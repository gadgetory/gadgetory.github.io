and welcome to the verge cast for the
week of July 8th yes 2013 2013 I'm Josh
Topolsky Pepitone I'm Ross Miller and
we're excuse me uh we're back on the
boom we're back we're back on the verge
cast where we discuss the week in
technology culture the culture culture
and the culture of feeling does that
happen every time you call if your voice
just completely I have a totally
different set of voices we're back we're
Ross and I are sandwiching Nilay in
colors in Platt I was gonna say
whiteness we're in different gangs he's
in the spearmint gang and I'm in the
Bloods experiment gang is just once
alright let's spread freshness create
within being this is the wrong Miller
yes sorry secondary Miller Paul Miller
is a busily off writing his book in
Colorado Paul Miller he's around Paul
Miller is around but in Colorado he is
he is on book writing stuff book he's on
book writing leave and he's actually
he's actually gone to Colorado to work
on his book so he will be on
sporadically yeah but not
he's been on sporadic so about the way
he's been on nothing new to get used to
whatsoever ah still Miller number two
though but you're still the second
Miller and you can still tweet at him
whenever you want yeah you still on the
internet yeah I mean as far as we know
we don't I just call right Oh get the
internet I sell an Xbox there if he's on
the Xbox he's on the Internet yeah
anyhow oh okay this little housekeeping
task and okay so yeah we have a big show
a lot of stuff to talk about today was a
very newsy day oh just a lot going on
actually the whole week has been nuts
what do we have what's on our what's our
with today let's do it let's start with
the things that happen today today today
this morning no t-mobile's like that was
yesterday oh yeah that's right the no
key event was today I finally watched
our super kind of John Legere is just
amazing and inside yes sorry yes yeah
end yeah and I keep asking t-mobile to
let me at him
yeah so I can talk you think you'd want
to talk right yeah just t-mobile get it
to get mobile let's be on let's be
sensible let's be let's get real with
each other okay
let us talk to your CEO I mean let me
have the wouldn't kill you look what's
he gonna do he's gonna swear a little
bit it's the worst that could happen
he's stripped nude and slaps knee lie in
the face of this penis quickly that does
seem like but also the best that could
happen metaphorically I try to do to 18
t this hold on so this morning was
enormous students he's amazing what's
imagine no no pants right there just
like are you I've been thinking about
switching the t-mobile well based on
their new plans
well my iPhone I've had my 18 t account
for years is still the iPhone you've got
a new t-mobile okay but there's a new
t-mobile SIM in my next interest you see
what's called it a nexus well it's
basically an access yeah anyway anyhow
go ahead but the big news this morning
is Microsoft without question the
biggest news in the industry this week
huge it is huge news so Microsoft has
completely reorganized itself which was
I think Kara Swisher reported it a few
weeks ago that this was like in the
works executives have been leaving
Microsoft likes like Don Mattrick just
left Xbox to go run Zynga before it
happened and now they're announced and
the changes are pretty major so Steve
Ballmer Center on a memo which is I'm
just gonna say it
yeah one of the worst examples of
corporate I've ever read in my
life
and Wow I mean it's really like he
should read it it's like several
thousand words
it's 2,600 words it was so long that we
wanted to put it all in the post enemy's
pose yeah and it was so long that we
couldn't figure out a way to do it so we
threw it in the forums you know I mean I
just I'll find some excerpts as we go
through the news here because it's so
long I have to like go find them but
that the top line is basically Julie
Larson green who just took over from
Steven Sinofsky as head of Windows is no
longer the head of Windows let me stop
you is there a reason we can't hear each
other in our ear pieces why am I wearing
the earpiece so they can talk to us
right but shouldn't we be able to hear
each other don't normally hear each
other they've replaced the headphones
they're looking into it can they can
they hear us the people can the folks
the folks out in the in America real
people and in the rest of the world yeah
greater Europe as I like to think of it
just kidding it's very insulting yeah
it's actually more like greater it's
like Europe is actually really okay if
just forget it yeah what's the worst you
can at the base of the penis go go on
Microsoft go for who knows org charts uh
so look she took over from Steven
Sinofsky yeah now she's no longer the
head of Windows
she's a head of devices in entertainment
yeah enemy and we talked about this oh I
heard a little moan of course we talked
about this earlier and and your take on
this is Eddie
well it's Terry Myerson it was at a
Windows Phone you know there's not the
head of all of Windows operating systems
yeah
across that's Windows Windows Phone Xbox
that's correct go ahead well we we
talked about this earlier and you
mentioned that you thought that the the
the move for for Julie is is Larson was
just two last names Larson green yeah I
don't wanna have to say Larson green I
don't know which personalize it anyhow
algae JLG that the move for her is
actually a kind of weird demotion and I
have to say you know there was an
article in Wired it's sort of like she's
the heir apparent but I'm not sure that
that's the case when she was a head of
Windows that was obvious yeah and and
and what's interesting is when you think
about in Microsoft are where division
uh really just Xboxes and the thing
that's making money I mean they're not
making money off of right yeah mice and
keyboards and but you know their big
halo product is the surface they're not
really I don't think they're making
money on that I don't think it's
considered a success by anybody's
measurement right and you've got Xbox
which is like for a long time was
actually kind of a loss leader and it's
now I guess turning some profit I would
have met at this point it has to be
because the hardware's making money
because they could be can sell things
right there yeah and that's Meyerson
again like he's running that right well
that's I mean it's like so surface is
great but surface has a leader Panos
Panay like he's in charge of the surface
Xbox has a leader right there somebody
in charge of the Xbox hardware and
ecosystem yeah like saying your that's
great maybe they'll expand in a more
device so the future of every company is
to make integrated devices right so
that's a great project for like it's not
she's not in charge well big successes
right the future of every company I mean
we I don't know because of Microsoft
struck a deal with every cable box maker
to what Microsoft software on there then
it would just be kind of a Microsoft
play for the living room or whatever
like the old Microsoft well but a new
Microsoft
yeah but we assume that you make up
runners so we assume that you make a box
and you put in the living room and then
like that's the thing or you make the
box and people use put in their pocket
software licensing microcell is the last
decade the last decade of showing that
but on the surface look what's what are
we expecting for Microsoft Thank You
months obviously they're gonna put out
the Xbox which is hardware they build in
design that's right they're gonna do a
new surface
yeah of it that's right a smaller
surface and there are lots there's lots
of discussion of the surface phone so
that's like she has a lot on plate to
manage there's our big projects right
but none of them are Windows Windows
Phone and Xbox software yeah and that's
like that's Microsoft that's whatever
like those devices are great and I think
the future of Microsoft I think when you
look at maybe it is with this new
streamlined hierarchy
you know her role becomes much more
important because it is there are really
fewer there are fewer spokes in the
wheel you know that there's only a few
main spokes she's got one of them
Meyerson has one of them and Balmer's
kind of sits at the top right like
they're basically on either side of the
equation of the of their
of their offerings into your appointment
like we are saying like Meijer has more
control it's like argue lien Iverson in
Microsoft's business do Larsen green for
the next six months has the harder job
because these are brand new products
that he has to sell right now Windows
isn't changing that much I think I
didn't say I don't think it's a demotion
I think it's a weird like she used to be
like Steven Sinofsky left it was a big
deal
the person who replaced him is now not
doing that job right and somebody else
it is that's the oddest part to me is
that the job she was just handed was now
taken away from her and maybe she didn't
want it maybe she was like I'd rather be
doing something else that the internal
politics of that I don't know right we
don't know the answer but but it anyhow
it is a big move for mice but it is also
and so the overarching goal is like what
you're saying like there's two sides of
Micra there's software and devices you
know they they're they're line in
bombers email is we're one Microsoft
which is like Sony's been running around
saying they're one Sony for two years as
how's that going she's not going so the
application of all comes yeah that's it
so they they're now organized along
functional groups which is the way
apples been organized forever and like
so Microsoft used to have like office
and Windows and like different and now
they're just one company with like my
apps cloud engineering wonder how much
this is really marketing very employee
level and how much is just I think this
is a big deal how much is just um an
organ rearrangement right well I mean I
think it's felt that the e like
executives are leaving Microsoft right
right I think engineers are just being
told I mean a lot of people have made a
rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic
analogy today I mean do you feel like
this is a does this feel like a for show
or futile or desperation or does this
feel necessary I think it's a little of
both I think it's a little bit for show
it's a little bit out of desperation to
get some further control over what's
going on in the company I mean I my
prayers my impression based on things
I've heard from people
familiar with the matter yeah and based
on my observation my gut feeling is
Windows in its current form was it's not
considered a success at the company and
that the discrepancy between this
confusion about RT and the x86 versions
of Windows and the way that it's been
marketed in the way they've been sold in
the way they've been discussed publicly
has been a has been not has not been
well-received in within Microsoft I
think Windows RT like at this moment is
an enormous failure
I mean Windows RT is from what I can
tell and correct me if I'm wrong but it
appears to be a completely failed
product yeah yes like I can't see I'm
not sure I mean I know they are C ran
today that we're cutting the price of
women and I know there are people who
have the surface and I think the surface
the RT version of the surface has a lot
of good qualities yeah but in the grand
scheme of what Windows is trying to look
you've got Windows Phone on one side
which seems to be getting a little bit
of a foothold we talked about this
earlier - it's getting market share just
you know it's number three
yeah gain market share because of course
because blackberry is lost market share
but also because they're they're getting
better at making stuff and people are
starting to go like hey this is a viable
alternative but so you've got Windows
and then you've got you've got Windows
Phone and Windows those are the real
products
yeah and Windows RT is like this sort of
you know it's just like a man without a
country yeah it's basically like who's
the user for that it's a really
specialized user
I don't think developers are flocking to
it I don't think anybody's making
hardware for it I think so if one piece
of hardware it was a big but that was
the big thrust of the the start of
Windows was the surface and Windows RT
you think about the way they rolled it
out it was first announced Windows on
arm at CES yeah it was literally just
Windows on a new processor and they're
like this is a big deal no they made a
big deal out they basically made it
sound like in not too long of a time
yeah we're gonna be all arm we're gonna
be Windows just gonna be an arm
operating system we ran a lot of stories
at the end of like window yeah and what
happened was the arm part was a total
fail
nobody's really adopted it nobody seems
to like it hardware makers don't want to
make stuff for it
Microsoft hardcore Microsoft users are
pissed about it yeah and every is going
to 80 X 80 the x86 version and they're
making the x86 version more like
traditional Windows yeah you know
they're I really I don't want to go back
down this rabbit hole de beber
spelunking down recently but I really
don't understand why the by that why
that surface RT wasn't just like the
Metro tablet Oh God
you know you know it's funny it's today
you know in sort of at the end event
like everybody kind of extends around
like chats for a minute before everybody
disperses and we like that conversation
came up like you've got Windows Phone no
he put out the 10:20 today which is like
a fairly interesting device because it's
insane camera and it's like they should
have just called all of this metro like
down the line right here's our mobile
operating system it's metro or whatever
the name would be MIT doesn't have you
Metro right could have been and they
just completely convinced it I mean they
just if they you know look Microsoft
seems to be really psyched on Apple
strategies given they're given a reorg
today if they really wanted to do what
Apple does they would have just said
this is gonna be our mobile platform
this is for tablets and phones and it is
gonna have like a bunch of compatibility
with our desktop but our desktop is
gonna be something totally different
which would have given them the
flexibility to focus on like an actual
like with Windows Phone you do get the
impression they've been able to focus on
making a better mobile platform they're
like hey there's stuff that was broken
in version 1 we're gonna fix it in the
next version and they did fix it and
it's like now you've got this weird
problem where you have to be fixing
something that's very similar at the
same time that isn't really getting any
attention like you've got to worry about
RT and x86 for the same platform that
isn't the same platform and you've got
to worry about Windows Phone it's like
why not just have that mobile platform
scale up yeah when your phone is done
right and it works great and that's what
Android is do yeah well but I'm saying
yeah but I'm saying that the basic idea
is that the underlying the core is and
the UI and everything else is all just
mobile only I think a lot in the last
selling point was always be like well
arm has been
processor but then with as well like
that's become like the last thing that
just doesn't matter anymore right with
the new chips I mean I mean it's my
MacBook Air has any indication though it
is a larger device I mean but still the
battery life is getting there it's not
the same as arm but it's getting there
right it's yet perplexing man I really
wish I really wish we could have seen
what it would be like had there been
this divide of the mobile of Microsoft
mobile if their line was always no
compromise the compromises they have no
they don't have success with that device
right why compromise success right they
thought they could differentiate by
Sigma compromise right here's a thing
that turns into another thing like that
did not it hasn't worked
let me just give you one Ballmer line
here please do we will plan across the
company comma so we can better deliver
compelling integrated devices and
services for the high-value experiences
and core technologies yes around which
we organize high-value experiences it's
just like you could have
I love high-value experience Annette
like this this is a really important
memo that he sent to a lot of people
that got out to the press the millions
of his customers are reading they
published and it reads like he published
it yeah but he sent bit like a great
right it's out in the world right and
it's like you should have made this half
as long
yeah but easily half maybe even a
quarters it's like one word for
everything do you think I like Ballmer
but do you think there's any chance you
know it's literally it's like I think
they have like 10,000 employees yeah
it's like it's more than that yeah
Microsoft has a lot more than 10,000
employees it's like 50 is it maybe 690
thousand plus over 30 that was who has
10 we have 10 I was just in my mind I
mean maybe in 1985 they were you
watching pyres of Silicon Valley by any
chance no idea where that I don't know
where it came out yeah yeah but they
only have about like 8 times more than
that yeah yeah right look okay so what
else what else today then the Nokia
everything else which was I think very
in Lumia 1020 when which is by the way
like 1020 it's like
it's like that's got a 720p display
right yeah yes so it's like it's weird
because all these phones don't have 1080
screens and now they have this they're
not they're naming convention is really
bad they need to have names for phones I
think numbers are not the way to go in
my opinion so it's like the 1022 Lumia
and okiya which by the way you Lumia
1020 I kind of stumbled over BIA Lumias
app or something
let me a click that's what I'd call I
will say Lumia click it's so Lumia
Photon yeah everyone kept saying Nokia
zoom which like not a bad name
the Nokia zoom the Lumia let me start
the beginning full credit to Nokia today
yeah
for putting on maybe the best press
event I've been to in the past like wow
or to really see was it was like a
shanty town disaster committee event
today no I mean not just because I oh
yeah a little bit better shorter shorter
was less insane and not just because
there was a power to ethernet like
that's like journalists stuff like I'm
talking like the staging and execution
of their event there are some like
awkward parts and like Ivonne who's kind
of a weird presenter sometime yeah but
they opened with like there was a
transparent screen that we thought was
the real screen and we thought like you
loft would be standing like a foot away
from us mhm but that was a projection
screen and then he was behind it oh and
there was another screen behind him so
there was like three layers or stuff
happening Wow and it was so cool-looking
that Dan initially thought that it
wasn't real but he was looking at a 3d
display to correct liveblog dan was like
they've turned on a 3d display in 3d
Elop is walking around actual like there
are some weird stuff when we can talk
about the poor Dan they're all wearing
fu
I try to catch things really raining on
the sparkles they look like sparkle no
no no that means that's from Taylor
Swift one two three I don't quote Taylor
Swift no it's when I went to the Sony
and so anything we see it sparkles on us
but they're shooting a 3d cameras we're
wearing 3d glass don't know I wasn't
yeah and now we're seeing the greatest
showmanship yeah that was great and then
at the very end of it
the second set of screens open yeah to
reveal the gigantic like hands on garden
very well they spent a lot of money
yes but the bag going from it one we
focus entirely on the camera it was
phone for 20 minutes yeah like they just
didn't say Windows Phone or app or
software
I think I saw Sascha Segan tweet like
does it connect to the which is amazing
like this is a hardware launch they were
they were down to talking about how when
you shake the phone you can hear the
ball bearings and the image stabiliser
move around is that good you know I want
to click what I do it's 300 yeah they
launched the phone Mona but like it was
no I saw this oh look they have a grip I
didn't have you compare it if you
compare to Samsung how samsung launched
it is this just a samsung phone camera
isn't it doesn't actually have that grip
that's just an add-on yeah so you put in
a thing it gives you 50% more battery
bay so if you look if you think about
how samsung wanna see s4 why would I
want a phone that's like the size of a
camera because it's like that's why
do I have a phone so I don't have to
have a camera right it's a 41 megapixel
camera anyway they can't like maybe
can't really do anything to Windows
Phone like Samsung can say like look we
put all those crops literally s4 is like
look we made this hardware don't think
we're right it's a gigantic screen
surrounded by plastic yeah you can yeah
but you can like look at all the dumb
 we did with the software right
Nokia's like we can't do anything the
software right we went all-in I got in
this crazy actually 41 megapixels it's
not it's a 41 megapixel my going to do
the 40 where the photos are 10 megabytes
a P 10 megabytes apiece Jesus but
they're locked into the pro camera app
so all the other apps on the phone the
camera roll gets access to five
megapixel right like I'll ensure
interpolated like I like shareable
images look I'm gonna say this is gonna
be my Instagram's look amazing so yeah
every time I Instagram have Instagram
every time no it has no internet but
every time I Instagram a picture there's
somebody without fails like what phone
is that yeah and it's like dude it's
it's something actually pointing this
out of my last one there like s41 iPhone
it doesn't matter it's an Instagram like
it is this big and it's got a fencer on
it and it doesn't matter how good the
camera is like yeah exactly
but like so it's 41 megapixels yeah yeah
they spent a lot of time talking about
zooming you know which is like a lie
because the camera doesn't actually
digital but it has 41 megapixels it's
even less horrible digital zoom yeah
right yeah but like everything still
looks like super fringy zoom zoom is not
I can't tell you the last time I used a
zoom phone actually I have used a zoom
function the digital zoom function well
you're desperate it's like here's what
they've done they've made the best
digital zoom ever yeah cool
yeah it's cool it's neat but like no I
don't know I don't want it I don't think
that I don't think that most people are
like man I really wish I could take a
picture of a factory and then zoom in to
see I was saying there's like fry Adam I
thought the other day I just told you
this in our front page call I thought
for a moment I was like what if I just
went all-in on Microsoft like just yeah
switch to a PC yeah you know got like a
surface or whatever and and or whatever
laptop I thought was good and
you know got a Windows Phone and just
moved over migrated all of my calendars
and all my con and everything out off of
Google and I was like you know maybe
that would be cool that could be cool
and then I remembered maps yep and then
I just completely remember the fact that
the Windows Phone mail client destroys
Gmail you maybe I just the whole thing I
just like I started then I started
realizing of all the route Prakash the
real world repercussions right and and I
decided that I couldn't do it but I have
to say it is it is weird to think that
like I'm now trapped essentially buddy
trapped trapped by Google yeah you know
that's why this is why it's so
frustrating we start about this but
they're making all these changes to
their apps and stuff I know I'm Segway
an out of Microsoft but but it is
annoying that that when you're a user of
I mean particularly with Google Apple
does the same thing I mean iOS 7 is
great example you're gonna get at the
iOS 7 update you're gonna be like what's
going on yeah like why is it like this
this is not what I bought rice is
something totally different like Gmail
is like they've changed Gmail on the on
the phone now and it's like not as good
as the last version and it's annoying to
use in some ways and there's nothing I
can do about it I find the GB can't do
anything about it better than the
Android version right now like it says
we're cut I'm sorry I mean we really I
guess you like waiting for things to
load yeah it's ah I mean the nicer user
interface it does but it still is it's
not but anyhow so let's finish it's not
nearly as thick as you might expect the
camera sticks out a little bit yeah the
photos that it takes are like they have
the new optical image stabilization that
they introduced me it looks ridiculously
huge it's not as big as that yeah that's
kinda nice looking I don't know it kind
of looks pretty good um you know if they
had this running Android that would be
there are two moments like like really
amazing nokia yeah won't you make an
Android phone
I mean is really something you this
blank piece they don't have an
exclusivity deal with with my question a
hundred times today and we were told
that like no she has its earnings coming
out next Thursday so they can't like
their base like our people can talk
about anything except yeah I would buy
an Okie Android phone you know so it was
on stage they're like why do you house
Microsoft and he was like well we knew
this would be a challenge and we think
the Android landscape is really harsh
and he said something really interesting
he said we used to think about Android
as a competitor but now we only think
about a certain hardware manufacturer as
a competitor mm-hmm obviously referring
to Samson well you can put it any way
you want I was like dude if you were
running their same platform like you
would really be competing with them no
that's the thing you're you're bound to
sell more Nokia phones running the
platform that people want than otherwise
right right you know it's like you get
both things working against you you're
fighting an uphill battle because you
have no brand presence and I am what
they're saying is they want it they want
Windows Phone to be a big success and
they want to be the Samsung of Windows
Phone that's actually Samsung will
probably sell Windows oh no Samsung
swear those phones I mean I mean they
are the Samsung of Windows Nokia's like
congratulations you're the Samsung
Windows the problem is your market share
is like single digits right they've got
it
they've got to overtake iOS somehow
right or the entire power overtake unit
if you want to elite who's ever taken
iOS like Windows Windows Phone like in
terms of how many handsets they said a
lot but I'm saying like setting a goal
that's less than we want to go from 3 to
2 but we want to go from really bad 3 to
media basically what they're doing right
I guess they went in four to three
next thing is high three went from there
were only at four because they literally
didn't exist before that right like they
did okay I understand are you arguing
for or against the Nokia Android device
I mean I would if they ran if they made
this camera with it with an Android like
on an Android phone
yeah be incredible what do you need for
Windows Phone to make this work or Nokia
augmenting Windows our dollars go back
at this this is it's like oh all the
ecosystem these are all the apps that
are they don't have need to be there all
the ecosystem needs to be working who
was that it's my way oh geez okay
she's cool with you all me to anyone
wasn't on mute brand-new I just got it
yeah yeah oh sheesh we talked about this
well let's finish the 10:20 that's it
are there anything else $383 by the way
my hands they're really pushing their
luck with that right and it's only an
ATT will forget about freedom and they
don't have enough costumers there's this
moment where I actually kind of like
wanted to hiss during the press
conference yeah but I was sitting too
close to like loudly hey Olivia come out
he's like we loved working with Nokia on
this project I want to be like what did
you do did you go there did your camera
engineers show up yeah yeah it's looking
good but we just want to check out this
camera do you have you seen our pan text
we want to make sure this is up to 18 t
camera standard the Q&amp;amp;A there was a was
I think the forest woman had asked about
80 cuz they she talked so that was the
best question like again best press
event ever like swell stage well-managed
and then the QA forced a research right
she was like horse sir yes was that what
it was
as for sir like for someone anyway yeah
yeah she goes someone why the hell are
you working with a TMT they've been a
terrible partner for you I tried to buy
an Illumina phone they didn't know
anything about it and their service
sucks
yeah and elop who is one of the best
media executive media trainings very
very wise for a second and said the
answer are there is an answer that's
more about Nokia than 18 t and he went
on to talk about how like there was a
big opportunity for Windows Phone they
had educated consumer right I was like
no dude the calls drop no but I will say
I will say in eel ops defense I've been
to a lot of these press events or trade
shows or whatever where or conferences
where somebody gets up and they've got
you've got like to book yeah you know
it's like your question to Tim Cook you
can ask him anything you want you're
like how come my AT&amp;amp;T services so I've
actually heard people do this at
conferences how come my AT&amp;amp;T service is
so bad it's like you blew it dude I
don't care I don't care how bad your I I
don't care if you're a teen he service
like sexually assault you in the night
okay there's your nor easy to ask that
question
at that time by the way a tea service
can do that I'm ashamed to say you the
face with videos yeah it does all the
crazy camera stuff for the video too you
can zoom on the video yeah look it's a
really nice camera right it happens to
run Windows Phone hmm it has the the
weird grip thing that you can put onto
it it turns it into basically Micro Four
Thirds camera how much does that cost
it's like $79 terrible I mean look it's
fine yeah you've already spent 300 off
that phone like you're it's more than a
Power Shot get a point shoot for cheaper
so that's the thing I mention this in
the live vlog it's like all of the apart
from the insane size of the sensor like
not the physical size for the 4000
megapixel almost all of this technology
is like point-and-shoot level right
technology right it's like they have
optical image stabilization which a $79
point-and-shoot as they have manual
controls which is said they built a
really nice point shoot camera and they
put Windows Phone on it right and
because they can't put a real lens
assembly in it they like they did this
thing where they built a crazy 41
megapixel sensor which is cool there's a
new there's something I have to say I
there's something unappealing to me
about this combination and I'm not sure
why but I think what's really striking
is what Apple was able to do with the
iPhone 5 with its camera which to me is
just far and away with it just the best
phone camera I don't know why it just is
really really good legitimately this
cameras better no no I'm sure it is just
I'm sure it is I know this is what I was
getting at I'm sure it is but in order
to do that they had to graft another
device onto the back of a phone and I
feel like the phone should be a thing
unto itself
in the sense that if you can't like I
don't want to phone this half camera
because you don't couldn't figure out
how to make a better small sensor that
could do something they could make him
cry could create incredible photos and I
think they did do something new right I
mean like what Samsung did they did a
second generation of this technology
which it's also Samsung just did this
they made a camera but they so look if
you look at the Galaxy camera which when
you put this thing into its battery grip
you should you can compare them one for
one right like they look the same this
is obviously better but if you might
kind of for as a camera is wildly
different right the Galaxy camera is
like a regular camera it has like
moveable lens you can it has optical
zoom right it's a point-and-shoot camera
that runs Android right this is like
Android cell phone or so Windows Phone
like a cell phone but it has this insane
camera that can approximate what a point
shoot can do and like because it doesn't
have a lens assembly like that it has a
it is not just like a cell phone camera
is that protrusion but no II know it's a
little it's a disc sitting on its on
bring one back for us no I tried the all
ones really beautiful yeah I'm pretty
into the yellow one of the yellow
graphite and just white Park and yellow
yellow black white I thought that the
black looked kind of things your graph
ID color it's like a you know it has are
gonna get grey it's like a dark grey oh
yeah it's cool I mean look it's real
cool the ant if you love Windows Phone
you try but that's the problem like
that's the answer if you love Windows
Phone you should buy this phone yeah
right God if you don't and if you're
committed to any other operating system
like it's still not but not there still
is on a compelling you don't think it's
compelling enough like that versus the
iPhone 5 you're not gonna go like if you
have an iPhone 5 and you love it you're
not gonna be like Windows Phone is so is
so on harbor iPhone 5 experience right
that this additional hardware is worth
the the switching cost right and that's
look I basically asked even aloft that
question like 10 times in a row for 10
minutes and he had a variety of
different stock answers but that is his
company's biggest channel oh yeah yeah
if there was an ipod touch of rain of
this like it's not cellular
I would pay couple hunter like it's a
nicer point shoe it's slim like I can
tether and get the stuff up there so you
want like I actually think a smart
camera is nice I would defend that but I
don't wanna put on the contract and like
have to pay that monthly $300 they MT
service what is it off contract 700 yeah
do it yes I mean I mean that's the price
of the galaxy s4 on there's no Instagram
so like right which we ran and I've know
vine is ironic there will be like yes
soon no no something else that's missing
so we just ran this like wildly reviled
piece about Instagram and like the
future of like photo yeah in like I'm
watching how I see the people in my life
use photos now yeah and we ran a piece
from James bærum about it which is the
reason it's so Graham is powerful is
because let's you take the photo share
it and look at other people's photos
like all in one interface hmm and that's
like that's what the people yeah I just
don't get the impression that people are
editing iMovies anymore like I feel like
it's like if you have kids and you are
taking videos of them or whatever you're
not putting together elaborate edited
things you're doing like just quick hits
of what's going on in real in real time
you know that you're doing or you're
doing like I shot two minutes of my kid
doing something and then I uploaded it
to YouTube and I put it on Facebook or I
uploaded it straight to Facebook right
you know and and I just don't even know
how out the other thing makes sense like
you're gonna sit people down to watch
the movie like the grandparent the
grandparents those tools have a place
right yeah what I'm saying is they built
a really awesome camera yeah without the
key tool right they're still lacking the
key to it that is making smartphone a
grand will happen eventually within I'm
sure within six months what's their ego
they're like we don't we really don't
know when it's coming up well there are
other ways to share photos I mean that's
it's not the only way to share so we're
in Twitter you can share just on Twitter
you can share on Facebook you can share
on you could do you know on YouTube
right yeah at one point you know they're
like and we have a great new app called
agua and you can share directly to ogle
yes
dude what like what these occupy there
like you can divide clone integration is
built-in can ever just like I'll go the
new hipster gram Hipstamatic hips the
Mathematica now shared of both ogle and
Instagram that was a big announce you
can use Hipstamatic to share that and
Instagram on Windows Phone yes so so
here time attic shares the Instagram
yeah oh well there you go but I don't
think you can do that I don't even see
instagrams interface janky but I guess
there's something you can do yeah
whatever maybe you can share all right
moving on yeah so so speaking of crimes
and speaking of colors so I've been
going back and forth I have the review
units of the and I this is my galaxy s4
yeah I put a torrent I've been using a
one and then and then the stock versions
came out and I've been for the past two
weeks have been torn going literally
going back and forth right everyday like
swapping my sim and trying to decide so
I now I think I've reached a point where
I'm saying I think I think what is my
clone I think that I think that I'm
going to get the s4 for like real your
iPhone I hear the things that happened I
was like okay a few days ago a few days
ago I had I was using this for and I was
like screw this I'm getting the one and
I went I went back to the one I was like
I just want to check it out before I
place my order and I was using it and
and and it really started to bother me
like that the screen seems smaller and
that it didn't have a home button and
that had that menu bar yeah and there
were just things that started bugging me
about it that I had not noticed before
using the s4 the only at this point I
think the screens are sort of negligible
wrong absolutely wrong the screen on you
know there's a piece of drugs the more I
think it's a piece it I think the one
has
a little edge the one does have a little
edge that screen is bad every time you
scroll text on that screen like it's
like I have a nose I think that the one
has an edge it is it does have it is
less saturated and and we're Samsung we
make the displays and we picked the
shittiest ones that we make anyhow to
put in our biggest margin so so they're
always little but I think that here's
what it comes down to this is what's
what's troubling me this moment is I
think that the one has better low-light
photography capabilities but I think
that it's general photography when put
side by side with this lineup on a
bright day or in well-lit scenes I
actually think this is a superior camera
so I'm torn this has a night mode but
the night mode is like kind of not that
good but it is passable two questions so
far so I take a lot of night photos the
other day I mean I'm just saying I don't
I take pictures for myself not as a
social video platform that lets you
co-create sync and edit multiple views
of a shared moment finally Louis I take
most people's I take I don't share an
Instagram or anywhere else you
understand what I'm saying like they're
they're just photos of things that I'm
taking right so I just want them to look
okay so so anyhow but I think I've
decided to buy the s4 and and the main I
think the main motivator is is this
that's that's it no because the phones
are basically both really good the
screens bad the phones are basically
both excellent phones in my opinion
right okay honestly like it side-by-side
they're both really good phones but I at
first if I really like this little like
fold 'back thing that they make for it
you can replace the backs on it and I
have found several insane like
chinese-made backs for the s4 here's one
of them I told you not to show the
listing because I don't want anybody
else to find I don't see heard you at
that point Evan don't show the listing
this is one back that I George just
Jordan don't show the listing it's too
late yeah you've exposed me
show the other one which i think is
really dope do we have it
we don't have it no I don't have it okay
fine well I sent another one anyhow so I
please sign it but I've been looking for
all these insane backs I ordered a green
one which I cracked yeah flexing it
which isn't hey I posted a picture of it
on Instagram yeah I did post that
audience yeah and then the I ordered
these and a fake leatherback one it's a
new one so here's the thing I think the
view one this is one of the most
annoying things about this case is that
cover the cover covers the camera I know
that Samsung makes one with up with a
they may have one that has like a little
window no I think it comes to colors
know that I had an orange one an intern
went and got me an orange one and then I
was like that's the wrong one and he
returned it yeah they make oh there it
is that's the other case that I got
which I think it looks amazing it's not
a case I'm sorry these are the backs so
it's like a 100% part of the phone when
you put it on widget because I hate
cases right so but isn't is a texture
it's not it's not a slimy then like it's
slimy that this one is less limey it's
let's no no this one's way less slimy
also color where does s4 is now yeah
which is like it's so anyhow the long
and short of it is the cameras have
there's pros and cons hold on let me
finish there's pros and cons on bogeys
there's pros and cons on both cameras
okay what does actually know about
instance I know what the third-party
Instagram app it's still not the
Instagram app like oh my god this
Windows Phone version of every app that
you could possibly want yeah yeah it's
like it's like instant chat like it's
like no I know I know it is called what
is it called instance it's not what
people yeah it's alright it's what
people want Instagram anyhow but getting
back to my phone play the booty boils
down to is this both of these phones are
great phones in my opinion but they both
run this exact same version of stock
Android which is great they have there
are pros and cons right like the pros on
that is like the hardware is way nicer
than the s4 last by leaps I actually
made a list of pros and cons I know the
hardware is way nicer the sound is
better the screen has
the screen is so much fine the screen is
so much better yeah the camera does are
stupid the camera does great low light
the kind of I know grain buttons are
stick and then you've got the cons which
is like the buttons are poorly placed
the not having a home button is I mean
not having a third button is really
stupid what's the the actual power
button location like the mall right so
that's the more I had that what's
happened I think that's I thought yeah
no I know but I'm saying the more is so
the other things are like like you can't
replace the battery and these phones are
they're not like you know the greatest
with battery life it's kind of cool to
be able to swap at the battery and I
like the fact you can change the backs
the cons on this one are really that the
low life photography isn't that good and
the screen is nothing it's okay I think
it's actually a pretty good screen when
you compare to old compared to old but
just it's very simple when you have a
flagship smartphone in your hand the
lead product front company and you
scroll the text and it's blurry I don't
that's bad I honestly don't I'm gonna
challenge you a little bit on that and
just say I have never noticed text being
blurry when scrolling it also when it's
scrolling what does it matter what it
look like it's it's bad it just looks
bad I've not had that experience
I will say this both these phones both
stock versions of these phones are very
bad at regulating their brightness very
bad yes both require a third-party app
this app lux which I talked about in the
last verge cast to properly regulate the
brightness of these screens I will say
this screen is really annoying when you
don't have the brightness tweaked
because it's way down right and it's
like it looks even worse that one is too
bright yeah my twins yeah you need to
get lives but the fact is so anyhow I
think I've made my decision and and I'm
a little bit I'm a little bit scared
that I'm gonna regret as soon as I place
the order and again you like comes back
through and one app extreme
yeah no I know wait am i showed you when
I showed him the orange case he was like
oh god if I made the wrong decision no
and literally like now you feel like
you've made the right like I got this
and I opened a box yesterday and I was
like ah about this one yeah and
then what do you think like here's what
I think you like device is these two
devices aside yeah my experience with
Android going from a nexus 4 to this
device and just one day it's been like
they run the same
we're yeah right but on the the Nexus
for feels really heavy to me in like
dark wide it's why no but like just
running Android on it this our Lee feels
like super techie for some reason okay
like it's like it's like a very like it
just feels heavy and on this phone it's
like it's with the phones faster yeah
and everything feels like a lighter and
more area it's like a really weird visit
I think it's it's all the hardware at
this offer is exactly the same yeah and
that's like that's been a revelation
here's my you just one question though
he's my dad to you why not wait for the
Moto X just to see what it is everything
I've heard about the Moto X leads me to
believe that it is not going to be it's
going to be kind of a mid-range device
mm-hmm well that means it's gonna have a
720p display
yeah and I'm certainly not going down to
720p and it has if it has a bad camera
than like at any point butter to your
eyes no it matters this is not I really
think you're really think you're you're
I think parking on a pixel layout that
I've been harshing on for like three
years I do not think this green I really
do not think this green is that bad give
me give me your phone let me open I want
to see map side by side well am I the
only one who actually has some hope for
the Moto X here
it sounds like it um oh wait whatever no
you have yo you have the new maps Oh
perhaps new maps no I have the old maps
yeah all maps I really want the new maps
I don't think that'd be a good idea hold
on so let's just see here zooming in
your screens brighter of course it looks
better white green wide your screen so
doctor looked at notifications it's on
auto price sending it no he's not
sending a tweet here well what will make
your hair will go to riveting television
on the audience still bright I love the
narration scroll just scroll the top
wait let me get your screen to an
equivalent brightness he is looking at
porn on Eli's phone your screens bluer I
can see that our it's greener
that's the porn yeah I'm just trying to
get this is I I don't have locks in a
headlock somebody I know I know okay
hard I'm just gonna scroll scrolling it
just watch look at the text just like
shatter and
it's weird just trust me this is
thrilling in person I'm telling it's not
yeah I mean I can't unsee it I'm telling
ya I don't know it just doesn't that
just doesn't bother me at all it's fine
look we all have that it's that it's
just not ready fans yeah I mean I can't
I can't do it my eyes like ah gross stop
it
but it's the motion on screen is bad and
these enemies know about running through
the panel's for years it's been like re
this is a good processor let me just
scroll through the absol past the other
the other the other things and I
remembered that I now I you know and I
said I complained about this I've
complained about it for a while I wanted
a phone with it I didn't like it on the
one and now I'm so reminded of how
incredible it is I'm how incredible it
is okay the the colored the RGB LED on
this when you use it with light flow no
it is incredible - I can glance at my
phone and I know like I've got some
tweets I've got an email from this
account from that account I've got a
text message and not have to know all of
that just by glancing at a little light
on the phone it's kind of incredible
okay anyhow so so I think at the end of
the day see the peers the third week in
a row where we've talked about these -
yeah that's depressing and yeah so I'm
buying the s4 and I'll have to suffer
the consequences what's most annoying is
I have to set up another phone I've set
up these - yeah now I have to wipe them
and go set up another moment I guess
that's it there are you happy everyone
and of course now Jim Dalrymple will
write a scathing a scathing post on his
on his Apple fanboy site about how I'm
on the take from Samsung as I said I'm
going to buy one of their phones so get
ready everybody get ready trolls yeah -
unleash your fury god I hope that sense
of money tastes good I I'm gonna spend
Samsung money to buy the Sam Sam sweater
it tastes like Magna Carta hold it
tastes like that's where I'm going
because you know that's Samsung money
right there yeah
you know just like you had the best
transition I did I'm trying to figure
out what part of this disaster to go
into let's start from the beginning just
start so Samsung I'm just checking my
releases new record mhm right they're
gonna give it away with an app to all
these Samsung phones one of them yes a
million of them guaranteed to go
platinum right away for billboard or no
for R is a really good Lumia name to me
Lumia focus oh good yeah
EAL up thank you laughing that's uh
Marciano yeah alright at Marcy plan
that's where the royalties go yeah right
so that guy go on Jay Z app the thing
leaks anyway mm-hmm the record leaks
anyway the app is kind of a weird
disaster it doesn't work on the Rubin
crashes a lot it asks for all kinds of
insane permissions from you right
apparently are apparently our chap does
as well which is I don't know if that's
I don't know why that is I think that's
probably some sort of weird it might be
laziness we're not collecting we're
certainly not collecting informations
and then the worst part is to unlock the
lyrics you have to tweet like I just
look read these lyrics from this app
right and so people like there's like
lots of you know once one person jazzy
like said he literally said this is not
cool like yeah this is a lot of things
he said it wasn't cool and that but he
actually was kind of it's interesting
what he said which was I've got a like
you know I we tried something it didn't
work perfectly and the next guy will get
it but even this line from Jay Z utterly
insane it was twenty million hits for
the app and it broke no one is expecting
it there's no way in the world for you
to calculate twenty million in yeah it's
not even a number you can fathom you
cannot prepare for a service million 20
million of anything are you rep oh
because he's going to rap genius.com
his lyric just to yeah I guess it's not
right Pina song meetings work to it but
this is what it is there's a specific
lyric why rap genius you're failing me
rap genius
what song what song whose a rap genius
in the hot start up man
thought it was one of his lyrics and I
will say this this record is like it's
not it's okay because lyrics is like 1
million 2 million 3 million 20 million
I'm so good at math fathom that I don't
know how ok anyhow like this is much
better - yeah and the thing I was doing
right 1 million 2 million 3 million 20
line oh I'm so good at math my crash the
internet and I even interested wait no
spaces ends with him saying twerk Miley
Miley twerk which is an amazing way to
end so he he says 1 million 2 million 3
million 20 million oh I'm so good at
math might crash the internet and I
ain't even into that might crash the
internet cannot prepare for a service
the Internet so make sure that doesn't
happen because he's not I repeat not
into this did you listen the record yeah
listen to yet it's ok I actually really
don't like jay-z at all so I never care
I think it's safe to say that jay-z and
Kanye West should always work together
yeah I will say that like Jesus has
become now that I've learned more of the
lyrics of he's like the first time the
first few listens I wasn't really
listening I said this on one of the on
the versions I said it's it's musically
and lyrically bankrupt and and the more
you listen to it the less inventive the
music sounds because once you hear the
music you like oh I've heard it now and
then you know it's like it's not
surprising then you start to really
focus on the lyric yeah and it is like
punishingly stupid yes like a like like
I'm I don't know if he's trolling
everybody really I have magical thing
where he was like the whole point of
this record is that kanye doesn't care
what his lyrics mean
I read that but I read some other stuff
that was really great about about just
like critiques of the lyrical content
yeah no it is like it is like it is just
so weird to me how stupid it sounds just
dumb so I was like a dumb guy I don't
think he's a dumb guy no no he's not so
that's why I'm trying to figure out if
it's some sort of elaborate role so kind
of a tangent I just saw I think yes I
just let's read it's called Jesus I
think so no I just I just read twice
loves me more mo meta Blues oh yeah
really good hi Loretta Questlove oh yeah
he has an extended passage on Kanye West
this isn't like nucleus time like um
when he came out on the scene it kind of
left and center and thing like that on
me request was talking about he loves so
much was like unlike other rappers Kanye
knows he's materialistic and he just
wants to flaunt and he look at that like
will you listen the earlier lyrics which
were clever like it was embracing it now
he's like the keys record is literally
about him buying the fine art oh it's
literally him being like he did as
profound an abaya Rothko yeah there's
like a a Basquiat in my in my kitchen my
child leaned on it rhymes he runs like
it's like ridiculous but maybe I subset
it that is really obsession rhymes it
thinking he's still street Kanye is like
I'm just buying no jay-z's like bored
like he's like I'm gonna rap about how
incredibly rich I am yeah what else is
going on for him just being rich honey
being like you trying to be like
shocking about race relations like no
that's good I'm glad the shocking is
about race stuff is amazing it's the
stuff that's around it it's like one
line really great point about race
relations in America when it's Donette
for the next line everyone about people
dying about 19 rich women in the
Hamptons and it's like we all both of
those people know are we all both both
I'm 100 I'm 100 percent Hamptons honey
it's so close every time the one that
killed me the most why are we talking
about Jesus Jesus look no one could have
predicted we always in ten years of the
verge cast you can't prepare
five and what else we out our laughs oh
my god okay Apple eBook yes yes I
believe book prefix 484 so poor poor
Apple the day the App Store turned five
oh right which is a big deal right yeah
distri change Casey wrote it was Casey
right yeah a great piece about the Apple
the App Store turning five and Apple
basically changing the world again I
will say this like the iPhone changed
the world I don't care who you are I
don't care where you're from it changed
the world in a lot of ways and and and I
think that it's almost like you forget
that but most people don't even know it
doesn't want most people who have an
iPhone but you forget that this apps
were a thing that had to happen yeah and
and also we almost didn't write Steve
Jobs yeah like really resistant he
didn't want to do it and and and you
have to say like you got to say that the
homebrew community really drove this
yeah I mean the jailbreakers you know
and they don't get the credit and I feel
like they really deserve it I think that
the jailbreaking community drove Apple
to do this in a lot of ways I think they
saw it was possible but I mean I think
they also realized that if they didn't
do it somebody else was going to write
you know and that it would become
increasingly easy which it had it had
become increasingly easy to just
jailbreak I mean I remember there was
like Ashton Kutcher was yeah he was like
tweeting about jailbreaking his eye
allenge yeah oh that was that was what I
was like a challenge in his nerd his
nerd cred has it having become an
advisor to Vox media I believe he hasn't
heard correct but uh no I don't he still
hasn't built a PC which I'm waiting for
all I'm gonna I'm gonna maybe it's just
some point the future of it opportunity
to talk to him about that developing his
own PC that's the challenge ask him Eric
Cooper no was it he was gonna build a
time machine
yeah that's not to go back in time and
kill earlier build a time machine and
then go back in time to kill Hitler yeah
to prove that he's got nerd cred well he
did now he has started as Steve Jobs in
a movie
yes Oh which comes out next month yeah I
know he has a computer in Two and a Half
Men
he definitely has what I've seen images
of him carry carrying around here anyhow
the point is what are we talking about -
enough men no before that
oh the AppStore Jesus does he listen the
user son - it happened the bombs
what does he think of blood on the
leaves the point and justice among that
by the way another another killer jay-z
lyric I don't pop Molly I rock Tom Ford
Tom Ford like that lyric doesn't get
high an ecstasy gets high on fashion oh
that's for his money because he can
spend he can for taxi Dez but well oh
it's just collapsed I mean if I yeah the
point was that Ashton Kutcher was
tweeting that he's jailbreaking his
iPhone because this is pre app story you
know yeah and I think it was pre app
store and anyhow the point is that I
think that those guys really drove a lot
of this well it was it was a revolution
revolution because the idea was there
right you can do apps on the palm you do
have some Windows Mobile you can in you
can they crack the crack super apps and
the BlackBerry just like eff let me it's
great frameworks like look you're not
gonna do everything in system but you
have this app do whatever you want
self-contained like yeah and they made
the store
Mikey was the store right the
distribution and the payment the the you
know the the centralized like experience
of the store how you doing over there
I'm just reading some tweets yeah
I don't know so anyway somebody said
that somebody's Apple have more than
30,000 employees so me just that they
have 80,000 that does sound right it
sounds insane
let's see Google away Ross it could be
right there that's fine Ross the very
usefulness was 30 I want to come correct
I just don't want to be wrong on that
yeah I guess and 30,000 at one point the
same day they saw bright of the App
Store got handed a brutal verdict in our
ebook price-fixing case yeah
which to be honest I have no idea what a
again you know Apple likes to fight out
its lawsuits which right they obviously
won the lawsuit against Samsung in a
major way
yeah well not really the price-fixing I
actually feel that in some ways one
malossi they won the lawsuit whatever
they lost a very some weird
part of the mind share that I think has
led to Samsung's like right dominance
current dominance whatever they wanted a
lawsuit I'm not there of course not
their revenue dominance but anyhow they
all the publishers have settled this
lawsuit so United States Department of
Justice says this is antitrust you all
colluded to to bring down Amazon and to
raise the overall prices and there is
their settlement is that like used in
the in the case I mean I you can't you
can't allow that right yeah did the
admit guilt when they did settle or no I
think part of the settlement was that
they're like we're not guilty right
like seems it and what so apple doesn't
settle they fight it out they put their
executives on the stand their executives
get beaten up by the Department of
Justice to turn on literally yeah
intellectually the judge in her opinion
says you know itq is on the stand he was
saying these things I did not find him
credible like wow it's at that level of
like they didn't they didn't do so well
trial right and the the enormous body of
evidence is that the publishers were so
scared of Amazon and Amazon some power
over the market that when Apple showed
up they saw the opportunity to make them
all collude to enter the market with
iBooks but the correct
so apples gold they explicitly said we
don't want the iBook store to compete
with Amazon on price we don't want to be
in that game we want to compete with
Amazon iPad to Kindle so the books are
the same and the price of the same and
then we think people will pick the iPad
they don't want to get in that price
right what's that the collusion was just
changing a model it wasn't saying really
it was it wasn't the most like things
that people focused on in this case or
like kind of like the red herrings like
it's not the agency model right it's not
the final prices it's literally that
Apple saw the opportunity to not compete
on price they saw the publishers wanted
higher prices and they organized a
conspiracy to block Amazon from
competing against them on price and to
raise the overall price of e-books from
$9.99 to 12 and forts the business to be
honest a like we're all gonna do this
together
don't worry yes and they were
instrumental and they kept on sending
emails to publishers saying things like
this is your only shot to do this we're
the only people with the power to do
this against great
and the judge is like this is
overwhelming that they had they had the
knowledge they were gonna do something
illegal and they did it and she that she
there's a big section in painting about
Steve Jobs where she's like here are
some emails from Steve Jobs like other
executives or he lays it out and he's
like we're gonna push the prices higher
or you can go in with Amazon and see how
that goes and then there's a video of
Steve Jobs talking to Walt Mossberg at
the iPad launch where he's like the
prices are gonna go up trust me right
and like she thought she's like pointing
this videos on yeah which is like I
don't know like people have been asking
John Gruber at WWE has me like straight
up he's like what's going on at the
ebooks case it seems like you know
Amazon was the the big power and Apple
just enter the market and it's like yeah
but they did it
it's literally they were so scared the
publishers are so scared they were
convinced to do illegal things to
compete with Amazon right there was but
that doesn't that doesn't change it
doesn't excuse you I mean but but at the
end of the day somebody tweeted
something where it was I saw somebody
retweet something where it was like it
was like the worst conspiracy ever
because they didn't they they about it
yeah but they didn't but there's their
success has been extremely limited yes
Apple success has been limited but the
table sure has got exactly what they
wanted right they got the agency model
in price of books well that is that all
blown apart now or what we'll see yeah I
I got a lot of appealing left to do now
I actually on interesting sidenote not
sort of related not not totally related
but I was surprised to learn that my
cousin has two sons and one of them had
a birthday I'm telling you starting his
story one of them I think just turned
seven it's two boys like it's like
eleven and seven or something I found
another ages exactly okay anyhow he
bought them both whose one's birthday
and he bought them both Kindle Fires
and I was actually really surprised that
I mean I guess it's just weird to think
about he's just like you know he's a
lawyer he lives in Pittsburgh I'm using
it later like a very you know normal fan
lovely family but uh I guess it's just
weird to think about like what a kid
would do with the Kindle Fire I mean I
just I don't know it just seems strange
to me meet books
watch TV yeah use apps I suppose horn I
just think it's interesting little kids
like I said this is 7 and 11 maybe or 8
and 11 or something Paul they're just
little compute they bought their kids a
computer yeah just interesting to me I
guess that's what people are doing and a
really cheap computer yeah I know I get
that it just struck me as very
interesting what should they both ruin
said I don't know I just I guess they
expect if you're gonna buy somebody a
tablet you get it you get an iPad yeah
but they're very expensive if I was
thinking like yeah they're really the
minions of AI presuming to buy for two
kids yeah
350 eighty thousand for Apple eighty
thousand fifty thousand two hundred
fifty thousand yeah okay he doesn't
worldwide wait thousand in the US okay
so that's like actually grown a lot last
and that's grown a lot since the last
time I looked at their Wikipedia entry
which was not that long ago five
thousand created since 2012 twenty-one
thousand US jobs added since 2008 okay
so they're they've been growing that's
pretty crazy like a really rapid yeah
yeah Wow
okay that's I'd stand totally corrected
i hi for some reason i thought the
number was 30 I don't know where that
number came from just like you don't
know where your Apple the deal was about
2002 but 11 years ago
that's by Microsoft or Apple Apple
alright anything else we have on the on
the list else it's bad for the big story
here are questions any questions from
the room at long time any questions from
doing that again well let's take some
phone calls remember we used to take
