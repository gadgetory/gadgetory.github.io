inaugural panorama music festival in new
york city and we're going to be hosting
the lab an incredible interactive art
space running all weekend long we spoke
to read paper heart a design collective
that has work in this year's space their
piece is called pinball performance I am
Sandra Brenda join and I'm the creative
director my name is Daniel tribal and
I'm the technical director my name is
Lisa Walters and i'm the senior producer
at red paper heart we're bringing a
project called pinball performance it's
taking a 1970s era pinball machine and
connecting that to a digital art this
will allow people playing the pinball
machine to become performers so as they
play they're going to be creating these
kind of like larger-than-life animations
and by doing so they're going to be sort
of like a concert pianist or something
it'll start with people putting a
quarter into the Machine and that will
light up an array of screen so we have
eight monitors they're all hung around
the n-bomb machine as you play the
various things that you hit will trigger
these satisfying little animations that
they kind of play off how the tactile
and just satisfying pings and rotating
bits in a pinball machine there's just
something really gratifying about those
reactions Cesar started talking about
pinball about how he was looking to do
something with our kids and where did
they all go and then one ball came
around as to how can we reinvent this
how can we make it magic again and so
that kind of started the journey of
finding the perfect Ramona sheen so to
find an original one where everything is
electrical all the connections the
scoring is even just rotating disks it's
really nice to have this really old
machine but then connected to kind of
like the newest technology with a really
creative code I think that things like
pinball get people over the seriousness
of artwork and people have like this
connection with things like pinball
people love involved so they instantly
have an emotional attachment to it
don't have to explain anyone how to use
a pinball machine but yet they have a
completely new experience with that old
game</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
