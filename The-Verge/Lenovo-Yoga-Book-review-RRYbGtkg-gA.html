tablet but it's not just a tablet it's
really more of a laptop but it doesn't
have a traditional laptop keyboard
instead it has this touch sensitive
surface that lights up like a keyboard
but also doubles as a writing pad this
thing is a Lenovo yoga book and it's
what Lenovo thinks is the future of
computing
yes the same lenovo that makes big heavy
sync pads and has made 13-inch
convertible laptops has made this thing
this thin and ridiculously light
computer that feels more like a paper
notebook than anything else so does it
hold up looks wise and design wise yes
this thing is a stunner actually typing
on it is a different story
still lenovo has managed to make
something that feels totally futuristic
and still familiar there are two
versions of the yoga book an Android one
and a Windows one the Android one is a
little bit less expensive at $500 and
the Windows one jumps up to five hundred
and fifty dollars but to me the Android
one is probably the one you're going to
want to get because it feels more like a
mobile computing device than a super
heavy-duty productivity machine it's
made of magnesium aluminum alloy and it
has a full HD 10.1 inch multi-touch
display it has the same watch band style
hinge that Lenovo's bigger yoga laptops
have which is what allows it to fold in
two different modes the yoga book weighs
just one and a half pounds which puts it
close to the same territory as an iPad
pro plus smart keyboard but oddly enough
it feels much lighter than that and it's
definitely lighter than a Microsoft
Surface and the Microsoft Surface
keyboard you put it this way when you're
carrying those around there's no doubt
that you're carrying a tablet but with
this you really can mist
if we're notebook so not surprisingly
there are some sacrifices when you're
working with such a tiny computer the
first is that it's so light that it
sometimes doesn't balance very well on
your lap and then just like Apple's
MacBook there's a shortage of ports it
has a micro USB charging port an HDMI
port a micro SD port and a headphone
jack and that's pretty much it no USB
and it's Intel Atom processor which is
in both the Android and Windows models
isn't the most powerful one out there
it's battery life isn't great either at
least by tablet standards lenovo says
that you should get about 15 hours with
general usage of this but i didn't get
anywhere near that so let's get to what
makes this different the halo keyboard
once you put this into laptop mode this
matte black lower panel turns into a
glowing digital keyboard it also
vibrates a little bit when you tap at it
you do get this sense that the whole
panel is moving and not the isolated
Keys you're typing on you can also use
lenovo's real pen as a stylus or you can
put a pen tip in a stylus slap a piece
of paper over the touchpad panel and
then write on the piece of paper as a
journalist I like the idea but in
reality this surface is probably more
appealing to designers or people who use
styluses and digitizer pads to control
multimedia software after a few days of
using the yoga books keyboard I still
don't feel totally used to it but just
like typing on a touchscreen it's
something I probably would get used to
it's also more comfortable than typing
on a touchscreen that forces you to prop
your hands up and blocks half of your
display the question isn't whether this
is better than a tablet touchscreen
keyboard because I think it is the
question is whether it's better than a
light accessory keyboard like the iPad
pro smart keyboard or the Microsoft
Surface keyboard personally I still
prefer a little bit more tactility when
I'm typing even if it means using a
flimsy accessory keyboard really the
only other thing to consider is the
software I still think Android is the
way to go although some people might
want Windows if they're using this as a
travel laptop or a secondary device to
their main Windows
name it ships running Android
marshmallow not nougat but lenovo has
added its own multitasking features to
the software to make it a little bit
more desktop like on what is a mobile OS
it is worth noting though that
multitasking isn't supported in all apps
there are a lot of reasons to seriously
consider the yoga book in the first
being it looks cool it's a sleek little
computer with an innovative keyboard and
also it's one of those rare instances
where a convertible or a two-in-one
actually makes sense
because it's great to use as a tablet -
the biggest drawbacks are that it's not
super powerful and lacks some basic
utility ports and some people just won't
like the feel of the keyboard it's not
going to replace that feeling of a real
laptop but it's not really supposed to
replace your laptop it's meant to
reinvent the laptop designs like these
are supposed to assure pcs into the next
wave of mobile computing lots of
companies have learned different PC
designs at the wall in recent years
hoping they would stick the Lenovo yoga
book feels like it actually might
okay so we're behind the scenes this is
Lauren all right here we go okay ready
and hit it hit the button okay reach
your arm around and start typing</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
