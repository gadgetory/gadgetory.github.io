just that space emptiness the void but
when it comes to the space around Earth
it's actually not that empty it's filled
with a whole bunch of junk or space
trash in fact experts think that there
are millions of pieces of debris in
orbit ranging in size from bigger than a
softball to smaller than a marble so
what is all of this junk hanging out
around our planet
well the awkward part it's all our stuff
that we've put into space that we just
don't use anymore sorry mom that can be
satellites that are no longer working
leftovers from rockets or stuff that's
come off spacecraft over time like
panels or even flecks of paint space
debris has included some rather unique
items too there's a tool bag still up
there that was lost by an astronaut
during the spacewalk a lipstick size
capsule of Gene Roddenberry's ashes once
over to the globe for a while - even
frozen pee used to make the rounds
before pee recycling systems were put in
place astronauts used to dump their
urine out into space where it
immediately turned into beautiful shiny
ice crystals that reflected the Sun sure
that's lovely and all but just like
trash here on earth debris and space can
be a big problem it makes the space
around our planet congested and
potentially dangerous place you may
think space debris is just floating out
there all slow-like
but this stuff isn't really floating at
all it's actually zooming around earth
at more than 17,000 miles per hour that
wouldn't be a big issue if everything
was moving in the same direction but
there are a bunch of different types of
orbits that space trash can be on some
go around earth's equator while others
go around the poles for instance that's
where you run the risk of getting
t-boned it happened in 2009 when a u.s.
satellite collided with one from Russia
putting thousands of pieces of debris
into space a similar event occurred in
2007 when China destroyed one of its
satellites with a missile creating a
whole mess of trash okay so
different scenario but the same result
even the smallest piece of trash
traveling at such a high speed could
cause a whole lot of damage if it
crashes into something if collisions
happen too often then we run the risk of
something called the Kessler syndrome
it's a simple concept colliding space
objects create even more space objects
and the more debris there is higher odds
of more collisions so if we don't keep
these accidents in check it's all going
to snowball until we get so much litter
in space that the entire area is
basically going to be hostile to
spacecraft for generations our best
defense against collisions is to
basically know where all of this space
trash is right now tracking space debris
is the job of the Defense Department it
uses something called the Space
Surveillance Network an array of
telescopes entirely dedicated to
tracking objects in space and figuring
out what they are the network is capable
of tracking anything that's bigger than
10 centimeters so about the size of a
baseball and right now more than 22,000
objects of this size are being tracked
once an object is spotted by the network
trackers must determine its orbit and
then see if it's in the catalog it's
getting the catalog trackers have to be
able to identify a piece of debris all
the way back to its launch if you can't
it's called an uncorrelated tract or
basically we don't know what it is but
ultimately the main goal is to know the
odds of these pieces running into each
other the satellite has a 1% probability
of collision that's way too high and
you're going to want to perform some
orbit correction maneuvers with your
thrusters to avoid an accident even a
space station has to move out of the way
sometimes when debris is in the area of
course correction maneuvers are really
only an option for spacecraft with fuel
to spare nothing can be done for debris
without thrusters plus there's a whole
ton of small objects that the
surveillance network can't see for those
experts have to create theoretical
models to predict where these tiny
pieces are going to be so how do we
clean up this mess well for the
satellites in lower Earth orbit chances
are they will come down eventually there
are still air molecules in the upper
atmosphere that create drag on
spacecraft pulling them back down to our
planet those vehicles will mostly burn
up on the way back
to earth but just in case the US is a
policy that satellites must have a plan
to do your bit safely when the time
comes that means no satellites are going
to fall on your head that only works for
satellites in lower Earth orbit though
many of our communication satellites are
in a much higher region 22,000 miles
above Earth called geostationary orbit
those are way too high to come back down
so when they run their course we put
them into a graveyard orbit it's an
orbit that's 200 miles up the hope is
that they'll be far enough away to not
interfere with our operating satellites
and those satellites will basically stay
up there forever
as for getting rid of the rest of the
stuff people have come up with some
creative and little kooky ideas there's
a concept known as The Terminator tether
it's a miles long cable that interacts
with Earth's magnetic field inducing a
current along the tether this creates
drag on spacecraft in orbit causing them
to fall back down to earth it's similar
to an electric whip that Japan recently
sent to space for clearing out debris
other ideas include adding balloons or
sails to spacecraft to slow them down
when they're done or even shooting them
with lasers the photons would impart a
small thrust on the object enough to
bring it down there are a lot of other
ideas too but there isn't anything
really viable to solve this problem
right now so in the meantime the best
option is to get better at tracking all
this stuff and that job may soon switch
hands the Federal Aviation
Administration has been very vocal about
wanting to take over the job of debris
tracking from the Defense Department so
soon the FAA may be the traffic cops of
air and space there's also another way
to protect against small debris that's
moving pretty slow it's called the
whiffle shield and it acts as like a
bumper shock for things moving at 1 to
11 miles per second and the space
station has over 100 whipple shields on
it so it's good to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
