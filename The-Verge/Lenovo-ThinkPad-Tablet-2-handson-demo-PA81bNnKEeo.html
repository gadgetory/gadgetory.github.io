for Berlin 2012 i'm here at the node was
booth and taking a look at the steel for
a new thinkpad tablet to which should be
coming out just about the time when
windows 8 releases windows 8 is going to
be releasably 12 26 but lenovo itself
won't tell us when this products coming
to market all it will say is that it
will be available with the windows 8
it's attached right now to this
bluetooth keyboard it's just a plastic
mock-up of the keyboard but you can just
pull it out like so and you can see
there's a stylus protruding out of it
stop it is an active digitizer so it
isn't capacitive like some of the
devices that you might have seen but
that also means that you get palm
rejection so this is a 10 inch display
with 1366 x 768 resolution you can have
one or two gigabytes of ram and 16 or 32
gigabytes of on-board storage you have a
whole bunch of connectivity which you
kind of expect with a thinkpad or
thinkpad tablet device you have an hdmi
port down here at the bottom next to
dock connector there will be a full dock
with extra ports as well there's also a
full-size USB ports cover it up with a
flap over here there's also a slot for
micro SD card slot and this is not for
sim card to get 3g and 4g signal now the
way you can kind of think about this
think Platt tablet too is it's kind of a
middle ground between the two surface
tablets of Microsoft's introduced and
the weather that works is it's running
Windows 8 the Intel or x86 version
rather and is running into a processor
but it's an aspen processor rather than
the core i5 core i7 that you might find
microsoft surface or the arm powered
version with the windows RT version so
it's lower power but that also means you
get up to 10 hours battery life it also
means you get a thinner device this is
less than 10 minutes tick it weighs less
than 600 grams and in terms of
construction it uses what Lenovo
describes is typical magnesium
construction which is also typical
lenovo understatement because most
companies go for plastic another goes
for magnesium
around here in the back you can see
there's an eight megapixel camera with
what looks like an LED flash and there's
also two megapixel camera around the
front the thing that we've been told by
Lenovo is a software still kind of an
early build so it isn't that responsive
and indeed the Metro UI is nowhere near
as fluid as you might find usually you
can see there's a chance menu over here
on the right and you can switch
applications by drag it in from the left
so that's it this is our look at
thinkpad tablet to hear ready for 2012
in Berlin</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
