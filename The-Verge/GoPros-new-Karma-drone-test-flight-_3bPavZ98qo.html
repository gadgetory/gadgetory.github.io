and after a year and a half of hearing
about the thing we finally got to see
GoPros first drone it was announced
today and an event here at Squaw Valley
ski resort and we learned all about what
it does what it's capable of we even got
to fly the thing now the big thing with
Karma is that it's easy to use and that
means a couple different things the
first is that it's small and unlike a
lot of other drones on the market it
folds up GoPro is actually selling it
with a backpack that it'll fit inside
once you folded it all up now another
part of that ease-of-use
is the controller for karma it's much
simpler than what you'd see with the DJI
phantom4 or the unique typhoon h it's
just a clamshell controller that pops
open and it only has a couple buttons
there's two joysticks for controlling
karma there's a button for starting and
stopping the motors there's a button
that will bring karma back to the spot
that you took it off from and it also
has a big LCD touchscreen which means
you don't have to use your phone to
control karma at all that touchscreen
will let you do things like change
settings or flip through their different
modes karma comes with a couple
different modes like cable cam or drone
E or an orbital camera mode now I've
never flown a drone before so all of
that sounded really exciting to me and
for the most part my first flight went
really smoothly I was able to take off
manually I was able to pilot it around
the ravine in front of me tilt the
camera around all without too much
trouble which was impressive because it
was really windy up on top of the
mountain today there were big gusts of
wind and they never really seemed to
shake karma out of its place whether I
was moving it or whether it was just
hovering and that's because there's a
GPS unit in the drone itself and in the
controller that keep it steady now the
wind did affect the battery life which
is supposed to be around 20 minutes so
my flight got cut a little short and by
the time that I brought the drone back
to land it it sort of just hopped down
on its own hit a rock and broke a
propeller
now this might be an easy drone to use
compared to some of the other ones on
the market but that doesn't mean you're
going to be able to pick it up and fly
it right away now the last cool thing
about Karma doesn't even have to do with
flying it at all you can take the three
axis gimbal right off of the front of
the drone and put it onto a handheld
mount that comes with karma to turn your
GoPro into a small little Steadicam rig
it's a lot like the DJI Osmo but it's
all in one package now we only had a
couple minutes with the Karma drone
today so it's hard to say exactly where
it's going to fall into the drone market
or how it's going to stack up against
the competition like the Phantom 4 but
when you consider the GoPro is going to
sell the $7.99 Karma as a bundle with
the hero 5 black for 1099 or with the
hero 5 session for $9.99 both of which
save you $100 it's easy to see how
they're going to compete so many bees
here I'm allergic and it makes me upset</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
