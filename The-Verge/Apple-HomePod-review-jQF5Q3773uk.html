Apple's answer to the Google home and
the Amazon echo and every other smart
speaker out there with a voice assistant
it's a $350 speaker that has Siri the
basic idea is pretty simple it's covered
in a weird spongy fabric there's a touch
display on top and it's surprisingly
heavy but the home pod is pretty limited
Siri just can't do as much as other
assistants and the only music service
you can control your voice is Apple
music if you're a Spotify person the
home pod is probably not for you and I
think Apple knows it's pretty limited
because all of the company's focus is on
sound quality the truth is most other
smart speakers sound crappy and the home
pod sounds incredible so I'm a huge
speaker nerd my house is full of
speakers there's a vintage all analog
system in the living room a brand-new
Atmos home theater downstairs Sonos
everywhere and all kinds of smart
speakers tucked into every other corner
so there's a lot here to compare the
home pod to especially since Apple says
the home pod is all about music first
and smart assistant stuff second and the
home pod sounds incredible for its size
and price we've been comparing it to the
new Amazon echo a bunch of sonar
speakers including the new stone s1 and
a play 5 the Google home and the Google
home acts and even Bluetooth speakers
like the UE mega boy and it's just
obviously better than all of them
it's
the home pot isn't just one speaker it's
actually eight of them all controlled by
an a8 processor and tons of custom
software there are seven tweeters that
fire down and out from the bottom and a
single four inch woofer pointing out at
the top for low frequencies there's also
a total of seven microphones six around
the middle for Siri in a seventh inside
that measures the location of that
woofer so Apple can precisely control
the bass when you first plug in the home
pod and start playing the music it goes
through a series of steps that tune the
speaker to the room it's it first it
uses the mics to detect any walls nearby
so it knows how sound will bounce off of
them second it uses of seven tweeters to
form a virtual array of sound beams that
are assigned at direct and ambient
sounds like vocals and applause the
ambient channels are pointed at the
walls to reflect and the direct sounds
are pointed out at the listener sometime
during all of that it detects the walls
again to refine the model of the room
itself then it analyzes the difference
between the left and right channels of
the music you're playing to figure out
what sound should go into what beams
ambient or direct and then it measures
the position of the subwoofer and the
reflections of the bass constantly as
you're playing music to make sure the
bass doesn't overwhelm the rest of the
music and all of this happens at once
within like 10 seconds if you move the
home pods an accelerometer inside
detects motion and it does it all over
again in terms of ideas I'm into a
virtual array of sound beams that points
guitar solos at my face is super high on
the list so here's the thing the home
pod sounds great but I don't think it
sounds so much better than other
speakers that you should switch away
from Spotify or give up all of the
features of Alexa or Google
if you're a huge audio nerd you will
definitely be able to hear it but if
you're just a regular person you might
get more from another speaker that
sounds almost as good something like the
Sonos one sounds almost as good and you
get a huge array of alexa skills google
assistant support in the future and you
can use almost any music service you
want and when you get away from sound
quality the home pod just isn't a very
smart smart speaker series just can't
compete with alexis huge array of skills
or Google assistance ability to answer
questions there's this display on the
top of the home pod but it doesn't show
information just blurry colors to let
you know what it's doing the Amazon echo
show and the echo spot actually show
information Google assistant devices are
coming out with screens too there's just
something missing there
you can control smart home devices like
locks and light switches but you have to
use homekit which is way more fiddly
than what amazon lets you do with alexa
siri can't even set more than one timer
which is the main thing I use my Alexa
devices for in the kitchen it's crazy
and in the weirdest omission of all Siri
on the home pod can't recognize multiple
voices this doesn't sound like a big
deal but if you just power through this
setup without thinking about it
literally anyone can ask the home pod to
read your text messages if you're on the
same Wi-Fi network so if I'm in the
basement and the home pod is up here
someone can there's a roll up to it and
start sending I messages or ask it to
read my most recent message and I'll
never know
your most recent message from Phil Amy
Leigh I don't know what kind of lonely
audio nerds Apple designed the home pot
for but I think you should turn off all
the personal requests features of the
home pod until the company adds voice
detection to this thing would you like
to reply yes what do you want to say hey
it's me like I believing that guy runs
the virtual your reply to Phil says hey
it's me I'm leaving Becca runs the verge
now ready to send it yes that's a huge
glaring weakness in a home pod if you
have roommates you have kids you live
with any other people at all you should
turn off personal requests on the home
pod settings until Apple adds detection
for multiple voices and I still just
don't know why it's not there Amazon can
detect multiple voices Google can detect
multiple voices Apple can detect
multiple voices if you say hey Siri only
your phone responds the home pod is
running an a8 chip same as the iPhone 6
should be able to do it it's just not
there the home about is limited in other
ways too
a lot of people on Twitter asked me if
you could use it as TV speaker and the
answer is basically no you can set the
Apple TV to airplay to a home pod but
the second you ask it to play music it
loses a connection and then you have to
set the Apple TV to airplay again when
you want to watch something so you can
do it it's just super inconvenient
you also can't tell Siri on the home pod
to place something in the Apple TV the
way that you can with Alexa and a fire
TV or a Google assistant and a
chromecast until air play 2 comes out
sometime this year you can only use one
speaker at a time you can't have
multiple speakers going at once you
can't use it as a Bluetooth speaker at
all and you can't even set it up if you
have an Android phone you have to have
an iOS device and then there's Spotify
and other music services I've mentioned
this a couple times already but Spotify
has way more subscribers than Apple
music and the home pod doesn't really
know Spotify exists you can play Spotify
on a home pod over airplay if you want
but you won't really be able to control
it with your voice and Spotify is
everywhere you can get a ton of devices
that support it direct
Apple music is pretty much as limited to
Apple's ecosystem so you lose a ton of
flexibility about where your music is
available if you switch to Apple music
it's a huge and frustrating limitation
look Amazon makes the echo and they own
Amazon music but they still let you set
Spotify is the default Google makes cool
home devices they own Google Play Music
and YouTube they still let you said
Spotify is the default Apple just wants
to lock you into that ecosystem and it's
incredibly restrictive I am an apple
music subscriber it's my primary music
service and I still think this is
frustrating as a speaker the home pod is
a huge accomplishment it sounds
incredible apples audio engineering team
should be so proud of itself
I actually went to Cupertino a couple
days ago and toured apples audio
engineering lab and got to see all the
rooms they test it in they've put so
much work into this thing and it totally
paid off but apples audio engineering
team should be pretty frustrated with
the executives at Apple who decided that
this thing needed to be restricted
entirely to Apple's walled garden if the
home pod would just open up a little bit
and let you use the music service you
wanted let Siri be a little bit more
extensible and would just be a little
bit more capable it would be the only
speaker to that absolutely look if
you're a huge audio nerd you use
entirely Apple products and you
subscribe to Apple music you should get
a home pod it sounds really really good
but if you use Spotify you should get
something else there are other speakers
out there that sound almost as good and
fit your life better and ultimately
Apple needs to compete with that man I
really put a lot of words in this video
