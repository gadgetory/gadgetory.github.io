still able to watch everything that I
wanted a bunch of TV shows movies for
watching West world on HBO right now you
probably already know this because even
enough money by streaming everything you
want instead of paying for cable and I'm
not talking about pirating things either
guarding the streaming route to be a lot
more selective about what you get and
what you don't and that can save you a
bunch of money average capable is over
$100 a month but there are some
decisions to make especially if you get
a lot of channels it's not as easy just
calling up Comcast and Verizon and ask
them to turn your service but are you
thinking about going to streaming route
you'll find that you don't have to miss
out on a lot and you can save a lot of
money okay so first we need to talk
about hardware but before you even get
to streaming one thing you should know
is that you can still get a number of
channels for free using a digital
antenna seriously it's legal and it's
like 20 bucks but this is old-school TV
it's in order with ads there's no DVR no
on-demand so that's really helpful
because it's free and always available
but it's not going to be as convenient
as streaming all right so what do you
need to stream you already know how to
do it on your phone or your computer but
the real goal is to get these shows on
your TV and if you already have a smart
TV then you're basically set if you have
something that can play Netflix or Hulu
or has an app store that lets you
download those apps then you're good to
go and if your Smart TV is really
confusing then don't worry about it
everybody who doesn't have a Smart TV
like myself you're just gonna have to
buy a streaming box and that box will
probably have a better easier interface
I've got a Samsung TV from 2012 with
absolutely no smart features and so to
get streaming I have two boxes hooked up
to it I have an Apple TV and a
chromecast you don't need both I'm just
a nerd the chromecast is super cheap
it's like 35 dollars but it doesn't have
an interface seriously you turn it on
and there's just nothing you control it
all through your phone so it's a little
confusing and I really wouldn't
recommend it for most people my favorite
is the Apple TV I don't even have the
lowest one my models from 2012 and it
still works fine if you have a 4k TV
though make sure you get the newest
model and if you're not a big Apple fan
Roku also make some really nice
streaming boxes all these devices will
let you stream whatever service you want
you'll just have to
look for it you'll usually have to
browse app by app to see what's
available which can be a little slow and
frustrating if you're used to live
channel surfing but I definitely prefer
it it's certainly quieter and that's
pretty much it the next step is to pick
which services you want to pay for but
before we get into that let's talk for a
second about why streaming services are
so complicated because they were
supposed to be a dream or you pay for
just what you wanted and nothing you did
it and it's really not that at all sure
you can subscribe to Netflix and Hulu on
their own but that's just like HBO and
stars they're basically premium cable
channels that stand on their own and
yeah you can rent anything you want from
iTunes but it's basically just a modern
DVD store if you actually want to stream
traditional live TV then you're still
going to be stuck with a bundle why is
that
the problem is TV is expensive and TV
networks know they can make more money
by selling channels together so Viacom
might require your cable provider to
offer MTV BT and vh1 together even if it
just wants MTV do that over and over and
over again and suddenly throughout the
200-some Channel cable package you have
today streaming TV isn't that bad
it still has bundles but streaming
services know that consumers are looking
for smaller packages and so they don't
get too out of hand but it gets tricky
when you bring in sports sports are
really popular and really expensive and
rights for them usually end up spread
across a bunch of different networks
that means streaming services have to go
out of their way to get certain games
and you'll have to go out of your way to
make sure you pick the services that
have what you want all right
so what services you actually subscribe
to what's too much and what's too little
right now I'm subscribed to Amazon Hulu
and HBO and I'm mooching off of
someone's Netflix account between those
I have access to most of the TV shows
people are talking about and some huge
back catalogs to watch I actually don't
think any one service is amazing for
movies so I like to rent them off of
iTunes they're like three to five bucks
apiece and just doing that once a week
is still gonna be cheaper than
subscribing to another service okay so
that works for me
but what about you what if you're
watching a ton of TV shows on a bunch of
different channels are you still gonna
be able to go to the streaming route and
save money the answer is probably as
long as you're watching stuff on major
networks Hulu is a live TV service with
50 some channels for $40 a month slink
TV offers even smaller packages one
starts at $20 and comes with a bunch of
major channels you might not be missing
out on a lot including AMC ESPN and CNN
AT&amp;amp;T says it's gonna start an even
cheaper service at $15 a month being
able to choose from smaller plans is a
really great opportunity to figure out
which channels you actually need and
pare down on the ones that you don't all
of these streaming services are
available on the streaming boxes I was
talking about earlier they're gonna be
more expensive than just paying for
Netflix or Hulu but the point is that
you don't have to limit yourself to just
these newer streaming services you can
still get old-fashioned TV and you can
do that while spending less than you
would on cable okay but the big question
is sports and yeah with streaming
services that can get complicated it's
gonna pen down what sports you care
about which teams you're following and
where you live if you're fine with just
watching some primetime and playoff
games then any streaming service that
just provides the major broadcast
networks than ESPN probably get the job
done most sports leagues offer their own
streaming services so if you're really
serious about catching everything you
should check those out but just keep in
mind they're pretty expensive and they
have a lot of restrictions on them like
game blackout so be sure to read up on
that before you sign up and keep in mind
if you get a digital antenna like I
mentioned earlier you'll probably have
the network that's broadcasting your
local team that covers TV movies sports
and the streaming boxes to watch it all
on there might be a little bit of a
learning curve at first but it's really
not that hard and in the long run you're
gonna be saving money you won't miss out
on any of the season's biggest shows hey
