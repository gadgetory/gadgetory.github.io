ride that cost more than two hundred
thousand has lots of horsepower and
looks the part but bring many so-called
supercar to a racetrack and they simply
don't and as you're out McLaren does
things differently
the 675 longtail cost me up four hundred
thousand has six hundred sixty-six
horsepower but it lives in breeze at the
racetrack this thing kicks ass I'm at
Monticello Motor Club in upstate New
York and this is a place I know
well like really well Ferrari well
Lamborghini well racecar well I've
driven almost everything here there are
a lot of supercars out these days it's a
lot of ways you could spend a hundred
grand two hundred grand or in the case
of what we're driving today four hundred
thousand dollars why would you do that
because you want people to be impressed
because you want people to like you
because you want a really shiny object
well although those maybe make sense but
in the case of this sex is 675 it's
because you probably actually know how
to drive this is a surgeon's instrument
you hear that a lot
and usually it's total in this
case not this SIG is for real
it's got supreme balance it's got actual
downforce which means that you carry
more speed through the corners you don't
need to rely on these great carbon
ceramic brakes of
certainly can and it's got a 666
horsepower which just screams me down
these straightaways but just carry more
speed than I've ever been able to carry
on this racetrack the long tail is an
old name in the McLaren heritage
the f1 our first road car was
successfully erased in a few forms at
one LeMond 20 years ago and the f1 long
tail was kind of the classic ultimate
iteration of the car and so when we were
looking for a name for the new car our
sportiest or most track Oriya and a
model long tail came back and it was a
good fit with the history of the brand
and really so it's got this huge fin on
the back and when you brake the big goes
like this and captures the wind and it's
one of the things that makes this car so
magical and so that's also it looks a
little different than the standard model
right
yeah absolutely and then you call that
it works it's it's it's not just show
and yeah compared to the 650 it's
actually 50% wider and it goes across
the whole rear deck of the car which
makes a race cars rolling bias which
shows so I passed that guy earlier today
he's in a real race car he's will see
one of the three asking for an order
Bank yeah yeah yeah he actually was a
matter of fact and that's the thing is
out here at a place called is Monticello
it's a private club guys do exactly what
we did today they drive up their
expensive cars they drive them some of
those cars I've had out here by really
famous brands and they don't hold up
this thing is like a pinnacle of
engineering you have to be kind of a
drivers driver to get why it's so
awesome but dude it was awesome
now this car wants you to be in control
but it will do exactly what you tell it
to it's like get in really close to this
curb break really late here oh yeah get
off the brake back on the gas all the
way back over here in oh yeah I wouldn't
ask this from many cars for expected to
perform like most cars this is four
hundred thousand dollars of speeding
goodness the submit' engines that means
it's behind your head
and then it's got a great whale to it
I've actually got it left in automatics
a transmission right now I could be
shaft shifting using these uh these
flappy paddles but it's so good that I
don't need to and you know what if the
machine is smarter than me
well in hell with it is smarter
than me what am I gonna do I'm driving
better with it in automatic than I
probably would be in manual mode so this
car is just it's so giving it's a
sweetheart
it's so phallus it's just this car is
made to really do things now they're
clearly inane things they're things we
maybe don't need to do per se but if
you're into it it's like anything else
you want the best instrument you can
possibly find and in my actually spirits
right now this is one of the best
instruments I've driven in a long time
it's not potentially ever this is a
driver's car do they care so much about
getting this little things right then in
the end it creates something that's much
better than you have any hope for it to
really be what's interesting is this is
sort of there are more expensive cars or
completely less expensive cars in the
McLaren line
this might be the most magical spot if
you got 400 grand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
