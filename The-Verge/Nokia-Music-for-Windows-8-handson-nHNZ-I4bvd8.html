verge and we're looking at nokia music
which is running on windows 8 you're
going to the application you notice this
is actually a native application and
it's not a html5 variant that's similar
to what knock is offering on the web and
swiping up from the the top of the
bottom you get the sort of typical app
have our support if we pan across and
get into the various mixes that knock
your offers and you can also create your
own mix the nokia music is kind of like
pandora so you can search for an artist
in here and basically you're creating a
plate a play list based on your favorite
artists which put a few in here and you
know what will happen is when you
actually play the playlist it'll go out
and look for songs are similar to say
Bob Marley or or a faithless Oriana I'm
gonna go play dough so instead of
moments it's obviously playing upon
multitrack here and you can't download
tracks individually and there is support
and if you hit the download button it'll
throw you into the web and yet you have
to go and buy that that song on its own
one feature that you can do with
knocking music is you can select one of
the playlist and you can take it offline
and that will literally sink it so it's
available without any data connection so
it's a little bit similar to sort of
rival services like Spotify and the rest
but when you actually search for an
artist here you'll get a view of all
that similar music and radio stations
and you can actually go in and they'll
give you all the sort of information and
it treats the stuff but you won't be to
like go in and select specific songs so
I like Spotify where you could wait if
you knew the music you want it and you
go and get it this is more of a sort of
radio service where it will suggest
music for you based on your likes so
knock your music is also available for
other devices like Windows Phone and
it's actually a free service on that
particular device and on Windows a knock
is offering a free dollars and
ninety-nine cents a month for the
subscription service you get seven days
trial free but then after then you
you'll be locked out you have to pay for
the subscription so that was a quick
look at the beta copy of nokia music and
it's expected to come out in q1</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
