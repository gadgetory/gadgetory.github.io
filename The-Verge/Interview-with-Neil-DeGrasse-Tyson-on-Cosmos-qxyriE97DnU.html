zipped through the universe during the
premiere episode of cosmos a spacetime
Odyssey the show whose premiere was
simulcast across ten US networks and
broadcast in more than 180 countries is
an ambitious continuation of Carl
Sagan's 1980 classic and it wouldn't
have been possible without dr. Neil
deGrasse Tyson a renowned astrophysicist
internet meme and outspoken science
advocate who was the daunting task of
stepping into Sagan shoes
neil degrasse tyson everyone's favorite
astrophysicist Twitter personality and
now host of cosmos a spacetime Odyssey
this is a huge potential audience that
you're reaching here what is the
audience that you are hoping to reach
out of that just sort of massive pool of
potential viewers I quote the executive
producer and writer of the series and
Riaan who wrote for the original cosmos
it's anyone with a beating heart and
then I got me thinking well do zombies
have beating heart because I want to get
them too but it's everyone is the
audience because science is not the
purview of a demographic it's the
purview of us all as human beings as a
species who are charged by ourselves
with being tenders the people to tend to
our civilization I mean who else are you
gonna how are you gonna do it there's
somebody from the outside gonna say oh
fix that and kind of move this in let me
give you some advice there thank you
goodbye
I'll go back to my planet no we are here
masters of our own destiny masters of
our own demise and I noticed you know
you touch on religion and you touch on
faith and it got me thinking when you're
reaching such a big audience I mean do
you need to sort of adjust the way you
navigate some of those waters sort of
the way you navigate you know faith and
science in an episode like that I mean
is that something that navigation
implies that there are some land mines
that we're avoiding we are offering
science the world as science has come to
reveal it we are also describing stories
of scientists of the past thinkers
searchers of the past who have arrived
at emergent truths and we show the
struggles they encountered upon sharing
those truths with others so the issue of
that first episode which featured
Giordano Bruno our hero of the story
he's by the way a monk these are he's a
monk the Christian monk and he dies a
Christian monk he's martyred for his
ideas his ideas were bigger than the
ideas prevailing the
so here is not religion or not religion
because he's religious and who's
persecuted by the the Inquisition so
it's not religion or non religion it's
emergent truths about the universe
versus dogma and Dogma can manifest in
any number of ways would be political
Dogma yeah
social cultural dogma things your
community doesn't want you to believe or
accept is true so you deny it in spite
of it actually being true so in that
first episode he my favorite line from
it is as he's being attacked by people
who are sure that earth is in the center
of the known universe
and earth is the object of God's
creation he's thinking that the stars in
the night sky are just like the Sun and
if they are then they must also have
planets and if they have planets then
they might have life and if they have
life then God is bigger than just God of
the earth it's God of the universe this
is his idea so do you want to call that
anti religion I'm saying it's what
happened
yeah and we're presenting it and it's an
idea that was where they attempted to
suppress it because it conflicted with
Darwin sure ended up being a pretty good
idea really good idea I also noticed in
the episode last night that there are
these so many elements that are so true
to the original things like the
spaceship of the imagination or the
cosmic calendar was it important to you
when you were coming up with this 2014
edition or reboot as it's been called to
to honor that original well so I think
the word reboot showed up in a very
early press release but it's not it's
it's a continuation of the story all the
stories are new for all 13 episodes we
continue to use some of the potent
storytelling tools that were developed
in the original series the cosmic
calendar but now brought into visual
effects that are just stunning as well
as the spaceship of the imagination
which got some mixed reviews and its
early incarnation will wisely there
what's he doing and we were ready to
just not even go there
until an idea was put forward for what
the new spaceship for the imagination
might look like you gotta admit it's
badass
I don't you've seen it yeah is in it
it's just bad it's a badass spaceship
but it's a ship that's not just through
space as you will see in later episodes
it goes through molecules and dewdrops
and it goes wherever we need to go to
tell the story that we're telling and it
becomes a literal and a figurative
vehicle to enable that storytelling I
mean obviously you've done you know
plenty of TV radio public appearances
etc how was filming this different or
unique or challenging for you I mean
everything everything everything about
it when you see the the awards
ceremonies where people are thanking the
whole list that list is a fraction of
who really should be thanked they're
thanking the important people who will
influence their later lives but the
gaffer and the you know the sound design
and and the graphic doesn't it just goes
on and on and on so all of that was
novel for me and it's not something I do
all the time I mean I the next time I
just rather stay home with somebody else
really yeah because it was I was a lot
of time away from home and I you know my
kids are growing up and I want to see
them grow up continue to see them grow
up so it's not like I had two years yeah
I'm not doing anything else just book me
around the world
and film this know it you know it
interrupted other things in life so I
don't regret having done it but the
reality of it is is not something I
would do as a career I'd there's not oh
I got five other film projects no yeah
no go back to the lab I'm ready and then
I'm going to the lab yeah right well
earned I think we can all say what's
next what what do you hope to well
that's a great question
I want to continue to write which was
put on hold for a book in contract and
another one half written and another one
that's an idea Wow and I like writing
because I'm at home I can do that or in
my office that I want to reinvigorate my
research program as a scientist that's
what fuels my energy to even communicate
in the first place so I don't want to
ever lose track of that so I'm happy to
just recede you know for
years let somebody else let the press go
to other people and you know at the at
the end of that for the viewer for the
audience what's the call to action here
yes through there people not in this
audience but this audience would be in
the category of people who know they
like science okay we got that then the
people who don't know that they like
science I don't think they're watching
verge okay because they don't even know
that that's something interesting to do
cosmos will fan a flame that might have
just gone dormant within them I'm pretty
sure of that and but then there's the
third category of person the people who
know they don't like science had what
are they doing what are they saying you
know that's not a problem unless you
that's how you feel and you're in power
yeah then that that's dangerous because
in this 21st century science matters in
a big way and the people who don't who
know they don't like science or
cherry-pick science to resonate with
their philosophies they are I think they
just don't know what science is I don't
think they learned what science is and
say okay I'm gonna reject that I think
they never knew it so I'm not here to
beat them over the head for feeling the
way they do I'm here to show them
something that they might not have ever
learned what science is how it works why
it works and what it means for a
scientific truth to emerge from the
efforts of observations and experiment
and at that point I think it's harder to
turn around and say while you're on your
mobile you're on your smartphone
listening to the car GPS tell you to
turn left say I don't like science I
don't need something that's like what so
so it's it's you know it's a it's an
awakening and after that I'm not gonna
tell you how to vote I'm not gonna tell
you where to live I'm not going to tell
you anything
but whatever however you decide what
your life will be I think there is no
rational argument for you to defend that
you want to be less informed about it
rather than more cosmos is a way for you
to become more informed about
the role of science in all of our lives
and you worry that that role has been
diminished sort of I guess I'm talking
about it on a federal level you just
mentioned people in power and I know
you've talked before about sort of a
need to fund NASA to a greater extent
for example do you worry that we're
maybe sort of missing out on
breakthroughs or new technologies or new
scientific truths then clearly oh yeah
oh yeah and the one of the many good
things about science
although bad for us here in America is
science does not sense as borders no one
has exclusive rights to make a discovery
so if America fades it just watch other
countries rise up for having done so for
having not done so for investing in
science and technology that they came to
recognize and understand are there the
seeds and of the engines of tomorrow's
economies so if we don't China will rise
up in the Russia Singapore somebody's
gonna come up and and take that slack as
so as a scientist I don't really care
when somebody does it but as an American
like I grew up in an era where we led
the world and everything everything it
was essentially everything everything
that actually shaped the 20th century we
invented computers we invented the
assembly line we invented look at the
things that are all around us now and
what role Americans play we invented
television all right invented radio all
right commercial you know the radio
there was some Italians who thought
about radio waves but radio as a
communication as a means of entertain
that so so much of that shaped the
century and I don't want to be on the
sidelines for the 21st century I want to
be there and you know what about kids I
think this is obviously a show that will
appeal to them if they're allowed to
stay up and watch it what should they be
taking from this what do you not should
what do you hope they take from this no
the kids kids are already scientists I
think they'll enjoy it they'll enjoy the
visual effects they'll enjoy the
storytelling
we're storytelling species
we like telling stories and listening to
stories there already there I don't have
to worry about them I worry about the
adults and adults outnumber children
five to one once you are informed by how
and why science works you will recognize
that that'll be the center of so many
issues that come up the challenges that
face our culture our civilization going
forward on energy and transportation and
health security and these go beyond just
oh I can't wait till the next app comes
out for my smartphone these are bigger
issues that require major attention and
investments without it we'll just muscle
just move back to the cave yeah well
we'll end up you haven't taken a sip of
your I took well I did take one set one
I did take see how purple it is it's
this what it looks like when it's in
barrel and so would you say that this is
a I put it away and open it in eight
years eight years were eight years too
soon maybe fine I'll give you five five
years I can't wait that long so what you
do is you buy wine and then put it in
the closet and then five years later you
can pull out a five year old bottle
every time you buy a brand new bottle I
don't know if I have that kind of
patience yeah it takes you have to think
about tomorrow yeah okay I'm not quite
there yet in my life or in my wine
collection so I mean what kind of wine
would you suggest that somebody drink
say next Sunday when they're sitting
down to watch cosmos oh well actually I
have a great quote from Galileo her name
and I'm gonna I don't appear phrasing I
don't have the exact words and he would
have said it more poetically but I give
it my best shot the Sun holds all the
planets in their appointed orbits yet
can ripen a bunch of grapes as though it
had nothing else in the world to do well
on that note cheers congratulations
Galileo and all those who wondered about
how to turn sunlight into gold
