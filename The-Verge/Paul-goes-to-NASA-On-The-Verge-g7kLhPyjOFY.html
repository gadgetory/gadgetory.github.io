we catch a ride with Russia commercial
spaceflight is awesome and it's doing
really well and it might get American
humans in American vehicles up soon but
it might take NASA a decade to build its
own capsule and get astronauts back in
space so what what happens now at NASA
what is happening now I'm here at the
Johnson Space Center in Houston Texas
opening the doors to shed light on the
future of human space travel this is
Robonaut 2 he's a collaboration between
NASA GM there's a guy exactly almost
exactly like this up in space right now
this is in Houston and NASA's tests out
new routines new behaviors and they ship
them over to another lab where they have
an exact replica of Robonaut that's on
the space station where they finalize
routine then they beam that up space and
do it for real well the whole idea
behind Robonaut is to provide an
assistant for crew a Robonaut could work
side by side with the crew like a nurse
to a doctor or you could also take down
all the tools and everything all the
infrastructure after a particular task
is completed I think it's important to
keep in mind that Robonaut is a tool
many people talk about science fiction
robots and how they can go and do things
on their own Robo Knight has been
designed specifically to be a tool for
people it only does we tell it to do and
it's been designed with the safety and
the reliability to be a useful tool
around people not to go off and do
anything on its own
I'm just going to show you a quick
little scene from national treasure 3 at
the start of the movie Nicolas Cage is
sent to space using one of the Russian
vehicles that currently takes astronauts
to space because the the Space Shuttle
has been the decommission and he's
looking for the lost US Constitution and
unknown to the other astronauts since
Robonaut outside the space station to
retrieve the the Constitution and so
Robonaut can fold back thermal blanket
that's hiding the US Constitution and
Nicolas Cage back inside the space
station because Nicholas Cage doesn't
know how to spacewalk she's like oh
thanks Robonaut i will take the US
Constitution to the President of the
United States mask him why did you hide
this on the space station well don't you
look in the yellow look at the goblet
it's just not Constitution it's just so
this is called the Robo glove an
exoskeleton for your ham it's basically
designed to help you grab things and
make you stronger in the glove itself
here on the thumb we have something
called a for sense resistor we actually
actuate the tendons and we pulled them
down and then release them when you let
go the f sr and that's what gives you
the extra power to lift an object like a
heavyweight or something more so now I I
mean I can lift heavy weight on my life
cuz I want you guys to know very capable
of lifting heavy weight sure i'm here
with front of the multi-mission
multi-mission space exploration vehicle
and so this is a capsule with a dead
body mounted to the outside noise so
explain your ears telling me this is
like a modular system so that that's
where multi-mission comes in the chassis
is effectively a robot this robot has
wheels and that moves around the payload
is the cabin so can i I Drive it yeah
let's hop in
so I do I've the pilot now you're the
pilot so pretty much push the stick in
the direction you want to travel and the
vehicle will do what it needs to do to
get there here we go
so you'll notice when I just tipping
into it so right now if you were outside
you'd see it forcing this right wheel
down into that hole
incredible
it doesn't make any sense it's just like
a avoiding a weird random direction of
floating and I'm Bobby the cure itself
won't allow you to to do things that are
gonna jeopardize the safety of the robot
as you're going over the hill you're
starting to pick up more speed because
your vehicle weighs a lot but the wheels
notice that and say well I'm only
getting a command of one meter per
second and it's
so you maintain that speed ma'am I just
feel like it's like just giving me out
of a pinch every time that's nothing a
little rescued basically by a robot we
can venture over to Mars if you want
that was good I'm sick of the moon can
we go through the wall and yeah yes
pretty good life down there I saw
dragonfly lot of people that's our star
c300 so sixteen thousand dollar camera
I'm gonna run over it I'm gonna close my
eyes and you're gonna tell me go
straight and you tell me what's thought
okay ready yeah push you push your stick
forward my eyes a club stick us forward
oh we're doing it I was looking good oh
my god it's probably not quite center
but listen I think we need I don't see
anybody in the cameras crying it's okay
alright trying to back off just look at
the review of the rear view camera
this is the space vehicle mock-up
facility where they have space vehicle
mock-up seeeeee within the facility this
is a ryan this is NASA's next generation
space capsule so this is how we would
get back from the Moon or Mars or
wherever we go next this is how we land
back on earth but you could live in here
for a while for people could be in here
if they really liked each other to be in
here for 21 days basically this this
room is awesome and I'm gonna live here
NASA Johnson Space Center Visitor Miller
Paul Josiah expires wednesday october
Tober 7th and that's today some say
space is the final frontier and you know
that's a final frontier that's a lot
it's like in Little House on the Prairie
when they you know they move to the
little cabin in the Big Woods but that
wasn't far enough so they they move
further to the Little House on the
Prairie
and you know and then one day we found
the UH notion to new an ocean on the
whole other side of the country there's
an ocean this whole time and I think
spaces like that the scientists that I
met today in Houston at NASA are they're
working on him this bass player we are
not there yet but we're working on it
that's cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
