you are constantly surrounded by comics
whether it's choking hazard sign in the
restaurant or the IKEA instructions
you're trying to decipher at one point
another in your life you've read a comic
ever since Action Comics introduced the
world to Superman in 1938 modern comics
have been a huge driver of art and
culture what used to be ridiculed and
cast aside has now become modern-day
cultural phenomenon generating billions
of dollars comics have come a long way
and thanks to new digital platforms
comics are more accessible than ever it
really feels like we're in this kind of
weird comic Renaissance there's just
more of everything yeah there's so much
diversity small publishers are doing
really well small publishers big
publishing to be a little more organized
I mean independents now can just go out
and do it and just publish themselves
but I really like I don't even like
where to start anymore where do we begin
with comics when I started out I could I
could just like go hmm and imagine the
entire world of comics you know in 1984
I could just see it in my head you can't
do that anymore it's too big this is
Scott McCloud he's a major figure in
comics theory you may recognize him more
like this in 1993 he created the seminal
comic book understanding comics it was a
comic book treatise of sorts
illustrating how comics leveraged many
different disciplines from semiotics to
sequential art he's a kind of a go-to
guy for anything comics you know the
comics industry has changed even since
the last book even since 2006 or since
1993 it's a completely new industry six
months after understanding comics came
out in 93 the first graphical web
browser came out web comics came in just
crashing into our art form and and
completely changed the rules meanwhile a
graphic novels movement finally takes
hold and that was a tremendous change
you also saw the influx of manga and a
lot of storytelling techniques that I
think could be tremendously valuable in
comics storytelling so these are four
massive changes in comics culture the
result is we have this tremendous
biodiversity of the
that are out there of the the kinds of
subjects that people can talk about in
comics of the people making comics we're
seeing more diversity there and we're
seeing a tremendous diversity of formats
and technologies this is how you have a
healthy art form you want an art form
that's so diverse that you can't see
from one end of it to another it's also
diversity in terms of format -
especially with you know digital comics
right now because they can think beyond
just the page convention right people
are doing things that are really
innovative in digital comics for
instance one really great example that I
can think of is Somalia Somalia was an
interactive comics journalism magazine
that was published on iPad and through
PDFs this is Joyce rice she was the
creative director of sambhal yeah she
knows a lot about digital comics how you
make them and what they can do and she
really believes that they can enhance
the comics reading experience if you
make them right one of my favorite
inspirations for interactive comics
actually is raw magazine which was a
magazine that was printed in the 80s and
90s they would include like sound discs
and packs of bubble gum and like all
these different kinds of interactive
things in their printed magazines and so
I look at raw and I'm like what can we
do on the computer that's totally
different symbolic deals in nonfiction
and that sometimes means dealing with
data so in this case they combined a map
graphic into a single panel thanks to a
gif if you wanted to do that in print
you need a bunch of additional panels
now over here were shown a street by
tapping on this icon you can here with
an environment sounded like the audio
and visual combination lets you enter
that landscape in a way that couldn't be
possible in print so digital comics
aren't just changing the way that we
read comics they're also changing the
way that we buy them here there's still
a surprising number of apps like
actually let you read and purchase
comics there's Marvel unlimited for
example those Dark Horse and of course
there's comiXology
there are tons of digital comics reading
apps the comixology is my app of choice
it's less buggy than most and it sports
a larger selection than any other
digital comics store to read a book on
your tablet or phone all you have to do
is buy it in the online store and then
you're off but comiXology is more than a
store the company also pioneered a
comics reading interface called guided
view the origins of data view is that we
needed a cheap way to present a portrait
style image onto a smaller screen or a
device at the start everybody was just
cutting out panels into in Photoshop so
huge overhead right you got to get a
bunch of people sitting in front of
Photoshop cutting out panels into four
40 by 640 the iPhone size and we're
making slideshows we felt like the
rhythm of the story was gone the feeling
of the page was gone the layout of the
page was gone but at the same time
you're talking about a very small device
so we had two goals one make it very
readable so that the text was readable
without a lot of pinching is doing cuz
that's a pain - we wanted the whole page
there so the idea of guided you came in
we basically show you chunks of the page
one screen at a time but do it in a way
that where we're telling a story so
we're not simply just moving around the
page we're actually going with the flow
of the story and then sometimes we'll
actually crop out unnecessary parts of
the artwork because they're not integral
to what the story is and then one of the
nice offsets of this is that you know we
actually invented a new way of telling
stories which has got to be native which
was completely done by accident what
happens is when you go from panel to
panel it slides but when you go from
page to page there's a crossfade and so
we had a lot of people see that and say
I want to create stories in this manner
it seems like there's a lot of
possibilities with guide of unitive but
it really just makes you think of the
device that you're using a lot more than
maybe you should be because you're
constantly tapping the screen and
waiting for bubbles to appear it also
comes down to authorial intent like
people a lot of these comics were
written with the page and I'm like
that's meant to keep them I especially
for example Scott McCloud who made a big
deal with a sculptor and being something
you should first and foremost
this thing was in every way designed to
take advantage of what print can do in
full knowledge and awareness of prints
limitations you know I have I have one
moment where where my protagonist early
in the book is shown is shown death you
know with with a little help from a
supernatural entity he's able to
understand what death is something that
all of us maybe understand on some level
but you need a little help to really
understand it some people have described
understanding death is like seeing the
back of your own eyeball the idea that
that consciousness can't even conceive
of the absence of itself you know so I
and the way I choose to show it in the
book is two blank pages the idea of
putting that in an iPad and having
people think that there is
malfunctioning you know I mean what do
you do it's like it's designed for print
it exists in print it's a it's a printed
artifact you know paper without ink with
that said I mean paper is always
something beautiful I think this is a
great constriction for people to kind of
experiment for mine but digital is a way
to expand entire audience yeah more
people are reading comic books because
of the digital format I think that you
know people who don't live close to a
comic book store have more access to
comics in general and then it also just
you know for people who maybe are
wouldn't feel comfortable going into a
comic book store as you know a newbie I
think that it allows them to explore a
world and and you know gain some
knowledge before having to step into a
comic book store and honestly anything
that brings more people to comic books
there's nothing wrong with that</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
