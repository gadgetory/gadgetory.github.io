I'm sure you won't mind hi I'm Joshua
Topolsky the editor-in-chief of The
Verge which is a website on the internet
that covers technology science art in
culture and you guys are currently in
our super session which is called argue
the future to return of the future and I
think it's pretty apt because I think
there have been a couple of things at
the CES that make me feel like the
future has come back a little bit it has
returned a little bit and and there's
some pretty exciting things going on in
technology right now so we want to get a
panel of people in this industry
together who really know what they're
talking about and are doing real things
and just chat about where we're going
right now where we are right now where
we're going in the future so I'd like to
bring up the panel and get this
conversation underway the first panelist
is our managing editor nilay patel who
is known online as Tornado 92 Neal I ok
sure you can applaud he deserves it he's
earned it we also have Andy for sell
who's the SVP of content at hulu and
strangely he's never seen snow so weird
fact about him bands no actual snow next
up is eric chang the director of
photography at Lytro he is an
accomplished underwater photographer and
but surprisingly bad at land photography
and and and finally last but certainly
not least Walt Mossberg who you may know
from The Wall Street Journal and his
site All Things D an interesting factoid
about Walt he's obsessed with market
fresh strawberries is that shoes give
the gimmer around it
so thank first I thank you guys for
doing this you're all very busy here
except for Walt he's taking it easy but
you know I'm glad to have this group I
think this is there's some diversity
though I realize we've got three
journalists up against to two guys
making this stuff and I feel like if you
notice us ganging up on anyone just say
stay Stassi leave the red card they can
hold up in the audience yeah seriously
so so the first question I want to ask
is about going into the CES there was a
lot of talk about first others love taco
CES is over it's not an important show
there's no need for people to do this
anymore because everybody's doing their
own events certainly you guys do your
your own events but there's this this
idea that's kind of starting to float
out there that innovation and hardware
is done that we got the iphone we got
iPads we got some broadband and HD and
now we're good for a while and and I
just want to I just you know I think
Walt I want to start with you on this
one do you think that that hardware
innovation is are we at a plateau right
now is this are we moving to a different
stage of technology the technology
industry um well it's an interesting
question I think there are there are
like 23 points to come to mind around
this topic first of all I don't think
it's possible anymore to separate
hardware and software I think you know
Steve Ballmer once said to me Apple is a
software company that instantiates its
software products and hardware and I
think you know now Microsoft is do is
instantiated its software products in
its own hardware and
Mike I think Google is pretty close to
that as well with the Nexus lon they
have now a line of Nexus things and they
owned a hardware company so that's the
first thing I think even just kind of
the premise of well software's and
services are moving but hardware is
plateaued and you know it's it's all
wrapped up the second thing is the
number of come if you look over the last
five years at the number of companies
that have done truly game-changing
hardware not you know small iterations
it's not that many companies so and one
of them the one that you mention i phone
and iPad that's one company yeah they're
great founder is has been gone for a
little over a year they is obviously
some natural term well there you know so
maybe they're just taking a pause and
working on the next thing how many
apples working on a revolutionising
television story have has the verge run
has all things the wall street journal
and rails right they are working on it
we all know they're working on it but we
also know that you know other companies
are working on stuff so it may seem for
a moment like a pause and then in three
months we get an invitation from one of
these guys to come to an event and you
know something something big happens
it's harder to surprise you on on
hardware and then you know the last
thing I would say is that these things
have a slow ramp-up so it's you you know
you can crack up and I certainly have
about the 84-inch you know TV that costs
as much as a car but you know the usual
takes about five CES is for some of
these things to come down into the
mainstream after they're introduced can
we still count them by CES is I don't
know where we are do you think i mean
III saw press release saying that they
had attracted a record number of
exhibitors and floor space and a large
about 150,000 people so it doesn't sound
like they're about to go away but right
well let's so let's ask these guys cuz
they're here I mean who lose here what
are you doing here I mean you're not
maybe you're not showing you know but
you
or here in every product or trying to be
in every product so what's what is this
for you what's happening right now what
are you doing here during this week yeah
i think my director answer that's
probably not super exciting we're here
because we have so many hardware
partners and it's a really efficient
place to come talk to them so you know
we're here really for a ton of b2b
conversations because it's a great place
to do it but but i think that gets back
to what Walt was saying is it hardware
software services what everybody's
trying to I think we're in a period
where heart you know we're still trying
to digest all the hardware that's come
out all the capabilities that have
increased in software all the great
services a how do you make those work
together Apple has one way of doing it
they try to control everything the rest
of the industry is trying to come up
with other ways to solve that puzzle
that are a little more distributed and
that's still in process so there's
ketchup going on there and then be since
a lot of the capabilities that come out
of those advances are about consuming
media various types we're in this period
we're waiting for the the business
models to catch up on media whether it's
video a printer or anything you know
radio to podcasting I think we're in a
period as well it says it takes five
years it may take ten years for some of
that to catch up and it's just business
model change that can't happen overnight
I mean it does it does feel and you know
I think light rose actually you guys can
we good example this you put your win
win de jure the lytro camera when was it
released to the consumer at the end at
the end of februari end of February's
and where did it gave you yeah didn't
debut didn't say it debuted at asia d
got you got clout got people to say that
here today yeah oh yeah one and a half
that but but your your product it's a
brand new product in the market I mean
there's nothing else like it you know I
i reviewed it's got its greets got some
great features got some flaws which I'm
sure you guys are working on but I don't
understand it I don't think I understand
your product yet I don't think I
understand what I can do with it and I
think that's a lot of our industry right
now that we made these things not me
I don't make anything but you know you
guys made these things and we're trying
to figure out what to do with them now I
mean that that even Apple seems to be in
some ways figuring out what we made the
ipad but is this all it can do or is
this the you know the full extent of its
ability I I mean I would argue I don't
know that there has ever been a point in
the history of Technology where we fully
figured something out before something
else came along we moved on to trying to
figure that on television I don't do you
know what you know what a television was
originally I mean there's you know
there's a big dispute somebody wrote a
great book about it I can't now remember
who actually Aaron Sorkin wrote a play
about it that's right who invented
television is his feet about it but
there was a Russian inventor who was one
of the people who was early on it and he
did it purely in his mind as a way to
monitor the safety of people down in
mines and you know the telephone was
originally thought to be something that
where people in a town would have one
telephone in the small town and they'd
all gather around listen to opera coming
out of the phone so right that didn't
add out when jobs did the iPad that
wasn't the first tablet we've gone
through a whole 10 years of a failure to
do tablets with the with the tablet pc
he did his thing and there was a lots of
people across the criticism people
saying well we have smartphones may have
laptops what is this poor and then how
many easy sold 100 million of them or
something by now so and people are using
them for all kinds of things and so I
think you're absolutely right people are
still trying to just it discover it and
walk around we a katie brett my
colleague and I walked around the health
section some of you may have done that
if you haven't I recommend it it's
really interesting that's a good
exercise too awkward good exercise
there's quite a few of those people with
ipads doing things with health right
over there that probably was not what
the guys who designed it in Johnny I've
wasn't sitting around saying i'm making
a medical device well they did show off
early on they showed all uses of the
iphone but but i mean i think people
come up with more things for then then
were originally anticipated so Apple
seems to be I do actually bring
is back NDT you you have a content
delivery service it's available on tons
of devices everything i buy almost
everything has hulu on it now I mean a
lot a lot of things have you mean Hulu
Plus right hulu plus well who the plus
is this hue hue was on everything with a
browser well with Lulu pluses the
streaming service you pay money for and
you get content with commercials even
though you've paid money also and by not
unlike josh and by the way any more and
more commercials is yeah like it's right
now it is almost the regular amount of
commercial it's getting a whole lot just
hold on it's approaching the regular
amount of comer it really is what is it
how many how many commercials in a
22-minute the goal the our view was
always you got to go back to the Golden
Age of TV which is the late 50s which is
about half of where we are broadcast TV
today so we're so you're saying it's
half yeah it's about half of in fact I'm
jr. we just pulled back a little bit
because we a lot of feedback and people
saying look we know you got to make a
buck can you pull the bass over so we're
not crazy when we it's in we have the
impression I haven't I'm did I don't
know about you but I wish I agree that
compared to when you first brought it
out there were there are more
commercials in there now yeah and part
of that was driven by just the ad sales
teams done a great job demonstrating
value we saw a lot of ads but a certain
point have to say no we could make more
money but you should you should you
gotta think of the user and balance
their interests and so yeah you'll see
us pull back a little bit there and the
challenge needs to be make those ads so
valuable people make them pay more for
them not just add more ads but so Josh
was so point right well I mean this is
interest the AG conversation that's
interesting too but now there's the
specter of in fact you know the apples
always a spectra at see if they had this
little leak in well they didn't have it
but there was a leak in your your paper
Wall Street Journal and no was reporting
all I mean he was it was a sources told
somebody at the wall street journal who
knows who they could have been these
sources that there that Apple may be
making a cheaper iPhone which they
already make it's called the iphone 4s
and iphone 4 anyhow the point is a Tory
you know it was but but so we heard the
news here nobody's talking about the
news
not that huge your story but now in the
TV industry there's the specter of apple
hanging you know everybody's saying
they've got something coming they're
going to append the cable companies
they're going to change the way we watch
television you guys have been building
this thing for years and years you're on
all kinds of devices are you spook are
you worried what do you you know do you
see this as a threat to your business
the thing that doesn't exist that we
don't know anything about this factor he
does know something about it though you
want to tell us about what you know feel
free there's nobody really you guys tom
yum well looked at directly answer the
one question and to skirt the other one
uh no I don't think we feel threatened
by it I think like we're excited
whenever is experimentation as I said I
think business models are catching up
like the one thing that I've had to
learn my job as I mean I'm a software
guy now spent five years living sort of
on the edge of media a lot of that time
I had to spend learning about 50 years
of Hollywood history and why things the
crazy rights landscape and I will spare
you examples but trust me they're crazy
about why the show can't be on that
screen and and it's amazing and and
there's a messiness there that is part
of what we've tried to tackle to say how
do you you can't totally mask that
messiness from users but how do you at
least explain part of it to them and do
the best you can and helping people
understand you're trying to get as much
content to them as you can and over time
that will increase I think the one thing
that's helped us a little is apple hates
that kind of messiness they want to have
a world they can control and I totally
get that but you know I think they'll do
some interesting things but I think
because they hate that messiness I don't
think they're going to change the world
overnight this is a world that can't be
changed I think it's a five year thing
as waltz that ore contains no but I
think that's a fabulously important
point at least on television and maybe
on some of the other devices and maybe
it explains a little bit of the hardware
sclerosis you were talking about if
that's an appropriate just going that
term thing out what I mean if TV and
revolutionising TV and forget about it
being just Apple because we know it's
not just Apple intel's in it Google is
in it everybody's trying to
revolutionize TV too it looks to a tech
company like low-hanging fruit
an important device it's at the center
of the home and it's poorly designed and
there's got to be the UI as bad you know
software is bad and the integration with
the wider internet world is bad so it's
low-hanging fruit what's the obstacle
what is causing this pause why is this
the third CES or there's at least the
second with the rumor of apple hanging
over over it I think it has to do with
exactly what you just said it has to do
with this crazy rights landscape and how
you can't really do this correctly
without getting deals and rights and and
bundles or whatever you have to get from
people that own hulu the people that own
the wall street journal is one company
news corp but also you know everybody
else well so don't you agree am I not
certain I I think that's a long-term
problem to unwind all that now what's
going on in parallel that will progress
and Apple will do part of it will do
will help but part of it you know
Netflix paying money for things will
help but that money solves you know you
guys voting with your clicks and making
it worthwhile will help us unsolved you
know solve that problem but it will take
a while because it involves you know
dick wolf suit NBC and suddenly that
means you know this is just crazy crazy
messages in the whole game in parallel
there's an alternate thing going on with
with you know youtube and other content
being created all over and shown on
people's own websites you guys create a
lot of content and our effect you know
competing in certain ways d certainly
does that and and there's a parallel
movement to say let's reinvent it with
no you know let's do new content has no
strings attached and I think that's
fascinating because you have both
progressing I think media loves to show
a conflict story and say who's going to
kill whom I don't think it's gonna be
that exciting I think cable is going to
still be around in 10 years it will be
different it will be more consumer
friendly because you all have voted with
your dollars in your clicks to force
them to do that will have helped in a
certain way and then in parallel there's
gonna be a whole world that develops
that's not rights constrained and that's
what Netflix is doing they're going to
make their own shows they can show them
anywhere in the world and so I think
that's fast and we have we have two
parallel things going on and it's you'll
be easy to say it's a race I don't think
it's that dramatic so here's my but it's
good for it's all good for viewers so
what I find interesting about the old
content that you that looks one way like
we know what TV looks like they're
sitcoms you know TV sitcoms look like
then I think about the content we make
and we make it differently because we're
making it online or means of production
are slightly different in our audience
look slightly cheaper slightly cheaper
and then I think I think about Eric's
company and you make a product that only
makes sense if you look at it on a
computer yeah right you have to interact
with a light row photo so I think what
we're changing our content and how we
make we think about making video because
our tools and our distribution are
slightly different then I think about
what photographers might do with light
show cameras but they're only forced to
be online right I mean just do you think
photography is going to change because
it only can happen on a computer is
there a future for your product outside
of the computer in the internet yeah
yeah absolutely there is a future for it
and in fact most existing photographers
only think in terms of existing
photography you know the first thing
they ask is well how big can I make a
print and I asked what when's the last
time you made a print I think I can't
remember and so you know in fact they're
consuming pictures online constantly I
mean if you if you leave someone alone
for 30 seconds what are they going to do
I'm going to pull out their phone and
look at a picture you know so it's very
natural for us to go straight to the web
and to allow interaction with all these
devices which are fundamentally
interactive in the way that you handle
them and so we're we're that's why we
decided to do that first having said
that light field photography is
fundamental tech and you still can get a
two-dimensional picture out of it for
print or a 3d picture for some other
kind of print which is you know on the
fringes right now of CES those very
small booths you know we haven't seen
you and those are launching here yeah so
I think you know this kind of
multi-dimensional photography you can
output whatever you'd like from it and
while the first camera is a consumer
camera with fairly low resolution to the
output you can imagine that scaling up
with Moore's law I mean we've just tied
photography to computing and once that
happens we vote we all know what happens
can you so we were talking about this a
little bit before we went on video video
with life I know we're virgin into a
light-filled conversation should hear
and I do want to get back to the TV and
I will in a second but video what are
the possibilities of doing video what
would that require to do video you can
refocus in real time well it's
fundamentally
anibal every frame we take is one frame
so you just string them together and you
get video so we have proofs of concept
time-lapse basically so what it requires
is high resolution capture the raw
capture and we know that already is here
it's just in the very high end and I
think what's missing which is very
interesting for this conversation is
that we consume very passively you know
we consume video material very passively
now and there have been attempts for
many many years to bring interactivity
into video you see these little pop-ups
you know like how do I get this thing
out of the way you know but
interactivity doesn't need to be an
overlay it can be you know like a very
intrinsic part of that experience it can
be now this is very content creators may
not like that they like to lock
everything in and say this is what I
made I'm an artist you know but in fact
when we have kids playing with these
things they want to try to interact with
every picture you know the kids of our
employees try to interact with every
picture they see of course you can
refocus a picture and of course you can
change the perspective they don't have
the same hang-ups we do and so I think
that's I think it's interesting that
you're talking about you know the idea
that just the very idea if you did if
there was this video content it would be
on it would be as flat as anything on a
regular television standard television
our old technology wouldn't be really be
able to replicate what you're creating
with the tool right you know you'd have
to it has to be on the web or it has to
be on interactive surface like an iPad
or an iPhone I think that's you know
telling about this that's TV industry
changing I mean that's where we are
going is this the second screen
experience and obviously innovations
like this but you said when we were
talking before that you don't have cable
right I didn't you don't you don't
subscribe to cable you haven't for how
long I haven't for about eight years or
so and so what so what spurred so you
look obviously you're deep deeply
immersed in the world of technology what
was how did you end up not having cable
I'm kind of curious to know this story
well I was out of town a lot but also I
I wanted something like Hulu I hated
having this expensive thing that I paid
for every month that fed me ads and I
have you know
had to what i watch i had a TiVo so I
would sort of record things and watch
them but they were starting to be I mean
not eight years ago but more and more
every year there were more ways to get
content where i could pay a little bit
or sometimes too much you know i got
really annoyed because i tried to buy
the wire and it was twice as expensive
to buy it on itunes than it was for me
to order it the whole series and have it
shipped to my house he was literally
twice to come that's still true and that
really was annoying I think it's still
more expense the first thing I did was
no was rip it so I could watch it on my
iPad yeah you know that's far flaw I
don't think he's got the work but no no
no you can't get the wire in itunes
that's right but that's not anymore
that's one of the right look what's part
of that whole rights thing yeah it's
what it's this I'm not trying to open a
books conversation but a similar thing I
mean it doesn't seem logical to people
that bits should cost as much as Adams
and that has a lot to do with I'm not
saying that Google and Amazon and Apple
or innocent their ever part in it but a
lot of it is the media companies and the
structures that go back way beyond when
any of the stuff was invented but Eric
how much do you think you spend on on
you know sort of replacements for that a
month I mean roughly do you it's
probably twenty dollars or something
like that about yours announcement I
spent probably 50 or 60 is it so you you
I think you're in there probably not a
huge minori but there's a segment that's
like that where you successfully cut
costs and also get the media you need I
think a lot of people have tried it and
I'm spending 60 70 80 bucks that they
normally spend but it feels better it's
a different way well you're not buying
you don't feel like you're paying for
yes this 700 ESPN channels that you well
that's my thought about cable I'm not
hugely negative on cable i have actually
two cable subscriptions i'm sort of
think you are you going to you right you
sunday i guess i'm just because you can
yeah well that sucks something ticket is
a prime example of what sucks it's also
a prime example of why hulu can't do
what what cable does no look have these
eyes what for the air with the NFL but
look I live Adam
get for the football team that I want to
watch I live in New York on watch
Packers I can't get DIRECTV I live in
apartment building in New York City
there is a product I'm waving the money
in the air and the right structure is
preventing me from having it what about
that legacy while so why don't you buy
slingbox yeah put it lighter where I've
seen right pay the five bucks a mono
idea sling where the eggs are swimming
okay the five bucks a month to the extra
cable box in one of your relatives I
don't know me tell you that I do that
least do is I want and I want in what
Walt is saying what I actually do I
think for a consumer is insane yes
because what I have done is and it's
there's demand for that the company
could productize it I have created my
own cloud television redistribution
system does that sound like something
any normal human being should do a lot
more subscriptions to that I'm just
saying when when the Ritz I'm a Red Sox
fan when the Red Sox were in one of
their World Series years it happened to
be one of those years when the MLB in
comcast for somebody were having a fight
about right now this periodically
happens and i said to my brother exactly
what i just said to you I said right I'm
coming to your house bring a slingbox
i'll pick your extra key i'm gonna use
your internet without telling you i'll
pay for that put in a closet now here i
get connected you do you have completely
jaya seal give it but here's here's the
question do you think so i understand
why you don't like that and you want to
get somebody ticket totally get it as a
consumer you should be steamed about
that but do you go another step and say
well they must be stupid like you do you
think they're missing an opportunity to
think it's bad business I think not
capitalizing on what is obvious demand
is bad business but I think if the NFL
and directv were here and spoke candidly
I think they'd say look we've done all
that math even if they're X number of
you and we're wildly ambitious and
aggressive about what we would pick up I
mean it's just like HBO going a la carte
it's a similar discussion I think it's
good business but I hate to say it as a
consumer selling but here it is good
business yeah but here it is worth it to
directv to have that exclusive and they
massively over pay for that content and
and it's horrible as in Sumer but I so
it is this directv overpaying efficient
in the market how do you want I think
they're overpaying vs well if I'm
NFL that's what I want sure and you
can't ask the NFL to do so I mean you
know we can't ask the NFL to take less
money just to be nice so I think that's
the trick I think over time HBO is the
same exact question we all would look at
we all many people would love to get HP
ala carte they don't have HBO today so
many people are inside HBO we love in
there yeah I don't see how that math
works though and I really don't you
think there are enough people that they
should be able to outbid direct
essentially to change the business model
no I I don't think I mean what are we
talking about how much per month for HBO
do you know I'm sorry the math only to
be the math on the ala carte yeah they
may be that it would be more profitable
than what they're doing yeah but again I
think HBO one way to look at is they get
paid a premium by big cable because they
big cable like DirecTV is willing to pay
a premium for the NFL to be able to use
that to get people to buy lots more than
just the NFL you know people you use HBO
the same way right and it sucks for
consumers but I think it's probably a
sound business decision so then we look
at that what's the answer because you
want to please users you want to get
content to users and that's where I
think some of that parallel developments
can occur we're all right you gotta
start greenfield in some cases but what
boy okay so we're all you know MURST in
this world we know everything about it
were you know voracious I'm sure
Watchers of content and you know we read
all the news average consumers I mean to
me it doesn't seem like there that
Maddie you're mad but you know you're a
very special guy I'm an angry guy you're
very unique it seems like TV is better
than ever i mean i watch i can't i don't
think i can count how many shows i DVR
now because there's so much good stuff
on I agree and I mean really good this
is the Golden Age of TV yes I mean it's
chosen for walk Empire these like is
that like watching a 12 hour right now
well you want two million dog down talk
incredible content great great comedy
great news well some okay news not
great okay those questions I was
actually thinking if I was actually the
day it's the Golden Age of TV drama yeah
well drama and I think there's some
decent sitcoms and you know but the
point is the average can spend and also
TV looks better than it has ever looked
before there is there are more channels
than ever do consumer our consumers
actually I know we talked about cord
cutters and that's a thing and I think
you talked to Ari Emanuel and he he said
there aren't cord cutters and you use no
but here's here's that if I could just
anticipate what I think you should go
where I think I think there are cord
cutters here's one I think there are
fewer of them then we might have
expected for five years ago because
because the cable companies have been
good at holding on to what they have
yeah they've been good at holding on to
it and I think this whole rights world
Danny was talking about has hurt the
efforts to do better more integrated
over the top services that make the TV
more attractive and easier to use and
all that kind of stuff but I think
there's something that this is what I
was talking to Ari Emanuel about or
trying to talk to him about which was
you guys know who are Emmanuel is right
he's like this Ari Gold travante he's
already gold it's the super agent in
Hollywood and and we had him at our
conference and Josh asked him a good
question but yelled at Josh since the
mainstream question its various very
upsetting but anyway the point is
horrific point is there's something
called cable Nevers right and this is
the most dangerous thing if I'm Brian
Roberts Brian Roberts that being the
head of Comcast's I have two sons who
were once married ones not there they're
both around thirty once 30 three ones
three so the my youngest son would go
without food before he wouldn't have
internet right he has to have internet
but he would never go without anything
to buy a cable subscription he doesn't
have a cable isn't it cute she never
would and he never will my oldest son he
was married has a very watched basic he
has a very basic cable subscription
they're trying to save up to buy a house
which as you know is difficult next a
fan of live in Boston it's a expensive
market I he hasn't said this to me but
if I had to guess if they had to cut
stuff back
to afford the house the cable would be
one of the first games that would go
because they both have you know iPads
and and smartphones and good laptops I
think one year for their birthdays I got
them Apple TV's not an expensive a gift
right so they have that only expensive
take a watch hulu plus for what is the
same place a month so you must this must
be music to your ears are you loving
this so after this your this is your
audience hi guys who don't get I don't
know the numbers I me and II might i'd
love to hear it I don't know the numbers
but there are these people that are
cable Nevers there is in there it's it's
I think it's even worse than that
because we did a long thread in our
forums of how do you watch TV we did
this week of TV stories we said how do
you watch TV we asked readers not one
person answered I just have a cable box
right but not one person says it's the
burj audience but that's fine but the so
hard if of people dia are the world
audiences is carrying this industry
forward right what notes are in Ohio
Illinois the answer that and that is my
question yeah the answer there you
pulling all kinds of personal data for
me see what you're doing uh oh hi only
knows where my wife is from it's a
smaller it's 450 people you know they
don't have cable right they they can't
have cable because look at the pipes are
know the answer you might have a
satellite to pay nothing for because
they want to get national channels but
as soon as they get the internet there
on the internet I'm just not sure saying
the cable industry can't say this is the
one thing you need to get content right
Apple can say that with the iPad because
when you load it up with apps and two
people it's I've and I don't watch TV I
use my iPad and all the apps on the iPad
qualify is one product right or if
you're a virgin or you say in our forums
I have 50 boxes under my TV and the most
important one of them is not the cable
box and they will argue whether it's the
roku box to use netflix on or the apple
TV box they buy movies on but they will
never say my most important box is my
cable DVR well she's also forgotten
something else that's really important
and when that's airplay yeah and there
may be a generic term for it I'm not
sure what
is what it's called there's a bunch of
America I understand why so do wireless
beaming from other devices sure so
having apples is the most evolved and
probably the most used airplay but it
prop might be exceeded by this time next
year bites that melts miracast is the
industry standard to do the same thing
and you guys probably all know what
we're talking about you're sitting there
with your smart phone or your iPad or or
that macbook air you have right there
and it's just a little button you hit it
and boom whatever's on your screen it
could be internal to the app or the
program if they built that in if that's
allowed or multi I think you guys have
that right you don't have that air play
button on your iOS app right they're not
allowed because you're not allowed to be
you're not some of your community don't
like them on the screen not a big screen
a little plus you can do it yeah for
rule applies always say if you tell me
that you do have an air below on living
room boxes as well so I oky right so the
point is either the button is in the app
in the scrubber barn you know in the
control bar in the app or in now in the
mac it's just mirror and the end the
ipad it mirrors the whole screen so if
you happen to be watching something
where they really didn't want you to put
it on the TV screen where if you plugged
it in with an hdmi cable right not work
you can just make it fullscreen it's
great it is that button it's always in
the menu bar and there it is yeah and
you haven't had to string a wire you
haven't had to get out off your chair
and plug anything in you haven't had to
dedicate a computer but people aren't
there's only a few million Apple TV's
most people but Samsung has the same
thing you know there's wide eye which is
an in was an Intel thing that toshiba
and some others having their machines
the problem there is getting a standard
and getting a brand that people
understand but it's coming well the
applet play if I to guess and it would
be a pure guess and admitted tell me if
you think I'm nuts there's been a big
expansion the sale of those Apple TV's
it's still a small business forum but i
think it's doubled or more than doubled
I think airplay is responsible for a lot
of that they even if you're not watching
the content on the thing you're sitting
there with another screen
and now you can just beam it to the TV
well but it doesn't you know airplay
doesn't solve all the confusion about
it's just another it is another is
another reason why I don't need the
cable what the cable isn't like
essential right and I think that that
cord Nevers combined with the even the
people who buy the cable thinking to
themselves this is secondary to what I
see on the internet or I get distributed
online that is the biggest danger if the
cable industry and I think that's why
they're gonna be pushed to make but
luckily do you love me that you see more
kind of like deal flow because they know
I mean that would be well I guess I'd
say I think the cable satellite telco
are having to pay more close attention
to consumers than ever before and that's
a good thing I mean they're you eyes are
slowly getting better too slow but
slowly they're better if you if you look
three or four years ago they're wildly
better it's still not enough I think I
think they're worried about that and I
think they're they know they're gonna
have to do some repackaging but they
look at multi-channel subs and they've
hung in around 100 million homes and it
wavers a little bit but it hasn't hasn't
dropped so they're all looking at the
cord Nevers they're all doing a bunch of
research but so far it hasn't hit the
bottom line and I don't think they're
going to anticipate that and start doing
things differently so i think it's going
to be slow it's also lucky that they
happen to control the internet service
where they also have their television
service so in worst case scenario they
lose that they can fly they got a
horrible were stationary they're still
gonna Pam we're all gonna pay more for
broadband right now that's that's the
thing and that actually brings me to
something I wanted to talk about and
then we're gonna do we'll get probably
to a quick Q&amp;amp;A with you guys but 4k TV
is everywhere at this show everybody's
talking about 4k television why you
laughing I'm laughing cuz like we have a
bet and i think i think i'm right i
think you're wrong Betty four thousand
dollars six dollars 4k TVs everywhere
what's this bed I want to know if I can
get in it oh yeah my vet is uh within
three years 4k TVs will be a main street
it'll be the thing the high-end product
best buy that most people want to buy
three years and you are saying I think
it's gonna be a little bit longer than
that I'm on your side I think that we're
not even so I talked to the CEO Sony
cause her eye and he said well we got
him we have to figure out how we get the
stuff on the tvs
the industry needs to come together on a
standard maybe we'll do this maybe we
won't right now they're sending servers
to people preloaded with content because
the files are so huge you can't stream
them you can't put them on a disk and
there's nothing to play them on anyhow
so I think we're sorry as if you go to
the Sony with my favorite products es in
the sunny booth it's such a gadget nerd
it's a non functional prototype of a 4k
player which means it's literally a
circle with a light in it and like my
inner gadget nerd is like that's awesome
it's a day doesn't know any meaning any
guts or doesn't yeah yeah there's I saw
behind it there's a PC behind it's
actually doing this so so okay but so 4k
everybody's pushing and I don't know
there is a part of me that feels just a
little bit we've been burned by things
before like 3d we actually wrote writer
of ours Vlad saw before an article it
said it's official 3d is dead i think
this CS proves that 3ds and not an issue
anymore that nobody cares that bother
you that the focus on 3d is gone because
and the light show has some faint 3d
capabilities yeah well we're not relying
on stereo displays for 3d because we
have 3d content that it can be expressed
in different ways like perspective shift
and you know this 4k discussion is
interesting because you know when hdtvs
came out and started to become
mainstream how many people were actually
watching HD content most people thought
it was HD you know was it it was what it
probably wasn't your website but which
site had the retina vs ipad 2 comparison
and they walked into the apple store and
show people out the the oh my we mighta
check out this retina display / and
everyone said wow it's so much better
and you know that's kind of that could
happen with 4k TVs I mean it took so
long for content to make 2k or 4k HD and
trying to take a lot longer this is and
this is what i was getting is that every
time at 4k and then the president of
sony says we don't know how you're going
to get it what we want to do we're gonna
be the first guys to do it but you know
we have to figure it out in the industry
has to figure it out but I think it's
difficult to invest in 4k content and 4k
distribution when there's no 4k
televisions big chicken's name and
what's been right but I think know this
but what's blu-ray what's what's what's
blu-ray an equivalent it steady you mean
the resolution yes what steady touch 1k
rights to gay rights they call to get
right all right so the only effective
delivery mechanism for that video today
is a blu-ray disc way I how well the
house for habitation yeah BB has 3 Xbox
all of you know they all do 1080 they do
10 e but not as heavy as what's on a
blu-ray I mean it's not as good it's
really it's digitally compressed with
the resolutions I'll tell you what I
think I think there will be big changes
until we've been talking about some
changes in television habits video let's
call it video viewing habits I'm not
even sure the word television is gonna
last another twenty years video viewing
habits from whatever source I think
making the TV the hardware the software
better and different and more smoothly
integrate just just so I don't have to
change inputs yeah between being able to
watch hulu plus and being and watch CBS
right or Boardwalk Empire something on
through cable if I do have cable I mean
those things are going to be much bigger
deals in the next three years if people
will lose resolution at that that's
right oh that's right i mean doing on
your pages they do it you know what you
just said is really really important we
haven't talked about it but we all know
or i think a lot of people know that one
of the trends that it's not too evident
here maybe it is and I just haven't seen
it I think a niche trend this year is
there's a push to do much more expensive
audio you know I basically iPods there
much there are seven hundred dollars
right and you know the Neil Young
project and there's another one a chabad
we could the point is these people are
audio files or they're recording artists
and they really feel like they're
specialists they really feel like the
world decided just as you just said to
go for a better interface and more
convenience and give up quality on the
music right and they did and it was
hugely successful i mean steve jobs at
one of his appearances at my car
a conference said he thought it was it
amazed him that people were willing to
give up on the quality of the music to
get the ability to put in your pocket no
sir this goes so it's a little bit to
action so if you I don't care what
company it is on care if it's google I
care if it's Intel and care for example
aren't careful it's a company we have a
named is able somehow to get some rights
deals done enough to make some amount of
critical mass and do a TV that is just
really different than other TVs in it's
the way you use it the fact that you
have to switch inputs whatever all that
that will be I I'm saying I think that
would be more important over the next
three years then adding doubling the
resolution of blu-rays so right for kids
well that's what I think so here's my TV
is changing but what we're seeing out
there just you know more resolution with
so good beers biggest arguments that I
don't think I think as people by the 4k
I think you if it's a chicken and egg
problem but one of them is actually more
important than the other and I think
having the sets in people's homes is
what creates demand for the content and
I think the broadcaster's the cable
company they're not set up to deliver
this content so as people get the
televisions which the curve of those
prices is going to plummet right so as
people get the 4k televisions they will
create demand for the content and the
online services that can provide that
content faster than the cable companies
will begin to seriously challenge cable
well this is where it's going and that
will dry your brother this is where i
was at which we end casa ride this is
where i was actually going with this
said we wanted to drive and you were
talking about we wanted to drive the
expansion of broadband because we think
digital delivery is ultimately where the
4k content comes from and so you've got
these samsung sony LG Panasonic
everybody right all of those companies
are doing 4k this year right and they're
all saying this is where television is
headed and as a result you know what's
going to happen is we have to find some
in other countries Asia and Europe have
different broadband problems than we
have here
America but it has to drive up the pipe
right you ever have a fatter pipe to get
this stuff and then does that create I
guess where i was going is does that
create an opportunity to completely
disrupt the industry that we have now
because if the cable companies aren't
there to meet it and it ends up that
hulu is there you know is that is there
a little bit to 4k TV yeah I imagine
that those photos look even more
beautiful and you have to you got to
make a device that can take photos that
can utilize what that wouldn't be hard
for you probably to make a 4k device
yeah it's I mean it'll get up scaled and
arch what a 4k light for a big just show
me what it'd be like if it has to be
actually physically larger it doesn't
just need to work more raised or pixels
in the underlying sensor and they can be
more densely packed along as you do that
right now we could do it it's a cost
issue how expensive would it be a fork a
white robe output full output in video
yeah no no 4k still you're more capable
Park it really Spencer it be tens of
thousands of dollars you know in the
hyatt just me again a few more thousand
pixels a few months cousin I'll be
perfect what was it ten dollars a pixel
what is it down what is it better light
sound so cheap the weight disadvantages
you order start paying your employees in
in pixels yes they're worth more that
would be very affordable yeah there I
don't think so all right maybe not are
not easy okay let people who have been
throwing away pixels forever right they
throw them well you take a 20 megapixel
thing and you look at it on this 1080
well that yet let should I say they
don't care it like to walk don't wear
and it looks better when it goes for
okay because the display is around the
same size and the pixels are much more
dense but it just it or not that's what
it is that's what that's why I started
buying netbooks a few years ago member
the netbook right but I mean what if you
want to make this all the way back to
apple and all the phones were seeing
here people want they want the pixels
back I mean Apple drove two huge
adoption curves by saying the screen is
better why every phone here is live
inches intending most people will wait
until the back but they'll wait until a
lot of plenty of people they sold a ton
of pre Retina screen yeah and then the
next the next thing that
could advertise around and it was an
engineering achievement I'm taking away
from but was the retina screen it wasn't
like there was a huge antennas had
already bought the non-retina runs they
just went and bought it's why the throw
money or whatever throwing money away
what does even but you know if you I
mean if you look at the retina MacBook
like that is to me that is the silliest
product I don't want it there I think my
screen has enough pixels and I used them
in a different way when I look at my
ipad I'm assuming the continent want to
be very beautiful like you want them but
that you don't necessarily think you
need them if you have if you'd like to
save an extra hundred bucks it doesn't
feel like that big of a deal to go get
the ipad 2 instead of the new what is it
the fourth generation for a lot of
people and I suspect I don't know the
sales numbers they don't share those
exact numbers but I bet they sold a lot
of ipad tues just the way that's the way
they sold a lot of ipad mini's which has
the same resolution just the way Vietnam
adjust the way or just the itunes
centerfield quality mp3's and people are
taking a lot of lower quality pictures
in watching compressed this Idol has
gotten extremely do I look at your
breath it's not that no I think what it
is is that over to them I I think
what we're going to just a second but I
do think that the average consumer the
people aren't specialist they would just
want the contact lee it's not the stuff
if I'm a Philistine I'm a full steam but
I'm happy to watch hulu plus on the ipad
mini i'm happy to watch it it looks fine
it's great to me sometimes I you know I
say or or the galaxy the nexus 7 it
doesn't you know I say to myself I'm
holding this thing and and this really
looks like good video now I know that on
the on the bigger everyone with the
retina it looks better and I have that
one but I grab the mini makoor the the
nexus 7 because it's just a little
lighter and lose market area around
right all right I'm happy to watch hulu
on it you know I want to do we only have
a few minutes I want to do some some Q&amp;amp;A
for for the panel here if you've got a
question any question that i'll raise
your hand and someone will find you with
a microphone someone has to focus us got
ya couple here bro yes someone got a
all over the place there I think we'll
get to you guys in a second I think in
the Russian runners kind of flow yeah
there's someone up the gentleman over
here in the blue shirt and you've got
somebody over there so let's whoever
gets to somebody first with a microphone
yes sorry we'll try to get you guys
hello he started to drift a little bit
for the topic which was the future
revisited so we did we got mine off we
might have we might have digressed I
wanted to revisit the topic of the
future revisited and get to the overall
trend that I heard a couple of times
before I panels with the user interface
revolution and the convertible idea that
there's a collapsing of the gadgets into
one convertible tablet like thing whilst
 you said no but what about that
what about like is that really a big
deal question what's the question wait
what about the user interfaces what
about the future of how that's going to
impact the industry well yeah I need
software is software and user interfaces
are increasingly important because you
touch everything now I mean my this is
my pin I think about don't you think
we're beginning to see I think we went
from obviously from doss to GUI and then
I think the importance of multi-touch
regardless of who has the patents and
who invented it's kind of boring but
importance of it so I hope I its kind of
Duke yet sorry don't get too many
patents right now we'll be here all day
you know the direct manipulation
multi-touch yeah and now we have gesture
and perceptual and things that are
controlled by eye tracking so yeah and
that's and that's the next way that's a
huge win but we have started on the next
wave of user interface and that's hugely
important I mean obviously if you only
have a screen you better be sure you
better be damn sure that you know how to
get somebody to use that thing because
you can do whatever you want with it
it's not like hey I'm constrained by a
qwerty keyboard and you can only do so
many things with the qwerty keyboard
this is you know user interface is
massively important but you know we're
just at the beginning of it you look at
the user
interface of the ipad that is
essentially the same i would say vastly
unchanged from the original iphone which
was six or seven six hours old let me
ask you this and i think this is this
goes to what both of these guys to the
user interface the ipad is nothing right
it's a almost a completely blank slate
apple provides you with some like lazy
way to get a lot of time and money on
that nothing well sure but what they
really provide it was a great touch
layer you build your own interface that
is optimized for content discovery that
has nothing to do with it what apple
provides you will do on interface for
viewing interactive photos it kind of
has a thing to do it it provides I think
the best absolutely on iOS right now are
googles apps which don't look anything
like without but at a high level yeah
but that interface is changing rapid but
at a high level you've got to have that
you you have to have the basic it's
still touch the UI has to be there but
that's all that's yeah we started in a
blank slate still understand berries
convey understand so Google so Google
Maps and I agree with you I mean I
actually think the new Google i/os maps
and soda the people at Google has left
ahead now in you I Walt and I were in a
car last update are you Siri to get to
the next hotel Siri completely failed
out and we both said you are that might
have been the network here but you're
right you're absolutely right look let
the put put what's cool about the google
maps thing it swipes you know it this
wipes up the swipes over to turn on
traffic those kinds of gestures or
android innovations by the way there's
andhra those are android whatever tears
their touch gesture innovations and i
think i don't know for sure but i mean i
think he was talking about the future is
really i think kind of this perceptual
natural gesture recognition stuff and
it's around it's around the floor you'll
let me ask this um you've got a product
that not when people get a light rail
not only do they have to understand how
to use it they have to understand what
is going on because unless you kind of
know what's going on you can't get the
most out of it so when you design the
interface for the tablet for touch
versus the interface for desktop how do
you kind of how do you teach the user
what's going on because that's your you
have the biggest interface challenge of
all it and your interface is extremely
vague and
is it should try to use what it's
there's a bunch of hidden menus it I'm
not saying it's bad yeah it was offense
in touch because in touch you know you
touch something that's blurry and it
refocuses and you dragged around in the
perspective changes and in fact you can
just tilt the device and the
accelerometer will trigger the
perspective shift to move as well so
there we're starting to see some ways to
get passive interactivity in light field
which is something we always thought
about but with a computer is just the
tools the the standard interfaces aren't
there and so if you can just move the
device and the picture changes then
suddenly its interactive without you
having to actually do anything let's try
to get there's a think something has a
microphone did we take the microphone
away all right okay and by the way I do
think we talked about the future right I
just want to say that what we were
talking about we kind of veered into the
future of content and content delivery
but that was just a quick just a quick
easy question about 3d how can you say
it's dead or gone if there's like 30
movies coming out some of the biggest
movies out were 3d this reason I think
it'll be a difficult animal to kill here
China 3ds multiple you know it's it's on
the ground I think I mean I just don't
think that people I just on the ground I
just think I think it's been it's been
wrestled to the ground yeah you've got a
death love ya happen I what I here's
what I think I think 3d was a gimmick
for the most part I think in the living
room it is I consider to be a complete
failure do you know anybody who sits in
their house with glass on there's one
person right there I don't want somebody
you want have microphones anybody here
stated their living room and watch 3d
there's one person ok TV so like 3 and 0
you show that you were okay Benny the
theater on the theater I think in the
theater it'll still be uh there will be
the right movies I want to come in his
defense I think he was talking about
televisions in your home yeah I was
talking about home the home 3d movement
that we've been pushed I've covered
Sony's keynote for what five years I've
had to wear 3d glasses for for Vienna
it's true we have pictures him in 3d
glass from any key I mean Howard
Stringer wandered around stage looking
lost in 3d glasses for like an hour so
what will happen when you're on and it's
it's just over i mean it's and I think
you'll see fewer and fewer films
actually I think that you know if you
look at how much content
coming out they're really going to zero
in on the avatars the spectacles right
and those are going to battle drive box
office right don't want to go to the
theater to get the 3d experience
actually a couple of years ago and I
think you were you're there and maybe
some some of the rest of you okay said
we had James Cameron at our conference
who arguably was that you know it's done
the best job with it he predicted
there'd be a whole bunch of crap movies
in 3d that would do it badly and it
would eventually we said James Cameron
yeah yeah no he did it by the way genius
guy's a genius but he was right yeah
yeah you had a bunch of horror movies
chain texas chainsaw massacre 3d maybe
that was successful so but but but we
don't work I'm certainly not in any
don't know anything about theatrical
stuff and that's a different category
but it's certainly true that the show
was full of 3d TVs and I really it's not
now yeah not I just think I saw one 3d
TV here Vizio has a totally glasses-free
it's got this crazy Dolby technology it
looks really cool and they're like it's
three years out I think I think my her
original headline for that story was 3d
one 3d is dead because every TV can do
every teeth price every buddies TV here
can is capable of 3d because they could
build it in cheaply enough but nobody is
really no or making content for it
if somebody else I think we could
probably get one more question in we've
got this gentleman here which he had his
head up a while ago you give the mic is
coming over oh hi George theres the mic
here we go all right okay basically i
happen to be a professional inventor
I've been vetted stuff for Hollywood the
thrust for the you know the 4k and the
8k and the 16 and the zillion k is that
they had to throw stuff on a very large
screen 60 feet 30 feet and so on and
they're trying to replace the film film
has a wonderful quality and very good
resolution and the digital stuff was
barely coming up and so on there's a
there's a phrase in inventing it's good
enough as best is there sorry I mean a
rush along where all the time anyway
question so this all came out of the
theatrical stuff and then his kind of
bumped itself down into the normal house
that's not a question it's not a
question it's just a it's a good point
but but but not a question you Justin
flex at the end it sounds like that they
ran up a little bit towards a question
thank you thank you I you know I we have
30 seconds what you want to try to get
one for it in 30 seconds or yeah if
anybody is it she's got it okay you
found somebody whose any just give that
might any human here even if they don't
have their head up I think all these
people are very um so with the
advent of context awareness and a lot of
the sensors that aren't being utilized
right now for instance samsung it has
the barometric center and that kind of
stuff how soon do you think that you'll
see those things come to light in the
future and consumers actually start to
adopt those kinds of things yeah I think
that just and we're gonna have to end it
here but I next few years it be an
explosion they already are right the
Fitbit in the Nike FuelBand consumers
for whatever reason they want to know
what's going on with their bodies with
data and the more unit in your future is
integrated thank you welcome welcome has
an initiative to create the tricorder
they're actually trying to give somebody
millions of dollars to build a react are
truck tracks I think sensors are huge
and and you know you use them you all
use them every day that you don't even
you're not even during think about them
in your phones and those there's the
first group that came out now work on
them in the second wave of sensors and
will
in the third wave maybe in another year
or two yeah so they're huge
unfortunately we gotta wrap up I want to
thank the panel thank you guys so money
rest and thank you for joining us
