gutted about the whole thing that I
decided I would commandeer the whole
introduction just cheap dump right in
get Rudy to get rid of Chris dan dan
pasta they're all gone it's just me
speaking of the introduction actually if
you ever thought about who we r doing it
for because I have I spent a lot of time
thinking about it and I realized nobody
actually comes to our show without
knowing what they're coming in and
getting themselves in for so I'm never
going to introduce it you guys know what
this is hello guys welcome to The Verge
malchow episode 18 weaker cetera 24 I
have less have oh i'm dan seifert hey
there's somebody else you thought about
me hey how's it going and dieter bohn
dieter bohn is joining us via a phone
which is really fitting it's been much
mobile showing our videos so diese which
blackberry using today yeah i'm not
using the blackberry dev alpha be
because i'm not a developer i guess so i
don't have one i don't own a single
blackberry anymore actually which is sad
but also not sighs oh it's sad but it's
also entirely on not having well i mean
the thing is I only I'm resetting its
library so as you guys might notice that
Chris is not with us right now hopefully
he'll be able to join us in a little bit
but we're going to plow ahead with just
the three of us for now so well I mean
the truth is we don't really like this
and you never have yeah speak for
yourself the your vendetta chris is like
a whole thing
squad show and but but that's actually
all taken out there are three of us just
afraid of us sitting number and we'll
get it we'll get onto that because room
was really bullish about having a real
shot at number three which is down was
saying just before the show is we're
gonna take it all the way guys all the
way to number three so rim high
aspirations high ambitions are you
platform ah but we know who's number one
I'll do with me oh we know who shares
the number one spot and a sample with
the iphone and I'm actually surprised
we've been talking about the iphone 5 so
long I should surprise that you only
just want to say oh this past weekend
and it feels like forever the initial
sales would be yeah it has been breaking
records as usual we've had a chance to
review it some of you guys have had a
chance so should play with and users
I've only have only seen it really and
play with that mock up wit good eye
candy for so I'll let you guys take it
away I mean then how do you feel about
the iphone 5 uh well you know like you
said it feels like it's been around
forever I mean it just it I've had mine
less than a week and it feels like an
old friend because I knew about it for
so long for before it actually hit the
market but you know it's exactly what we
kind of expected it to be if you didn't
catch our iPhone review iPhone 5 review
that went up last week definitely check
it out but it's largely the same
experience as the iphone 4s except
everything is faster the processor is
much faster you've got LTE data which is
much faster and you've got you know
slightly thinner slightly lighter body
with a bigger screen but it's still an
iphone it's still you know is iOS so
your experience hasn't changed to
dramatically if you're coming from an
earlier iPhone model epcot from yo Matt
right awesome at man yeah I just want to
you know in addition to the the iphone 5
agree we also got a an iOS 6 review that
the damn worked on and I contributed to
a bit and basically iOS is as iOS as iOS
has ever been it is it is iOS it's the
same and like we we talked about this
last week and you know my piece would
think this that's very very iterative
and I mean to be very clear like it's
super fast I didn't think that the
iphone 4 was slow but iphone 4s was slow
but the iphone 4 definitely was chugging
and so the iphone 5 feels much much
faster and voice quality for calls is
better at least i think so i'm talking
to you on one right now and i'm actually
relatively happy with the battery life i
had mine run the gamut yesterday from
630am and it finally conked out i want
to say around eight thirty and that was
with moderate to heavy ation at least a
full hour of phone calls so like I would
like that to be better but it's
definitely on par or slightly better
than the LTE android phones that i've
used and that's particularly remarkable
to me because i'm pretty sure this
thing's got like like fourteen hundred
milliamps in it for the battery right
yeah you know I'm actually not sure
exactly what the capacity of the battery
inside of it is but it is it's very
light and it's very thin which indicates
that oh my producers are saying it's
actually 2100 which actually sounds very
high considering how light in hell that
it is if you compare it to other devices
that have those size batteries they tend
to be a bit thicker or heavier but like
as you were saying with this is bad well
they as you're saying with the speed you
know I I was coming from an iphone 4s
and I like you said I never felt like
the iphone 4s was slow but moving from
the 4 s to the 5 the speed jump is like
so dramatic to me even coming from
Apple's previously fastest version of
the iphone it's almost like you're jump
from like the 3g to the for that that
big of a speed jump to me and it I was
actually kind of kind of impressed I
didn't expect it to be that big of a
difference so the battery is super in
centerville 5.31 1430 no that's iphone
4s I 3.8 Bowl 5.45 uh wat our 1440 okay
am so that's actually pretty small for
an LTE device Mary yeah everybody in
chatham losing her mind that we didn't
have this number of different out hey
guys I'm on the phone you can you break
I think I just got a bunch of tweets
about it too anyway it's ridiculously
small and ridiculously fast so this this
new processor so it's a sex is a
apparently incredibly power efficient
and fast right I would expect it to be
yes actually from the things that will
Apple disclosed about the a6 processor
and of an antec fame I included that is
actually running an a 15 cortex 18
processor which is super exciting
because i have had one of those yet and
what's going to be the next big jump i
think i think what's an efficiency
that's actually changed i don't think
it's an a 15 it's no no I know oh no um
I was booting up to that I was putting
up to embarrassing my good friend Anna
yeah shame for me but but yeah so he's
initial conclusion was that it has to be
quoted safety because of the properties
that I've always disclosing because of
the battery life that Apple is disclosed
etc whereas on further review and I'm
found that it's actually a mixture of
cortex a9 quota safety net is Apple's so
to speak fully custom chip fully custom
apple design and so it isn't a stock arm
chip whereas previously I mean Apple has
been saying ever since its branded its
process is a whatever a 585 X etc and
now a sixth it has been saying that it's
designing a cell processes but it was
mostly sticking to templates from what I
know um template maybe just doing a few
tweaks and optimizations here is there
where is now apples at a time it took
over that company whose name I don't
recall any more chip design company said
time to integrate it welcome it and is
producing these really extremely fish
and chips like it like you're saying
tita which you know is good a no and the
bigger display is absolutely making the
iphone catch up with the four-inch i
know there's a golden ratio so it gets
recorded the golden form factor as far
as I'm concerned you know what 4.3
inches and so Apple is catching up on
that front physically and the display is
now even thinner making for the thinner
phone overall but ultimately you know
apart from this little tug that I had
when the hype was at his highest and
when we're building up to the launch in
the release I don't feel at all
compelled to buy this new iphone like it
makes changes which are in the right
direction but I don't feel like it's
pushing me the same way that the iphone
4 but it was first announced in the
first launched just push me a fourth 32
byte essentially it was like such a big
jump but Andy but then you guys are
saying that the user experiences in to
prove so much so maybe maybe that the
thing that might convince me but but
seriously above the maps issue I saw the
maps on on Iowa 6 on the iPad and they
look good and actually quick in terms of
operation I think that they're quicker
than google maps which you know is that
is down to the way they're coded but the
problem with them is that they actually
suck in terms of just being maps so what
was the experience been dead I've had a
couple of crashes and freezes but
nothing worse than google maps and I
mean I mean I live in San Francisco and
so this whole issue that Apple's maps
aren't as good as Google's Maps just in
terms of the raw map data for me the
pain point is losing transit but in
terms of you know street
I mean you know apples in California and
but they're getting they've got lots and
lots of data from my area so like it's
not a huge tragedy for me although not
having transit really really sucks I
think it's a bigger deal outside the US
and in rural areas but there's a lot of
places where the math data just isn't up
to snuff and you know we've got some
reports on this Chris had a report up
that there was still a year left on the
the Google Maps agreement between Google
and Apple and Apple decided you know not
not to wait it out to just you know put
their app out there and apparently it
took Google by surprise which is which
is itself kind of surprising but
nevertheless there their new app for iOS
isn't isn't ready yet because of that
and you know there's been a lot of
complaints about the maps and I think
it's I mean here's my take when Google
Maps first launched on you know
smartphones way back in the day that you
know the Java version it was unless and
you know the other day of the version
that they had out there it wasn't that
great it took him a long time to build
up that crowd-sourced data and when i've
been using mapping products you know way
back to the day tomtom way back there
was another one copilot they have been
mapping and all these different mapping
services back then it wasn't okay they
were they were not that good but we
dealt with it the problem now is that
like the expectation is there that when
you launch maps they need to be really
good and it's just really hard to do
that without years and years of data
okies got that time at Google's had that
time so these other companies also have
that time but you know Apple hasn't
despite the fact that its partner data
brought a bunch of math data and so you
know for a generation one first release
smartphone Maps product I think it's
quite good um you know flyovers pretty
but useless but you know I think it's
fast I think it's quite good uh the
problem is quite good doesn't cut it
anymore compared to the competition
right right now absolutely I think
that's actually um the thing that has
turned the mapping
me scandal I mean actually it's not a
scandal a lot of people are annoyed with
it because they're not getting same
functionality but most people were
actually just making really kind of poor
jokes about it and just having a big
laugh and I think what surprised most
people even you know those not tracking
the industry as closely as closely as we
do is that it's a really really stark
example of Apple playing catch up to
others usually when I was trying to
catch up to others it does is behind the
scenes and just comes out with finished
product you're like well there goes
Apple Apple is doing the unique the
amazing etc etc it's not in the other
guys whereas in this instance exactly as
it says this is just version one is to
start over apples mapping products and
it has really really obvious rough edges
which were not used to see from apple
and speak in a rough edges is a kick-ass
segue the aluminium on the iphone has
been chipping away if you guys had that
so yeah this mine has not a chip but a
cleared up scuff mark and it had it
right out of the box and I'm I'm frankly
surprised by this because we know that
it's possible to make aluminum that is
very hard to scratch and get the shiny
partner leaves we know because HTC did
it with the 1s and yes the 1s cancel it
scratches but it seems like the the
iphone it's much simpler to do and show
the shiny part underneath well I think
the in the case of the 1s that is a very
unique treatment to that particular
device that is like not anodization it's
not electroplating it's like or maybe it
is a form of electroplating but it's a
it's a very intensive type of coating
that that happens to that and you know I
there were reports of that shipping as
well especially right when the the phone
first came out and it's quite apparent
that that none of that treatment has
been applied to the iphone 5 it this
seems like a standard anodization type
of coating on top of it which frankly
you know when you put other pieces of
metal against it it will scratch
kind of easily I think the the real
controversy or the uproar is that people
like you said dieter are finding it this
way out of the box which is again not
something that you expect to see from
Apple devices apples always been lauded
and is always taken hide regard for its
type quote unboxing experience of
pulling a device out for the first time
and everything is pristine and clean and
perfect and that's just not the case for
some people with the iphone 5 just
respect to the 1s I'm that the name of
that process is being printed in my mind
because I've written and said it so many
times it's micro oxidation oxidation
yeah that is micro as my bath right yeah
the plasma blast that's yeah and
millions and millions of volts of
electricity and all other sorts of
exciting stuff and yeah I mean on the
scrapping if if asked me in a year after
I my phone gotten scratched and dinged
up if I'm angry about it because
assisting get scratched and dinged up
and it looks kind of cool and distressed
yeah then I'm totally happy with like
that's actually like kind of needs a lot
you know give my phone character and
it'll look you know it'll it looks like
the black phone looks like murder now
and have a look like like the stress
burger would actually be really cool
yeah that's like making a little bit
yeah if it's like the little over the
ipod's that scratch like crazy yeah in
scrap yeah it looks like crap after it
scratched then I'll be angry but I you
know I'll just have to wait and see well
if it has one thing going for this is I
mention dish is it I think even if you
got scratched a matte finish won't look
quite like as crappy as the the chrome
finishes at the old ipads ipods head
yeah theory yeah but but also the issue
with apple's iphone design since the
iphone 4 and I've been banging on about
it is that it's kind of too fragile and
it's also tries to be a little bit too
perfect I mean we saw Johnny I've at the
iphone 5 presentation and he was talking
about again this is the most exacting
design where ever done it's the best
product of them yeah yeah yeah but it
but it is true that the design is so
exacting
and it's really trying to go for this
luxury look and appeal and there's also
the glass parts on the back this is the
thing that convinces me that the new
iphone isn't going to look really really
awesome when you scratched up because I
know exactly what details talking about
when you have an aluminum products
whether it be cameras like somebody's
NEX series Oh some of the older
generation smart phones from HT in
particular and a piece of a few scuffs
and scratches it kind of feels like he's
your own or even even like a wristwatch
you know titanium wristwatches people
think titanium is such a harder material
doesn't scratch actually does um I
scratched my titanium watch in a week
later ya know but I have a psychosis in
it watch and actually like it scratches
like kind of like piece of my own this
tells me that I've had this product for
a long time we've been through things
together even if they are just
completely mundane right the reason I
don't think that is going to work with
the iphone 5 design is because of those
glass parts which move in a whole
different design direction they're about
perfection and about you know looking
really pretty as opposed to the
ruggedness of having scratches but
that's only one aspect it's one aspect
and the other thing I wanted to discuss
is actually the front of the phone
sticks to from what I can tell sticks to
the exact same you know one big plate of
glass design which would be so
vulnerable and the iphone 4 and 4s
design and i think that's that's
probably the thing that's putting me off
the most from the new iphone 5 if i
don't think this software um and I think
the mapping issue is something is going
to put me off so a deal-breaker for me
um I don't think things like oh wow this
phone has 1280x720 resolution and the
iphone doesn't have that exact same
resolution those aren't do brakes to be
but I just don't trust that i can use
the FM five in the way to like these
phones and having survived that whole
year that these were talking about like
you just gotta stop dropping your phone
about him to be it yeah you just go I
think I mean I think that the iPhone 5
is a bit more rugged than the for the 4s
I mean I mean yes of course apartments
that doesn't have glass on the back but
it does feel like and maybe just kind of
lighter so it's most likely to crack and
drop it but it does feel like it's less
likely to shatter if I drop it the other
thing that I fix it fell and they did
their teardown is they changed up the
way that the phone is put together and
so you can take the first thing to come
off is that the screen and the display
assembly and so it should be much
simpler to replace displays and you know
cheaper at least for Apple to take take
a broken screen replace with the new
screen you don't have to take the whole
phone apart you can just take the screen
off and pop anyone on it right I think
there was actually some some commotion
that Apple traditionally with the iphone
if you had a broken iphone and you went
to an apple store they just kind of
would take it and replace it with a new
version or a new model entirely and now
i think there was a report saying that
with the iphone 5 the stores are
planning to fix the screen in the store
instead of giving you a whole
replacement so yeah that definitely
should cut costs for Apple at least if
not for for you I was just gonna say
that cheaper for Apple but does that
mean cheaper for the user yeah it
usually doesn't when you get is pretty
straightforward um you know savings and
costs for whatever reason they just
can't seem to trickle down which you
know oh I didn't insist economy you
would think trickle-down economics you
know foundation of her pink good and
holy and all that stuff but anyway i'm
straying into a whole lot of territory
can we can we wrap up this really really
famous and over this class phone by
talking about verizon and the OT
situation yeah so this is like really
interesting it's a familiar story so the
iphone 5 if you buy it from verizon it
has a sim card slot just like the sprint
model and the AT&amp;amp;T model but the sim
card
on the iphone 5 from verizon is actually
unlocked so you can actually put an AT&amp;amp;T
sim card in there and walk around using
it on AT&amp;amp;T hspa+ network which is a bit
of a surprise none of the other LTE
phones at verizon has released are
unlocked in such a fashion if you try to
put an AT&amp;amp;T sim into it it won't work
and so it's been kind of a bit of a
surprise we did see this last year with
the 4s from sprint came with a sim card
slot unlocked out of the box and it was
later on shortly after the release of
the phone it was updated to actually
lock the slot but what's different is
that Verizon saying that they're not
going to lock it in the future their
plan to leave it and keep it unlocked
which started a kind of a snowball of
theories thinking that the FCC's laws on
the 700 megahertz spectrum that Verizon
uses for its LTE network was requiring
verizon to unlock the sim card slot for
everyone but Chris did an excellent
report that kind of debunked that theory
and since the sim card slot that part
that's unlocked to use that allows you
to use the phone on 18 T's met work
isn't doesn't even run on the 700
megahertz spectrum and among other
reasons we kind of debunked that theory
that it's it's just verizon's just doing
it for whatever reason it feels like and
mostly that it probably doesn't feel
that it has a big loss to sell the phone
unlocked instead of being forced by the
SEC I mean why do you think without
doing it then right you know but if I
hang on real quickly what's verizon
motivation at the FCC forcing their hat
if it's not is it is it Apple course in
their hand is it verizon just like
coldly calculating well well I don't
think that I don't think Apple wants to
buy it I don't think app is involved at
all they've okay so surprised and let's
let's just assume that is it because
they're going to have they know the
verizon LTE works better for LTE global
roaming and surviving just like straight
up saying well if somebody really cares
about unlocking or having you know i'm
not gsm then we're gonna go ahead and
offer that to them and not really
advertise it but just have it be out
there no
because that's what their justification
motivation is actually makes me really
angry why because like though they will
lock stuff down for no other reason or
for whatever their reasons are for
walking stuff down like rising always
does but there's one time they're like
oh well we can get a little bit bit of
an edge here so let's just not lock at
this time it's like you know be
consistent yeah well be a jerk being
jerk all the time we tested this with
with verizon's other LTE phones like we
had a razr m and we put an AT&amp;amp;T sim card
slot and it would refuse to work it was
definitely locked and that's a you know
very recent LTE phone from verizon so
why Verizon's doing it with the iphone 5
i really don't have a great answer other
than it just doesn't feel like there's a
big loss for it if it's unlocked I think
that most I have a theory I have a
theory oh hello hey mr. Ziegler's here
I'm so glad he's doing Machiavellian
Chris because I that that's what my
theories uh well as sorry i was i was
off having some really important DM
conversations with the federal
communications commission that's why
plate oh my god but yeah so so iphone 5
unlock so here's my theory i'm actually
going to reject your theory deaton
replace with my own i think what's
happening is verizon realizes that the
iphone 5 is the first c block device
that's high profile enough to catch
attempt to catch the you know the
attention of a mainstream news outlets
which in turn is going to catch the
attention or a het you know be more
likely to catch the attention of the FCC
so i think that they're actually hedging
their bets and saying well you know it
because everyone that I've talked to
like no one seems to be able to agree on
exactly what the rules mean whether only
the c-block support of the device needs
to be unlocked or if the entire phone
needs to be unlocked I think the rules
are intentionally hazy they never been
tested nobody really knows what they
means and we won't know what they mean
until we go through the court system
which we haven't yet i'm sure it's
inevitable at some point is going to
happen
but in the meantime I think that verizon
is just hedging their bets okay well it
certainly is giving verizon a fair
amount of good press because on the
surface it looks like a
consumer-friendly move at least what I'm
sure well yeah I don't see a bunch of
people let me keep in mind that that the
iPhone 5 is one of the very few devices
where the subsidy is greater than the
ETF that's very very rare so or at least
by this margin it's it's rare you know
you get the UM the 399 device and I mean
I actually I guess the the subsidy is
the same across all three models but
anyway so you know you can you can get a
device on contract from verizon
immediately break your contract pay the
etf and then take it to simple mobile
you know or t-mobile and there you go
any tmobile is pushing their iphone you
know support so hard right now it's
hilarious you know they're issuing press
releases on it so you know I think that
Verizon could end up becoming a reliable
and desirable source for these unlock
devices which is absolutely blows my
mind knowing how verizon's been for the
past decade so that's just it's just
like really hard for me to wrap my head
around that although let's just say for
the record we don't agree with dita who
says if you're gonna be a jerk just be
check over the time like if this is the
start of a beautiful new relationship
between verizon its users for whatever
reason that's a good thing and so it's
all consistently trying to derail you
guys from discussing the f of 5 and
verizon but for the sake of our non-us
audience and the sake of our audience
who might be a little bit sick of this
phone by now which i am and i didn't
have to got that thing can we please
talk about HTC's windows phones because
they're kind of sexy yeah we need a
super sexy let's talk I mean we talked
like we didn't really talk about the
molasses week I guess we our show was
just before the announcement so we
didn't really know what was going to
happen
HTC revealed its Windows Phone 8 X and
Windows Phone 8 s last week both of
which look like really attractive
devices that are running the obviously
Windows Phone 8 platform and what might
be the most interesting part about this
story is the new rekindled tight
relationship that HTC and Microsoft have
for these devices so far or to the point
where Microsoft actually picked the name
out for the smartphones and put Windows
Phone right in the name and is calling
these signature devices for the platform
which is a little bit different of a
relationship then HTC has enjoyed with
Microsoft in the past and now Nokia was
you know the the chosen one for for
windows phone for a long time or at
least that's how it seemed and so so
there's a little bit different in a
little bit of a shake-up in the Windows
Phone family I guess you could say you
know just what are we about a month away
from its expected launch did anyone
figure out what a signature device
actually means like what are they saying
with those words well it's going to be
the center of the marketing for windows
phone 8 by Microsoft so if we see marker
Microsoft marketing windows phone 8 like
if we see a printed add you know I would
expect to see these HTC devices front
and center and then you know maybe to
the side you'll see the Nokia maybe two
further to the side you'll see the
samsung's which is kind of e pretty
brave and that's okay yes the atif is
actually going to bring a windows phone
into its own and it's going to become
the dominant form because of the atif
duty vests oh don't forget that how much
nobody actually see the eyes and yet
it's still pretty much like a rendering
a photo out of so at the moment but you
know I actually got to see the 8x today
in fact um because I'm special and HDD
special things like that for me and for
first of all I think we need to separate
the 8x + 8
a little bit the HS is such a mess of
color that I struggle to comprehend it I
think it has like four different color
options and only one of them is
relatively consistent in being reddish
throughout there's the yellow gray and
black version me you guys have seen
these right they kind of I think a
yellow gray and black version is so hot
I think the yellow gray and black is is
of all of the ones for the 8's I think
the yellow gray in black is the winner I
mean it just looks cool yeah nuts your
guys backing out he's not right Alabama
wait wait you're talking about the 8's
right yes damn yes correct a test yeah
the for each one the smaller one the
mid-ranger well that phone is completely
irrelevant so it's all about the 8x I
mean look you know yeah i will say that
that HTC has taken a very very different
um like you know you can look at it two
ways dan i'm thinking back to your
report on you know color and how that's
really playing into Windows Phones angle
but color Assad yes both the the new
HTC's and also of course the nokias are
very colorful if you look beyond that I
think I just think that these are very
different devices alumi 920 in the 8x
because the the 920 is such a thick and
heavy phone uh that's really pushing
camera quality and that's something the
8x is not really seeking to do in as
much thinner and I think sexier um so
yeah well i don't know i don't know if
that's accurate though because HTC's
like big differentiator with its any of
its devices but you know is the the
image sense chip is going to be in the
8x which is the first time for a Windows
Phone device to have the image sense so
I think as far as in HGC size it
definitely is innovating on the image
front obviously you know to the rest of
us it's not doing nearly as much as the
Lumia 920 is but as far as being totally
different devices the the 8x and the 920
look really similar from the front and
if you like turn them on the side it
just looks like the 8x is a flattened
version of the 920 yeah but what uh well
in pictures maybe but I feel like in
person they end up cuddling you have the
opportunity to hold them back to back
they end up being very different phones
I think very much so very much so just
to mention here somebody tweeted the
because when Wendy a days and the EDX
would be in announced tomorrow is the
guy who covered in their whole release
and got to play with him a lot more than
myself over here in London ah my excuse
me that I wasn't in the country
otherwise I would have been it all over
them but so I was a little bit detached
from them but somebody tweeted at me
saying hey Vlad somebody took the 1x or
other HTC took the 1x display and they
shrunk it down to 4.3 inches you must be
you know prune about it you must be
really excited so I was like what I need
to take a look at this freaking windows
phone 8x display and I don't know that
is i I really don't think it's the same
exact technology so 1x it isn't quite so
vibrant doesn't have quite the same
viewing angles but he's really good
space like that I think it's very so to
what we saw on the rezound last year the
resound was a 4.3 inch super lcd2 with
the 720p display I think it might it
might be a little bit a newer version of
that as opposed to the e1 X's displays
shrunken down but so true but I mean I'm
fat I do i do like to display on the EDX
just like Chris i'm also a fan of the
build in the design and i definitely
think that when you get the 912 money in
hand in the 8x in hand you can tell a
big difference and immediately I can
tell you that I prefer the 8x again
because it's smaller because then our
lights etc not say the United 20 is a
bad photo device but it's still a big
bigger and chunky um but HTC is really
shoot using itself in the foot by losing
track of the details with the EDX and
the details of the a legs actually color
and maybe I'm being extremely nitpicky
here but the volume slider
the power button and the camera button
there a sort of orange-ish red whereas
on the red model that is where as the
phone itself is a pinky shade of red and
I re just really like the red version of
this phone um but they just stop
matching all the colors so that bread
version actually has three different
shades of the color the yellow / green
version again has multiple shades of the
color and it's those little things that
just kind of pesterin know you and just
finally to mention on this topic of the
camera HTTR still keeping software lock
down completely like they wouldn't let
me unlock the phone like this there's an
actual passcode lock on the phone but
because of the Windows Phone own camera
functionality you can actually turn on
the camera without unlocking the phone
and take a few photos and look at the
photos and I'm actually impressed by the
EDX just I just took a few quick photos
with it and I'm impressed by his camera
quality I thought that phone is so thin
they would go for a really cheap camera
sensor and it doesn't seem that have
which is you know thumbs up so far
aren't they I just like to point out how
crazy it is that we've had we have five
now windows phone 8 devices to Nokia's
to htcs and Samsung's achieve and
Microsoft like is not like and any of
these fun unveilings you know letting
people see the full story of Windows
Phone 8 no and end the software is know
when you're done because even though
they were locked one of them managed to
crash most butta in the same way I
really don't think I'm supposed to be
saying this but whatever I didn't sign
any embargo she's so silly you guys the
software is not done and it's slow and
everybody down and everybody would just
love to be able to show off their
devices to the fullest but you're gonna
have to wait and if we trust someone
which I do if I had kids or trust
someone with my kids it's basically
gonna happen I think October 28
what's going to happen October you mean
the the unveiling of the platform right
I think we just lost Vlad yeah that's
when we're expecting to see windows
phone 8 debut entirely so that will see
everything that Microsoft has been
essentially holding back from us to this
up to this point if they've been holding
anything back I don't think yeah clear
that they had well I mean I think I
think Microsoft would like us to think
that it's been holding a lot of things
back and that's the reason that it
doesn't want us to see any of the
software yet but you know you have a
good point Chris they could not be they
could they could just be if they're not
holding it from the react then I'm going
to storm Redmond with pitchforks all
tables and Redmond will be flipped if
there's nothing new it's like here it is
the thing that we would let you see for
the past three months what did you guys
know it has screenshots it can do
screenshots well so far so far what does
eight have that 7.8 does not um we know
that it has the the kids feature kids
pune not on the side kids corner office
or something with brooms or something is
that is that eight exclusive or is it oh
I know I know windows phone 8 supports
higher resolution displays in multi-core
processors all right have a 10-point
87.8 is mostly going to be for existing
hardware anyway right so but i mean you
know i'm just saying that liking you
know when these when these platforms
come out presumably they're going to be
differences between the two I suppose if
Microsoft is holding anything back it
would be that that's a pretty big thing
to to you know with Holden that we
haven't seen and we're not clear on yet
what's that differences between 7.88
right yeah well yeah I know this that's
exactly my point yeah right we can
expect some some enterprise stuff that
will only work in a teeny on terms of
device management and other corporate
e-type things you haven't nobody cuz
that's one of the big advantages to
switching to the new ride structure the
colonel right yeah I I heard a rumor I
heard a rumor a few weeks ago from a
very reliable source that Microsoft made
a last minute
to port a bunch of supposedly eight
exclusive features back to 7.8 which I
don't push both yeah which I think
pushed both versions back a bit and and
I was chatting with Tom about and he
said yeah that made a lot of sense so so
it seems like they might be looking to
actually close the gap between 7.8 Nate
I don't know if that's designed to
appease the ten existing owners or okay
I mean you've already taken the bad the
bad press from having it you know having
to confirm that you wouldn't offer an
upgrade path from windows phone 7
Windows 2000 night you've already like
given the fig leaf or the the olive
branch of a few features I mean just
stick to your guns and focus on the new
platform don't spend don't spend your
cycles on 7 and I know that's crazy to
me to say but once you've made the
decision and already taken the hit so
not offering a full upgrade I mean
unless there's something there that
they're back porting that they feel is
essential to the entire ecosystem so
that that all widows song can play
together and have this feature I
wouldn't spend the development cycles on
it right yeah i mean i would agree i
don't i don't know what their business I
mean first of all it's a rumor but
secondly um you know we yeah we don't
know what the business logic is right
so I mean I totally agree with both of
you well you know if that is true then
you know why would you waste time
supporting the older platform on when
you know for all things considered your
your bet is on the new platform and and
all the things that are involved with
that so we have we are stuck in 10 years
on hey blends best what we doing well
with that dieter we got really quick
about Nokia's response to uh you know
HTC announced that it was a little bit
caddy as I recall it was it was very
caddy let me see if I could pull it up
here now the official response was
referred to it as a quote technical
rebranding and then you know a Nokia's
executive Chris Webber posted some
tweets saying that it takes more than
matching colors to match the innovation
of the Lumia 920 and happy to add a new
signature to the windows phone ecosystem
behind the Lumia new 20 or 920 so so
it's you know it's a bit of a caddy back
and forth and I don't think we really
expected nokia to respond in this
fashion I certainly didn't I well but I
mean they are it is a really weird spot
that Microsoft is almost throwing a
whole bunch of love behind HTC after you
know everybody just sort of spotted not
yet the flagship Windows Phone device or
om it you know the difference is like if
a cici's windows phone 8x and 8s and I
still am angry at HTC for calling phones
x and s because I've got to enunciate so
hard to shake them anyway if they say
they bomb out they don't work they still
they can still take you know another
shot in Android I mean lord knows that
they're not going to stop making android
phones but nokia is all in like if in
windows phone doesn't work for nokia
they don't really have a viable plan B
not in not in the short term not for you
know if they might have something skunk
works but they're they're not coming out
with another source file s I highly
doubt that they would go to Android and
and it's interesting the relationship or
this new
promotion behind HTC from Microsoft
because Nokia's put so much more
investment into the Windows Phone
platform between its dedicated apps for
the platform it's you know pretty much
essentially pushed aside every other
smartphone platform in order to push its
weight behind Windows Phone so yeah like
you're saying if windows phone fails
nokia kind of goes down with it at least
from what we can tell now i think that
microsoft owes it to all of its Windows
Phone OEMs I mean these guys need to
really stick together right now they
can't afford to be into you know to have
a civil war and it's microsoft's
responsibility as the as the patron
saint of this platform to kind of keep
the OEMs in line and this behavior that
they're exhibiting with the so called
signature HTC phones is not conducive to
a healthy relationship between these
OEMs obviously and and it's it's very
strange to me that they're doing this i
think that they need to be treating
these OEMs equally and fairly and i
think that that after you know it took
them a long time to try to convince
everybody that that their relationship
with non nokia liam's would not be
damaged by the nokia partnership and
they got over that hump and HTC and
samsung came back to the table with
additional phones and now look what's
happening now HTC is getting this
special treatment and it's very strange
to me because you know to what end like
a customer a customer goes into a store
they're certainly not going to say i
want the signature phone because what
does that mean but then it even worse if
a sales guy to them and says well at
these two devices we have this Lumia 920
and then we have from Nokia and then we
have this HTC phone that's the signature
phone oh that what you know then the the
customers can be like well I don't know
what that means but that sounds
important or good or something I guess
I'll take the HTC it's just bad like
that they should Microsoft should be
should be the Switzerland of this
platform and they're not being that at
all yeah yeah no I feel like this entire
a move to brand the HTC devices
signature devices is superfluous it's
not something that Microsoft needed to
do which together with the move to the
movie you guys were discussing to
at Port features down to Windows Phone 8
7.8 is kind of you can just move on you
know you're big enough your major enough
people will follow you or do you know
burn for the fact that another doing it
I mean HTC still kind of wants to be
split between Android and Windows Phone
and as Dan was saying earlier is now
reemphasize in Windows Phone those
companies in samsung they prefer to have
some sort of a fallback plan if things
don't go perfectly according to plan
with Android so I mean in my only
justification for Microsoft might be to
say that HTC won't have invested so
heavily into designing let's say the
windows phone 8x I'm not going to give
HT that much credit for the siding t8s
so maybe that's what it is microscope in
giving HC that branding and that extra
cachet gets in return more investment
more design time more production time
from HTC basically just gets better
phones I don't know I just feel like
that might have been something Michael
could have just simply paid for given
that has cash reserves and all of that
but also let's go to measure the
Microsoft has a signature series with
Windows laptops and maybe desktops as
well but just windows in general and the
the Signature Series in Windows was just
the bloatware free versions which is
kind of hilarious because that basically
means every Windows Phone device ever
shipped it's pretty much signature
because Microsoft looks down software so
tight so if you have a windows phone
it's a signature Windows Phone you can
tell people that covers gonna know to me
so you can tell him that well I mean
well what what HTC was saying and
Microsoft was saying about the naming of
these devices is as far as what the
signature means I believe Steve Ballmer
might have said this or was an HTC
executive that said when somebody goes
to a store and they want a microsoft
phone or a windows phone you know this
phone has windows phone right in its
name it's pretty obvious what it is
and and I think that was what the idea
behind the naming of these windows phone
8 X and Windows Phone 8 s was well it's
pretty easy to have a parallel to go
ahead dinner I was good they do have to
call it the the windows phone 8x running
windows on the Windows Phone 8 Windows
Phone 8x would it be even less excusing
is the windows phone 8x running Android
that would really blow minds oh my god
thought I should be proud with that
hardware d by cool but what I was just
going to mention is that you know
Microsoft has has already had this
signature program in place on Windows
where if you go into a microsoft store
they sell a number of so-called
signature devices that are stripped
completely free of third-party software
essentially and it's just you know pure
windows instead of all the crap where
that usually get when you when you buy a
new pc and and so you know from that
perspective if you think of it that way
Microsoft is really slapping Nokia in
the face because they're saying well you
know we don't want all your crap we're
on these on these windows phones so
we're going to give a special brand to
these htcs which are basically a
shipping you know quote unquote stock
even though I don't I'm not too
comfortable using the term stock talking
about a Windows Phone device but you
know bay if you think about it like that
you know people draw that parallel that
if they've heard the term signature used
with Windows PCs before then then that's
certainly the impression they're going
to get with these files it correct me if
I'm wrong because I may be like totally
hi but it isn't nokia providing the
mapping services for all of Windows
Phone 8 yes so so essentially it be like
Microsoft we don't want all of your crap
where we'll take some of it but we want
this other stuff that you insist on
putting here but we'll take your Maps
the end and we'll use those and we're
going to give those everybody else as
well well yeah I'm just worries to your
Q point here just two quick point it
first of all Chris somehow managed to
miss the bit where I mentioned in the
signature windows devices and decided to
make that point after me but but key
augmented it with something interesting
about nokia so i guess we just allow
that oh so I'm
I'm a dueto con look flat Vlad I'm I'm
in a talk only mode right now I'm not
listening i'm only time how's that a
different second profile the second
point actually uh i still remember with
microsoft annakut and alcohol
partnership and microsoft's was making
such a huge deal out of all the maps
being integrated into microsoft's just
broad range of mapping services it
wasn't just going to be four it was just
going to be big maps it was going to
become big maps and that's what it's
going right now that nokia's maps is
essentially becoming Microsoft's mapping
software and to me at the time I was
like why don't make it such a big deal
out of something so kind of regular and
commercialize mapping and now that Apple
is trying to do it by itself I can
really see why that was such a big deal
for Microsoft autotech acquiring that
part of Nokia was probably worth it for
Microsoft just to save itself the source
of headaches that Apple is enjoying
right now because if you think apple is
having headaches with maps and just
imagine a company that doesn't have the
same level of customer trust that Apple
has trying to sell them that sort of
service it would just be a nightmare
and and and very good point bud but so
here's clearly what happened back five
six years ago when HTC and Microsoft
were flying as high as a more fluid
windows mobile peter chao acc CEO and
see Ballmer were out partying and Steve
Ballmer like accidentally killed
somebody and only Peter to figure out
the only witness and so rather than
report him he took a chimp and now that
HTC is fallen on hard times and the 13
hasn't done so well he cast that ship in
so that is why they get to call their
phones windows song I'm bomber killing
somebody Steve Ballmer killing somebody
is is a is one of the the storylines and
pulp fiction if i'm not mistaken oh man
got weird really so so long of Silvio's
yeah let's talk about those ten times
and what he had to show us and tell us
at the new blackberry jam or some such a
like just a nice guy I mean compared to
Missouri tussenbaugh silly like he gets
on stage is just what I like just like
took him on the shoulder oh good job man
uh and the other thing that's great
about them is she doesn't lie about what
blackberry is any more like he admits
that they're you know they're not going
to be number one which was you know he
had this Q&amp;amp;A after blackberry 10 was
quasi sort of kind of announced for the
second time but not fully and out where
he said we have a clear shot at number
three and later on he you know he
clarified and said no no I mean we're
aiming for number one long term and
number one in all of mobile computing in
fact even took a swipe at Microsoft like
you don't understand people aren't going
to use pcs phones and tablets we could
be number one or both of us long term
but in the short term is like we're
aiming for numbers for we know for a
verse number one we have a clear shot of
number three and they think they can
pull it off and I don't know so
settlement context but what they
announced which was blackberry 10 and a
new device your developers
well I mean if we want to do that that
was happening but this delay isn't the
problem at all guys don't go ahead
dieter well okay I'll just jump into
riffing on what blackberry 10 is so
we've already seen some of it they
showed it up once and then what they
showed off this time wasn't the whole
thing again but it was like another
iteration and they're in this weird spot
where they've got to keep showing
different parts of it so they can get
developers excited to make apps because
they need out to make the platform
succeed but they don't want to actually
have their full amount so they have
these like half announcements so what we
saw blackberry 10 is we finally know
what like the full you I paradigm looks
like and it's weird like you have up to
eight apps running out of time and
they're always running just like on the
playbook and they sit in these little
things that they're calling active
frames which by the way is the worst
name ever for a UI element and they're
like little miniature versions of the
app and you can you know switch between
those really easily by swiping up on the
screen there's a grid icon on the right
hand side of the home screen swipe over
to those and then on the left hand side
of the home screen and actually in the
left hand side of every single screen is
the same are calling blackberry hub and
what that is is the unified like
messaging and notification zone where
all your emails are your Twitter
messages are there your linkedin
messages you there your facebook
messages are there and it's also like
developers concern notifications in that
area so you can make this swipe up into
the right gesture which it works pretty
well but it's not quite as fluid as it
could be from anywhere in the u.s. to
jump right into your notifications in
your email which is kind of cool it's
kind of clever if you'd like if you use
your phone primarily for messaging it
makes a lot of sense so can I just jump
in here quickly because I was looking at
that and I couldn't possibly avoid
thinking of the nokia n9 and the Mego
Harmison you I uh because that was based
around three central home screens which
were notifications applications and
multitasking
and in particular with rooms blackberry
10 you have four of these active frames
where you preview you I mean it's
essentially visual multitasking they're
previewed the applications that you have
running and and the nokia n9 also has
the same for for rap interface so to me
it was like you're just copying them i
mean i think it's a good thing to copy
but it's like where's innovation room
okay so i want that for me go they
copied from web alas they've copied from
the iphone because you can you know eat
drag-and-drop icon the icon grid just
like the iphones icon grid I think they
steal anything from Android yeah you
swipe down from the top to bring up
menus and stuff I guess that's that's
not android that's more or less again
but like you know unified notifications
they basically just borrowed from
everything they could and talk to the
other no less and so the question is
going to be like will it when you
actually use a day to day will it feel
you know elegant and awesome or will it
just feel kind of cobbled together well
there there are two things to keep in
mind here one is that I'm assuming that
they still have a number of tat
employees working on this UI and aunt at
has done some really great stuff in the
past and and also we heard at some point
I don't know if if this is something
that we that we wrote about or not but
we've definitely heard that there was a
concentrated effort at some point in
rims recent history to hire ax webos
people and of course we saw a lot of
striking similarities with uh with the
playbook and and you know I think that
that's I'm going but but one but one
very important point that I wanted to
make that absolutely no one on this
podcast has made yet is that there's
some striking similarities to Nokia's
harmattan you I at this point I'm just
rolling Vlad that's a that's a very
original point there Chris I'd like to
hear you elaborate
so I have please do Chris well I want to
say going back to the comment of being
number three or they have a clear shot
at being number three just for us to be
clear right now room is in number three
it is still the third most dominant
smartphone platform so really what
they're clear shot is just trying to
hold on to what they have and not let
any more that slip through their fingers
yeah he may have been referring to
number three in North America and I
don't know if they still managed to hang
on a number three in North America and
he may have even been referring to like
number three speaking from an oem
standpoint so the Apple Samsung and then
rim instead of iOS Android and then
blackberry but I mean let's really they
also got some new enterprise stuff
they've got the you know saying where
you can launch secure enterprise apps
right next to your regular apps and
those weird toggle thing that you
dragged down on a blank spot on the icon
screen to switch between which apps you
can see it's pretty weird but I mean if
you gotta have secure apps that's you
know you got to do something that's
going to be an elegant no matter what
but like this is this this battle is
between Microsoft Windows Phone 8 and
rim and they're both trying to square
the circle of appealing to enterprise
and CIOs and IT guys for managing
devices in a corporation and consumers
at the same time and I mean I think
Microsoft really believes it's going to
just completely take over whatever rim
at left and rim is doing everything it
can if that's been happening and until
that battle shakes out you know they're
not going to be able to actually take on
Android and iOS in a real way okay so DJ
I have a question for you so if you just
assume for a moment that we anticipate
to be the first BlackBerry device
gladbury London also also was codenamed
just imagine that it has great
industrial design so let's take
industrial design out of the picture
imagine also has a great camera let's
take those aspects the hardware away
from it are you excited by this software
they saying today my
yes it's it's a company together of a
whole bunch of what we still think a
good ideas from other operating systems
but if you see it all come together with
great industrial design and is that it
actually flows and is responsive with
your big assumptions does that excite
you are you going to be psyched for
first half of next year I'm intrigued
like I'm I'm interested I mean you know
um dan was complaining that my my hands
on post with the latest version of that
blackberry 10 beta was really long it
was like well yeah but this is the first
new smartphone operating system since
Windows Phone and so it at least deserve
some attention because like they're
trying to make something out of it and
there are some pretty good ideas here so
I like good ideas I like movie
successful so from that perspective like
I'm interested but am I psyched am I
excited there's nothing here that like
makes my jaw drop there's nothing here
that needs to go oh my god I must have
that and I don't know what that would be
in the mobile space right now because
I'm cynical and jaded and hate
everything but they definitely don't
have that and since they definitely
don't have that you know I don't know
what they can do to get it and I don't
know if you know is it isn't enough to
like tread water which seems to be kind
of their office and I pick up a little
bit back in North America it might be
especially if like the what's left of
the loyal BlackBerry users are willing
to transition over to a relatively
quickly but they definitely don't have
something that is going to make somebody
not buy an iphone right now they
definitely don't have something to make
something not buy an android phone and
wait like it's it's cool it's
interesting but it's not like oh my god
I must have that and I honestly don't
know what they could have done to like
engender that feeling I wish they had
kind of because you know I make the
underdogs but they haven't done that
here so far i think it's a it's a
striking difference from what we saw in
2009 when webos was introduced when
webos was introduced i think it had a
lot of those things that are like oh my
god this is incredible and it's like you
know really cool new ideas that we
haven't seen anybody done before or
anybody do before and it's like one of
those i must
have a type of deals we all know how
that worked out in the long run but rim
doesn't like dita were saying have any
of that these are all ideas that we've
seen before that are just kind of
cobbled together here and there into
this rim playbook type of user interface
shrunk down onto a small screen well I
mean I will say like if hub is done
right that is actually kind of new but
it's just not that like it's not like
that jazzy right about that holy crappy
is it's like oh hey you've got all your
messages a notification in one place
where like acting on the messages and
like talking to people on doing emails
in the same place as you know your
Twitter notifications and your push
notifications from your game and
whatever else so like taking those two
functions and sort of throwing them all
into one you know relatively can be in
place a successful trip anywhere is a
really cool idea it but you know we have
to see if that it's actually the work I
mean the other thing to point out is we
haven't seen the full final feature set
of the OS they haven't officially
launched this yet we don't know you know
they have officially launching devices
but they're in this weird spot where
they're like they're showing little bits
and bobs of the OS and then when they
finally will completely launch it a lot
of it's going to go well we saw that
before and they're in a rock and a hard
place because they've got to do this to
get developers because they got to get
whatever apps that they can and so like
I don't know that I would not want to be
in rims position and you're right that
there are a lot of parallels to level s
and one of the parallels they're afraid
of is announcing everything and then
having six months of waiting before they
actually ship something so they're
announcing as much as they have to in
order to get developers but they're
trying to minimize the amount of time
between the whole launch and
availability or devices can we talk
about their other efforts to woo
developers aside from teachers in there
no s rejected an gonna have whoa I
didn't see it you didn't see it might
have been the best thing on the internet
yesterday I think we might have it have
it queued up to play a clip for the show
is that is that true I think I'm getting
the nod
from our control room yeah yeah so we
kind of have to let make this happen
one
okay so glad I really hope that you're
paying attention to this you know since
you insist that you had not seen it
yesterday now I didn't know we'd swim
the rack we have let me say that is this
video killed at the developer event
everybody loved it they ended up they
thought it was awesome and I don't mean
that they thought it was awesome on
ironically everybody was in on the joke
including you know Alec on stage God the
head of developer relations together you
know the frontman for this discover it
was all everybody thought it was funny
and everybody was in on the joke that
they were sort of making fun of
themselves because you know there's
really there's a big circle the wagons
tality around blackberry people right
now library developers so it let off a
bunch of steam um but I mean it's like
cringing Li like hard to watch right and
so the problem is like they put it on
the internet and so while like I get the
joke and developers get the joke is like
you know somebody who has a some
teenager has a blackberry and uses for
BBM that you know is going to see this
completely out of context going to get
the joke and appreciate what they're
trying to do yeah but now listen then
bream has already said the boss so
freaking low yeah I mean I can't even
get the bar in the frame here like it's
so low with his previous advertising the
list this is just excellence rim this is
excellent I think I think they had one
with a believer's Christina Milian and
admittedly my expertise on pop sing
singers isn't as great as my expertise
on HTS backlog of devices um but it was
like a really really terrible confused
wicked ad which I think it has something
to do BBM I don't even remember I just I
just remember being kind of cringing on
rooms behalf you know it wasn't
nursing on rooms behalf and I'm totally
with you I I can see why people like
this because it shows exactly you're
saying a sort of self-awareness from rim
and a sort of humility that you
absolutely will never have seen from my
class radius and from the former company
so this just makes a company more
approachable and being an underdog now
which is what room is acting like one
will help it ultimately and I understand
that a lot of developers I'm just going
to start investing you know their
careers in two rib just because it's a
cute company but it doesn't hurt I
thought I was effing one I was nothing
to say pletely I thought oh that wasn't
like completely cringing and freaked out
by his video I did I know that other
people at the verge like this is the
worst thing I've ever seen Josh like he
tweeted this is the worse video I've
ever seen I'm like it's bad so I mean
it's in feel it just feels very
microsoft ii like this is something
Microsoft would have done in 1998 and it
just it just kind of reeks of that I
know it's it's it's supposed to be a
very self-aware tongue-in-cheek to
everything but just it just reeks of
that corporate doesn't really get it
type of vibe when you're seeing it from
the outside if you're not there at the
the dose first thing he's been kind of
but yeah hey guys it can we talk about
the iphone 5 for a minute I just have as
I i hate to completely change so we'll
get back to rim but I was just sitting
here holding this iphone 5 and I
observed something very important buy
you a top I got back up stop stop right
there I just want to point out that the
thing that chris said would happen last
week of a podcast is exactly what
happened he didn't pre-order he said he
wasn't ready and then he went and waited
in line I want to say that you said you
were waiting in the knife online not one
but two days in a row is that true no
you're making that up i was there only
on friday okay
yeah um it no actually I was I was in a
tent in front the apple store the night
before no yeah it was really easy yeah I
guess I should talk about my my
experience getting phone this so you
know 18 he just opened this
quote-unquote chip store in Chicago
which we we did a piece on not too long
ago and I think everyone just kind of
forgot that it existed because it was
like there were like you know 10 people
in line for the phone at 4pm on friday
and they had stock of everything they
were no danger of running out of
anything meanwhile like a block down the
street at the apple store you knows
Lionel around the block so um yeah
anyway so but no the only point I wanted
to make I'll be real quick about this is
that if you hold the iphone 5 until this
side to side the screen gets very dim
which is something that you don't have
on the 1x if i remember correctly so i
would i would venture to say that the 1x
retains the title of the best i display
on on a mobile phone so you're saying to
be the viewing angles of the 1x are
better than the iphone 5s this way yes
ok yeah i think i agree with that
although Chris I gotta say Vlad made
that exact point earlier well my only
goal is to remake every point that glad
makes from now on on everybody when I
was making that point I was making about
the 8x not about the iphone and I'm sure
the purses around at that time because
Chris salty at some point like a
superhero right well I guess I was too
busy dealing with the FCC so yeah
Christmas goal is to make your point
over and over again and my goal is to
just roll the podcast and lie and take
us off topic and get derailed which I
have done successfully also there's one
other things that I want to say about
rim that they gave out new developer
devices to the developers here a client
dev alpha B and you know they said
they'd ran out of the original ones they
had to give out you know make new ones
and looking at these new ones like it's
really really obvious that
this is basically the the health series
of London the first device is going to
ship and what they did is they took off
the outer casing of the phone and
replaced it with a big ugly plastic box
like it's very clear that's what
happened that makes perfect sense too
because you know why would they spend
money making another device for
developers when they you know they need
to start making the actual phone so if
they're going to actually hit you know
their ship date they need to have stuff
in carrier testing now in fact they do
have stuff and carrier testing now so
why would they waste resources making a
phone that they're never going to ship
when they could use the actual phone
just put a different box on it so that
you know it doesn't do not accidentally
announcing the device today right by the
way dad what is it really this on the
under dev alpha but what's happening
there was a post it was the screen
resolution etc I'm kind of odd but yet
they're not talking processor but it's
16 gigs of storage gig of ram and a 1280
by 768 screen and i'm pretty sure 20 LED
and you know with ice you know there's
some hang-ups and crashes but when
blackberry 10 works and it's not bugging
out which is still is a little bit
because it's you know still in beta it's
actually really fast really responsive
some pretty pleased with it the the
screen resolution is interesting because
they've remembers told developers that
they should target 1280 by 720 and 720 x
720 but got the first device of chips
would be 768 x 1280 and like that's just
kind of weird that you know they're
telling developers to target the screen
resolution that isn't going to be on the
first flagship divisive issue yeah that
is odd and it'll be interesting to see
how that's handled if it's done with
blood or boxing or I guess zooming or
stretching yeah I'm pretty sure they
recommended letterbox so is that a sign
that RIM no longer has the the component
muscle to like source displays that they
want instead they had to take what was
available on the market I think it
definitely could be I also think that it
might
them giving developers that guidance is
actually kind of a nice thing because
you know they knew that the the square
one is going to be 720 x 720 so they're
just giving the developers as few
targets as possible which is something
that room has never done like developing
for blackberry has always been a huge
mess and you know rim is pretty much
admitted it and so it's as I was talking
about the chemical crackberry about this
a little bit that they're probably going
to they're getting smarter about
sourcing stuff and they're getting
smarter about making fewer versions of
you know their hardware because with old
blackberry devices there was like
redoing it all over again every time
they ship the phone but I'm guessing it
that was just a matter like they have
the screen natcha and that the next
one's good be 720 and so they just tried
to simplify the message to their
developers was there any uh any other
features of the dev alpha be hardware
that kind of stood out to you or just
kind of money it's got NFC I mean it's
got a camera I don't know how good it is
it's like you know it's it's a it's a
phone or box it's not for developer
purposes so there's not a whole lot to
say there until we actually get to test
the final hardware even even if I'm
right this is the final hardware in an
ugly shell it's not fair to like you
know actually judge it because they're
not calling it tile hardware and you
know there might be tiny revisions
between now and actually ship so well
there and you know in terms of like
developers like there aren't a whole lot
of big names here I think biggest name
here is probably Foursquare they got
trotted up on stage but like Facebook is
going to be on it twitter is going to be
on it linkedin is going to be on it as
far as i know all those apps are
developed by rim not by those companies
there'll be a bunch of gameloft games
but there's not like you know they
didn't promise Instagram they didn't
promise skype they didn't promise hulu
so there's there's a real big question
of do they have those apps lined up and
they just are waiting to announce them
or are they just not going to have them
right yeah actually I was just gonna say
going through the device it will be real
arias if room came back and introduced
the london audio series and started
telling us about how much and how much
lights or it is than the current brick
that is show notes people and it tried
to pitch that as like this is how far
we've come over the past five months we
took this old chair we stuck this new
owner it is so much better I mean listen
the other thing is like you were saying
deed to the brim is going to be
trickling out announcements of features
and things like that over the course of
the next six months or however long it
takes to you know release his first film
released blackberry 10 so Facebook
integer rap so good stuff out to having
those at launch I would be more
reassured if the rim announced to have
an email app and I kind of the reprap at
the launch add those are kind of
important but also I'm seeing here one
of our headline I says that the app
submissions beginning october 10 so
which is the tenth of the temp whether
you're using the US calendar or the
normal cuban calendar a kind of a nice
little coincidence but video so that
gives a lot of time in space for him and
others to do a bit of development and
get the platform up to speed so let's
try me you know optimistic that's all we
can really do ok opportunism indeed
which is kind of the wrong guy to wrap
up on yeah usually we end on rumors are
always such a down note i mean i think i
think is some respects this is a down
note because being optimistic with
britain is like the most futile thing in
the mobile industry but oh no wait i
have a realtor I know we can end on a
samsung and TouchWiz and uh the dialer
code yes you you have some experience
with that right dieter yeah so
I mean I haven't been following too
closely other than good in here at the
blackberry thing but I did help help
test this so apparently touch with
phones have a thing where you can dial
in a code on the dialer and hit Send and
I guess not offend and it will hard
reset the phone erase everything and
like it is actually relatively common on
a lot of phones you can send commands
via SMS and so someone figured out that
you could send the command to open a
dialer oh no it's not SMS you couldyou
could send a command open the dialer via
an iframe in web browser or just by
clicking a link which is similar to an
SMS vulnerability anyway the point is
I've another link and I hardly set my
song but it was really weird because it
didn't happen right away it sat on the
screen just a little bit and so I had to
test it a couple of times and it doesn't
seem like it's consistent across every
Samsung device and I'm glad you said you
you weren't seeing it on on your Galaxy
s3 is that right right and not my own
but one here in the UK and we tested
that one to death and it just it it
didn't affect the thing here and
Athena's emerged days actually that this
is a more widespread thing actually that
we initially thought it doesn't seem to
be touch with specific anymore which
actually really helpful one I would like
to clarify by making zero statements
about such words like it's not a
TouchWiz issue and your Samsung like
your first job will be to come up to
people and say this is not a touchless
problem but it's a dialer issue and
somebody's done some research into his
looked into it they found the same
vulnerability on other Android devices
so it's not samsung exclusive it's not
TouchWiz exclusive so shouldn't just
bash something too hard um and
apparently this isn't really theaters
been identified and it's been patched
but this is the problem here that is
with passion some Android devices and
not others so the galaxy s2 still needs
a firmware update to get this fixed up
some galaxy s free seems to be running
the latest software which makes it
invulnerable to this thing and some
others like the
does seem to be running potentially an
older version of software again Samson's
communication here has been really sucky
to be honest um so we're not really
perfectly clear on what exactly is going
on but the best thing to say is that the
very latest version of software I mean
jellybean is Bernie copley and
unaffected Galaxy Nexus devices are
unaffected if you have the very latest
version of whatever Android software
your phone manufacturers make it
available that would be your best way to
avoid this the yellow thing is don't
click links that you don't know we're
going to lead you to oh don't don't do
things that I send you to because I said
that link to theater degree says phone
is my phone I think that the answer is
don't click link that you don't don't do
it you can't ya type everything into the
URL bar manually admittedly the seraphic
if you click on links on your mobile
phone and something's wrong like you
should be using a mouse yes this is
entirely the users fault this entirely
out all right on that note I think I
think that's a good a good wrap up for
our mobile show this week would you say
so bring it I would agree he's gonna
yeah I I believe you did the intro so
you do the outro there Vlad oh man i was
asking that just so I could avoid living
it oh yeah I know what uh let's see what
are we supposed to say what is important
like I'm saying there isn't that much
important important information
contained in the introduction when we
know that everyone who's watching
listening to the live stream the
recording knows what they're getting
ourselves in for and so really
introducing it is kind of a an active
vanity and the outro is another activity
but let's do it so that's not me and the
with it you can follow us on twitter dan
is at DC ciphered equally or cifra
pieces that background

know get in touch with my friends and my
roots and shave at some point um you can
