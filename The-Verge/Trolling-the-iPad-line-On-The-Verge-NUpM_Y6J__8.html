Apple store on Fifth Avenue and there
were people in line including including
Greg Packer who I don't know even who
Greg Packers he's kind of a famous line
sitter he's his job in life is to wait
in line I think he's the first in line
at every Apple event now anyhow we shot
some video it's very bizarre and I think
you should take a look check it out hey
this is Josh from the verge and we are
at the Apple cube on Fifth Avenue and
there are people here in line waiting
for the new iPad so we thought we would
have a chat with these guys about why
they're here and what they're doing what
would it take to get you to leave it's a
cop tried to arrest you would you leave
all this for the Apple TV you in line
for the Apple TV are you in line for the
Apple TV the iPad 3 oh the iPad HD iPad
3 I think it's called the iPad 3 all
right I'll be honest with you on the
iPad line aren't that friendly Greg how
are you now you've been at the front of
every one of these lines yeah since the
launch of the original iPhone right this
is not the only line you've been at the
front of know you love being at the
front of line I love in the front
why because you you know you get your
iPad and you do your interviews and
that's it what if I offer to trade for
your place in line if I offered you an
iPad - sure they've been still gonna get
a fan 3 so you would just come back
later
no I would just go to the back of the
line and enjoy - actually a really good
idea even CNN comes out for the iPad
lock they're asking the tough questions
though that's the difference is this
camera better than ours hi how you doing
are you guys waiting in line for the
iPad
not working like what about for like an
Android tablet would you trade your
plays our lines are used they let you go
yeah how can you ensure that entry takes
your place

violence let's just say I make sure if I
were to try to take your place what
would you do to me test me to find out
all right who else am I going to harass
here would you kill me test me to find
out would you say that's been find out

comment a knife a bowie knife will
course up for a different when we go to
it bowie knife to the throat we've
crossed that bridge if and when we get

bridge if we good alright so some pretty
interesting reactions here in line and
