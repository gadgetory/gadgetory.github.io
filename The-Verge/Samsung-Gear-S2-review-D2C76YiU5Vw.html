smartwatches for as long as anyone its
earlier efforts have been disappointing
but the new gear s2 promises to be
different and in many ways it is it's
got a sleeker more attractive design a
completely new interface and finally
works with more than just Samsung phones
gear s2 is far from perfect but it
demonstrates some really great ideas
about how a SmartWatch should look and
work and can be a learning tool for the
rest of the industry the gear s2 is the
first round SmartWatch from Samsung and
it's by far the best-looking wearable
the company has ever made it's not too
big not too thick and it's comfortable
to wear I've been testing the $299
standard gear s2 which has a rubber
strap and smooth brushed metal finish
it's not the design I choose the $349
gear s2 classic with its leather strap
and darker finish is more my speed
unfortunately the standard s2 uses a
proprietary strap mount which means that
you can't go into any jewelry or watch
store and swap it out for something else
the round design is there for more than
just looks it enables the rotating bezel
control which is the smartest way to
interact with the SmartWatch I've ever
used sure you can swipe through the
screens with the touch screen just like
an Apple watch or any Android wear model
but once you use the bezel to control
the watch you'll wonder why nobody else
has done this before
the rotating ring is predictable and
reliable unlike Apple somewhat confusing
digital crown and it lets me navigate
the interface without blocking any of
the content with my finger that great
experience is helped by the fast and
easy to use interface on the s2 turn the
ring to the right from the main watch
face and you access widgets of
information turn it to the left and you
see your notifications use it to scroll
through text when reading a message or a
list and it behaves exactly like you'd
expect it to a button on the side of the
watch jumps back one level while another
button takes you back to the main watch
face it's all very simple to understand
and use and I never felt lost or
confused the gear s2 s display is great
it's bright and sharp and easy to read
indoors and out you can turn on an
ambient mode to always display the time
but that will have an impact on battery
life I was able to go 2 days between
charges with the ambient screen off but
only one with it on neither option is
great you'll still be charging it at
least every other day and you shouldn't
travel without it's charging dot but at
least the gear s2 doesn't die halfway
through the day but here's where I run
into some big issues with the gear s2
it's
great for checking and even replying to
some notifications and tracking your
physical activity but beyond that there
isn't much else you can do with it while
Apple and Google boasts thousands of
apps for their watches including useful
ones like citymapper dark sky and google
maps the gear s2 lacks both quantity and
quality apps right now that's not likely
to change anytime soon the gear s2 runs
a different platform than Android wear
or the Apple watch and it's not likely
that developers are going to devote much
effort to supporting it even some of the
apps Samsung demoed at its launch at the
s2 such as uber aren't available for yet
there are a number of attractive watch
faces included with the s2 but
third-party options like the apps left
me wanting and while the Apple watch and
Android wear will let you do a bunch of
things with your voice the gear s2 s
voice actions are slow and really
limited I can't even use it to settle a
reminder for example and that really is
what has me worried for the gear s2 it's
a fine functioning and looking
SmartWatch today but I'm not confident
that it will get the support needed from
developers to turn it into something
really special tomorrow I want a
SmartWatch it looks good it's easy to
use shows me notifications tracks my
activity and lets me do certain things
without pulling my phone out of my
pocket the gear s2 gets a lot of those
right but that last one that's what
really separates a great SmartWatch from
the rest and the s2 doesn't yet fulfill
that need Samsung came awfully close to
making a brilliant SmartWatch this time
but his journey isn't over</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
