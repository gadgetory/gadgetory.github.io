proud to welcome the newest member of
the Xbox family fittingly named Xbox 1x
starting on November 7th Xbox 1x joins
the Xbox one and the Xbox one s when it
launches worldwide
let's talk power which starts with the
specs 6 teraflop GPU clocked at one
point one seven two gigahertz twelve
gigabytes of gddr5 memory and 326
gigabytes per second of memory bandwidth
because that's what it takes to give
game creators the power they need so you
can experience true 4k resolution 4k
textures and 4k assets in your living
room and when we say true 4k we mean 8
million pixels high dynamic range wide
color gamut premium sound like Dolby
Atmos and 4k UHD blu-ray playback all of
your Xbox one accessories and games will
work with Xbox one X the game library
you have today will look and play even
better on Xbox one X with enhanced
visual fidelity anisotropic filtering
and faster load times since Xbox one X
enables a technique called super
sampling the new 4k games you see on
stage today will look better on your
1080p TV than anything you've seen
before it starts with a Scorpio engine
we use 16 nanometer technology to build
a 360 square millimeter chip with seven
billion transistors and a 384 bit wide
memory bus this is the fastest most
advanced processor to
power a console the Scorpio engine is so
intense that for the first time ever on
a console we're using a liquid cooled
vapor chamber normally reserved for
servers and high-end PC cards not only
have we built the most powerful console
ever Xbox one X is the smallest Xbox
ever now let's see what this monster can
do Forza has become the premier partner
to the automotive industry so today for
the first time in history a flagship
supercar is making its world debut
ladies and gentlemen may I present the
2018 Porsche 911 gt2 RS using the power
of Xbox 1x
Fortson motorsport 7 runs at a native 4k
and a rock-solid 60 frames per second
and it's more beautiful and alive dark
skies open up and change as the Sun
emerges from the clouds for a
breathtaking finish I'm going to play a
ton of Forza Motorsport 7 when it ships
on October 3rd and when Xbox 1x launches
we will all get to experience
Fortson motorsports 7 in true 4k at 60
frames per second up next is a game from
a creative team that built their
franchise on xbox in 2010 for a games
worked with us to launch a single player
masterpiece that i played on xbox 360
now i'm honored to bring them back with
the premiere of their next work running
in engine in true 4k
ancient Egypt is the birthplace of
modern civilization and it is also the
birthplace of the assassins Brotherhood
Sanskrit origins is also the story of
one man by ik by ik is the last Magi the
protector of his community and his
struggle against the dark forces that
corrupt ancient Egypt will lead to the
foundation of the assassins Brotherhood

their work whether it's a story that can
only be born of a different land or
artistic design and storytelling that in
a single moment can capture your
imagination and inspire at Xbox it's not
just about finding creative artists it's
about empowering them and nurturing them
helping shine a light on their work

share their creations that's why the ID
