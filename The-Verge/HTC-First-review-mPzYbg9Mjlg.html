this is the HTC first that's a heavy
hitter name for what this phone is the
first phone facebook home software
preloaded out of the box Facebook
integration will actually run on a lot
of different phones but on the first it
has deeper integration and more explicit
Facebook branding the first is hard to
categorize on the one hand it's
definitely a mid-range phone but unlike
every other mid-range Android phone it's
not loaded down with ton of garbage from
the manufacturer or the carrier it's
pure stock Android underneath Facebook
home more importantly a lot of people
have been waiting and hoping for a
manufacturer to finally buck this big
phone trend on Android and the first
does just that with a 4.3 inch 720p
display so now that HTC has done it the
big question is whether this smaller
phone is like so many other smaller
Android phones will it be underpowered
or will it be good enough for power
users the best answer I can get to that
question is probably it's definitely not
as fast or as powerful as HTC One or the
Samsung Galaxy s4 it has a qualcomm
dual-core Snapdragon 400 processor
clocked at 1.4 gigahertz with a gig of
ram and 16 gigs of storage that means
that moving between apps scrolling and
everything else feels fine unless you
compare it directly with the best stuff
that's out there right now it's also not
running the latest version of Android
4.2 and HTC hasn't yet said when it will
be getting an update even though it's
not a flagship caliber phone there's a
lot to like about the first for one
thing the hardware feels really good it
has a polycarbonate shell with a soft
touch feel and rounded corners and edges
that all just feel natural if you're
familiar with the HTC One X imagine it
had a love affair with the iPhone 3GS
and the first is basically the result of
that pairing so while there's nothing
especially premium about the hardware on
the first it's still a step above most
other phones at this price point it
doesn't creak or feel cheap at all
the speaker on the bottom is reasonably
loud but it can get muffled in your hand
and call quality and LTE data speeds are
both solid the 4.3 inch 720p LCD screen
is especially good which is something
we've actually come to expect from HTC
it has great viewing angles and well
tuned color saturation there are three
soft buttons back home and menu just as
it should be and since there's no s
voice or blinkfeed or whatever
everything just works as you'd expect
there's also a LED notification light
but it's inexplicably turned off by
default the camera is only so-so it's a
5 megapixel
that comported itself better than I
expected especially in daylight there's
still a little too much post-processing
for my taste introducing noise and
softening some edges that really didn't
need it
low-light is also pretty bad by 2013
standards the camera also sits flush
with the back of the phone so you need
to make sure that you wipe the lens
clean if you don't want blurry shots I'm
actually kind of stunned that a Facebook
phone doesn't have a camera button or a
top level shortcut to the camera and
since this is stock Android underneath
Facebook you're stuck with Android 4.1
camera interface which I find pretty
clunky but for a $99 phone this does
better than you think
even though that's not saying much I
have to say I really like using an
Android phone that's roughly 5 inches
tall by 2 and a half inches wide you
could actually reach the power button on
the top the notification drawer and
everything else with one hand battery
life in the first was slightly better
than I expected
although I drained fast when I was in
areas with poor wireless signal I had no
real issues getting through even a long
day with the first there's no removable
battery so you might run into trouble
but the benefit of having a relatively
pokey processor and a smaller screen is
that both draw less power and so your
phone simply lasts longer as for the
software there are a few things to know
obviously the first and most important
thing is that it's running Facebook home
we have a full review of home separately
but I should point out here that it
works really well in the first the
overall aesthetic of the first matches
up nicely with Facebook's Spartan
chromeless interface and because
Facebook has done so much nerdy coding
work there's not a lot of lag or delay
though it does make you wait a half-step
from time to time home has some
interesting new ideas for Android it
merges your lockscreen and home screen
gives you persistent little chat heads
for your ongoing SMS and messenger
conversations you can swipe through your
newsfeed like stuff and even look at
your apps even if you have a pin code
enabled by default you enter it after
you tap on an app that you can change
that in settings Facebook home on the
first actually has deeper integration
than it will if you install it from the
Play Store on another Android phone
Facebook puts your notifications right
on the lockscreen front and center and
you can swipe them away individually or
stack them all together with the long
press to get rid of all of them on the
first you get all of your notifications
not just your messenger alerts which is
pretty neat but if you're not a facebook
junkie the first is interesting on its
own merits you can turn facebook home
completely off and still use chat heads
or turn them off to for a completely
stock experience there are only two
pieces of AT&amp;amp;T software on this phone
that I can find
visual voicemail and those little bits
that make it automatically connect to
AT&amp;amp;T Wi-Fi hotspots both can be turned
off that means you have a small and
completely cruft free Android experience
it's not as fast as the Nexus 4 and it
doesn't have the latest version of
Android but it does have LTE and for me
those are both trade-offs that might be
worth it so who should buy the HTC first
I think a lot of people actually if you
want the best Facebook experience you
can get on a phone the first really does
live up to that promise despite the fact
that Facebook home feels a little bit
like beta software if you're looking for
stock Android with LTE and don't mind
the trade-offs on speed and camera it's
basically a no-brainer most of all if
you're looking for an Android phone that
you can actually use with one hand the
first deserves a long look I don't know
if I'll be switching to the first but I
do hope that it does well enough to
prove to HTC Samsung and everybody else
that there's a real market for phones
that aren't designed for giants and with
stock Android the first is great but
hopefully the second will do away with
compromises everybody seems to make on
smaller phones</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
