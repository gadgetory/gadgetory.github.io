its breath after the failure of 3d TV
manufacturers have turned to 4k as the
best option to get customers to upgrade
the problem is when there isn't really
anything to watch and no 4k content
means no 4k sales this year at CES
that's all changed one company has
emerged as the potential Savior that has
the brand awareness and the
infrastructure to make 4k happen in the
home Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has been
everywhere as Sony Samsung LG and Vizio
all announced that they would be
including Netflix Ultra HD 4k streaming
in their televisions well we really
wanted to continue to push the envelope
times of delivering the highest quality
picture possible so in the last few
years we've moved through deliver high
definition HD we recently started doing
super high tech which is a high bitrate
in high-definition still 1080p and the
next logical step was to embrace the 4k
sets the TV venom TV manufactures the
building and several several interesting
sets coming out this year and so we've
developed a lot of the technology to to
encode and deliver 4k content to those
TV sets that will be a big piece of our
effort this year the one of the
interesting pieces of course is that 4k
is not going to have a major life time
on a plastic disc
it doesn't fit on a blu-ray disc and I
think it's unlikely people want to
create that DVD players similarly it's
unlikely that it will be embraced
rapidly on the broadcast and cable side
and so internet delivery is where it's
at the company's original programming is
allowing it to move forward without
waiting on studios for 4k masters the
second season of house of cards be the
first show to stream in 4k in the second
quarter of this year Sony is also
lending a hand and the entire run of
Breaking Bad will stream later on to
2014 that said they're not home free
just yet bandwidth is going to be a
likely concern and Amazon has announced
its own set of 4k partnerships Comcast
DirecTV and MgO have their own plans as
well
but despite the industry shift some are
worried that 4k alone won't be enough
yeah I actually believe that the color
and the high dynamic Ram
is a bigger impact than just straight
resolution so I think resolution is
great I mean we're big fan of ultra high
def obviously you're gonna put it on a
lot of products and if you get close to
a small TV or at a large TV like this
we're standing in front of 120 inch the
resolution is very very important but
from a customer impact and feeling like
you're actually in the scene the color
the high dynamic range and that contrast
that we've got I think it's actually
more important you can feel like they're
one of the technologies that makes that
possible with the new Dolby vision
format which remasters films and
television for greater dynamic range and
more accurate color than we've ever seen
before on TVs they'll be announced for
streaming partners for that format
during the week and Netflix was on board
so typically so far what others have
done is they they use the standard
signal that is being distributed they
and blu-ray broadcast over-the-top
streaming and when I say standard I mean
standard dynamic range 8 bits per pixel
that's been the standard for the last 20
years unfortunately that's outdated we
believe you have to go higher in terms
of bit depth so we go the go revision to
12 bit and up and with that you can
retain a lot more dynamic range detail
in dark areas detail in bright areas so
bright areas don't get washed out as
easily dark detail gets retained and
doesn't get you know drown in the black
and at the same time you can retain a
much higher color gamut between more
colors more vibrant colors a lot more
true-to-life viewing experience that
consumers can instantly recognize as an
improvement to what they seem today it's
another example of Netflix looking ahead
and leveraging every technological
advantage at its disposal everybody's
going to have 4k eventually it's just a
matter of time but for right now Netflix
is leading that charge the company has
gone from red envelopes to changing the
way we think about television we're
entering a new era one of easier access
better images and people can watch what
they want when they want it and it's all
happening on
