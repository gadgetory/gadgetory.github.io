seifert and this is episode 58 for the
week of August twelfth today is actually
August thirteenth if you are watching us
live and if you're going to listen to
the recording it could be any day after
this or still today so uh that was a
great intro I'm dancing hey I'm Vlad's
how i'm chris sigler just to clarify I
want to make sure that our listeners
understand the time the time-space
continuum you are positing that if they
are listening to this show it is some
point either now or in the future that
is correct that is that is my theory
that that is an interesting theory that
could ultimately be debunked should you
want musk create a time machine after he
finishes the Hyperloop which is entirely
possible wouldn't put anything past the
mad at this point you know what i would
i would expect that Elon Musk is going
to come up with an idea for an actual
functional time machine and be so
excited about it and like just forget
all about the Hyperloop and then just go
build this time machine or maybe you'll
get the Hyperloop going so fast that it
like it just like disappears into
another dimension or into the future or
past which is basically what happened in
time cop we're like you know they had
that you don't remember they had like
those those like those like pods on
Rails and like they had to get him going
really fast and then they would
disappear and go into the past that's
probably what's gonna happen was meant
whoa oh right that feel turns they don't
getting speed up this match to submit
words rightful right yeah I remember
there was like stains on the on the
walls from where like people crashed
into them but they never happened to
Jean Claude Van Damme because this work
sees and this is where i admit that i
don't think i've ever seen Timecop what
whitewater stop we are positing the
verge mobile too dancey freaking go
watch time cop that's it's the game of
the arcade right where you step on the
pedal and then your gun works and you
step off and and you reload and stuff
that's time cop to me what yeah was your
cave game right no need for a whole
other version of the 1990
oh my god time decision time cop is the
second best movie of the 90s after
demolition man that's a no statement to
me yeah that's a big prazer it's good
movie so I'm saying so it's also
mentioned if somebody is actually
listening to this podcast for over for
the week of August 12 on August twelfth
please let us know because we'll be very
impressed yeah yeah that's true although
I don't know if they can send an email
into the future to reach us well if they
send it from the past it will get here
eventually yes you're right God my
head's going to explode so unfortunately
deters not here with us he isn't tied up
an email you send off is going that's
true that's true unless unless you use
undo send and stop it from happening
right like say somebody say you click
you sent the email and somebody from the
future goes back in time to that five
second window and clicks undo send and
cancels it that you would probably
there's probably a good chance that you
would end or destroy this version of the
universe so ensure our conclusion is
never hit em do send just to save the
universe right and also never miss it
never hit undo send in the past cuz
you'll endanger the future oh man this
is so far over my head uh so yeah
unfortunately deters not with us today
because he had more important things to
do so there you go there's your
announcement about eater but let's talk
about news I guess so we have a date for
the new iphone yes not well not if not
officially but it's kind of the
consensus rumor in September 10 yeah
this has been rumored originally
reported by All Things D last week
Bloomberg actually corroborated that
date again today so now there's two
sources saying that August 10th we will
see a new iphone
and a new cheap iphone stuff that has
been literally been rumoured all year
yeah they're finally doing it you know
it for years and years like i had just
finally gotten behind the Apple model of
just recycling old iPhones as the cheap
iPhone and now they're going to throw it
all into the blender and come out with
an actual legitimate cheap iPhone that's
a completely separate model yeah and I
know we've discussed this before when
Pryor shows but you know it for my
theory at least is that it just it like
it just costs too much to produce the
iphone 5 still like if if Apple did
continue to do the thing of moving the
prior generation down a notch every year
that would mean that there once this
next iPhone comes out the iphone 4s
would be the free on contract model and
the iphone 5 would be a hundred bucks on
contract and i have a feeling that the
4s and the five are just still too
costly to produce right because there's
still glass front and back whereas this
cheap model is going to be a plastic
shell right right and then of course in
in you know markets where the the evan
our producer just reminded me that i
confuse time crop with time crisis time
crisis is the arcade game you put your
foot on the pedal and shoot the gun and
then lay off and okay that's cleared up
now time crisis yes I've never seen
Timecop but so this new lower-cost
iPhone would theoretically be very
popular in markets that aren't as
reliant on the contract model so markets
where maybe people by their phone
outright aren't going to spend six or
hundred dollars on a new iphone so maybe
this and not naturally not you not not
just non US markets but also could be a
very appealing option for the prepaid
market in the US as well right and not
just those guys I mean from what I've
heard about this new iphone I'm actually
into it I like the idea um a couple of
things have popped up one is that it
might not have Siri which to me is like
owners because I never use it so then I
don't have this redundant feature
hanging around on my phone and the
second is the plastic shell the plastic
construction seems to be more rounded
more like
the iphone 3gs designs while also it
appears to be a heck of a lot like
Nokia's mid-range Lumia so things I had
a 6-10 510 etc I'm gonna under the
challenge in there glad because if it's
actually like the 3gs I don't want I
don't want anything near like like I
would want to run so far away from that
after using like the iphones for
economic sale 5 and the they're just so
much better built so much nicer build
quality well yeah but i'm talking about
the shape so you can have a shape with
poor construction you have a shape with
good construction and to me the curve is
always better than the linear angular
you know designs of the iphone 4 and 5
series I suppose I feel like the the
iphone like that that's much more
apparent on a larger device like say the
HTC One which has very kind of sharp
edges and and anecdotal story I actually
was using my one the other day and I was
holding it with my pinky like holding
the phone like you know antico way like
this and like after 15 minutes I had a
good good mark in my pinky from what the
phone was sitting because of its sharp
edges but on a smaller what took it to
my point the smaller devices like the
iphone 5 and iphone for us I think those
sharp edges are less prominent when
you're using it just because the device
itself is smaller but also also a whole
bunch of people particularly with the
black iphone 5 i've complained about
chamfered edges you know picking up
little scratches and nicks and things
like that like nobody seems to be able
to maintain the iphone 5 spotless which
is annoying for people and you know it's
kind of like if i'm buying a phone
sometime soon i'm thinking of the iphone
like honestly if idea how i already have
the iphone 5 and you gave me a cheaper
option with plastic shell and no sirree
and no loss in terms of app
compatibility battery life etc etc
camera performance it will be a
no-brainer to me out i would go for the
cheap of plastic one i can I should be
considered a better device yeah
durability is a consideration you know
you look at the
at the iphone 5 and I had mine for a
while and I still refused like set it
down on a hard surface because I know
that is going to get scratched or ding
and that that probably wouldn't even
enter my mind if I had a plastic phone
right what wasn't it you Chris who was
saying that you lay down a silk cloth
before you put down your iPhone I don't
think I said that but it sounds like
something I would say and it seems like
something I'd do so bring silk pillows
everywhere he goes there like miniature
silk pillows that he puts his iphone
down on you we have we have this amazing
stock photo in our in our internal image
library that gets used at least once a
week and then the caption which like our
readers I don't think that can see maybe
if they hover over the image i'm not
sure but the caption on this stock image
is iphone 5 luxuriating it's an iphone
sitting on like this bluer this dark
blue or cloth it's amazing it's yeah
it's like fake it's like a fake fur coat
its knit me why I took that right I
think I yeah it's a mansion it's great
i'm showing eli is responsible for of
those pictures we have the iphone 5 on a
black leather couch looking kind of like
a pause time repose we have a Galaxy
Nexus I believe we'd like some fur all
around it and it is 10 of those it is
that image called galaxy s4 luxuriating
I hope it is the key is the use of the
phrase luxuriating the word luxuriating
of course so you know so now we have a
pretty safe bet as to when we're going
to hear about this new iphone but you
know we've been talking about the this
cheaper iphone i obviously there's been
rumors all year long about what the more
expensive or flagship iPhone is going to
have we did a big roundup of them this
week so definitely check it out if you
haven't already pretty much all of the
rumors of what we might see what we
might not see but it seems like the
strongest rumors seem to be circulating
around this fingerprint sensor which
would be kind of a weird thing at least
in my opinion be a weird thing unless
Apple implements in a totally different
way than what we seen in the past the
gold iPhone
is definitely like somebody some someone
in Asia is trolling yeah there's no
chance like it's amazing because like a
lot of people are seriously betting on
there being like this this pre blinged
out it's not just a gold iPhone it has
like a crystal home button what is the
story with it bigoted there's some rumor
circulating this week about like a
blinged-out gold stock gold I feel like
I feel like I've tuned this one out
Chris yeah well it's been going around a
week and I'm like come on is there
anything remotely close to this in
Apple's history that would make you
believe that they would ship a stock
blinged out the old iphone 5s mostly to
be honest I'm sure that the Vladimir
Putin already has one of those I'm sure
maybe cause I Sun suggested it to Tim
Cook he was like you know what I gotta
meet with Tim Cook and I'm gonna be like
this is what you guys need the people
want gold iPhones they want more
swarovski crystals on their iPhones man
like get on it this is how you're gonna
turn Apple around altering yes to cook
was a good idea yeah Tim Cook is like
that sounds like a good idea Carl Icahn
was like things are looking up boom 2
million in uh in paper money or not
paper money fake money I don't know what
the term is not real money market value
yes up 20 billion um so I mean that's a
knicks iphone well obviously i mean i'm
sure that the rumor train and the leak
train will be hitting full steam in the
coming weeks as we get really close to
that September 10th day you know what
it's not going to have then the new
iphone what's up it's not going to have
a separate camera attachment with
freaking sony rx100 sensor and lens in
it well i didn't have that to our topic
was today how did i forget about this
let's just talk about that know that
things in santee so for the uninformed
this there's been a rumor this year that
sony is going to release this device
that attaches to the back of a
smartphone and communicates with the
smartphone via NFC and Wi-Fi
and provides a large size camera sensor
and a whole lens it's literally a whole
camera without a display but you use
your smartphone to control it and we
foot saw our first pictures of it this
pest was it yesterday I believe and the
thing looks looks crazy uh and it's
something that I need to own ya know yo
gonna hey Doc because you have fun rx100
m2 oh right right so you already have
the camera you don't need to own the
attachment that includes to say open it
but dudes dudes just hear me out on this
okay that likely key one of the key
differentiators of a real camera versus
a smartphone with a good camera on it is
access to good physical controls and you
you lose from the pictures we've seen
you lose ninety percent of those right
like there's a ring out of lens but you
gain like all these controls that you
don't normally have a smartphone like
zoom controls and other buttons right
yeah by carrying two to like was what do
you get this is like this is like a pad
phone except for cameras is what it is
like you have to carry two pieces you
have to carry this attachment that is as
big as an rx100 and then you have to
carry a phone it'll like what do you
gain two things I need to raise here
first of all are we still live because a
producer doesn't seem to be in hang out
anymore it says we're out here so okay
fine i'm just going to believe the magic
is still going on but the second thing
the really big distinction between the
PadFone and this sony attachment is that
the sony attachment will be
interchangeable among devices the thing
that made the platform be such a failure
device for a sous and why never took off
is because every single padfone had a
tablet that you ducked smartphone in and
it was just that one smartphone and at
one tablet and if you want to upgrade
the next year you have to buy yet
another tablet with yet another
smartphone which kind of defeats the
point of docking the smartphone in the
tablet accessory where is the thing with
this Sony attachment i think i think is
called like a
a lens that's supposed to be like his
name is that you can just light it on
with any phone you using so you know you
can be using the HTC One one day the
galaxy s4 the other day I mean s4 has
decent camera but the overall point is
you can just cycle through a whole bunch
of phones and probably day two days in
the best example either it's year to
year and if this camera attachment is
good and high quality you can keep you
know for two three four years maybe even
if I think because things in camera
technology at least for the this kind of
compact size w this quickly as
smartphones and Chris this is
facepalming right now I'm sorry I think
I should give away I I didn't I didn't
realize you could see me i thought that
i had the now i'm just yeah I'm
flabbergasted by by by this entire
conversation you know Chris is such a
hypocrite because you know this thing is
going to get announced in like it's
expected to be announced in September
and it's probably going to hit shelves
in like november or december and it's
going to cost 450 or 500 dollars and
chris is gonna buy one of course I'm not
because i have an RX 100 m2 and i'll
have an iphone 5s like this and
furthermore more importantly uh would
you guys okay let me put you guys on the
spot what if you have this attachment
which it sounds like both of you are
very interested in buying it would you
keep it on your phone full time no
that's the beauty of it what that is not
the beauty of it because in your bags
are carrying an attachment that is as
big as a camera and a phone but i don't
have but I said but Chris this is where
I'm at now I still carry around my phone
and then in my bag is still my camera
and the problem with my camera that I
own right now is that all the pictures
on it are trapped on it until I get them
onto my computer and then I share them
or whatever you just need to use real
camera bro there's your processing on a
second you're approaching this from two
important presumptions which then and I
are not making so the first is that
point and shoot cameras which are you
know the most natural alternative to
this attachment you say they have
physical controls I disagree like I I
think in general their user interfaces I
mean though they're all kind of moving
to big touchscreen displays anyway but
the user interfaces of sucked and as Dan
says sharing your pictures as sucked and
I mean last year at photokina we did a
report specifically on there saying if
you know makers of point shoot camera is
want to compete with smartphones
whoo-hoo eating their lunch they need to
make their software more like
smartphones and Sony is just kind of you
know cutting out the middleman and say
we'll just check the camera hardware on
to the smartphone itself and boom it is
exactly like a smartphone so that's the
first thing I the other thing is again
Chris you're presuming that you're
coming from a smartphone with a camera
and then all sudden now you have two
devices where is the perspective than
and I'm taking is you're coming from
having upon a shoot camera and a phone
with the phone having and you know a
deficient camera which most kind of have
an NIU you know combining the best parts
of both and and kind of cutting down
with physical sizes what I mean this
isn't exactly the same size as a point
shoot and not only that as you upgrade
your phone you still have great camera
but you have you doing shoot we're
having take that one off the table
because that makes us okay I mean that's
fair Esther but also think that the
point of them raise the down the point
is very likely true as well you know
Sony announcing something in September
and then we'll probably get it sometime
around the new year whatever any we wait
to expense it etc etc which well I look
forward to the day that you gentlemen
have a great photo opportunity at 8pm
and you pull out your Xperia and it's
got a five percent battery life and
you're like oh man and then you use
sitting you assemble your camera you
pull your accessory out of the out of
its custom case and then you attach it
that takes a few minutes and then you're
down to like three percent at this point
like oh man am I going to get the shot
the allotted / camera app
and like you know that maybe takes 20
seconds or whatever its android and it's
sunny and then and then you got to take
the picture and then boom it power roots
down and then I whip out my arts 100 and
you know I know at the end both of us
are just gonna have this picture stored
on our devices and what I've got to have
it on the Internet so ultimately the guy
with a freaking lumia 1020 beats all of
us but but you know what I know what
would make this device a success if it
has like a shotgun action sound when you
put it onto the phone look so it has
like a really satisfying click like I'm
ready to take photos like it your phone
is literally cocked I would buy it just
for that yeah see cassie ryan me make a
freaking amazing team I'm sure of it
well I look forward to you two gentlemen
supporting Sony financially in the
coming quarter it's very exciting news
your sony and for you frankly yeah i
mean if if I could you know make some
design decisions is it Sony man that
would be so beautiful like the first
thing I would do is I would take the
social button of the ps4 controller
because i still find out blasphemous
okay it's a lot of sorry first first
course of action it's a bit of a well
you know maybe we should get you and I
sit down with with cars and you guys can
ya know hammer out and hit when you can
ignore me really politely yes he can you
can notice head and be like I see what
you saying that you create a great idea
yeah all right ah let's move on you guys
want to talk about blackberry I always
want to talk about blackberry I live to
talk about blackberry yeah so
BlackBerry's not having a good week when
they don know I mean they're not really
having a good year but to put it bluntly
I news came out uh they announced
actually officially yesterday that the
that the company has formed a special
committee to consider a possible sale
which has been kind of rumored for a
long time I think we've heard this quite
a bit of
for that blackberry has hired various
financial advisors and things like that
to explore sales of its assets and sales
of its business but now it seems to be
actually formalized in a more official
manner at least ma just like to point
out how amazing corporate this is to set
up a special committee to look into the
possibility of set of selling of
somebody else I mean the first part of
this is it's not so much looking into
the possibility is actually looking for
somebody who gives a damn in case you
want to buy a company yeah actually
bloomberg reported today that I guess
say they were corroborating earlier
reports about potential than looking for
a sale and then nobody's really been
interested for the past year which is
right and the second thing I was going
to say is that this reminds me of the
way kind of the UK government operates
over here it's like they set up a
committee the committee says upon
inquiry the inquiry posed to the
committee the committee that makes a
determination and recommendation and
then a minister you know kind of glasses
over all this you know thousand pages
paperwork and says I whenever I just do
the most popular thing so I could
anticipate black where you gonna do
similar thing I mean it won't I mean
it's all about either finding a buyer or
you know their value just continues to
drop until someone's just like okay
until Carl Icahn comes in is like yeah
okay I'll buy him which is gonna be
talking car why can't trash all day
today are we probably I'm looking
forward to that the Carl Icahn tweet
that says oh man just got a call with
tourists and Hines and the stock is
ready to pop it that's gonna happen next
I'm sure I look I don't know I wish I
could say a single positive thing about
BlackBerry's outlook but I got nothing
these guys I mean it yeah I think you
know everybody knew that it was well
everybody outside black brand new that
blackberry 10 was a long shot to begin
with they could help them that the z10
got out to a really rocky start we had
some pretty soft reviews ours included
the hardware sucks
suck it's just very very plain and it's
just not competitive I mean I would have
been it would've been awesome hardware
in 2011 but this is 2013 and right uh
it's it's a different area that you're
playing with them right and it's not
competitive and of course the q10 is
another story and it appeals to the the
traditional blackberry nerd but you know
it it's an open question how large that
demographic still is these days and how
many of just kind of given up on that
form factor and moved on to to full
touch and a point that i made my review
and i think is very much true is that
you know this isn't 2008 soft keyboards
both apples and and really more so
androids third-party soft keyboards have
gotten so good at this point that the
argument for a physical portrait
keyboard isn't as strong as it was even
two or three years ago wrexham yeah and
and windows phone as well yes 2007 post
but when is fun yeah it's got a great
keyboard I remember there was a time
where if I what if I had to review a
phone and it wasn't an iphone and and I
just like kind of cringed anytime I had
to use the keyboard like any virtual
keyboard and and just nowadays is just
not a non-issue yeah so absolutely uh
other blackberry news apparently um the
company was offered a solution to switch
to android last year which was a firmly
rejected as we now know but the entire
details of this proposal were released
yesterday and we had a report go up
today that's really kind of interesting
about what could have been for
blackberry if it had taken a different
course instead of pursuing blackberry 10
and instead maybe pursuit adopting
Android or focusing on its enterprise
business solely instead of trying to
recapture the consumer market right and
you can kind of see how I mean people
are always hating on OEM taking Android
skins to the extreme obviously that's
not a new trope but you can
and you can imagine how one of androids
bigger weaknesses is is the enterprise
and you're seeing solutions like Samsung
Knox come out to try and address that
but you can imagine how like if if
blackberry had paired its name and its
expertise and enterprise security with
Android that could have ended up being a
very powerful solution and maybe it's
something they could have won on I don't
know maybe the alternative is that
they'd end up having the same fate as
every Android OEM that isn't samsung but
you know which is isn't easy I mean
let's put it this way the this proposal
which which came out and was was
presented to BlackBerry's board in 2012
by a group of Silicon Valley investors
to uh to invest in the company and make
all these changes there's absolutely no
guarantee that it would assault
BlackBerry's problems it's just you know
it's a vision of a very different
direction for the company to take that
was presented by people who kind of know
what they're talking about so you know
hindsight is obviously 2020 but what
they're doing right now obviously isn't
working yeah Amanda also those upon on
Heinz side ah tourists in hindsight 20
20 you know we'll save that for a
blackbird victory one day yes but you
know there is one thing that we can
probably say if you took a look at for
example my not microsoft nokia
microsoft's unofficial subsidiary when
nokia had the N 9 and then follow it up
with Lumia 800 they basically kept the
same phone design because they spend a
whole bunch of time designing one phone
it was the n9 but then they switch
software to Windows Phone and just kept
the design so if blackberry has switched
to android the most likely handset that
would have been running android would
have been the z10 again and that just
isn't good enough like it wouldn't have
competed on the android front the way
isn't competed with microsoft's list so
i don't think blackberry would be well
any notable way better off it
if I could if I could say one thing
about the z10 is that the size is really
nice it's a smaller size phone that came
out before like the HTC mini or the
galaxy s4 mini uh and if it was running
Android I think a lot of people might
have been attracted to it just because
it was you know a fast phone that had a
high res screen in a size that you could
use with one hand comfortably by pretty
much anyone uh anything but the fact
that puts me of the most is actually
it's better life which is kind of stunk
yeah but we don't know I mean androids
not exactly known for being an
especially efficient operating system
either but we don't know how much of the
battery life stinking is because
blackberry 10 or because of the the
actual hardware yeah but you know to to
kind of argue against to myself in the
first instance it might have not have
made much of a difference but when we
come to have this conversation now about
others potentially buying up the company
and what BlackBerry's featured looks
like you know this this company doesn't
really have a roadmap like there's
nothing compelling or interesting or
unique coming down the pipe apart from
perhaps again that porsche design which
is going to say nobody's life what about
the z30 guys yeah so we've seen quite a
few leaks for the c30 this past week we
saw a video of the z30 being this 5-inch
blackberry 10 device with 720p display
with 720p display well you know what
else has a 5-inch display 720p display
is the motorola droid whatever whatever
the big 1i the joint ultra and the max
actually Thank You 5-inch 720p this is
true Chris this is very true and and I
still think after all this time the
1080p is a joke in yo town the one
exception might be you know there are
rumors going around this week that the
galaxy s3 is gonna have what a five
point six five inch screen note and line
gay excuse me yes no three and and at
those sizes 1080p whatever it's fine but
but at five inch i don't think the 1080p
is necessary and Chris what I'm saying a
big man but I'm fighting that I'm gonna
buy a xiii look this is what my phone
has over 400 ppi right now I will not
settle for less than 500 on my next
device that's a lot of ppi bro it's just
more p guys better can never get enough
ppi right bro I'm loving this BPI
program like I can just see this
happening in the New York streets just
anybody talking trash and you can just
whip out your ppi number and bi okay now
yeah but we're like you know we're all
online at the at the boutique coffee
shop yeah and we're arguing over ppi's
it's like in the 80s in Brooklyn there
would actually be like a battle rap
right there'd be like a winner but now
you just pull out your phone and say I
got 408 ppi and then Dan's like boom I
got 542 ppi and then you take a sip your
espresso and you move on this is
different scene question here's a
question why 720p is nhp whatever
resolution why would you need a 5-inch
blackberry well this one you really need
the emoticons in your bbms to be that
massive and that visible cuz you're
going to use it play games you're not
going to use it for you know all the
other stuff but that's that's the claim
right is that the z30 is gaming centric
which is hilarious for a blackberry to
begin with but but that's also it's also
hilarious for a dual-core device you
know right and and what what cracks me
up about this is when blackberry was
marketing this e10 a big part of its
marketing campaign was the fact that you
could use it one-handed and you could do
all of those blackberry gestures with
just your thumb and you know it was
really quick and easy and convenient
there's no way that you can use the 5
inch device one-handed as easily so do
you guys think that this is AT&amp;amp;T
trolling blackberry they're like you
know what it'd be funny let's go let's
make let's make blackberry make a 5 inch
dual core phone
unless let's throw him a million bucks
or whatever that though they'll make
this ridiculous blackberry will sell it
for a week and a half we'll pull an HTC
first discontinued it just just mess
with them a little bit so it's like it's
like a high school bully yeah it's like
it's like that yeah it's the corporate
equivalent of a of ATT stuffing
blackberry into a lot what's happening
and I think is just a sad like we laugh
about at at a time but then when you go
home and you think about it so it's just
sad a single tear rolls down your cheek
poor babe the nice Canadian kid who's
always trying so hard so damn hard but
he's always about three years behind
everybody else and I was getting abused
from you know a company with a CEO with
a you know a supervillain mustache
seriously like somebody needs to teach
Larry Ellison how to connect this like
does he not know how did like does he
realize that nobody shaves this part
like wisp along with the man also is
he's definitely a multiple facelift
something I'm convinced Oh without it
without a doubt his skin is way too
shiny and it's just like taught oh yeah
I taking of which speaking of which I'm
just gonna completely derail us as if it
weren't they were already know if we're
fully off the rails so in terms of shiny
skin your American dudes have shiny
bread which I do not understand do not
trust shiny worries me shiny bread yes
with burgers and hot dogs oh well
there's a literary oisin on it well then
oh that's because it's either moist or
greasy and there's nothing wrong with
greasy bread no no no it's almost
plasticky does it does a point like I
know you can like egg glaze bread and do
that kind of stuff like a brioche or
whatever but no this is just the way
this tool is red delicious booty bread
well I don't I don't have a good answer
for you but what I can tell you is that
America sets trends and if we decide
that the world is going to eat should I
need bread then damnit Vlad Europe is
going to be eating shiny bread in six
months to a year like that is not a joke
because you guys invented shiny apples
and we have them here as well chut will
shiny apples that's usually just like a
wax coating on the Apple right I think I
don't know man it I mean the thing is
when the Apple weighs like a pound it
looks amazingly spherical you're like
yeah that doesn't really seem entirely
natural I mean when I will personally
when I'm at the grocery store because I
shop for a lot of apples I consider
myself a bit of an apple connoisseur I'm
currently on an ambrosia kick but I'm
sure that as apple season picks up we'll
be moving back to the honeycrisp I look
for a good and of it I look for a good
spherical Apple III don't necessarily
look for glossy or matte apples but I do
like a nice spherical Apple because that
tells you there's a lot of flash on the
Apple because it's very cool but it
could be misshapen is to be really
fleshy that's true that's true a lot of
things in life lab on which point of
colors man that you can never tell just
by the outside how much of a car you're
gonna get on the inside because of the
stone so like oh yeah avocados sometimes
have freakishly large stones a
interesting fact about that vm the
British unit of weight measurement the
stone is based on one avocado stone no I
oh my god I guess I I just want to say
that I was dropped by the google hangout
for maybe 15 to 20 or 30 seconds and I
just came back in and you guys are still
talking about produce for you you were
keeping it smooth yeah I mean blight and
I dan I like I I wasn't ready to
announce it yet but maybe now's the time
Vlad and I are starting a produce
podcast that is what
calling to put you on the spot Vlad I
don't think we've come up with a name
yet have we yes cause of la de kado show
the logic Otto yeah it's gonna be me and
everybody just kind of not in the head
saying yes that is really why's this is
an amazing we can have real carrot facts
on as a guest love it I love it anyway
seriously mobile technology instead of
mobile food yeah we were actually a lot
of like phone stuff to talk about still
so LG finally I'm gonna actually use
finally here just because they like
unofficially did like four times in a
row but they finally announced the g 20
last week and it is literally the it's
like the bizarro galaxy s4 that's just
the best way I can put it it's a good
way of putting it yeah the biggest
distinction from the galaxy s4 is that
LG has done the buttons completely new
software rather than galaxy s4 having
the physical home button and stuff by
then and it moved the power button and
volume keys to the back of the phone
party in the back it's revolutionary
when LG was announcing this thing they
you know mentioned numerous times you
know design innovation and you know
ergonomics and all this stuff and it's
like I I want to give them credit for
designing something different with a
mobile phone but then I want to like
take away that credit because of the
stupid design that they made well you
know I I was on the verge cast last
Thursday talking about the g2 and I'll
echo something I said over there with
today I feel like whenever LG this true
Samsung too but but LG whenever they
produce really any product but
particularly a phone I get the sense
that they have like a bazillion like
super talented engineers that are being
run by like horse ebooks basically like
there's a designer who is like the human
equivalent of horse ebooks oh it's just
like coming up with these insane specs
and engineers are just nodding their
heads and like really faithfully
executing those facts what's it like the
thing is like LG is usual
one of the first on the market with like
these high-end high-end specs right like
it was yeah if I remember correctly LG
was the first one in the market with a
dual core processor phone is the first
one in the market with a 720p display in
a phone now it's going to be the first
one in the market really with a
Snapdragon 800 but I couldn't care less
about this phone like I've virtually no
desire to want to go out and buy this
phone ya know that LG is not skating to
where the puck is motorola is at the
forefront of this post's pack universe
that we're living well this android
based postback universe that we're
living in LG is a mile behind and i
think i mean like they're not going to
be a leader in this business as long as
they're they're playing this game of
like doing what Samsung did six months
later and with the buttons in the back
like it's yeah and and just to point out
the plastic show of the g2 is exactly as
shiny and glossy as the food we've been
discussing and as a galaxy s4 Andy
discussing to when you pick when you
pick up the the g2 like the first thing
I noticed is just how plasticky and
glossy it feels and that's exactly what
i noticed when i pick up a galaxy s4 um
I mean the I think the biggest thing
with this event and with this launch was
I was thinking about topics for today
show today and I was like the g2 did
that happens as recently as this past
week did that happen between the last
podcast and this one because like you
say that they've leaked they've pre
announced they've released information
they don't teasers amazingly obscure
abstract teasers that you don't really
understand what they have to do with the
phone and any functionality that you
might desire out of a phone so they done
all of that noise and then the event
happens and you don't feel any more
enlightened than before the event and
it's just like the phone is now just
kind of fading into the background well
exactly because we don't know when it's
going to be released and or when it's
going to be available to buy and how
much it's going to cost like those are
the two things that LG could have held
on to to announce at this event right
after pretty much confirming everything
else about the phone and then all these
leaks that happened he could have held
onto price and availability and it
didn't even give us that
yeah but again ten to two shows credit
20 G's credit they are using an IPS
display in this phone which I think that
many AMOLED haters nilay hint hint will
appreciate but I mean I mean it doesn't
HTC use an IPS display here's that major
Tecna better display a bet yeah I mean
it we have good alternatives to AMOLED
if you really hate AMOLED I mean I guess
I guess if you want a really glossy
plastic phone but hate AMOLED screens
and you like the buttons on the back
this is the one for you and you'd like
all the features of the phone to end
with on in capital letters boom LG just
created your dream device I do like the
one feature i like which they cribbed
from nokia from years ago is the double
tap to wake you just tap my phone twice
and it wakes up which is like it's such
a brain dead simple feature that I wish
every single phone had yeah now that you
know what's nice I don't know knock on
feature not the latest xperia
smartphones have it but i know that the
experience that tablet has double tap to
wake I've never seen under the xperia
phone unless they've been updated since
i've used them um but yeah i'm the same
way as you would it's like if you can do
it in tablet it makes perfect sense you
should be able to do it on the phone and
I'm a hundred percent with you like we
can actually do away with the power
button if we just had double tap to wake
like you could have a software button or
software functionality something that
you can have when the quick toggles many
or whatever to turn the screen enough
I'll EE that would be really annoying
guys can we talk about a much more
important aspect of the g2 launch which
is that 20 were injured in a g2 launch
events where was it this is in Korea
right this is in Korea yeah um you know
I'm pretty fuzzy on the details on that
one so that I think the deal was that
they tied g2's to helium-filled balloons
and then like a bunch of people showed
up with BB guns and started shooting at
the balloons oh man and it's just yeah
and then and then a bunch of people got
hurt LG apologized he was big it was
big deal but the bottom line is that uh
20 people getting injured at a launch
event for your device does not bode well
for uh for the device muro dem associate
or man is publicity even kind of
indecisive you're right it casts a pall
on the on the device uh it is the web
I'd put it I would not personally be
keen on endorsing a product that had
injured 20 innocent civilians but that
well you know what Chris no no it's cuz
I'm really harsh but no it's actually
gonna ask concern to the place because
you know in order for you to be able to
endorse the device your first
qualification is that you have to know
pretty much nothing about okay that's
what we found out with guys like Robert
Downey jr. and all of the other
celebrity endorsements that we've seen
and yes I am using this is a awesome
segue to talk about HTC's new promo
campaign which is silly and daft but I
don't know might appeal to some people
which is without any journey the the
problem I mean HTC is not a stranger to
what I would consider to be like edgy
aggressive uh marketing the the problem
is that I feel like the only the only
way that a company can get a lot of
attention for its it's a smartphone ad
campaign is by saying something really
dumb about Apple products which is what
which is what Samsung uh you know milked
for a very long time and apart from that
I don't know if there's material impact
on on on say I mean who knows maybe
Robert Downey jr. was the secret sauce
is the missing piece and HTC's puzzle
who knows I mean he is a popular guy he
kicked the cocaine habit years ago he's
cleaned up he's you knows iron man he's
iron man he was really Chaplin up on
that front but to me he's not very clean
because he used to in those
asa phones around i am man really so
he's already dabbled in the industry is
already value brand but you know there
is something that just really
disappoints me about the world about the
fact that you can just get somebody pay
them a whole heap of money to pretend to
care about your device and then all of
us can view these things maybe we're
entertained by the mega winner and then
just kind of at least subconsciously
think well this is the phone that Robert
Downey jr. pretended to like in an
effort so that's part of my purchasing
decision guys I I hate to interrupt
breaking news the LG view 3 specs of
leaked whoa 5.2 inch four by three
display oh oh he's blessed me again
Snapdragon 800 so it's literally a g2
that they stretched right like they
stretched it horizontally yeah it better
be a party in the back is all going to
stay but it better be a party in the
back and better have a capacitive stylus
it and instead of instead of an actual
digitizer but those are the two
hallmarks for me of a good view Chris as
far as I'm concerned this device shows
that LG has bolts so to me the LG g2
basically now acknowledges the fact that
that company has posed the name that is
and I was talking about the view is
still ok I'm sure I'm just saying like
you feel so badly with the view so many
times ok maybe the affair was battling
career but doing it again just
persisting with this failure of a device
is beautiful and the best part about it
is that i can i would put i would bet
somebody a crisp ten-dollar bill 10 US
dollars that it's going to be a verizon
exclusive in you privatize and call the
first one they had a special name for it
right I can't hear it's like totally
escaped me and I've never actually seen
what a in a verizon store
or B being actually used by a human
Verizon actually sewed the optimist for
you it's called it was called the
intuition maybe yeah how does the way I
think yeah no algae into into a cheese's
you guys are kidding me I think it was
it was sold for under a month a month I
would imagine because like it came out
so long after the view actually debuted
yeah that like it wasn't basically a
full cycle behind the view debuted at
like mobile world congress in February
and it can it like launched and Verizon
in like October of that year so it was
like a full eight months or something
silly like that yeah that's great anyway
let's acknowledge to a little correction
Chris was saying earlier that LG might
have be one of the first to have a 720p
display maybe it was down with me it was
probably me what so we have somebody CC
get in touch with us urgently urgently
stressing the fact that the regime was
the first 17 hey that was not me eyes up
to i see i would never get a fact
incorrect on this program buddy value
the sanctity of the verdi me too much
this is coming from the guy who confused
time cop in time crisis so I i I'm gonna
say it was probably me that that messed
up that that little stat there um but I
will stand by the fact that LG was the
first dual core phone yeah yeah that's
right suck up ah no scoop on that it was
code the LG star like way back in a day
the lucky gold star star you did get a
scoop on that and of course that phone
went on to become the the absolutely
spectacular g2x which is a phone that
appeared to be made out of silly putty I
owned one for several months and it like
it like everything was coming off of it
it was like what it it's one of the
first one of the worst not just phones
but one of the worst pieces of consumed
electron in my life if you guys are
deciding to the audio only of this or
are little
listen to it later or listen to after
the show and you're only listen to audio
you just missed probably one of the best
hand gestures from chris sigler ever and
he was describing the silly putty g2 or
g2x worst worst fun i think probably the
worst I've ever and that that's going
all the way back to like my sony zuma in
1998 and my motorola lifestyle before
that I told it is I am sorry Chris I
know I know I had a part in letting you
know about that fight so I apologize i
was excited about it like I I went down
to the tmobile store and voluntarily
issued them currency in exchange for
that it wasn't like it was a review unit
like this was a real phone that I bought
and yeah it was just awful hysterical
and never got upgraded like I I think
was i think paul o'brien of modaco in
the UK who is a good friend of the site
in just generally good human being um he
gave me a build of gingerbread for the
g2x what it appears you yeah out of pity
but it was what it was like everyone
thought it was about to be released for
the g 2 x and then it ended up being
released like a year like literally like
year later and i was like wow you know
like thank god uh Paul Bryant me of
course I didn't have the g2x very long
anyway cuz I you know it literally came
apart my hands like silly putty right
like silly buddy but you know what all
LG needed to do was put back buttons on
the back and they were golden they were
good to go so I'm glad that the g2 is
rectified but I have the stuck right now
by all the stock need to do yeah glad
icon over here they'll be back Vladek on
yeah excuse me um so we had a report go
up this last week about tracking the
ubuntu smartphone um the edge which was
announced was it three weeks ago now and
they a buncha was raising money through
indiegogo campaign needed to raise 32
million dollars in a month in order to
produce this thing
and unfortunately it doesn't look like
it's going to hit that goal um based on
I look pretty sure not to hate to go
have either of you contributed to this
campaign no I can't say I have yeah I
haven't either i feel like i have um bye
you know wishing it well contributed
good glad tidings and advice yeah but on
your let me ask you on your tax returns
every year do you deduct wishing well
like is that is that a tax-deductible
line item like fruit for charity you
know what you you can tease me about
that but yahoo revealed the details in
terms of its tumblr acquisition and it
spent 750 million dollars on goodwill
that's how many bought tumblr so my
wishing well i think that CEO level
performance and waiting about it what
does i wish i did said i wish that it
said like we spent 750 million on
goodwill another 200 on good tidings 50
million on like sheer seriously when you
actually like listen to the things that
some CEOs come out with you know the
speeches and the rah-rah the stuff is
like how much better is it how much more
work and contribution are they making or
somebody like me saying well it would be
nice if they made it you know shrug your
shoulders yeah i mean the thing that's
going to happen would do a bunch of a
jury is it's either going to fail in
this campaign if everything carries
honest it's going i mean it's
desperately desperately off track it's
its highest day of earnings with his
first day every day since then if it's
slower and slower and slower so it's
really never going to happen nobody
really expected them to make 32 million
in 30 days the only thing that can serve
as a campaign is just to have like one
big way or investor jump in and say okay
i'll give you guys like 24 million and
pursue this which I wouldn't rule out
there are enough like
I'd start up people out there that like
maybe someone is gonna be like yeah I'd
like to see this happen I mean it
shouldn't like it I don't know the
personal wealth of Canonical's mark
shuttleworth who is kind of like that
the head of ubuntu if it had one uh but
like you know pony up if you want I mean
I it's just that was a stupid thing to
say so I take that back but you know no
no I'm sorry if Jeff Bezos can just buy
the washington post without having any
idea what it wants to do with it I think
CEOs of you know spare cash to like fro
20 min another sport wait wait wait mark
shuttleworth is worth half a billion
dollars occurring oh well in that case
in Episode II up man like if you want to
make this happen you know you right now
I'm looking at the campaign there at 9.8
million dollars or almost nine point
nine million dollars there's eight days
left and they need to 32 million um you
know time time to write a 23 million
dollar check he spent I am I know imma
hang on how much did he spend to go to
space he spent he spent twenty million
dollars to go to space exactly that's
exactly how much it needs to complete
this campaign boom it's like what just
just you know take one year off from
space holidays why and you've got your
friggin mobile phone platform yes
exactly but you know you know I would
actually be kind of offended and I'll
feel betrayed if he does pull that as
like a last day maneuver like maybe he
all along planned whatever is left over
I'll just Pat it out and we have a big
success in yadda yadda yadda because
then I mean I don't know me all the perk
perks and packs that go along with being
listed on a crowdfunding site will be
appealing to people and they'll feel
more involved by funding it etc etc but
if you had the money to get this project
going you should be spending that money
already you should be getting our
project go like they can't afford to be
standing around waiting for money to
come in well so there are a couple
things to consider here right at white
Vlad I think you probably know more
about the backstory
than I do but I don't know if there's
any like basis to the 32 million number
if they just pull that out of thin air
as an arbitrary goal and two unlike
Kickstarter canonical can actually take
the the full balance minus V actually
I'm going to stop you right there Chris
because that's how I what I thought too
but actually was informed this afternoon
that it depends on the campaign that you
do on IndieGoGo and Canonical's campaign
actually says it right there on right
below contributed yeah it's a fixed
funding campaign which means that if all
32 million isn't reached canonical good
zip uh-huh so interesting well I wonder
what the what the basis is is the 32
million figure because yeah that's a
very good question like I would have
guessed that producing developing a top
and high-end smartphone like this is
supposed to be soup to nuts from
beginning end would cost more than 32
million dollars right oh yeah but
obviously they have their own funds that
their own reserves their own investments
etc etc but I also do you think that is
kind of you know very rough estimate and
I just kind of write that a figure and
said okay we'll do that I mean to me
it's kind of like the top stuff that the
US did it's like how many billions and
trillions of dollars do we need to
rescue the economy I don't know like
1,000,000,000,000 seven trillion I don't
really know and it's like I just feel
like they're doing it this same thing
like nobody's going to be able to I
Timaeus how they go to spend 30 million
in order to deliver smartphone yeah i
don't i just can't care that much about
this phone i know there are people who
are like really into i mean every time
we write about this phone it gets a ton
of interest and comments and traction in
general but yeah we're actually
surprised every time how much interest
there actually is in the the above to
device yeah and I mean like from a from
a purely philosophical standpoint I
understand the interest and like don't
get me wrong like some of the UX
elements
that they're the Canonical's trying to
push our cool and Vlad I know you played
with the with it but uh if I I mean do
we really want to like I am so far
beyond the point where like I can get
excited about a cool brand new platform
because we've just been burned too many
times at this point wow that's
absolutely correct absolutely right and
any other if you remember the Yolo guys
you know the ones you're trying to
resurrect me go they're trying to do
something similar as well yeah and it's
just the case that at this point mobile
software I mean if there was food as
ever this year has all these issues that
bogus and annoys but it has involved
they has moved forward like when you
mentioned gingerbread I kind of you know
shivered a little bit because those were
dark days man those were the days will
you really really needed you're freaking
android update fix yes everything was
busted and wrong cuz okay I don't know
how the g two x's on tmobile but in
Europe the g2 it would crash just by
looking at it the wrong way there's a
nightmare yeah and the fingers we don't
have those issues anymore and this is
the reason why I Android can go so long
still kind of iterating gradually
instead of having these major massive
upgrades and updates things things have
reached a high level of competence now
so the reason you're not getting excited
is the reason I'm not getting excited
when I try to bring you back in january
i think i was showing off for Nexus S or
Galaxy Nexus it had all these nice
little gestures and you I interactions
and things like that but it was laggy
you know and if you're not going to show
people a snappy quick performance that
goes along with a nice inventive UI and
paradigm then they're just not going to
get excited because they won't both the
quality and the inventiveness together
you can't just give him one or the other
I mean I guess we were just kind of two
pickets but it's just why why why saddle
yourself with the poor experience when
there's better options in the market
that's just something that it's okay and
yeah we are talking about people
spending their money right and and did
not like us they're not going to go
through you know two dozen phones for
reviews and as Chris put it so
beautifully issuing currency to mobile
phone shops right so you only buy one
for a year or whatever and ultimately
you want to get whatever causes you the
least paint its country with everything
in life come to think of it pretty much
that's why we don't all live in Hawaii
man it might be a pretty awesome idea
but it's like yeah well you know what on
the beach I don't know about that yeah
just be boring you know like weather is
always good like you know yours fishing
all day at some point gonna be like you
know I want I want some action I want a
nice nice nor'easter to come through
here just just mess mess my stuff up
right I mean it the only reason the
other thing that's actually holding back
from Hawaii is that I think the internet
there is like completing utter garbage
so you could go there but you'd only be
able to offer like tweets yeah so that
would be it that's all the bandwidth
you'd have sunny today like yesterday
sofa surfers good yeah yeah hang out
under the palm trees pick some avocados
Tokiko Hawaii I think so well no no
they're mostly in like the color glass
yeah southwest u.s. yeah California and
then like parts of South America I think
um I think that you know what you can
find in Hawaii is a nice coconut if
you're into that sort of thing and of
course pineapple yeah the iconic uh
Hawaiian fruit the pineapple you know
but I'm thinking maybe there aren't any
actual avocados in Hawaii but I think it
from has a climate for it and now the
idea of being of an avocado farm owned
in Hawaii is really startin to abuse me
and Vlad you could specialize you could
become like a windows like hybrid like
crossbreeding experts and like make the
stone smaller
on smaller so like your whole-- like
claim to fame will be like oh my
avocados have like the most flesh
because they have a tiny stone inside
it's a great point it's square foot
which actually makes me wonder how do
other colors reproduce well when two
avocados love each other very much they
make them a great big commitments to
each other uh and they get married yes I
get married couple of avocado sequence
Erica do they have to be a male in a
FEMA of akkad oh I i well you know our
fortunately our country is becoming more
progressive and now that that's no
longer the case this is getting really
weird you have any more fun stuff to
talk because of a pile of Windows Phone
news talk about so I eyewitness foes try
to join us segue into this and like I
can't I can't get myself to do that
there's a you know updates are coming to
Windows Phone that include things like
rotation lock and text message thinking
to your computer which is a bona fide
useful features that we always seem to
like every time we see see it shown
somewhere and right now you can get big
weather news sports and finance apps on
your windows phone so no no good night
know if you've been waiting for those
that was my listen to are you interested
in any of these Bing apps the answer is
no I mean rotation lock that was the for
me that was the you know that was the
deal maker like that was like you know i
used i use the 1020 and I'm like man you
know it sounds perfect but there's no
rotation lock so you know I put the
phone aside and like so this is really
exciting news for me I have this look
all kidding aside at this point I'm
waiting for Windows Phone 9 that all
these incremental updates are not going
to change my opinion about the platform
like it's just not so I mean in again
like I know the windows phone is great
for a lot of people i know the apps are
like ninety percent of the way in tom
we'll get we'll talk about this but Tom
had a great piece on these inventive
developers or like trying to close the
gaps
but as someone who's like super heavily
invested in the Google ecosystem like
the ongoing like cold relationship
between these two companies is just
making lot lives of Google users very
difficult you know it's funny I got I've
got like an anecdotal relate thing I can
relate to that it's and it's this
weekend I switched my wife over from her
iphone 4s to my nexus 4 because she'd
been complaining about her for us as
governor issues or whatever size put it
over there and because she uses Google
services it was one of the most seamless
transitions ever her contacts our
calendar her email everything is just
like you know I had her sign in and it's
done I and you know you couldn't really
do that on Windows Phone certainly not
as seamlessly and as easily as you could
say just switching between iOS and
Android right yeah it's a problem and
and and to put you know to put either my
wife is not a techie person at all she's
very much a normal user who uses her
phone for facebook and pinterest so uh
you know it's it's not just you know
people who are super tech-heavy like
maybe we are having very interested in
in gadgets and tech that are in that
situation there's a lot of normal people
that at the exact same situation yeah
and it's cut its kind of another
situation before Microsoft as well I
think because the company's been so used
to just being so dominant that everybody
being familiar with Windows now is
facing the same situation with Google
exactly what you just rated then in the
fact that you use all the google web
services and then you go to android and
whatever your level familiarity with
smartphones there is something that
you're familiar with there is thing but
there are things that you just plug into
you know you have one log in and boom
all of a sudden you have your ducks you
drive etc etc your gmail and i don't
think that there's population this
massive people who are similarly fully
invested into into the micros microsoft
ecosystem so it's like canada sync
outlook email etc using all of those
services i don't think i agree with that
i think and it might be skewed all
it because you know that is a very vocal
population would hear from those people
a lot so I I don't have a good read on
how many people are actually in that
world in the wild but certainly at least
from a corporate perspective there there
are companies who are completely built
on a Microsoft stack maybe maybe that's
less true for people who are just like
you know building their personal lives
around a particular platform they're
probably less likely to change like you
say you know onenote outlook etc etc
than they are at Google but as a
corporate device Windows Phone certainly
makes a lot of sense for a lot of people
yeah I mean I mean I was talking about
the personal side as well yeah and let's
not bash Microsoft services like I
really think once they redesign them
they've worked pretty well like a
leukemia works well OneNote is very nice
those are good services I just don't
think that there are people whose entire
again personal lives revolve around that
like even the guys who come in and
destroy us for being such pipes of
haters would be like Microsoft fanboy
and gmail com that would be the English
resi they might not accept it admit it
but there we use even Steve job Barbara
gmail com yeah well let's talk about
Tom's report about these windows phone
developers I found this really
interesting tom went out and talked to a
bunch of Windows Phone developers that
are behind these like third-party
replacement apps for these big platforms
that are not yet on Windows Phone so
third party Instagram apps third party
vine apps what have you I mean if if
there's not an official app available
for Windows Phone chances are there's a
developer who's picked up the torch and
is trying their hardest to may bring
that experience to the Windows Phone
platform through these third-party apps
but they have a lot of struggles with
that they you know are obviously not in
on the inside door of development at the
company so like they don't know what
instagrams next move is they don't know
where they're going exactly Instagram
could arbitrarily change things which
happened a couple weeks ago and all of a
sudden these apps stopped working
because these apps offense essentially
reverse engineer these Instagram api's
and and a slight change can just render
them
useless so it's almost like you know I
feel bad for these guys see that are
developing these ass because say it's
it's and they say this that they do this
not really to make a profit but just
because they want to get more people on
Windows Phone platform and I think one
of them said that you know I gave my my
significant other Windows Phone device
and she wanted to use whatever it was
pinterest or vine or something and the
app didn't exist so I went out and wrote
one which is like you know such a like a
great story in a heartwarming thing but
like it seems like there it's just a
losing battle to me yeah if losing
battle and there's also it isn't it
certainly isn't universally true but
there are cases where developers have
run into legal trouble with their apps
but I guess I mean like what's the vine
app six seconds or whatever I think so
yeah yeah like that that's still working
as far as I know yeah and to clarify the
the problem with Instagram that happened
a few weeks ago Instagram actually
changed things back to the way they were
so those Instagram apps are working once
again but it's just an example of you
know that could happen in the future
again you know all right as Instagram
updates its platform rolls out new apps
for iOS and Android uh it's not
concerned about what happened some
windows phone if it doesn't have an
official presence sir right well
instance was the name of that
application on Windows Phone yeah I mean
I I think you know I I certainly don't
want to advocate for companies like like
Twitter and Facebook to pull you know to
cause these apps to get pulled but you
can kind of see it from their
perspective that like you know for from
a user's perspective the the experience
that they have and end up like uploading
a vine or uploading Instagram through
these third party and supported tools is
still kind of like part and parcel with
using Instagram and Vine and if it's not
a great experience then that reflects
poorly on Instagram vine right so
they're playing it so that can be one of
the reasons why these companies
ultimately ask these apps to get pulled
and that's always a risk for these guys
which sucks for everybody but you know
from the users perspective quite often
these apps are paid apps and and so that
you know you might just lose your mom
any moment right and to be fair you know
a lot of times in order to make these
apps work the developer has to invest
considerable resources in not only
developing and writing the app and
reverse engineering anything but
frequently they require a middleman
server that needs to be run and
maintained yeah and that and and so that
the developer does have cost it's not
like they're just trying to scam
somebody have two bucks because they
want to use Instagram on the Windows
Phone but from a user perspective if
you've paid two dollars for this app you
kind of have an expectation that it'll
work and there's always that chance that
it'll stop working right yeah but the
thing is the developer any well I know
about the user the developer is an old
anything by guys like Instagram and
Twitter and exactly as Chris was saying
like we usually take the more Communist
side on this podcast but in this case
it's kind of like if an app makes your
user experience I mean vine is just so
limited it's kind of a joke to me but if
an app makes you use experience seem
worse than it actually is if it you know
degenerates your brand you're fully
entitled to you know get rid of it and
I'll you know if necessary else
Microsoft to take measures to make those
apps incompatible the person or the
company that everybody needs to be
pointed fingers and question marks do is
basically Microsoft because they're the
ones responsible for the platform and
that that platform has the developers
who want to do things it it has the
users who want to use those services but
as we were saying a week or two ago but
not get being frustrated with Microsoft
things just are moving quickly enough
particular with the official software
because that's the other thing the guys
who are fans of windows phone right now
essentially wasting their time you know
doing things that should be there anyway
it should be an official instagram app
they should be an official app for all
of these things microsoft should i mean
that's the other thing I've kind of
interrupting myself here but Microsoft
has the money and the moment Microsoft
really isn't make it with us from
profitable to my knowledge it's my
understanding so why not take a big
incentivize the hell out of Kazakh
Instagram and everybody else to be on
your platform to have a proper fully
functioning app you spend as much as you
need to spend but they're doing and then
what they have on the upstair be because
I think in some cases they're just like
no like what we don't want to like you
know that we don't want to bother
supporting a platform that we're not
seeing enough enough traction on because
you know that Microsoft has been behind
the scenes hustling everybody really
high and they always talk about at every
event at every developer event they're
like you know we got 47 out of the 50
top apps we're working on the others
like you know they're definitely out
there pounding the pavement trying to
get these guys on board and I I'm
positive that there are blank checks
involved like especially for the big
guys like Instagram no question about it
but it's just the whole story with
Instagram is just kind of amusing
because of how much Microsoft worked
with facebook to integrate facebook into
the whole Windows Phone platform and and
net there's still this huge component of
face that Facebook owns that is missing
and they can't see now get that two to
work together so that that just kind of
strikes me is like obviously Microsoft
and Facebook have talked about windows
phone before you know it's just not not
not happening i guess it's weird again
let me ask you what what's your give us
here your your your 30-second overview
of the the weather app situation on
windows phone is it good as a bad
doesn't need help um so it's been a
while since i've checked out the latest
weather ask for windows phone but
there's actually some really cool ones
on there that that good design and they
got they make use of the live tiles
really well so i would say that the
weather app situation is actually better
than you would say like maybe the main
street map situation okay i think if i
if i converted to Windows Phone weather
apps would not be the thing that I was
hurting for okay it's because because
the thing like with Windows Phone is
that there is a focus on design in the
platform then there is a focus in
aesthetics and making it look good and a
lot of the third party
app developers that are worth their salt
try to do their best to follow that and
to you know provide apps that that are
aesthetically pleasing and and weather
apps going to lend themselves to that
nature and so there are a bunch of
weather apps that do look good and make
use of the live tiles and are
informative and cool and all that fun
stuff so right blackberry 10 another
story yeah i think the n is shaping up
to wrap up the podcast because he just
took us to our usual down note i'm at
i'm not downer yeah i think we are
wrapped actually so we've been we've
been going for a good while here this
week so that is the verge mobile show

tuning in if you want you can follow us
on Twitter of course I'm DC seifert
vladas flat 7 of chris is e power and
dieter is back lon and of course feel
