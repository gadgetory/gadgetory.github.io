for being black the last week the
company unveiled one that was really
different project livewire a
surprisingly quiet electric bike
liveWires Harley Davidsons first
electric motorcycle but it isn't
actually going on sale anywhere
instead probably is touring it around
the country to get riders feedback it
kicks off today in New York City but
Harley let us take an early look at
livewire one of its stores in lower
Manhattan
livewire is a sleek electric bike it
almost looks like something off of a
movie set
but it's completely ready to ride it
goes from zero to 60 in under 4 seconds
and tops out at 92 miles per hour
for now though Harley isn't interested
in talking specs just how it feels on
the road I'm not a writer myself
although I did try out a stationary demo
just throughout the engine so we brought
in a friend of ours photographer and
motorcycle enthusiast first on film
provided by Manhattan Culbertson riding
an old Honda for a few years now so
livewire acquaintance literally took
them about five decades into the future
superlight it's really agile really like
the power just so smooth and so ones on
the highway I really want to go I just
want to open it up at night as awesome
even from owners of traditional Harley's
the immediate response is pretty
positive I'll be it with some hesitation
many saw it is a great starter bike and
a good option for those in the city but
unsurprisingly the absence of Harley's
classic sound was the big turn-off here
I think I'd probably missed the the
sound of the engine for sure like you
know the rhythm and like even like the
smell of gasoline like Italy like well
kind of nice about that romantic
this not writers only concerned either a
lot of the classic Harley Owners I spoke
with salt library's silence it's a big
safety issue I put my baffles out of my
my Honda and it just makes people you
know because otherwise it's like people
won't see those we make left-hand turns
in front of you and swerve in front of
you so it's like I mean this is so
silent it's like yeah there there's
definitely a safety issue one told me he
thought that an accident was guaranteed
on such a quiet bike Harley doesn't see
this out as a safety component though
the sound that you hear behind me right
now
is an engineered sound that we put into
the product that we feel is you know in
its own way very muscular for an
electric product so this isn't like any
other electric product that's out there
retail it's there for the emotion and to
that end it's distinctly different from
the Harley's that fans know and love one
of the biggest things about
harley-davidson is like the trademark
sound like everyone knows that sound you
can hear it coming from a mile away let
me know I don't know who this will feel
good
that's what Harley is out here to gauge
them if the writers won't buy it because
of the sound Harley's next iteration of
livewire whatever that may be might just
fix that
Harley won't say exactly where it sees
livewire going or when it'll put an
electric vehicle up for sale but it says
there's work to be done in the electric
vehicle market and it knows it can help
push that forward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
