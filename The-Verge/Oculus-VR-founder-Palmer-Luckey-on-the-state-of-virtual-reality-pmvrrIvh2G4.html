and I'm here at CES with oculus founder
Palmer Luckey in case you haven't been
paying attention the oculus rift just
started pre orders on Wednesday and so
it's going to be shipping a couple
months from now so I know you probably
haven't gotten to see a lot outside of
oculus but what's your feel for this
year VR at CES is a huge year for it I
mean it is a huge year it's not just
oculus there's a lot of other people
here with both hardware and software in
the virtual reality space and that's a
big change from a year ago or especially
two years ago when basically was just
oculus that was here and you know a
handful of other people now you have
really proof that this is a whole
industry that's moving together to try
and make this thing happen not just one
company there's mobile headsets their
desktop headsets there's all integrated
headsets like how is that going to play
out over the next few years well it's
hard to say over the next few years but
in the long run I've talked about this
before I think it's largely going to
converge towards all-in-one solutions
it's going to converge towards the
render horsepower being on the headset
or at least on your body whether it
plugs into your phone or it's built into
the headset itself that's not to say you
won't be able to tether to more powerful
devices when you want you know to have
higher quality experiences but for many
people there's going to be a limit to
how good the experience needs to get
before you just want the convenience of
having something that's you know able to
work wherever you go without being
tethered to a big box yeah well you've
also said that's going to converge with
augmented reality and I'm just wondering
are there any concrete steps that people
are taking towards that yet because they
still seem very distinct people are
taking concrete steps but i don't think
the things you're seeing it's the es
today are necessarily showing those
steps hmm like what should we be looking
for real augmented reality that has a
real understanding of the environment is
enable and is able to either place
objects in that environment well or
bring the real world into a digital
space and also represented well I don't
think that there's much in the way of
that going on here at CES I mean how
long do you think it might take us to to
see something like that can't say but
I'm assuming you're working on it I mean
we've it's no secret that we've acquired
a lot of computer vision companies
thirteenth labs nimble VR surreal vision
tech we showed off a video at oculus
connect that showed some of some of the
possibilities of doing real-time 3d
world capture and augmentation but we
don't have anything to really show
around that yet mmm yeah the other thing
I'm curious about is when so I've mented
reality things like the whole lens there
are a lot of applications that are not
consuming things a lot of applications
that are sort of active and more like
computing do you think we're going to
see that in Virtual Reality in the near
term I mean we are already seeing it
used for a lot of things like
architectural visualization medical
training people who are designing things
in CAD in virtual reality I'd argue
there's probably a lot more people using
VR for productivity and industrial
applications than a are right now er
there's a lot of concept stuff there's a
lot of you know look this will show you
how to install the screw in the place
that needs to go but there's very few
companies that are actually doing that
in real life yeah it was actually the
oculus touch is incredibly cool and it's
been great to see it is it sort of the
ultimate interface for your product it's
not necessary the ultimate interface
it's gonna be one one of I think it's
gonna be one of the main ways that we
interface I mean some applications
really you would do want to have like
full markerless fingered hand tracking
where you can just interact with things
that way for others you really do want
to have a prop you really do wanna have
haptic feedback you want to have some
form of reliable digital actuation like
buttons or triggers I think that touch
is going to complete I think that touch
is going to evolve over time but that
what we ship now and during the near
future is going to it's going to be
about as far as you get in terms of big
shifts kind of like when the first
computer mouse was created the mess we
have today are certainly better but they
are not radically different than the
concept of the first mice they think if
you're going to be using VR that
requires holding a prop only controller
the things that you do with touch are
going to be very similar to the things
you do with those types of controllers
in the future just sort of going beyond
that for a long time whenever I would
ask about Sony or HTC it would be we're
not in competition there VR space is
just trying to grow so when are you
going to be in competition you're
selling a product now well it's not
really about selling a product it's well
there's two things first of all
Sony's very much targeting the
playstation 4 market I don't think
there's going to be a lot of people who
would have bought a high-end PC and a
rift that decide to buy the design of my
place you should be our headset and said
I think people who have playstation
honestly that's almost certainly what
they're going to choose over investing
everything in a rift if they doin us
everything or if it's because they want
to have a higher quality experience and
they're willing to pay for it but I
don't think there's a mass market of
people who are necessarily willing to do
that it doesn't really become a
competition until it becomes a zero sum
game where when you sell a headset
that's me not selling a headset did you
know at a fair that is something close
to a one-to-one ratio right now the more
people there are on the VR space the
more be our developers will start making
VR games the more people there will be
that are interested in VR some time said
a lot is that the real battle is not us
versus other you know companies that are
getting into VR now it's all of us
together against the public perception
of virtual reality that's been built up
over the decades we have to convince
people that virtual reality is worth
using but they want to use it and they
want to wear this crazy thing on their
face no matter how slim it gets and
that's that's the uphill battle that
we're all fighting together and I'm glad
Sony's doing that and I'm glad that
HTC's doing that I'm glad that Samsung's
doing that I'm glad that all of us are
taking this taking this pretty seriously
do you think that there's a danger in
over-promising with VR still a lot of
people will talk about VR not just as
being there but it's like a teleporter
it's like literally being in a place do
you think that that's over selling
things I think that there is a risk of
doing that that is one of the things
that hurt virtual reality the last run
around you at Hollywood and you had
media and you had people in the virtual
reality industry hyping and PR up as
it's going to be this amazing thing it's
gonna absolutely change the world and I
think they were right in the long run
but at the time when you needed you know
a hundred-thousand-dollar SGI
workstation and you need is 50,000 r vr
headset you were getting 10 frames a
second @q vga resolution there was just
no way it was ever going to become a
consumer ready thing and what was
interesting about virtual reality a few
decades ago is that the people who were
most excited about VR was the ones who
had not tried it they could imagine what
it was going to be and that's what
excited them once they tried it they
realized that it had a long
to go and that's really what caused that
whole collapse today I think it's the
opposite when people try VR that's
usually when they're convinced people
who try VR ivory like they'll try it
Bell of a realistic expectation they
understand what they're getting and
they're able to understand how it'll get
better but they see that it actually
does make sense and that is going to be
a cool thing I think it's mostly people
who haven't tried VR who have
artificially inflated expectations and
the best thing we can do is get VR in
front of their eyes as fast as we can so
they can see what this is going to be
how it's going to get better and how
it's going to become part of their lives
well it's been great having you on and
