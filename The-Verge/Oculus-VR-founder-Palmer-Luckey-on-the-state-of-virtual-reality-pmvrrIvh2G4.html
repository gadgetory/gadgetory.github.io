i'm here at CES with oculus founder
Palmer Luckey in case you haven't been
paying attention the oculus rift just
started pre-orders on Wednesday and so
it's going to be shipping a couple
months from now so I know you probably
haven't gotten to see a lot outside of
oculus but what's your feel for this
year VR at CES is a huge year for it I
mean it is a huge year it's not just
oculus there's a lot of other people
here with both hardware and software in
the virtual reality space and that's a
big change from a year ago or especially
two years ago when basically it was just
oculus that was here and you know a
handful of other people now you have
really proof that this is a whole
industry that's moving together to try
and make this thing happen not just one
company there's mobile headsets their
desktop headsets there's all integrated
headsets like how is that going to play
out over the next few years well it's
hard to say over the next few years but
in the long run I've talked about this
before I think it's largely gonna
converge towards all-in-one solutions
it's gonna converge towards the render
horsepower being on the headset or at
least on your body whether it plugs into
your phone or it's built into the
headset itself that's not to say you
won't be able to tether to more powerful
devices when you want you know to have
higher quality experiences but for many
people there's going to be a limit to
how good the experience needs to get
before you just want the convenience of
having something that's you know able to
work wherever you go without being
tethered to a big box yeah well you've
also said that's going to converge with
augmented reality and I'm just wondering
are there any concrete steps that people
are taking towards that yet because they
still seem very distinct people are
taking concrete steps but I don't think
the things you're seeing it's the es
today are necessarily showing those
steps mmm like what should we be looking
for real augmented reality that has a
real understanding of the environment is
enable and is able to either place
objects in that environment well or
bring the real world into a digital
space and also represented well I don't
think that there's much in the way of
that going on here at CES I mean how
long do you think it might take us to to
see something like that can't say but
I'm assuming you're working on it I mean
we've it's no secret that we've acquired
a lot of computer vision companies 13th
Labs nimble VR surreal vision
Tec we showed off a video at oculus
connect that showed some of some of the
possibilities of doing real-time 3d
world capture and augmentation but we
don't have anything to really show
around that yet mm-hmm yeah the other
thing I'm curious about is when soive
mented reality things like the whole
lens there are a lot of applications
that are not consuming things a lot of
applications that are sort of active and
more like computing do you think we're
going to see that in virtual reality in
the near term I mean we are already
seeing it used for a lot of things like
architectural visualization medical
training people who are designing things
in CAD in virtual reality I'd argue
there's probably a lot more people using
VR for productivity and industrial
applications than AR right now here are
there's a lot of concept stuff there's a
lot of you know look this will show you
how to install the screw in the place it
needs to go but there's very few
companies that are actually doing that
in real life yeah it was actually the
oculus touch is incredibly cool and it's
been great to see it is it sort of the
ultimate interface for your products
it's not necessarily the ultimate
interface it's gonna be one one of I
think it's gonna be one of the main ways
that we interface I mean some
applications really you will do want to
have like full markerless fingered hand
tracking where you can just interact
with things that way for others you
really do want to have a prop you really
do want to have haptic feedback you want
to have some form of reliable digital
actuation like buttons or triggers I
think that touch is going to conflict' I
think that touch is gonna evolve over
time but that what we ship now and
during the near future is going to it's
going to be about it as far as you get
in terms of big shifts kind of like when
the first computer mouse was created the
mice we have today are certainly better
but they are not radically different
than the concept of the first mice they
think if you're going to be using VR
that requires holding a prop only a
controller the things that you do with
touch are gonna be very similar to the
things you do with those types of
controllers in the future you just sort
of going beyond that for a long time
whenever I would ask about Sony or HTC
it would be we're not in competition
they're VR space is just trying to grow
so when are you going to be in
competition you're selling a product now
well it's not really about selling a
product it's well there's two things
first of all Sony is very much targeting
the PlayStation 4 market I don't think
that there's gonna be a lot of people
who would have bought a high-end PC and
a rift that decide to buy the decided my
place you should be our headset and sent
I think people who have PlayStation
honestly that's almost certainly what
they're going to choose over investing
everything in a rift if they do in us
everything in a rift it's because they
want to have a higher quality experience
and they're willing to pay for it but I
don't think there's a mass market of
people who are necessarily willing to do
that
it doesn't really become a competition
until it becomes a zero-sum game where
when you sell a headset that's me not
selling a headset to you know at a fair
that is something close to a one-to-one
ratio right now the more people there
are in the VR space the more their VR
developers will start making VR games
the more people there will be that are
interested in VR some have said a lot is
that the real battle is not us versus
other you know companies that are
getting into VR now it's all of us
together against the public perception
of virtual reality that's been built up
over the decades we have to convince
people that virtual reality is worth
using that they want to use it and they
want to wear this crazy thing on their
face no matter how slim it gets and
that's that's the uphill battle that
we're all fighting together and I'm glad
Sony's doing that and I'm glad that
HTC's doing that I'm glad that Samsung's
doing that I'm glad that all of us are
taking this taking this pretty seriously
do you think that there's a danger in
over-promising with VR still a lot of
people will talk about VR not just as
being there but it's like a teleporter
it's like literally being in a place do
you think that that's over selling
things I think that there is a risk of
doing that that is one of the things
that hurt virtual reality the last run
around you had Hollywood and you had
media and you had people in the virtual
reality industry hyping and VR up as
it's gonna be this amazing thing it's
gonna absolutely change the world and I
think they were right in the long run
but at the time when you needed you know
$100,000 SGI workstation and you need
this $50,000 VR headset you were getting
10 frames a second at QVGA resolution
there was just no way it was ever going
to become a consumer ready thing and
what was interesting about virtual
reality a few decades ago is that the
people who were most excited about VR
was the ones who had not
they could imagine what it was gonna be
and that's what excited them once they
tried it they realized that it had a
long way to go and that's really what
caused that whole collapse today I think
it's the opposite when people try VR
that's usually when they're convinced
people who try VR ivory like they'll try
it they'll have a realistic expectation
they understand what they're getting and
they're able to understand how it'll get
better
but they see that it actually does make
sense and that is gonna be a cool thing
I think it's mostly people who haven't
tried VR who have artificially inflated
expectations and the best thing we can
do is get VR in front of their eyes as
fast as we can so they can see what this
is gonna be how it's gonna get better
and how it's gonna become part of their
lives well it's been great having you on
and thank you thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
