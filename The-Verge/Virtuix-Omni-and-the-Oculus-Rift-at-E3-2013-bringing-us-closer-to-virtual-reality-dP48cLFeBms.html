with yen who built the Omni which is the
Omni is the first virtual reality
interface to move freely and naturally
in your favorite game so you walk around
in here and you move in your game that's
right Johnny puts your brain on your
body in the game so you can walk on the
platform in 360 degrees you can run jump
Crouch and you're in the game so I've
seen your Kickstarter you guys got
funded right oh yeah we got funded in
three and a half hours I think people
kind of want this and I want this I want
to try this so just I'm gonna put on the
shoes all right yeah so these are like
friction lofric G's are low friction
shoes with a bit more friction on the
toe so our objective is to mimic a
natural gait so that I feel like you're
walking naturally and the key to that is
to have a specific sole configuration
that just allows you to walk naturally
and freely here in the virtual world
it's like bowling
yes yeah it has a special soul as well
that's that's right and how did you what
what what led you to decide that
slipping and sliding on a on a surface
was going to be the way to do this you
know the only is a result of two years
of experimenting and researching and
throughout our research I started
realizing that the best way to make a
device like this in an affordable way it
should make a passive device or no
motorized parts no moving parts I keep
it as simple as possible to keep it cost
down it's pretty free so now what is
this this is a support belt and I'll
give it to you once you're in here we'll
get to that later and it's just a
prototype so we're gonna what I want to
do now is guide you through because this
is your first time you never done it
before so - just be careful sighs a lot
of disk wavers hold on with your both
hands it's gonna be slippery let me
close this for now oh yeah dude and so
what I want to do this is be great for
dancing is to
that could be if it can close this so
what what I want you to do first is hold
on with both hands and we're going to
start with small steps okay so when I
hold on and just take a small step
forward and put your lean forward a
little bit and put your weight on your
forward foot just like you're walking
natural light yeah that's it that's that
you got it
so while I'm walking how is this
tracking my moon so right now we're
using the Kinect to track your walking
movement the connector extracts your
feet in the final version that will be
released to our backers will have an
integrated tracking solution we don't
want people to have to buy a Kinect even
though Google support Kinect so to
accommodate an integrated solution so
give it a couple more seconds actually
are you doing great it's like a
treadmill there we go the next step is
to give you the support bones
second of all Abbadon it's going to be
too high yeah one one disadvantage of
this prototype is that you know we put
the ring and kind of my sides it's nicer
to use it would have to ring Razer the
ring a little bit alright our next step
is to put you in the game all right so
this is we're working with half-life 2
right now yeah we'll make it work with
half-life 2 let's put this on hold on
one second I'm going to activate the
Kinect but I need to get out of the
frame for that
here's a gun let me give you the gun now
just girlfriends
I am half-life right now talking that I
feel like I'm gone from the world yeah
welcome back okay but you think last
thing I remember I was chilly
yeah good this is all a dream maybe it
was well some camera so it's pretty real
what do you think yeah when I when I got
it I got it yeah no I really felt like I
was I was doing it it's definitely
working some muscles that I'm not used
to so maybe that's me stepping wrong
well I gotta say you you went all in
right away without any getting used to
tell you them so it takes some time to
get used to the Omni it takes about five
to ten minutes okay so when you're doing
it without the ribs you're doing great
then you put the rift on right away you
get disoriented you start sliding right
you forget you forget whatever you
learned in the two minute training we
did I think maybe it's because like what
I'm looking around I want babies should
be you know yeah commiserate English is
not my first language what I feet to be
where I think compared to my or my head
is so I kept on like I go I'm like slash
I didn't know that because my I felt
like I was upright in the game I was
looking up for something yeah so see
even of you you walk again without Oriya
so you know you're doing it great again
see that that's what it is you're
walking nationally it looks natural
yeah the difficulties is is shipping one
of these to my apartment and then I can
find that place for it in my apartment
it convinced you my roommate that this
is a really good connection connecting
your roommate should be easy
I would hope oh well I gotta give her
this it's gonna work out I thank you
good it's the Omni
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
