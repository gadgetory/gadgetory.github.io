where asus has just revealed the new
platform 2 now you hear me saying a pad
phone and I'm standing here with a
tablet of what's going on well the thing
is as you've seen with the original
padfone this is a tablet and a phone
it's two devices in fact it's just one
device this is just a 10.1 inch display
1280 x 800 resolution and it has a five
thousand million power battery the big
difference with this docking station is
that it's now significantly thinner it's
a smaller battery but a significantly
thinner which is a big advantage and
also has this new 13 pin customary dock
connector that asus has come up with its
post micro USB and MHL connections but
it's not really the exciting part
exciting part is new smartphone it is a
4.7 inch device 1280 by 720 resolution
which is kind of standard nowadays in
android flagship smartphones compares
very well with the HTC One X they seem
to be about the same size they're about
the same thickness and weights as well
however the platform 2 has been upgraded
with a new quad-core processor it has
the quad-core Snapdragon s4 this is
something that a sooz describes is a
cortex a15 class processor and tells us
it obliterates every other Android phone
in terms of benchmarks we have to check
that out but really it's not about
benchmarks about the user experience
which looking at it right now it's
running Ice Cream Sandwich not very
happy about that we would prefer for it
to be coming with jelly bean
particularly since the release date
hasn't been specified here it's just
before the end of the year but issues
promises jelly bean upgrade soon but
still it snappy it's quick it's still
masseuses my old android skin on top on
top of Android 4.4 and just looking
around it he have highly customized
notification screen but if you
toggles and notifications the app tray
looks relatively close to stock and you
go the multitasking buttons the Android
keys once again capacitive as opposed to
on screen as Google likes to do them now
apart from the new 4.7 inch display in
super IPS plus it has chops eggs Oh
technology so on the first shell shop XO
displays that will take a look at it
does have some very good viewing angles
looking at it from the side come around
to the back none of the big upgrades is
a 13 megapixel camera this is Sony made
backside illuminated sensor has an LED
flash on the side and has an F 2.4 lens
now one of the things that a su shot su
stout is a particular advanced for this
phone the platform to is that it can do
100 frames at six frames a second
continuous shot that's faster than
galaxy s freak faster than the 1x and
again speaks to the performance of this
new device but they megapixel camera you
might have already seen it on the Xperia
T from Sony it looks to be the same
sense of it also has the same 30
megapixels that's it that's our first
look at the asus padfone 2
you
