david pierce and i have yet to take off
this oculus rift my doctors are worried
about my mental state but it's okay
they're not real this is 90 seconds on
the verge a federal appeals court today
struck down the FCC's net neutrality
rules saying the agency didn't have the
authority to impose rules on carriers
the ruling will now allow internet
service providers to make some traffic
run faster or block other services but
the carriers must tell subscribers what
they're doing Verizon responded by
saying the FCC could no longer quote
impose last century's common carriage
requirements on the internet and
insisting that service will only get
better actor Michael Douglas just got a
very small big role Marvel has announced
that Douglas will play dr. Henry Pym in
edgar wright's ant-man him is the first
Marvel character to Don the persona of
ant-man followed by Scott Lang will be
played by Paul Rudd plot details are
still being kept tightly under wraps but
then again the movie is still far from
Ruiz ant-man will crawl into theaters on
July thirty-first 2015 and finally good
news and bad news good news the newsroom
is coming back bad news it's the last
time I'll be saying Aaron Sorkin's HBO a
melodrama will return for a third and
final season the new season has been up
in the air as Sorkin has been busy
writing his Steve Jobs biopic but the
writer has reportedly finished the
script hey three seasons is a great run
for a show and whether it ends on a high
or a low it will always be better than
studio 60 that's it for today's top
stories coming up tomorrow I continue to
perfect my time machine and travel a
hundred years into the past no we on
David close to it it's not worth it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
