joanna stern is standing next to the
lovely delightful joanna stern give her
a round of applause so so you know
Joanna's kind of our resident windows
laptop expert and I recently expressed a
kind of a dislike for windows which was
just haunting me I said windows feels
like poison to me on a podcast and and
it really was affecting to a lot of
people a lot of Windows fans and
draining out Jenna got this idea that
that that she could provide a better
windows experience for me that's what
I'm well we were talking about this and
she was telling me okay well if you get
a laptop here's what you need to do and
I thought people are gonna get these for
the holidays are gonna get a new windows
laptop and it's gonna have stuff on it
they're not gonna like well they'll have
some stuff that they do like but you're
sure I understand that but it's gonna
have like blue air and you have kind of
like put together a little guide to
thank you anyways window poison the
antidote yes I'm hoping after this you
are gonna be using Windows I'm gonna be
a full-time way this user does it
anything's possible so let's walk
through what would you get a few
different steps here so this is a
samsung right out of the box hopefully
we're getting that there and one of the
big problems is crap where you mentioned
it before yeah I hate it hate it litters
them do you have you met anybody who's
like you do it i really like crap where
I like a computer to be really bloated
when i get it i bet actually this
company that makes this software like
scrobbler because they wouldn't have a
product they would have a business there
whenever business coming down from a
different angle yeah so slim cleaner is
the first thing you probably want to put
on your system and you can actually
select different programs we're not this
is not slim cleaners that paid for an
advertiser yeah Joanna just thinks it's
a good change on this and this basically
will find bloatware on your computer
exactly and what's actually interesting
about this is like me and you we know
what to delete right we know like oh we
probably should get rid of this
wildtangent games what I do is I just
erase hard drive and put on something I
put it that I put it away okay
well somewhere in our audience know what
to delete so what you can actually do
here as you can see reviews of things
that people like said oh yeah you
wouldn't want this and you can come in
here you can they're actually
crowdsourcing so yeah on this piece of
software people will will basically tell
you this is a you want to keep this
piece of blue write comments people but
if it you know the things you can be
careful things like the big bar for it
since 91 people said we like this well I
bet at Microsoft a lot of people like no
I mean maybe it's great I don't know I'm
just saying maybe you don't want the
Bing bar I personally don't want the
Bing bar right there you go but so
that's one way to do it you could
obviously also come into the control
panel here this is a little bit yrs to
actually just go find the application
exactly I believed in my hands so like
you know and then there's the step the
major step this is the sledgehammer this
is a sledgehammer you buy windows seven
you install it yeah you get rid of
everything I think that's what I would
do that seems easier but it's like how
much is that are not 120 120 hours so
that's like the sledgehammer is gonna be
the doing it on your own is the scalpel
yeah and then what would you call the
slim cleaner is like something in
between I like a rusty knife
yeah he's doing one of these moves a gun
that's a gun okay all right so I've
taken to blow air off of my computer now
thank you try yeah so this one here you
kind of you might want to get rid of
sort of the generic Windows desktop I
think that might not be and that might
be what you don't like about like I'm
not crazy about I am like it's not it
doesn't strike me as particularly
beautiful ok you know maybe like you
don't like the icons on the left side
you like I'm on the right maybe you want
it's sort of a widget type of thing so
this is this is this actually looks
really nice yes I mean this is really
cool i've used two different things here
when i change the desktop background
which is great bag of its great choice
first thing you should do to change the
desktop background like this one has HP
logo on it so the other thing i did here
was I installed rainmeter and rainmeter
actually lets you sort of like a
launcher pro for like android launcher
pro for windows you can put widgets up
here I've got battery about time again
you can customize all these things you
can put your I've got the verge logo or
the the verge feeds coming through here
it's good as over here you can i'm using
something called fences where you can
organize all your desktop back to these
so these are just aliases to apps are
these do these windows now these don't
snap in place so you can move these
around well how are you how do you get
things perfect you line them up by hand
oh you get bit if you put a piece of
tape on the screen yes that's great I
feel like snapping would be a really
good feature here it would be yeah
that's maybe that's just one man's
opinion though it actually seems to like
sort of lock in place topics it's
snapping but it the 1i and what is that
called it's called fences okay so
fancies a rainmeter yeah again not paid
endorsements japanese rely just software
that and and so and then on this one on
this computer which by the way is
obscenely ripping off a macbook I mean
no I you know we saw it I wish it BTW i
yes god i wish you had a beach volume HP
envy better gruber showed it to his kid
backstage and goes look jonas a ripoff
thanks
which is amazing this is freaking
shameless and they should be ashamed of
themselves this is disgusting okay I
mean I if how come Apple isn't suing HP
that could happen means you tell you
about IP IP rip off Neil I can we come
on the case yeah you're all you're gonna
do handle yeah let's talk about what's
happening on the screen so yes so uh so
wait right here I think windows gun sort
of a bad rap for not having very good
looking apps I think people sort of
figure office you can have you know
outlook all that sort of stuff right and
so here are some ribbon ribbons
everywhere ribbons everywhere so this is
a few a few apps i like this is metro
twit it's really nice looking sort of
looks like Windows 8 or Windows Phones
Tom Cruise uh yes I am I I didn't really
hit a twitter account he doesn't you
know I really shouldn't follow him no I
need to find him so just keep following
him because I'm to follow her I need to
find out was gonna have a ghost protocol
he's gonna be cool or not um okay so
this is based like it makes like a
twitter client naturist I'm where
exactly that's very nice what else maybe
you want to use it maybe what is this
what what these are some this is an
email client I want to find you an email
client that you'd really like is wrong
what is wrong with you nor female
meanness rossi mail thanks i wanted to
show you the gifs support the animated
gifs supports great but no this is an
app called post box right OS X as well
yeah but uh you know it's a nice it's
it's not the perfect gmail
implementation I wanted to find that for
you yeah but it's a good one you can get
labels in there yeah you have is also
these little app yeah what is the
applets in here so you these are a
little app called pokey and so you can
install these down here to the taskbar
and can actually just like sort of reply
from in here are you were playing right
now I'm gonna reply to Thomas Houston
right here this is great so you're
actually have to go out to the right to
the browser so these are little little
applets little wrappers and all free I
have to admit I mean I feel like this
combination is is is somewhat compelling
yeah look at this desktop look how nice
it I see it yes
he has a 3rd watch it yeah alright so
you're gonna use windows no no i mean so
if i was uh i think there's a laptop
mine the you what would you recommend
for me this one you seem to really like
this is great this is great as I won't
have to get actually used to look yeah
remember yeah yeah beat yeah i would
suggest and i think i've got it over
here and it is the Lenovo IdeaPad u310
we were talking about this before and I
have to say like as far as this is this
should be you know HP should take a look
at what Lenovo's doing because you know
there are some similarities chiclet
keyboard or wherever to to a to a mac
but I mean every computer has this down
but this is actually the industrial
designer this is really nice I really
like the design i don't--you're you will
miss the backlit keyboard no backlit
keyboard but let's maybe that's an
outrage uh-uh and this is a core i yeah
you can get r i7 core i5 all right I
mean maybe I'll do it I mean maybe maybe
you've shown me the light I doubt it but
I mean it's possible I will say that
this is a much better that stop looks
good yes it looks very good yeah I'm
trying to all right here you go thank
you very much do you want a stern
everyone be poisoning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
