i'm here with rick from heat said owen
and he's going to show us exactly how
coated gadgets can work underwater show
you a couple of things this is just a
regular ipod nano that we bought at a
retail store and it's been treated with
HCL waterblock technology the treatments
on the inside everything's open there's
still openings here we're still
connecting devices so there's no cover
protection this device I just took out
of the water it's been underwater for
about an hour and a half but we'll stick
it back in there actually I just turned
the music off when I took that device
out so let me start music back up we'll
stick that under there wrong for
anybody's a fan of wicked
this song starts a little slow but you
can hear it building up but now if you
feel that that's been in as i said
earlier for an hour and a half tonight
so let's get it back to the and you're
also bringing this to phones as well
what kind of us we've again these
devices i just want to make really clear
we're all purchased at retail we're not
representing any of the manufacturers
here today but this is an iphone i like
this because you can actually see the
water is in there that's been soaking
see that's clear full of water literally
clear for water and yet it still
functioning still operates everything
still works we'll put it back in and it
will fill up with water again it just
doesn't matter because the electronic
components inside through a gas
vaporization process have been coded
treated so even though water is all
around there's a there's an encasement a
barrier that's keeping the water out of
those key components again committee
look at the
stuff you done on its habits as well
yeah a lot of people you know the tablet
is the fastest-growing market so we
didn't want to leave those out this one
I don't know if you you can see the
water dripping out again this has been
dunked all night but kind of the same
the water pressure is what's changing
the screen or the electron in the
electricity in the water so let me put
it in a little slower and you'd be able
to get the shot with it halfway in the
water and half way out yeah see the
water lines and again that thing is
clear full of water so you working with
any many pictures for this so we are
we've been working this technologies is
voiding warranty but if you do it
afterwards yeah in fact what's so most
of most of the major manufacturers that
we've talked to have said yes it will
have an impact on the warranty it's not
just that it's it's more expensive and
it's less effective so yes we've been
working for several months with many of
the major manufacturers we hope we can
make some announcements soon about which
devices will be coming out with HCL
waterblock but obviously because of our
agreements with them we can't mention
any names at this point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
