we're taking a look at the latest
version of pocket cast for Android
pocket cast is a pod caching app so it
lets you listen to podcasts on your
smartphone or tablet and version 4.0 has
been completely redesigned with a new
style and interface to complement the
latest versions of Android the first
thing you have here are your pocket our
podcasts that have been subscribed to
and downloaded pretty standard fare
there they're also features a discovered
mode where you can find new podcasts to
listen to and subscribe to them pretty
quickly and simply pocket cast supports
both video and audio podcasts so you can
watch video
or you can also listen to audio podcasts
you have the option to stream or
download a podcast while your to listen
to it you got controls to easily rewind
or fast-forward you can change the
playback speed when you've fully
downloaded it to speed it up if you want
and you have the ability to share
podcasts or episodes via links through
other apps and then you've got some
lockscreen control or notification
controls here but unfortunately there's
no widget for this particular version of
the app you also have playlists here
that you access unplayed podcasts by
audio or video type and which ones
you've downloaded and you can mark
things as read and delete them from here
if you want the only problem that we
have with these is that they do not
automatically delete once you reach a
certain limit so you can't set a
specific limit a number of podcasts that
you want to save and you'll have to
manually delete them if you need to free
up space on your phone's internal
storage the last thing that's really
cool about the new version of podcasts
is it lets you sync between devices so
you can sync your podcast playlists and
you're listening status between your
phone and tablet if you want you can
pick up pocky cast from the google play
store now for 399</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
