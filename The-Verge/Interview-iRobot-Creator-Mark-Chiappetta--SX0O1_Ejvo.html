here with Mark chiappetta the vice
president of advanced development at
iRobot and you built ava is that correct
that is correct with your own bare hands
alright not exactly but but this is a
hand-built prototype of a mobile
robotics platform after you what is ava
so ava is the world's first practical
robot app development platform she takes
the best innovations from the mobile
computing space from the electronic
gaming space and of course the mobile
robots industry and brings them together
to bring robot app development to the
ios and android developer Oh communities
and so there's a lot of technology on
here but what you guys want to emphasize
is the apps that can be enabled by this
yes so the application development is
definitely one of the key missions of
this robe on you know exploring new
market opportunities for us internally
and developing partnerships to solve
some practical you know robotics
problems but we're also using this
platform to continue to move the state
of the art in robot navigation through
real-world environments right so you
guys are working you guys have a
partnership with Google right for app
development it's correct what how is
that going what's what's happening there
there's a couple robots out there that
are having applications you know
developed so Google has a couple Ava's
yeah that's correct okay and what what
are they working on there oh you know I
really I'm not sure android I vid yes
Android and I I think they're sort of
exploring the space at the moment okay
and is that is that the what are you
working with other developers that are
trying to figure out where they can fit
in so you know right now we just struck
a partnership with In Touch health to
bring a derivative of this platform into
the healthcare space allow doctors to do
remote patient monitoring and rounding
is that research or is that a product
that you guys are working to deliver no
that's a geared towards product
development
so let's just talk about Ava you
mentioned it's got a this is basically a
kinect sensor what is the pure direct
it's a prime sensor crime sins there are
actually two of them and the prime
sensors are depth imaging cameras where
as well as RG where it was the other the
second one is uh is under the shoulder
and it pans back and forth and it looks
at the volume in front of the road so
it's like an IR sensor but it's just
panicked so it's another connect or
connect type of sensor oh there's like
that hands in front to develop
situational awareness and to avoid
obstacles that are in front that way you
guys were developing this like about two
years ago started yeah we started around
March of 2010 was this even available to
you at that point the platform itself
the these sensors um yes it was but in
prototype form because the Kinect hadn't
been out yet right right so you guys had
that pretty early and it seems like is
that I mean we for the hacker community
that's been such an enabling technology
but it's so cool I mean even I robot is
using this sort of technology yeah you
know I robata is uh we have a number of
core competencies from one being over
all that navigation other one being
building you know practical products
right we also develop our own sensors in
house but we that's a shared competency
I mean we are always looking outside to
see what the latest in you know high
fidelity sensing what is around so for
example this has a long-range scanning
laser rangefinder right and it's based
that it's used for localization and
mapping and it's got some sonar in there
yes it has upward looking ultrasonic
sensors to prevent the robot from you
know decapitating itself on a table but
we got the boot that's a smart that's a
good one and we got to play around with
it outside I mean it's you know with the
brake collision avoidance and you guys
have a nap here you can just you know
point to where you want it to go and it
goes there that's correct there's a
number of ways to to get your input into
the system one is
there's a map you can click on a map and
the robot will autonomously plan a path
to whatever that point is you can string
points together to make like patrol
paths you can also click in a video
image and it'll go to where you click in
the image you can control the individual
degrees of freedom right by touching on
the image if i wanted to make it say no
way or you know or it she also responds
to you know direct right touch as well
so like i can like and look at me what
was it you know if you uh if you do that
she'll turn and then tapper goes the
direction she'll turn towards you that's
the one I was doing this so well before
I profit and obviously you could if you
bump into it with those pads down there
she'll stop blush correct and but this
is this is how users are going to
control this do you want app developers
to have access to this right I'd use
that to navigate yeah absolutely we've
created an API and we've exposed it to
the face device which in this case
happens to be an iPad but can just as
easily be an Android tablet and you know
the sky's the limit right this is a very
robust safe and you saw it move it's
very Swift you know navigation platform
that is equally at home in a home
environment in a business environment or
even in a healthcare institution where
the operating around people and
accomplishing its mission getting from
point A to point B is you know it's
state of the art doesn't sound
pathfinding absolutely it'll plant its
own path and using the it's a knowledge
of the world in a map that it's created
by itself so it does create that like
now right now you guys kind of have to
like skin like set it up a little bit
but will it be able to dynamically
generate its own map for things yeah
absolutely what you working on
autonomous exploration as an example
okay in their research space so that you
know you could pull a row
but out of a box right and you know fire
up a nap and say map and it'll drive
around your home and boring you're in
your office space and will create the
map on its own okay um and you know this
is an engineering development tool right
here so it's not very pretty right
obviously the maps can be post-processed
to give the user you know a really
nice-looking user interface and you guys
are doing stuff this is similar to your
military robots it can can follow you is
that correct that's correct yeah this
robot on does person detection and
person following my face recognition um
not facial recognition but it looked at
the upper torso okay in the case of this
robot and identifies that it's human
being and then can either follow you or
go away from you or go you know whatever
its program so what's what's next for
for ava is this early development where
would you where would you say you are
right now I'd say it's market
exploration early partnership
development and you know continuing
technology development for us right and
what's next you know greater exposure to
the developer communities would be real
is of importance to us is that a
messaging thing for you guys or is there
stuff that you need to do to be ready
for a lot more developers to get
involved I think we're putting we're
building the groundwork to engage with
greater numbers of developers so there's
still a little bit of work to be done
there and we have limited numbers of
these prototype platforms now soon
they'll be derivatives right in the
market place under the intouch agreement
right what can you explain that a little
bit sure we saw we signed an agreement
with In Touch health or low here that
one that one in the year yeah to develop
on and that will be in the market when
we're not saying exactly when it'll be
in the market okay but it's we're in
joint development right now okay great
and are is what comes in the market
going to look
like this I think you'll see the family
resemblance okay but it won't look
exactly like this we'll have limbs ah oh
I would say that one will not have limbs
but the health want to help 11 on Italy
but are you guys looking into that
researching that yeah we have a lot of
manipulation development that's
happening in house in research and you
know right now the problem of going
through cluttered environment safely is
solved right it's solved in a way that
you know obviously good enough for
highly cluttered you know even small
environments where so you can imagine
next steps would be okay now i can get
from point A to point B if somebody puts
a meal tray on me and tells me to bring
it into the family room it'll do it
right but it can you know manipulate the
world yet itself so that's then the goal
is for it to be able to do that that's
just one possible application that could
be developed with the right hardware
what's right hard right hey that's I
mean that seems like the that's been a
for a consumer robot outside of these
single purpose ones you've done with
like rumba and the gutter one luge yeah
you know the idea that a robot could go
to the fridge get out a beverage of your
choice and bring it back to I mean
that's kind of like that the idea in
milk a soft drink exactly uh that's kind
of been the I don't know for some reason
that stuck in my mind as we're consumer
robotics need to go for someone to spend
what this would cost to get it in their
home a single purpose robots are like
with the Roomba you know obviously have
great utility we have a vision of an
automated home where an Ava type robot
is the focal point and it's there to
interact with humans so that the humans
don't have to interact with the other
application-specific robot
right so this robot is here to command
the other robots to to serve you and
it's also here to directly you know
serve you in that vision so absolutely
going in you know fetching and carrying
things for you you know allowing you to
be somewhere where you're not physically
delivering content to you through you
know web connection and her tablet
computer so those are all potential
applications and are some of the
barriers there the actual technical
complications or are some of them the
cost implications of bringing something
like that to consumers so you know
that's a great question so we're the
leader of you know the practical robotic
space and you know you won't see I Robot
more than likely release a product that
doesn't have a very high you know
benefit to cost ratio right so the
Roomba is you know for what it can do
you know it's price reasonably low but
um it's it's really both right there's
still technology development that needs
to happen and also there needs to be
market pull right there needs to be a
practical problem that needs to get
solved at a price point that we think we
can solve it in for us to bring a
product derivative of this to market but
you know people didn't think they needed
a room bow before you had the Roomba
right um you know that's a classic
problem in the field of mobile robotics
right it's in the early days you know
over the last like 20 years folks would
call mobile robotics you know solutions
running around looking for problems and
the Roomba was really the first problem
that customers had they knew they had
they just had a different way of you
know solving the problem a more
conventional way with uprights and
canisters and whenever we talked to
people they would say make me a robot
that vacuums your floor's right that was
like the first killer app you know
getting a beer out of the fridge that's
pretty much a man's
you know first right that's an hour of
vacuuming versus a minute of getting out
the cow exactly I see that now you back
to what you were saying about interface
is there an aspect of this that the
robot is is user interface even more so
or in some ways different than just the
practical application so ava is capable
of interfacing with people through
speech through gesture through touch and
as advancements continue in the mobile
computing space things like facial
recognition as you mentioned before or
you know basically other applications in
that area right we should hopefully
leverage those to deliver those advanced
capabilities do you think of that as
natural user interface in the sense that
like Microsoft things with the Kinect or
is the fact that a robot is a physical
present is that a more natural user
interface um I think it's both you know
you know to take connect as an example
playing tennis with a Kinect is it's
nice it's interesting but there are some
times or you want to actually physically
interact with something right you're not
holding anything in your hand you know
steering wheel you're doing this right
right so the tactile inputs are very
important to us you know robots are
going to be in the environments with
people people are going to touch them
you know it's it's a common way you like
them up to you and tap you on the
shoulder you're going to turn around
look at me one of the ways that humans
are used to interacting with other
organic beings for robots we want it to
be the same yeah and our developers
getting excited about that you have like
UI designers that see it that way I
think so yeah we uh there's a number of
people both internal and external that
quickly see the possibilities
you know the possibilities are pretty
much endless you know and whether I
robot or not does it when when should I
expect something like this when when am
I gonna get the beer out of the fridge
let's submit I want a beer out of the
fridge is that five years is that ten
years yeah that's close you know like i
said you know whether if you're talking
about in a product it's farther out
we're talking about in research it's
happening now yeah right the question is
you know is it something that you'll
want to spend your hard-earned money on
you know is it available at the right
price point that's a little farther away
but you think most of the technical
problems at this point are solved the
visual object recognition grasping all
you know those problems are still being
solved you know many technologies feel
like they're solved where they're done
in research but then when they're they
end up in practical environments or
which wrecked but you know randomly a
very bro you find out that those
problems aren't quite solvent it takes a
number of iterations of being in actual
in out in the world were to have them
quote unquote salt which seems to be an
excitement citing thing about Ava is
that you've got it out in unstructured
environments already absolutely hurt her
navigation ability through cluttered
environments is unparalleled we don't
know there are other robots that can
navigate similarly but a lot slower a
lot less dynamic you know she's also as
I mentioned before holonomic meaning
that you know she's capable of moving in
any direction while facing any
orientation like strafing she could
exactly like a first-person shooter
right she could strafe she can orbit she
can sidestep at two meters a second when
she's going down the hallway if somebody
jumps in front of her so she's very very
sort of deft is that why we're going to
see most of these things on wheels for
the time being yeah legs if you're
referring to legs yeah you know legs are
obviously there's a ton of research
happening there's there's toys and
products with Bill the flags but you
know legs are legged robots are still
being held back by how much power they
can put on board and the complexity that
is there and complexity equals you know
lower reliability and greater cost is
just not it's just not cost-effective
and it's not necessary I think you'll
when you see robots you know climbing
stairs which were developed for people
to change elevation right then you know
you may see legged robots so it's
something you guys are aware of right
I'll keep your keeping tabs on you know
absolutely a leg locomotion I think
where you'll see you know practical
implementations of legs are more like in
you know prosthetic applications yeah
sweet well this is cool I'm excited I
hope to see it watering around the show
floor soon thank you will probably but
and I hope to have it in my home as well
yeah you'll have to talk to Lauren oh I
will I will definitely and then once you
on meant a robot arm I think I think you
have something here alright thank you so
much you're welcome next fall</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
