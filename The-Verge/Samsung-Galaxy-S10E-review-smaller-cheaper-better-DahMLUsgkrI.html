smartphones seem like they
just kept getting bigger.
Bigger displays, bigger
batteries, and bigger price tags
for this little computer we
keep in our pockets every day.
But here's the thing, if
you're someone like me,
you've never been able to carry
a smartphone in your pocket.
So, it's pretty exciting
when Samsung decided
to finally offer a smaller
option with the S10E.
It's basically the
Goldilocks of smartphones.
You get a little less
than the original S10,
but you save a bit of money for a phone
that punches way above its weight.
There's a lot more to talk
about than just the size of this thing,
and I will. I will just tell you, though,
that smaller doesn't mean worse,
and that's a huge relief
in the era of giant smartphones.
(techno beat)
The best way to think about this phone
is to figure out what
the E in S10E stands for.
If you've been paying close attention
you might already know that Samsung says
it stands for the essentials.
But where I actually think it
stands out is its ergonomics.
The design is just easier for me to use
than the regular S10 and a
bunch of other Android phones
because my hand can finally
actually fit around the device
and my fingers almost
reach the entire screen.
I think I speak for a lot of people
that tech companies can
stand to make phones
that are even smaller than this.
And so far, I think this is a
step in the right direction.
In the US, it comes in white,
black, blue, and pink.
At first glance, it's pretty obvious
that the S10E is smaller than
most other Android phones,
but really not that much
smaller in terms of width.
It's only a millimeter narrower
than the standard S10.
But instead, you're
getting a 5.8-inch screen
because the bezels are a
little thicker on the sides
than on the S10's 6.1-inch screen.
Now when I first heard about the S10E,
I thought that even
with the 5.8-inch screen
the phone was going to be way too big
to fit in my hands and pockets.
But the shorter body is a surprisingly easy
and pleasant solution.
I also much prefer the placement
of the fingerprint sensor
on the power button on the side,
over the S9's location
underneath the camera,
or even the S10's in-screen sensor.
It feels a lot more natural
because that's just where
your thumb normally is
when you pick up the phone.
Plus there's a little divot
that lets you find the reader
without having to look
at where you're aiming,
which is a lot nicer
than some other phones
that have it flush with
the rest of the phone.
Now with that said, this
placement might still
be frustrating for left-handers.
You end up needing to use
your index or middle fingers sideways,
and it can be a little awkward,
but once you have it set up
it does work well and works fast.
Another neat thing about
the S10E's power button
is you can still use it to drag
down the top navigation bar.
That's just something you can't do
with the S10's in-screen reader.
And despite the shorter display,
I still can't quite reach
the top of the screen
with one hand.
So being able to use it this
way is so much more convenient â€”
as long as you're using your right hand.
Let's come back to what Samsung
claims the E really
stands for: essentials.
Yes, it's just a marketing term,
but I do think Samsung has
mostly nailed the essentials,
and is just missing a few perks.
Just like the S10, this thing's got the same
Qualcomm processor,
wireless charging features,
headphone jack, stereo
speakers, the same selfie camera,
the same network performance,
water resistance, SD card
slot, and even the same
internal storage as Samsung's
more expensive S10 models.
What you do give up is the telephoto lens,
the bigger battery, and a nicer screen.
The S10E has a Full HD display
instead of a Quad HD display,
which means it's only 1080p wide,
and is about 100 ppi
less than the regular S10.
I actually don't think most
people will notice this.
It is only when you
put phones side by side
that you start to see any difference.
For me, I find that even
after adjusting the tones
on the S10E for more vibrancy,
the whites are still whiter on
competitors like the Pixel 3,
and you get a lot more depth there.
For the past couple of years,
Samsung phones have had
curved edges, and the S10E screen is flat.
It has bigger bezels, but I
prefer it over the S10's design.
Full-sized videos now look less warped,
and my palm doesn't wrap
over the screen as much.
It also makes the edge
lighting come way more alive
against the darker sides of the screens.
There are a couple of things
I did have a hard time with,
including the size of
Samsung's default keyboard.
With the small display, everything is
naturally going to be more condensed.
And I did end up finding
myself making more typos
than I do on similar sized
devices like my personal Pixel 2,
even after making this
keyboard as big as it can get.
These are easy fixes, though.
I recommend that when
you first get the device,
adjust the icons so they
don't look cartoonishly big,
and download something like Gboard
to fix those keyboard issues.
And while you're at it, buy
a better screen protector.
The S10s now come with an
included screen protector,
but they're not as scratch
resistant as I'd like.
The battery is a little
smaller at 3,100 mAh
to the S10's 3,400.
But it works out to be roughly
about the same battery life
because the S10E has a smaller display.
I've been using the
device for about a week
and it makes it through
an entire day of scrolling
through Twitter, Instagram,
Slack, and playing games
on my commute without needing
to recharge until I get home,
and that's without
using power saving mode.
It even has the new Wireless
PowerShare feature,
which lets you charge
other devices off the back
of the phone like the Galaxy Buds.
Now I'm not going to get
into the camera too much,
because we already covered most of this
in our original S10 review.
The thing you should take away
is that this camera is great.
It takes awesome photos
that are sharp and vibrant,
and about 90 percent of the time
you won't be let down.
But if you're comparing it
to other competitors like
the Pixel 3, Samsung's camera
just doesn't quite match
the niche features like
Night Sight and ultra-wide selfie.
Honestly, I think I'm just spoiled
by the Pixel's Night Sight.
Plus, with the Pixel you can
manually enable Night Sight
and you can't with the Samsung
unless it's really dark out.
While Samsung says it plans to send out
camera software updates,
the Pixel 3's camera is
just so much better that
if you care a lot about
taking photos with your phone,
it might be worth considering spending
the extra $50 for the Pixel 3.
The last E is economics.
For $750 you're basically
getting the full S10 experience
without spending as much money.
Samsung phones also tend to
go on sale pretty quickly
after new Galaxys are announced.
So you'll probably find
the S10E's discounted
or in BOGO deals in a few months.
If you looking for a good small Android
or one that isn't
uncomfortably close to $1,000,
I think this is the
phone that most people
will enjoy without
sacrificing much in quality.
Smaller and cheaper
doesn't have to mean worse.
And I think that it's time
major smartphone manufacturers
start making devices that can do the most
without the gigantic size.
So while the S10E may
not be the phone that
can finally fit in my pocket,
it's one that I'd be super
happy to use at a price point
that leaves just a little
more breathing room
in my wallet.
Thanks for tuning in.
Now that you've seen all
three models of the S10s,
let me know in the comments
which one is your favorite.
