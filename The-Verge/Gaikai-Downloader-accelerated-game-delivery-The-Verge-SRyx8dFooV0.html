now this is something the future it's
called Gaikai download and what we've
been doing here is we're going to
install the first chunk of this game
locally and then stream the rest what
we're playing the idea is that well when
you decide to buy again Gaikai you're
not gonna want to just play it all you
can get it on your local computer but
instead of having to wait for that giant
download you can reduce the amount of
time you're spending waiting and start
enjoying the game just after a few
minutes here we've got FIFA 12 we're
already in the game start playing in at
moment while it strange the rest
installs it on our computer just took a
click there in the browser to get it
start long term what guy kind of looking
at doing is a hybrid model you can
actually start playing instantly see the
guys clouds streaming and then water
streaming it will install the first part
again and then what's the first part of
the games installed will start playing
it locally well you stream the rest of
the install so what should we user to
see in this process we need to start
playing and when you're done so now
we're going to show you how it works
we're here on the guy can't download a
web page and we're going to install
Dragon Age 2 takes a look over here and
grabs that install button click save it
up comes the process and over here and
the Windows Explorer window you can see
the dragon agents problem and it's
already populating the computer with
these temporary files intact and here
come on here come on over here at the
install window and we're at three
minutes up two minutes is dropping
rapidly until we can actually start
playing this game while the rest of the
files are delivered the computer you can
have it fully encapsulated on your
machine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
