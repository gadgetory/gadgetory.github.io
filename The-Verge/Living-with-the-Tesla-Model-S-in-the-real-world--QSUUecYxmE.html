and we're so close
in point two miles take the round right
towards Morro Bay Boulevard
it better be like literally like right
here otherwise we're screwed
it's not a good gret one mile now turn
right onto Chester Avenue what was that
um keep it out you go man I'm sorry dude
you have any comments I just spared you
on YouTube a thousand the electric motor
here was the strength of Lin's backs the
muscles of their animals and the power
of the waterwheel in one package here
was a light that was to show the way to
one of the most significant single
developments the world had ever seen the
electrification of nearly all human
endeavor hey I'm Chris and I just took
delivery of a Tesla Model S I'm
experiencing it for basically the first
time here a little discombobulating if
you've ever been in any other car in
your life because nothing is the same
you have a 17 inch touchscreen and
nothing else in the center console you
have a big LCD right in front of you and
that's about it everything is controlled
through those two things plus a few
buttons on the steering wheel tell me
about the decision to go with this giant
touchscreen ilana myself decided early
on that we need to make a pretty radical
change on the interior of cars and that
the thing that we both hated the screens
in general that we hadn't seen to that
at that point where they just small and
the interaction with them sucked
we've seen a lot of really unique kind
of experimentations in forward-thinking
design language for electric vehicles as
if that an electric vehicle needed to be
something really crazy for it to be
adopted when we set out to design Model
S was really about understanding the
marketplace the the type of people that
we were going to capture beyond the
early adopters who we knew were already
engaged and we're already clamoring for
this type of technology so I just signed
my life away if anything happens to this
car you will not be hearing from me
again we're going to Santa Barbara
that's the first leg of this journey
we're going from LA up to the Bay Area I
know how it's going to go so on that
note let's get this show on the road
oh my god that is not normal
acceleration you know there's that that
that feeling that like natural
accelerometer here but you guys know
what I'm talking about that
accelerometer is in full effect right
now and I'm feeling great joy at the
amount of acceleration with this
vehicles capable of you've been warned
by Tesla staff that taking too much
advantage of the acceleration
capabilities of this vehicle will impact
range negatively and which makes sense
it has that that seat of your pants the
visceral feeling of raw performance and
acceleration if you're in the sports
cars and funer performance cars this is
not a car that's going to disappoint
bring your Ferraris bring your
Lamborghinis let's do this I've driven
my fair share of performance vehicles in
my lifetime and this definitely feels
like a performance vehicle the Tesla
folks were pointing out that the
batteries which weigh about a thousand
pounds are mounted very very low in the
car actually below the axles which gives
the car an extremely low center of
gravity so we are in scenic Santa
Barbara it's really beautiful here we
have about 130 miles left of rain on the
Tesla right now I'm feeling the burn
woke up at 3:00 a.m. this morning
Central Time so I need as much caffeine
as I can get we are going to crash in
Morro Bay tonight which is the last
place we can plug the car in
hopefully the hundred thirty miles that
we have on the gauge are enough to make
it was just luck what do I do with this
thing
nice we've been going through the
mountains here north of Santa Barbara
for a few minutes and we had kind of a
scare because we started with way more
miles on our Range meter than we did
miles to go to Morro Bay which is our
final destination for the night but then
as we went up through the mountains the
range kept going down and down and down
and we got to the point where I became
questionable whether we were going to
make it but fortunately the car has
something called regenerative braking /
coasting it has both there is a center
mounted speedometer that has a gauge on
it that switches between green and
orange depending on whether you're
feeding power into the batteries or
sucking power out so like if you let off
the gas it goes into the green zone
which means that you're actively feeding
it's using regenerative power to feed
energy back into the battery so when we
had 99 miles on our range and then we
started coasting downhill we got to the
top of the mountain we started going
back down and I watched you climb back
to about 108 and we're down to 83 miles
to go now so I think we're going to be
okay
please follow the road for 12 miles I am
kind of freaking out
I decided Yolo I'm guiding us onward
tomorrow Bay our original final
destination and we're gonna just hope
that we make it we're so close
I'm trying very hard I'm modulating the
accelerator to try and keep us so we're
not burning juice okay it just went to
red just probably bad I'm guessing it's
limiting the performance of the car
based on how much battery you have left
so in other words like I can't smoke
BMWs anymore until I recharge right one
mile oh yes
Eevee now turn light on to chance to
having it I think this has been the most
exhilarating experience of my life we're
actually connected to the one and only
evey charger in this entire lot we are
using an adapter because Tesla actually
doesn't use a standard charging port the
same one that's used by the leaf and the
bolt a lot of other V's so the car comes
with an adapter that you connect that
you can charge it off a standard port
for every hour that we leave this thing
on charge is going to put 80 miles in
the batteries we need to get to 250
which means this thing definitely needs
to stay on charge all night
it's morning in Morro Bay it's cold I'm
hungry but the good news is that the
Tesla is almost fully charged we headed
on charge for about eleven and a half
hours and we'll close to full we have
about 240 miles of range so making it to
Gilroy theoretically anyway should not
be a problem you're going to hit the
road I'm hoping to get some breakfast
and some coffee that would be amazing
we're going to see if we can make it to
Gilroy we are in Big Sur which is
absolutely beautiful
I've never seen any place in the world
quite like it this is completely insane
we have 158 miles of range allegedly
according to the car about 112 miles to
our destination which is Gilroy where
the superchargers are located
so I think we're going to make it
especially since we're already up in the
mountains so that means we have a lot of
downhill which means a lot of regen
this is a very very curvy place probably
the curviest I've ever been on it's a
great place to really get a sense of how
this car handles for real as opposed to
being on you know straight expressways
and it's doing extraordinarily well as I
kind of expected it would because of the
low center of gravity all those
batteries way low on the car really
sticks to the road and it's rear-wheel
drive which is the the drive of choice
for people who really like performance
cars I have no complaints I am standing
in front of Tesla's proprietary
superchargers here in a strip mall in
Gilroy California which is about Sunday
miles away from San Francisco that is
our final destination for the day we're
going to take about a half hour of
charge that's not going to get the
battery completely charged but it'll
take us to the halfway point there
abouts there's gonna be about 125 miles
of range it's more than enough these
Chargers cannot be used by other EVs
these are proprietary to Tesla just bad
for other EVs but good for Tesla because
they charge a lot faster so this is
going to take about a half hour means we
have some time to kill
should I talk No
I'll be the first to arrive had a lot of
skepticism about this car and about
Tesla in general and the last two days
have really proven to me that this is a
livable car you know you can you can
take it from LA San Francisco granted we
had a couple close calls we had a few
white-knuckle moments but we made it
so yeah I'm impressed and let's be
honest for 50 60 70 thousand dollars but
if you're paying for this thing not to
mention your or to wait you better be
impressed that'd be a really good car
you have over 100 miles left on range
since we left Gilroy I have to tell you
as a car guy it's really hard to imagine
first of all that an e V can be like an
emotionally charged driving experience
you know V's are a tough sell I think
particularly for car nuts but the
performance is there it feels like it
was designed and engineered by car guys
the handling is fantastic and it's a
heavy car going through the curves of
Big Sur going up and down the mountains
it was great
but that being said there's still a long
wait list that's problem number one and
problem number two the infrastructure
isn't there they still need to install
hundreds of these superchargers
nationwide and in general the e V
infrastructure has to get better both in
cities and in rural areas so that's a
challenge over the next few years and
fortunately because the wait list is a
few years long that gives me time to get
on right now and hopefully get my car in
time for everything to be ready
