we're with George from 53 one of the
creators of paper for the iPad which is
a new sketching drawing scrapbook
notebook how would you describe it
what's your description of the app so
paper is where ideas begin right it's
the place where you go to like sketch
write draw color outline it's it's when
you want to spend time with your ideas
papers the home for your ideas and you
guys are a new york-based company right
are you totally new york mayor in new
york and seattle-based explain to me the
the ideation behind this now you guys a
few people who work at 53 worked at
Microsoft yeah you guys worked on the
courier project which a lot of our
readers will know yeah and there's some
you know similarity here but this is a
this is something you guys started
working on after you left Microsoft can
you just help me tell me where the
creation of the how the creation of this
began where it came from it really came
from from actually this this is
disbelief of our so I thought people are
their best when they create right that's
what motivated that's what motivated us
you know to start career that's what
motive would have made it be to start
working on office that's what really has
been motivating like a lot of us and to
just start picking up like engineering
to build tools creative tools in this
case in this tools tools that you know
that that that help people work with
their ideas right and personally we were
getting a little bit frustrated right
there now we have all these great
breakthroughs in mobile technologies and
and connectivity and what we really got
was like mobile email Twitter and and
Angry Birds right and it just didn't
feel right it just didn't feel right I
think there's more there was more to
mobile curation and and so we we bound
it together we all really enjoyed
working together and we said it's like
hey let's start a company and devote
ourselves towards figuring out what are
sort of essential tools for creation
let's figure this out so when we were
testing this yeah as soon as we got the
beta from you guys we were like we have
to go get styluses styli now and we got
these bamboo these Wacom or Wacom Bamboo
Stylus is they're not that good and it
seems to me that you can use your finger
and it works really well in paper but it
seems to me like you guys are you want
people to use stylus to do this I mean
it's it's natural so people used to
write with this you know what's your
take on that well I you know but when
you when you look at activities like
drawing and sketching they just
feel much more natural when you can have
holding utensil and the reason for this
is one it's I mean that's that's what
the hand has evolved to use we've got a
risk so you can articulate at the moment
you put your finger down you lock your
wrist into place right you can't move
and the other thing is your fingers
fairly large so it actually concludes
what you're working on right so stylus
makes a lot of sense I mean it has made
sense for hundreds of years and it still
does thousands right that wasn't first
in the minute they're actually pick on
the stand that's true but I mean you
know so so you know but this the stylus
you can get right now for the iPad I
feel it's pretty lacking I don't know if
you agree or disagree I don't put words
in your mouth but have you been looking
into other technology there's blue tiger
which is apparently gonna be you know a
better more advanced take on yeah it's
the ILA Aaron for a capacitive just like
absolutely I think there's a lot of room
for improvement
there's a tremendous amount of room and
for improvement like you know mentioned
blue tiger there a couple other there
are a couple other and new technologies
that are coming and we're super
interesting and that stuff the year that
you're looking into we're absolutely
looking to those but what about other
platforms I mean Android Windows 8 is
coming you gotta buy you've got a
history with Microsoft so like are you
exploring other platforms for thought we
we have great relationships to all the
various you know platform vendors in our
case we're somewhat limited by our
resources and our time you know I mean
Samsung Apple anyone send us more money
you want an apple samsung said you okay
that will facilitate that I'll just make
a call whoever sends me the checks yeah
well I'm sure we'll cut you one no but
it's it's it's more like will develop
platform you know we'd love to go in
more plan right so so Android is a
possibility absolutely a Windows 8 is a
possibility
oh that's cool that's great tell me
about the business model here it's a
little bit different then you know other
apps um they charge 15 bucks you just
get this at 10 bucks two bucks you are
offering the basic app for free and then
you can buy put tools basically yeah so
the the idea for us is like you know we
want people to experience paper right
and really look at the UI get a sense
for it see how nice it flows and and
anyone should try that so the base
application is free you get first tool
which is draw for free drawing is all
about sort of
general sketching illustrating can use
it for writing it's a really flexible
tool that adjusts its width dynamically
I think people would be surprised how
great their script looks when they when
they use that and then you can't
customize the application to your use if
you want to do color right there's a
tool for color its basis to control
color and watercolor a cost to box to
get its its 99 okay yeah
two dollars yeah so so so so and the
other tools are you get the eraser yeah
you can play eraser and then you can
have you know you can buy color right
outline and sketch okay and and do you
see and so this kind of gives you a way
to be modular with this app so you can
add-on tools and we were talking a
little bit before this that you're
thinking about what other types of tools
you might add to it and it may not just
be freeform stuff that's right it's
right you know I mean this is really our
beginning right and now we need to now
we can start engaging with you know
dialogue with our audience and our
customers and start developing tools
specifically for their needs
so if industrial designers want a Copic
marker well build a Copic marker if like
you know Julian our developer has been
talking about like flow charting tools
drafting tools we'll go build that and
it allows you to really tweak and tailor
and get more vertical in the various
creative disciplines that are out right
so you really could go all sorts of
directions I mean this could become you
get out like a text tool if you wanted
to we could add a text me yeah saying
that you will but yeah if that's it well
there's a demand for there's a demand
for it yeah sure it's and it's for us
it's like we need to be you know we know
there are certain bases that you want to
cover in the creation process draw
sketch right color right these we know
people do right but now from that now
we're starting to get into this
interesting dialogue of what to develop
next and that's kind of where we're now
it's time for us to see and sit back and
look at what people are doing and also
work then with different you know just
with different disciplines and start
bringing on the next set of tools right
now now you mentioned that I mean we've
been talking about how simply how very
simple this is not simplistic but very
simple you worked on the office team
office suite right so did that and is
this in some way a reaction to because
offices coming classically known as
being a very feature-rich complex
application this is in the opposite
direction was that
that inform any of the stuff you guys
were thinking about when you started on
this yeah certainly right I mean what
was there was part of the office of 2007
release which was an attempt at or which
was actually an effort at streamlining
the office experience and off is an
incredibly valuable product there's so
much in it but I oftentimes felt like
when you ship a box software a product
you kind of have to put all your eggs
into one basket you put a price label
and ship it out it's like if you don't
get it in the box it's not gonna be
maybe they're right and I think you know
the world of mobility and connectivity
it's different you can be much closer to
your your audience and can be much more
responsive and so and that's where sort
of the in-app purchase model for us is
actually really fascinating to see is
like look only build what people need
right and only buy what you need right
and that I think is a wonderful thing
you would and if something isn't selling
yeah you'd consider just scrapping it
you know if you feel like there's a tool
that people aren't in here you would say
like hey you know we'd probably like
just remove like put it to other places
in the UI I mean there might be that one
or two people you know that are using
that tool but I don't have to keep it in
the main you right there you have that
modular we have the motor approach -
yeah exactly so all you really have what
you need right because we know what
creation it goes many places right I
mean if you're in if you're in the arts
versus science worth versus legal
profession right you'll need different
tools right you don't want to have you
know like every other tool available
only the ones that really matter to you
right and so this this was in
development before the new iPad existed
obviously you guys how long have you
been working on this app started working
earnest probably in June last year okay
so it's you know you're approaching
almost a year of working on it was it
always a plan to wait until there was a
higher resolution display out there or
do I mean obviously this will run on
will it run on the original iPad it runs
on iPad one two and three okay so did
you want to hold it for that high res
display or did it just a line that they
released this new what happened we had
the application ready for some time but
when you know we started seeing glimpse
of what the iPad 3 could be or the new
iPad could be we were like hey that's
pretty sweet yeah like you know our
graphic engine is there to really take
advantage of the high resolution I think
people are really going to enjoy it you
know just the look and the clarity and
the speed of the
so that just made more sense no I mean
it looks incredible in the new iPad I
mean it is it just like you know text is
like you don't see the pixels so that's
really very fluid and natural I do have
any plans to bring this to the iPhone I
mean seems like you get like a smaller
sketchbook or there any idea that
certainly we architected it and we could
do the development work it's more about
like what can we do to like how can we
best support our customers if if there's
demand for it will develop it but
currently there are right so this is me
I see where this yes so you guys have
added you have some unique gestures here
in particular the undo gesture is really
interesting yeah
you use two fingers to kind of go
backwards so we have to rotate backwards
what's the thinking behind that we're
dead so from so our interaction designer
and round he's a filmmaker and he's been
working a lot with jog dial on VCRs and
for him it was like we need rewind we
don't need to undo we need to rewind and
that's kind of where that gesture came
from and I really fit in our way of
thinking about sort of what does mobile
creation look like how how shouldn't app
work when you're on the go how do we
keep people in their work and you know
rather than having to bring up a menu
find a little button it's like no it
just flows really naturally like you
drew a mistake or you just want to
revisit what you did you just start
scrubbing backwards it's it's rewinding
what about you shake to undo was yeah
that was the other thing it's like kind
of not how to do it right I mean the
current oftentimes in people like you
know today under gestures oftentimes
people just have to shake the device and
that's we found that to be really
distracting yeah like really distracting
me Shh stamp rush no it 10 status right
and you were like you'd have to do a
shake for each step they didn't did you
test that with that not a thing that we
call right it didn't feel right I didn't
feel good we didn't like so you came up
with with rewind rewind yeah and it does
how many steps back now if I what's the
how far back are they so on on the new
iPad and iPad 2 it's 20 and on the
original iPad it's 5 but we're working
on a on a much better way is that a
memory issue it's a memory issue well
it's more like a my my coding skill
issue but right oh it's your fault it's
my fault you take responsibility for the
action
more undo but all the awesome code with
no my trillion my my yeah
under your like I can just do I get half
ask the undo stuff you want
I don't know it's fine it's actually
good you can go back at all I mean but
you can you envision a time when you can
go back yeah no I mean it's like as far
as you want we want people to spend time
with their ideas and being able to go
through and play through their process
of creation because that's where you
learn right you know that's where you
learn something so that's definitely
something we want to have right so
you've also felt incentive some cool
sharing functionality to this you've got
tumblr Twitter Facebook and you know
about right but the main the interesting
one for us is this tumblr here right one
is like we noticed people use their
tumblers almost like online notebooks
and we were like hey how do you have
pages into it
right so we were like hey let's paper
the web let's make it really easy for
them to post pages up to their tumblr
more original content you envision an
internet that looks like just a bunch of
pages that people have drawn on say your
say your vision so what you want to do
to the Internet the best thing about the
Internet is when people create things on
it and get creative so the more of that
more power to the creators</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
