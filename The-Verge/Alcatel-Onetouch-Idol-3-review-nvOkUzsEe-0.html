chances are you're looking for some
specific features a great display fast
performance reliable camera and easy to
use software are all likely on your
shortlist if you want all of those you
usually have to spend many hundreds of
dollars to get them but what if you
didn't have to that's the promise of
alpha tells OneTouch Idol 3 it's a $250
unlocked phone with a bright high res
display slim design LTE and Android 5.0
lollipop and you know what the idol 3
mostly delivers on that promise the end
of 3 screen is the star of the show it's
easily the best display on any phone
under 500 bucks that I've seen it's a
5.5 inch 1080p laminated IPS panel that
just pops great viewing angles bright
colors outdoor visibility if there's
something you want out of the phone
screen the idol 3s display has it but
the screen isn't the only thing to like
about the idol 3 it also has really loud
front-facing stereo speakers slim
attractive design and all-day battery
and support for LTE on both AT&amp;amp;T and
t-mobile it also has a 13 megapixel
camera that would embarrass a number of
much more expensive phones the idol 3 is
plastic but it's not glossy and it
doesn't feel as cheap as a price tag
might lead you to think the design is
pretty generic but it's not offensive
and certainly not as bad as other
inexpensive phones for software the idol
3 runs Android 5.0 lollipop with very
little customization it's pretty much
just limited to a few custom app icons
and a tweaked lockscreen there are a
handful of preloaded apps but nothing
near the levels of bloatware the average
carrier puts on their phones it really
feels like I'm using stock Android when
I use the idol 3 which is a good thing
so what don't you get with the idol 3
compared to a much more expensive phone
well conveniences like wireless charging
and quick charging aren't here and while
the octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615
processor is fast enough for most things
an HTC m9 or samsung galaxy s6 will
leave the Idol 3 in the dust when it
comes to raw performance I didn't have
an issue with the idol threes
performance most of the time but the
occasional stutter or lag when opening
apps reminded me that I wasn't using a
top-tier flagship but overall those
problems are pretty minor the idol 3 is
the most impressive
inexpensive phone I've ever used it hits
all of the right marks great display
solid battery life and a good software
experience if you thought you had to
spend nearly $1,000 to get that in
smartphone the idol 3 might make you
want to think again</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
