taking a look here at the droid razr and
the Moto active both of which were
announced today so have a couple of moto
active accessories here behind us we
have the wrist strap which is obviously
designed to be a sweat resistant and the
wired version of the headset which does
have the heart rate monitor built and
there's also a wireless headset and
those are sold separately but we do have
this droid razr paired to this moto
active and i'll try to show that to you
real quick on the side that's right
and so there's an app installed here
called moto active and I'm guessing
they'll be in android market is that
right okay load that up and this allows
you to set exactly what kind of
notifications you're going to get on the
Moto active calls notifications you can
break that out by calls calendar alerts
text messages and test text message
privacy which just means you're not
gonna see the actual text message
content on the on the the Moto active
you also have separate sets of
notifications for during a workout i'll
show you what that means in a second on
the moto active oops back out of it
there and then it looks like there's
some plugins support as well we'll try
to find out more details on that but
that that connects over bluetooth to the
actual moto active and you'll see i have
it here in a belt clip there will be a
few different accessories that you can
attach it in different ways on the side
you have volume buttons and the power
button we're going to power that on here
and you'll have a capacitive back button
here on the front and so here we're
we're at the home screen you can swipe
left and right to get to the different
screens the center screen is the clock
and if I want to start a workout click
on work out there choose the type of
workout outdoors or indoors i'm assuming
yep you can see the gps turns on when i
select outdoors then you can start and
that'll transmit once you get back onto
a Wi-Fi network you can trends transmit
that information back so that you have
that uploaded we also have settings you
can see this is very easy to scroll
through the capacitive touchscreen
smooth music there are two different
models available one with eight gig one
with 16 gig for a 250 and 300
respectively and notifications you can
see what notifications on here we had a
calendar notification come in here and
that's what we're seeing here you can
mark those as red and we have the USB
port here on the other side it's covered
by a protective flap to rugged us what
resistant device so that's why you have
that flap there I think and then on the
edge here you have
the three a half millimeter headphone
jack which connects to these these
headphones as I was showing you before
and again those do have the heart rate
monitor built-in if you don't want to
use that it also supports ANT+ so if you
have an aunt plus compatible heart rate
strap chest strap you can use that as
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
