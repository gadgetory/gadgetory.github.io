is the LG optimus 4x HD it's a
smartphone currently only available in
Europe but it's probably a pretty good
indication of what we'll see from LG in
the US in the future the phone itself as
you can see is kind of huge that's five
point two by two point seven inches and
weighs just under six ounces so it's not
particularly big for this kind of a
phone but it's still really large and
kind of hard to use in one hand it's
well made it has this kind of Ridge
silverback that it's still plastic but
it's a little better to hold than some
of the glossy phones we've seen even
from LG and it has these two silver
stripes along the edges which are really
more design Flair than anything overall
the phones really well made its thin and
just the way it's designed it feels even
smaller than it actually is there are
three capacitive buttons on the bottom
instead of the typical on-screen buttons
which I actually kind of like it sits in
the bezel and you can't really even see
them when you turn them on so you just
kind of get used to where you tap the
homework feature obviously is the 720p
4.7 inch display 720p is pretty much
standard for a high-end phone now and LG
has actually put this same display and a
couple of its phones before but it's
really great display it has great colors
and great viewing angles the only
problem with it is there's this thin
black stripe around all of the edges
that makes the screen feel like it's set
really far back into the phone so it
feels like there's a disconnect between
your finger and what you're actually
tapping it's not a huge problem but it's
not quite as nice and experience as I
mentioned the optimus 4x HD is only
available internationally and that means
it's unlocked phone and you can
basically just drop any SIM card and you
want and so your mileage will vary
depending on what carrier you use the
microphone on the phone is great the
earpiece is okay and unfortunately the
speaker on the back is actually pretty
bad it goes right where your hand wants
to go as you hold the phone in one hand
so it really muffles the sound but even
when it's free and you kind of awkwardly
hold it so that you can use it it's
still really quiet and you can really
only hear it in a quiet room where
you're all by yourself there are two
cameras on the phone there's an eight
megapixel camera on the back with an LED
flash and there's a 1.3 megapixel camera
on the front both are fine the one on
the back is actually better than most
phone cameras it has really good colors
and better dynamic range than most but
you still get soft and noisy images and
it's
really nothing special the phones
running android 4.0 and it's running the
same LG skin that we've seen before and
disliked on a couple of other phones but
it's really really improved as is
android in the jump from gingerbread to
ice cream sandwich the first thing
you'll see is this really cool new lock
screen now you can either drag an app
out to launch straight into that app or
if the screen is locked and you just tap
it gives you this kind of window into
whatever you're about to open it's not
really added functionality it's just
pretty cool there's also in the app
drawer these new tabs and so you can
either swipe through all your apps or
you can just see apps that you've
downloaded or go to widgets it's just an
easier way to navigate through
especially if you have a lot of apps on
your phone and there's blow Twitter and
stuff like that there's also in the
notification pull down it has the same
power and radio controls as most but you
can edit them in there are a few that
you can add or you can just easily
rearrange them and you can quickly if
you want take a note just with the quick
memo app you can you know doodle on a
screenshot or take your own picture or
do whatever you want it's just a quick
way to take a note from pretty much
anywhere you are the phone is powered by
a quad-core 1.5 gigahertz Tegra 3
processor and is really fast in general
everything you do is as smooth as we've
come to expect from ice cream sandwich
and it's fast and reliable and even for
you know pretty heavy gaming holds up
pretty well battery life on the phone is
also surprisingly solid given how
powerful the internal processor is
obviously your mileage will vary based
on with carrier and if it comes to the
US and gets LTE it'll probably be even
lower but it's still pretty solid
overall LG's previous efforts with
phones basically all got something
significant wrong some had issues with
software being outdated and ugly and
just bad sometimes the phone was
underpowered and other times it was just
an issue with build quality like we
found on the spectrum but this time it
does all of those things right Ice Cream
Sandwich is great and the skin has its
issues but is actually genuinely useful
for a lot of things the build quality is
solid it's not spectacular it kind of
looks like the galaxy s3 but it's really
solid and the performance is as good as
any
sandwich phone we've seen I'll still
take stock Android on the Galaxy Nexus
over this any day but it's really been
scaled back and is definitely in line
with some of the other manufacturers out
there it's not as good right now as the
galaxy s3 or the HTC One X but if this
phone does come to the u.s. if and when
it should be a real contender</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
