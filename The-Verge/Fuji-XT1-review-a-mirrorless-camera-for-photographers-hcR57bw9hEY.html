mirrorless camera for years
the perfect combination of image quality
control and compact size and no
compromise package I think I might have
found it this is Fuji films new xt-1
camera the new $1,300 xt-1 takes
everything fuji film has learned from
its earlier models and adds some new
things to make it the company's most
interesting camera yet the xt-1 features
an all new interchangeable lens design
complete with a litany of control dials
and customizable function buttons the
xt-1 is fuji films first weather sealed
camera and though it doesn't have the
same heft and gravitas of a full-frame
DSLR it is really well built and feels
solid when you hold it it's diecast
metal like a real camera should be and
it's covered in a grippy rubber
everywhere your fingers touch the
control dials all five in total have a
more intuitive layout than Fuji films
prior cameras and there are six function
buttons that are fully customizable
including one on the front of the camera
that lands directly under my middle
finger I've got that set to change my
focus points but there's a half-dozen
other functions that it can be set to
there are many little things on the xt-1
that appealed the seasoned photographers
such as the physical switches to change
metering or drive modes or the dedicated
dial for changing ISO s all of them are
designed to keep you out of on-screen
menus and focus on your subject other
fuji film cameras have taken the look of
a classic rangefinder but the xt-1 looks
more like a miniature SLR that's because
of the massive hump in the middle of the
camera that houses its brand-new
electronic viewfinder electronic
viewfinders are typically taking a
backseat to traditional optical
viewfinders but one look at the XT ones
will change even the most die-hard SLR
shooters opinion it's positively massive
has an incredibly high resolution and
according to fuji film has 1/10 the lag
of prior viewfinders there's also a high
resolution tilting LCD panel on the back
of the camera which works great for
reviewing photos after the fact you can
shoot with it too just like any other
digital camera but if you're passing up
the opportunity to hold this camera up
to your eye and peer into its viewfinder
you're really missing out autofocus on
the xt-1 is lightning quick it's easily
one of the fastest mirrorless cameras
have ever used and fuji claims that its
point zero eight second lock time is the
world's fastest and compared to other
mirrorless cameras the xt one hunts less
in low-light and finds focus more
reliably all of those things matter
little the xt one doesn't have great
image quality
unfortunately it's really solid there as
well it's got the same 16 megapixel
x-trans aps-c sensor using Fuji films
x100s and xc2 and it's just as
impressive here it's got great colour
reproduction captures a lot of detail
and can be pushed to high ISOs without
turning into a noisy mess
Fuji films colours technology draws a
lot from its years of experience
producing films and it shows in the way
it's able to reproduce skin tones and
other difficult colors in a pleasing and
attractive way it shoots 1080p video at
60 frames per second but the video
features are definitely taking a
backseat to the stills it's also the
first Fujifilm camera to have remote
shooting via smartphone and that's
actually really impressive the xt-1 is
built-in Wi-Fi lets you transfer images
to your phone or use the Android or iOS
apps to take photos with the camera
complete with full control over exposure
and settings it's really fast and
responsive and doesn't have the lag that
I've seen on other camera remote apps I
tested the xt-1 with Fuji films 18 to 55
millimeter kit lens and a couple of it's
faster primes the 35 millimeter 1.4 and
the 27 millimeter to 8 pancake all of
these lenses are made of metal and have
a higher level of build quality than
it's typically found on mirrorless
cameras that isn't to say there aren't
some nagging things on the xt-1 that I'm
really not a huge fan of the 4 way
buttons on the back of the camera are
small and fiddly and the rear control
dial can be really hard to use when you
have the camera up to your eye it also
suffers some pretty poor battery life a
common problem with mirrorless cameras
but when looked at as a whole in the
grand scheme of things those are pretty
minor complaints and they don't take
away from the overall package the
Fujifilm XC 1 isn't a camera for
everybody it's a focus tool for
experienced photographers that know the
principles of photography at $1,300 for
the body or $1,700 with an 18 to 55
millimeter lens the xt-1 isn't really
priced for the casual photographer
either
it's like Fujifilm listen to what a lot
of photographers were asking for and
then included them in its camera without
compromising on what it's set out to do
with the series make a compact camera
that offers great image quality it
doesn't have the wow factor of a
full-frame camera like Sony's a7 but it
offers a better shooting experience and
still has the image quality that
demanding photographers look for it and
really at the end of the day it's just a
fun and rewarding camera to shoot with
it makes it really hard for me to put
down
