just ended and here are the three things
that I think you should know about
number one celebrities if this is your
first time watching a Ubisoft press
conference you might be surprised to see
so many people showing up that you don't
get instance really want to be there
this year jason derulo gave a
performance that was maybe not his best
performance and Angela Bassett showed up
and she was fantastic Angela Bassett
should be at every e3 press event unlike
say pehlay who is at the e a press event
number 2 the familiar properties it was
kind of an off year for the familiar
properties at Ubisoft we didn't see
watchdogs we didn't see far cry again
like I kind of thought we would we saw
it DLC kind of playing as filler for the
crew and trials fusion we saw things we
had seen in years past rainbow succeeds
showed a new mode the division showed
more of its campaign which we've seen a
few times and we saw another Assassin's
Creed and we always see in this assam
screen in fact this year was kind of
unusual because we only saw one
Assassin's Creed game it was a little
slow in terms of games that we already
know about there is the new stuff and
some of that was pretty exciting and
that brings me to point three there are
new properties at you massage for honor
is a fighting game in which you play as
as far as we can tell us the least
samurai vikings and knights and there's
a focus on melee combat namely swords we
saw the player positioning the swords
and defense and then positioning in the
end should lop off somebody's head to
their arm and just you know brutally
murder people it's almost like a
standalone fighting games happening
inside of a larger multiplayer event we
also saw
I go with me here Tom Clancy's Ghost
Recon wildlands which as far as I can
tell is an open-world game set inside of
a franchise set inside of another
franchise and we don't know much about
it other than that in this game you can
drive cars and boats you can fly
helicopters and can parachute you can
also kill lots of people it's kind of
like the US Special Forces meets Grand
Theft Auto which is not a thing I ever
thought I would say but here we are so
that's it not the best press conference
and that kind of set something coming
after ea's which was also a little slow
we started off strong with Microsoft
that I recommend you check out a recap
of that and we still have sony so
there's a lot more here and if you want
more about ubisoft press conference go
to the burj com we have an entire piece
explaining all of this we have a
supercut so you don't have to watch the
whole thing you can just watch let's say
the best few minutes until next time
I'll see you later bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
