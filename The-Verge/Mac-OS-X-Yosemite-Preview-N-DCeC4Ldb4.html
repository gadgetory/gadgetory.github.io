some new features and usually some
design tweaks and every year we wonder
if we're going to see iOS take over the
Mac and this year or the release it's
calling Yosemite Apple's brought the two
platforms closer together than ever
before but lucky for Mac users it's
making sure they stay distinct starting
today up 2 million regular people who
can sign up and download a beta for
Yosemite not just developers that's the
good news the bad news is that the very
best features of this new version are
the pieces that make it talk to an iPad
or iPhone with iOS 8
let's aren't out yet so you'll have to
wait until the fall before you'll be
using your Mac for making calls sending
texts and sharing files directly with
your iPhone also this is a beta so you
should not install it on your main
computer but what can you expect if you
do download and start using a70 quite a
lot first and foremost Yosemite is
completely redesigned from dock to
menubar and everything in between it
shares a lot of the aesthetic of iOS 8
it's a Johnny I've led flattening where
you used to have gradients Yosemite has
broad expanses of white where he used to
have thick toolbars with extra
information
Yosemite emphasizes thinness and
efficiency there are a lot of corners in
OS 10 and I keep expecting Apple to miss
a little one or two only to be
pleasantly surprised at the attention to
every little detail the so-called
stoplight buttons are cleaner and
actually worked the way you'd expect
when going to fullscreen other buttons
are were less well button E but not to
the extent that they are in iOS these
are still things that you click with a
mouse the icons are bolder the fonts are
updated there are still a few edges to
be smooth but not as many as you'd
expect on a beta but the biggest change
I probably the most radical is all the
translucency and lots of places
throughout the Mac you'll find that
different parts are see-through and show
you a blurred out version of what's
behind the window side bars show you the
desktop or the window behind it menu
bars show you the content of what's
inside the window as you scroll up and
the Notification Center appears over the
desktop instead of under it all these
blurred out elements are supposed to
help give you a sense of place for your
windows or maybe they're just meant to
look cool mostly I found the effects
distracting and I was constantly
glancing at elements on the screen that
I'm used to being completely static and
it wasn't too long before I was taking
through the settings to turn down the
effect another big change and a huge
improvement
with Notification Center in Yosemite
it's actually finally useful not only
can you reply to some notifications
right there in the pop-up but you can
actually add useful widgets inside the
Notification Center instead of a basic
list of alerts you can get customized
pieces of data including a daily
calendar view that actually makes sense
third-party widgets are coming to the
max Universal Search spotlight also got
an upgrade and now pops up right in the
center of your screen just like the
third-party Alfred app and it's able to
give you more search results than just
your local files just like Alfred
sometimes it works for searching the web
and sometimes it doesn't but mostly it's
a big functional improvement over what
we had before Apple gave a bunch of love
to its built-in apps as well Safari has
some new tab and address bar features
that finally give chroma run for its
money
and it's usually way faster and gentler
on your battery calendar has it today
view that's actually worth using mail
has the ability to mark up attachments
and store them in the cloud most of the
important built-in apps have received a
fresh coat of semi translucent white
paint it's all simpler looking but it's
still just as powerful at the end of the
day the most important thing to remember
is that the Mac is still the Mac sure
we'll be able to hand stuff off to your
iPhone and yeah it looks more like the
apps on your iPad than ever but Apple
isn't taking Mac features away it's just
making them look better or at least
making him look more consistent and just
wait until you go 70 and iOS 8 are out
this fall Apple is not trying to merge
your computer in your smartphone it's
just trying to make them all work better
together it's gonna be great hey doctor
you're on speakerphone with V on my Mac</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
