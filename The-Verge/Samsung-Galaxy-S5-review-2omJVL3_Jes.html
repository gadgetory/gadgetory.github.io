about what we should do with our cell
phones and it's been wrong a lot I don't
want to wave my hand over the phone to
answer a call thank you very much but
this time Samsung says it's trying
something different to perfect the
things that users really care about and
leave the rest aside and when it does
weird things to at least make them
awesome that's how you get this the
Galaxy s5 to look at it the s5 is not
actually that different from last year's
ultra popular galaxy s4 it has a
slightly larger 5.1 inch screen and is
thus a little bigger but it's pretty
much the same look the same layout the
same everything but that's okay the
1080p screen is absolutely beautiful the
phone is thin and light and it's as
usable as any other big 5 inch phone
which is to say not very but that's what
you sacrifice for a screen like this and
the look may not have changed but the
phone feels really different it's still
made of plastic and it feels like it
belongs in a toy aisle when you compare
it to the HTC One or the iPhone 5s or
even the Moto X but it has this slightly
dimpled soft touch back that feels a lot
better than the gross slimy shell of the
s4 is it great no it's not even good but
it's better the one remarkable
improvement is that the s5 is waterproof
there's an awkward port flap covering up
the charger but other than that there's
no indication that this phone has been
ruggedized at all but it has it doesn't
seem like a big deal but it is
since the s5 doesn't feel so precious I
want to be using it in places I never
would otherwise one thing Samsung's
always paid attention to is battery life
and it holds true here to the s5 lasts
through a day even a day and a half
without much trouble at all if you do
run into problems there's a crazy ultra
power saving mode that instantly turns
your phone into a super basic but super
long-lasting device so no matter what
comes you'll probably be okay the last
big thing manufacturers have to get
right is the camera and Samsung does
more or less it has a 16 megapixel
camera that is capable of taking really
great sharp pictures there's a neat
real-time HDR mode which does wonders
for shots with bright backgrounds and
dark subjects they're also of course
many of the same weird dual camera modes
and crazy filters as always a second
sensor in the camera makes auto focusing
really fast and it'll even shoot 4k
video if for some insane reason you want
your phone video in 4k it has some real
trouble in really low light but for most
things you'd want to shoot with your
phone the s5s camera is solid
Samsung got the big mission-critical
things right here the display and
battery
can check the camera mostly check and
even though build quality is still
pretty rough having a waterproof phone
is at least worth something that's all
great but as they always seem to the
little things kill Samsung little things
like the fact that every time the phone
vibrates it sounds like an explosion and
feels like something is rattling around
inside the phone like the speaker which
points quiet tinny audio away from your
face like the fact that the fingerprint
sensor the supposedly great addition
that makes it super secure and easy to
unlock your phone and pay for stuff is
impossible to use unless you hold the
phone in two hands and swipe oh so
carefully right perfectly down the
center of the home button like the
multitasking and back buttons that bleed
a circle of white light and just look
bad Samsung has always over customized
Android and its TouchWiz skin here on
top of Android 4.4.2 is only a very
slight improvement Samsung has cleaned
up the TouchWiz look a lot and it's now
a lot more consistent and a lot less
ugly it still has just as many weird
options and ideas they're all just
better hidden now Samsung still preloads
too many apps recolors just about
everything and for some reason that is
far beyond me still insists on making
the phone bloop and ripple every time
you touch it the phone is really fast
thanks to a quad-core Snapdragon 801
processor but the software is so over
animated that it can still feel laggy in
spots magazine UX the Flipboard powered
news reader that lives to the left of
the home screen isn't as good as HTC
blinkfeed
TouchWiz just isn't as good as sense in
general even if Samsung has made some
steps in the right direction when there
are 20 options in the notification pull
down 61 items in the settings menu and
27 different camera settings Samsung's
still doing something wrong here then
there are a few good ideas that Samsung
had that it just hasn't executed very
well as health is a shockingly
full-featured app that can do everything
from track your steps to tell you how to
exercise or eat better but it's really
not well implemented you have to
explicitly tell it to start tracking
your steps and adding food or exercise
gets really clunky the s5 even has a
heart rate monitor if you're really into
tracking yourself but it's really
inconsistent and just doesn't make sense
here the way it does on the gear fit
luckily most of its problems are easy
enough to hide or avoid except for the
heart rate monitor which creates an ugly
divot in the back of the phone and
that's the thing about the s5 which cost
$199 on contract on just about every
carrier out there samsung got virtually
all of the important things right and
most of the things wrong are a nuisance
not a deal-breaker but for all the boxes
it takes
s5 just isn't an interesting phone or
one I want to use it doesn't impress or
inspire the way the HTC One or the
iPhone does and it doesn't offer
something groundbreaking ly cool like
the notifications or voice control of
the Moto X the s5 is just good good
enough even but I wanted better</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
