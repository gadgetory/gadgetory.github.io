film Allah knows I was president and CEO
of sony electronics america and we are
standing in front of a very impressive
television pretty toes be my absolute
pleasure we've just today announced this
sony xbr 84 inch 4k TV it's our first 4k
TV as you can see first of all it's a
large TV 84 inch across on the diameter
but the key here is that this picture
you're seeing is four times the
resolution of Full HD so four times the
resolution of filler HD which gives us
the ability to give this a completely
immersive picture and what you can see
is strands of hands or beads of sweat in
this kind this picture it's so immersive
so we're standing at the back end of
this what makes it so unique we have the
x-reality pro intelligent engine that is
driving this panel to allow this depth
of color and this clarity of picture so
that's one part and the other part is we
brought together the best of audio sony
knows audio and sound matters and we
have a combination of 10 speakers in
total on this TV and in combination they
give 50 watts of power and it's got sub
woofer as well so when you see this
visual impact together with the audio
impact then it really takes your breath
away so how are you going to get 4k
content opportunity because you guys are
3d for a while there was a big rush to
your 3d content I don't know if it never
really took off the way anybody's hoping
and now we're kind of looking at 4k are
we going to distribute 4k to people all
right much more stuff so look I've got
to pick you up on the 3d side because
you know if we look at the cinematic
revenue on 3d all right 3d films it
heated it's cube at home you know there
are many many titles available in 3d 3d
is available for download on sony
entertainment network there are two
broadcast stations that are feeding 3d
to the homes across the u.s. there's a
hundred 3d playstation title so you know
context is there
this product comes with 3d as do all of
our other TVs so 3d is there but this is
the great next revolution in TV viewing
and the 4k content perhaps not many
people know but we have a professional
sides it's only business and on that
professional side we've produced what we
call the f65 4k camera yeah and this 4k
camera we announced to the industry 18
months ago and we've sold many many
hundreds and there are now producers in
the US and around the globe that are
capturing sporting content in 4k as well
as making movies in 4k and TV series in
4k how are you going to get that from
the camera so the full code delivery we
can take first of all blu-ray and if we
take a blu-ray in 2k format that can be
upscaled buy a blu-ray players too near
4k resolution and in the future of
course our plan is to bring native 4k
content to consumers but then I'm going
to talk about another day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
