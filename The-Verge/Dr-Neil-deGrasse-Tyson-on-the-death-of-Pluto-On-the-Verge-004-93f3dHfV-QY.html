Pluto as a as a plan I was an accessory
I mean I well well okay so but I drove
the getaway car but I didn't commit the
crime well so there's a there's a
there's a book written by a guy named
Mike Brown it's a good friend card how I
killed Pluto and why it had it come in
is there a beef in this in the science
community about who was responsible for
the death of Pluto I mean I got blamed
for killing Pluto but I didn't kill
Bluto but he took the credit he so
therefore all right so he not only
killed Pluto he admitted it so so get
off my back right you're right have you
got the gun the smoking gun and the
person who pulled the trigger and all I
did was drive the getaway car so in the
year 2000 we rebuilt the Hayden
Planetarium into a whole facility and we
said well we want a future proof it what
is the trend line what are the trend
lines in scientific research so that
when we cut metal it'll have some shelf
life for it without having to redo it
every six months we notice that more icy
bodies were being discovered in the
outer solar system who look more like
Pluto than either Pluto or they look
like any other planet that's an awesome
sentence by the way you follow that
sentence meaning so so what anytime that
happens in science you say there's a
category just waiting to be named a new
a new bin of identity just asking for it
and so Pluto and these other icy bodies
are part of the Kuiper belt of comets
Kuiper was a guy who predicted that this
belt of frozen objects would exist
beyond Neptune sure enough there they
are course and Pluto was the first among
them and we just grandfathered it in his
planet but it's really puny it is it is
much smaller than our moon half of its
volume is a small I imagine Pluto as
being like you know could fit like
somewhere on the stage right over there
how small is Pluto okay I'll tell you if
if Neptune that's that don't use Neptune
go with like a basketball compared to a
basketball no no you don't know where
I'm gonna land that's true so how will
you not tell me not to go why does if
it's a reference point I'm just saying
okay so if
- were analogized with a Chevy Impala in
mass yes of course so now how big is
Pluto compared to that so this Chevy
Impala parked at curbside Pluto would be
not like a Mini Cooper no it would be a
matchbox car sitting on the curb all
right but compared to the moon the moon
the moon is I forgot the exact number
it's like eight times the mass of Pluto
our moon where can we put Pluto in the
world can we put it down somewhere Oh
Pluto would fit between like here and
and Chicago okay so that big did I just
say that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
