welcome welcome to on the verge brought
to you by Samsung I'm your host Josh
Topolsky and you're not me which is
great there should only be one it's
really enough for everyone we have a
very interesting very exciting show for
you tonight Brian Bishop our intrepid
reporter
I call it reporters intrepid a lot our
intrepid reporter went to Pixar to
interview the producer and director of
monsters University a documentary about
monsters and and it's what it is
and Nilay Patel is going to be here in
the studio talking about Google and all
their crazy projects and the most
important thing you need to know right
now is that John McAfee is back on bath
salts so obviously lots to talk about
let's get into the news of the week as
many of you know the biggest gaming show
of the year III was held last week in
Los Angeles at the show we got to see a
bunch of the next-generation consoles we
saw Sony's PlayStation 4 Microsoft's
Xbox one Nintendo Nintendo didn't show
anything because they don't have a
next-generation console but the big news
this week is that Microsoft is reversing
its policies that have been extremely
controversial policies that would have
made it very hard for people to sell use
games for the Xbox one they would have
required an internet connection so your
console could check in every 24 hours
and obviously there was a strong
reaction to to those policies and you
know take a look here here's the kind of
negative reaction we've been seeing
before they reverse the policy
just people ripping their shirts off and
rioting in the streets of Redmond and
elsewhere around the world so Microsoft
has now gone back on on those policies
and that should be good for the
shirtless guy but but I actually
actually want to talk about last year's
e3 we saw a game called The Last of Us
at e3 2012 I guess it would have been
and I was very excited to play this it's
a very intense emotional game for the
ps3 it was just released on June 14th
and I spent last weekend playing it in a
haze of nyquil because I was sick and
and I broke down several times in tears
because my nyquil ran out and but the
game is actually really intense and
really emotional and I thought it showed
a whole new type of art form something
that's that's that's in some ways more
emotional than film but recently some
filmmakers have been really outspoken
about the fact that games don't do what
films can do Steven Spielberg and George
Lucas in particular have talked about it
not really being viable as the same kind
of art as film George Lucas said this is
a quote by its very nature there cannot
be a plot in a game you know and I think
you have to listen to to Lucas because
this is a guy who made such incredible
stuff as as this right here
hi
highbrow fare and but Spielberg also
joined in saying that the second you get
a controller something turns off in the
heart you know but luckily that's not
the opinion of everybody in Hollywood in
fact there's there's somebody who really
disagrees with him I've been playing
games for decades and I even started
playing pong in 1974 and over the years
that experience has exploded from the
simple pixels upon two worlds that are
as immersive as is certainly more
physically interactive than those
portrayed on the silver screen yeah yeah
a slightly different tune when he was
talking about his new halo project for
the Xbox but ok moving on yeeeeesss
Jesus Jesus leaked on the internet last
week sparking a rash oh sorry uses his
Kanye West's new record I should
probably tell you that though you know
don't you sparking a rash of listens in
my home after I pirated it and I have to
say I think it's an incredible record
musically inventive lyrically bankrupt
which is the makes for the best pop
music possible and to promote the album
which was officially released on June
18th
Kanye put a video up on Kanye West calm
his internet website starring my
personal hero Scott Disick the baby
daddy of Kourtney Kardashian and
Jonathan Cheban who is the best friend
of Kim Kardashian the video is a remake
of the film adaptation of Bret Easton
Ellis's American Psycho novel with
Disick in the titular role of the psycho
take a look and in Steve Jobs
try getting the universe
just a normal way to say hey I just had
a baby
anyhow uh you know that's Kanye you
can't be Kanye so finally in News Google
launched a new product called loon which
is is a real thing it's a balloon that
gives internet brings Internet to people
who can't get internet it floats around
beaming it down to I don't know if you
don't have the Internet do they have
computers I don't really know at any
rate it's it's another Google X project
Google X as you may know is a secretive
gang of people at Google who come of
wacky out their ideas they're probably
best known for Google glass which has
allowed Sergey Brin's bro hams to
skydive and BMX their way into a Google
keynote or maybe you've seen Google
self-driving car which has recently been
used to help a blind man order a Taco
Bell at a drive-thru which i think is
that's not even a joke I think it's the
pinnacle the pinnacle of innovation
Larry Page Larry Page the CEO of Google
is a guy who's known for daring ideas
such as matching his microphones to his
outfits and and and you know here's it
here's a clip of him talking about how
he'd like to do more experimentation we
haven't maybe belts mechanisms to allow
experimentation there's many many
exciting and important things you could
do they just can't do because they're
illegal or they're not allowed by
regulation and that's make sense or if
we don't want to work the world to
change too fast but maybe we should set
aside a small part of the world you know
I like going to Burning Man for example
I'm sure many of you have been to yeah
I get it look I get it you know uh Larry
is limited by what he can do by things
like laws ethics morality the average
human lifespan it's it's troubling it's
really problematic and here to talk
about this problem is the lovely
delightful
Nilay Patel I'm here yeah I like you've
been to Burning Man several times I'm
drunk right now
do you either stuff we want to talk
about that some real stuff but for a
second I'd like to ask you what you
think Larry Page is doing what's the
hyper I was there in the audience when
he was giving that speech and I couldn't
I couldn't process it at the time yeah
because you know he has a vocal cord
problem so it's like he's whispering to
this roomful thousands of people about
this place he wants to go yeah it was it
was like nothing I've ever seen I like
I've never been a birdie man but my
assumption is Mike my guess is that most
people go to Bernie men are on acid yeah
during their while they build a square
the trip they're tripping on acid
they're smoking doobies but but Google
is I mean obviously he's smoking doobies
but google is pushing is pushing a lot
of boundaries a lot of leads they just
did this thing this loon project can you
explain to me I mean I know what it is
but there are people here who might not
know there are people watching who might
not know can you explain loon so it's
Google's plan to put Internet access to
give it an access people in remote
places by sending weather balloons the
balloons have internet they go something
like twelve miles in the air do they
just they just how long are they up
there unclear I think it's a long time
so the balloons have computers in them
and they can regulate where they are on
the airstrip Rome books books so they
can go up and down the Airstream and
like move around and like track where
they're going right it's it's very
high-tech in like the most insane like
this is like it would be a good plot for
a Bond movie yeah like seriously like
but it's not that evil yeah but like
okay like what is the village like I
mean I'm gonna give internet to people
who don't have it take that James Bond I
mean he controls I think actually I will
control the world's information was
actually the plot of a Bond movie that
was tomorrow never done tomorrow never
dies
which is basically like
I think Larry Page it's it's a statement
of raw ambition right it's we want to
like the googles mission statement is we
want to organize collect and organize
the world's information and then
sometimes like and don't be evil yeah
and if you get rid of don't be evil it's
we want to have the world's information
either in dust control the workdays eat
out don't be evil yeah they're basically
they're basically like we just want info
right I like that they're like look
where are places we cannot get
information right so we're going to send
balloons into the stratosphere later
that so they could do Google and if you
look at the things they do that reflect
on there there should be a place where
there's less regulations so we can be
nuts you know it's directed right now
that that energy is focused on putting
interacts he just say he said that in
the clip that there should be a place
where they can experiment now I've been
watching this show called top of the
lake which is set in New Zealand it's a
it's like a crime drama but my I just
finished watching it my impression is
that that in New Zealand the police
don't really have any power yeah
do you think that it's the transition
from the movie the road warrior to the
transition the road warrior warrior
which was not a fictional that's not
zealand that's and that's where Mel
Gibson Kansas was in Austria was
discovered explain his behavior later in
life but do you think New Zealand could
be a place where they're like setting up
their Google Island well no I mean
that's like the they're like look you
don't have internet we can come in we'll
put the balloons in the sky don't worry
about it and the people of Christchurch
New Zealand we're like yeah that sounds
great
in Kenya they're doing whitespace
internet which is companies like Google
and Microsoft even trying to put
whitespace internet the United States
and Europe for a decade and failed yeah
because people here like no we use that
spectrum for other things you can't have
it Google is like screw it we'll go to
Kenya and do it there and that's their
argument their argument is we can go to
these states with less regulation less
industry and we'll we'll try stuff and
see how it works yeah first-first
whitespace internet next your soul yeah
well I mean the flipside is maybe you
don't want them to disrupt everything
all the time like yeah they tried to
build Google health and I think that
that was on Larry's mind when you talk
about this there's too much regulation
everywhere
he said during that speech like you know
I I'm sick and you know I finally told
everybody that's wrong with my throat
and you know I realized the reason we
don't share medical information is just
because of insurance companies I'm
sitting there thinking that's not true
it's actually just deeply personal yeah
you don't want like I don't want to like
Google like plus one like I have
browsers
it's like on your on your Google Plus
page there's a sidebar I was like your
current ailments like just had a
check-up but I think you all need just
tonsils out and you can't build like
yeah like what it's great like Google
has products that are good like that
work right um and that's great so let
you balloon yeah it's great if Google
builds Google search or Gmail for health
care maybe what if they build wave right
it's like I'm gonna give all my health
care data to Google Rock way and the
like screwed this sucks so I will you
know it your Google+ health I really
think it was that important after all so
wait where's the internet coming from
for loon so that's totally unclear to me
I mean from assassin I know that the
balloons form a mesh network which is by
the way like saloons were mesh network
these like Waterworld yeah but the
upstream connection to the balloons I
have not been able to know he's one of
the speeds quickly there's a big wired
exclusive at it and their speed that we
are quickly browsing the internet at
someone's house on an old HP laptop so
so so do you think projects like a loon
is obviously like a I mean I want to
know if it's a moving shot it's just a
weird off it's a moon side it's part of
Google X right so Google X they describe
it as the place where they make atoms
right so they built the car the build
kuru glass they built X or they built
loon and they're saying we want to come
up with ideas and have them fail as
quickly as possible so we can move on to
the next one so loon is one of the few
that is like they had the idea they
decided was workable then made it it's
official it's out in the world but it's
not it's not in the same as like a
Google glass or the driverless car which
feels to me like it's got more of an
obvious commercial application
I think glass is a real real outlier for
them in terms of Google X projects think
it's an outlier because it is being
marketed in some ways it's oh yeah you
know they'll make a next one and you
know I think Sergey said glasses
virtually done from his perspective
proof-of-concept is made they put out in
the world there's a team now that's
gonna iterate on it
I think the driverless car and the
balloons that give people Internet yeah
I think it's different you don't think
the driverless car is gonna be a real
product is gonna be something that is in
the world I think it's a technology that
they'll sell the car companies I think
but you have to change the whole world
to enable driverless cars like you have
to they're going state-by-state to like
change the laws to get them even allowed
who's like this the basic question of if
you're driverless car crashes who's
responsible is not answered so my
problem with Google is I've struggle
with this concept that they're like
their company is in beta in a lot of
ways that I've we talked about this
before they talk about doing beta
projects but does it do you buy into is
there an evil and angle to this I mean
cuz some of the stuff they do does seem
sinister right right and some of it but
I can't tell if it's a sinister because
they they they have these their
financial issues they want to like get
at you for some reasons they can make
money ultimately or if it's if it's just
because they're setting some how naive
about humanity I think it I think it's
super naive and I think it's it's a
question of who are you gonna trust
right and Google believes you should
trust them because they have your best
and feel like you should trust Google I
do but I feel like I only trust Google
because their products are so good that
I have no choice bad really
it's like a danger but like if your
government did the things that Google
does regularly because a condition of
your participation you'd feel like you
know government's reading all your email
no one's happy about it yeah but the
price of about it but the price of it is
I think you know the government cloud
service free prevails the service we
provide you in exchange for reading your
email is that we keep you safe right but
people are I don't know that I read
anybody believes that exchange is real
or valuable Google says the service we
provide for you in exchange for reading
your email and the ads next to it is a
gigabyte of storage and it's like is
that the same it's like preventing
terror like I don't know those balances
are not the same I don't trust Google to
prevent terrorism that's for sure
well a dark depressing take on on Google
I love
of upsetting and frightening take on
Google and Neil I thanks for being here
and taking the time to talk yeah it is
you are you're contractually obligated
to speak to me and now stay here don't
go anywhere we have an amazing
incredible astounding fantastic video
with Brian Bishop at Pixar and I think
you're gonna enjoy it
we're here in Emeryville California at
Pixar Animation Studios you might have
heard of Pixar if the company behind Toy
Story A Bug's Life wall-e
Finding Nemo monsters incorporated hop
and the company's latest movie monsters
University
I know you were princess and I'm just a
stableboy puppy paws at my bed were you
kissing my hand no and what about you
with all your shedding I don't shut
really I had just started a pic start
when the first movie came out so I mean
I was a fan of Monsters Inc and just the
idea of telling a college story and and
the idea of telling a story about a
character that doesn't get exactly what
they want was really appealing to me I
think with any Pixar movie that's the
thing that gets us excited is the thing
where we think that could come off bad
where that could be like the dangerous
part the parts like are we really gonna
try to do that cuz that could be that's
where I think we all get excited like
well we don't have we don't know but I
like that about whenever I hear what the
new Pixar ideas I think sell that and
that's good because it hopefully means
its original and taking a risk
Rick and I both worked on the first
monsters incorporated and if you ever go
back and watch the first one again
you'll notice that the same like 12
background monsters are everywhere we
just like repurposed them and put things
in their hands and stuff so I think you
know we always said that we'd really use
all the parts of the Buffalo making that
movie and so I think both of us really
wanted to make sure that we you know
populated the world more densely this
time around normally is a process of
Pixar's we would do as the background
characters later as the story evolved
and was kind of changing we knew that we
need to populate this campus because we
did it so early it would help influence
story so story would come up with gags
based upon some of these design and then
by source that they would come up with a
gag and hopefully we can cast someone
from this group we need a slug okay all
the slugs
Pixar hasn't structured like a
traditional movie studio instead of
bringing people together on a
project-by-project basis as a group of
talented folks in house across every
single discipline I worked in the
industry for ten years before I got here
so I worked a lot of different places I
was down in LA and you kind of jump
around a little bit more down in LA here
you just kind of stay I've worked in
places there are the opposite we have a
term where you know oh yeah well you're
basically just a wrist there and all
you're doing is just drawing you don't
think it's really limiting you know
you're really you're really stunting the
growth of the film or whatever you're
working on if you're not allowing an
environment where creative ideas can
rise to the top
and get the best product that you can
get from the very beginning John worked
really really hard to form a studio that
wasn't higher up a crew for one film let
them all go restart again and and do
that every four or five years he wanted
people to stay that's you know one of
the reasons we do short films because we
have projects that people can work on in
between you know the time on features
and I think he just he he really really
believes that it's important to keep
people here and keep giving them new
opportunities and new learning
experiences the Studios movies have a
distinct look and feel almost
immediately you can tell that you're
watching a Pixar movie that makes the
need for fresh creative voices with
different perspectives even more
important one of those voices is the
director of the blue umbrella the short
film that accompanies monsters
University
I started in 2008 a pizza in the
comments aging department which
basically does the virtual
cinematography of the phones there's an
open door policy epic so about pitching
ideas for short films so anyone can
pitch as long as you have three ideas
and I just thought well I should as well
just try it it was based on a test I had
shot just just for fun on my phone
actually of phases in the city and then
I had loaded them up with my computer
one weekend and animated them and that
was part of the pitch I showed just to
show what I mean with the city coming to
life he talked to picks our employees
and this isn't a fly-by-night kind of
place people are here for 10 years 15
years 20 years the studio does a lot to
let employees explore different creative
avenues and different disciplines they
may not have a chance to look at
otherwise it's kind of a nice playground
to have people try out new roles and new
positions and even sometimes in
different departments to kind of be a
bit more playful with that I've been
animating since I was a kid
drawing on the cards and I was studying
animation at RISD Toy Story came out my
senior year they came and brought it to
RISD and they were said they were
looking for an intern and I was the
first animation intern you worked on the
monsters Inc as well he says yeah I was
that was the first film I was a lead I
was a directing animator which means I
was kind of a deputy to the sheriff on
that one and then I supervised two cars
up and now monsters University
so what's it you have a next one lined
up are you like this Stoke for vacation
at this point I am stoked for vacation
I actually I'm in-between I'm gonna try
some storyboarding and just approach
animation from another angle and and I
don't know we'll see what what happens
next it is an incredibly supportive
environment so so while it's a little
bit scary we have the confidence that we
have this amazingly talented group of
people around us to help us when we get
in trouble
Pixar's recorded actors in this room for
every film since monsters incorporated
and it's about to get even busier the
company has six films lineup over the
next four years the only question is can
Pixar's approach to filmmaking hold up
under the volume we've developed a
collective style almost because it is so
collaborative here and because the same
people are working on the films for
years and years we are under an umbrella
but it's a very big umbrella it's
exciting as new people come in they
change that a little bit I'm writing on
a couple of things but I'm also helping
out on the upcoming features in in the
cabinet staging department so it's a mix
of tons of different things because you
always like everyone works together to
make the features happen and then on the
side you're doing other things as well
there's a desire to say bring something
new here you know what what what do you
want to do it will all get filtered into
you know what I mean into a process that
feels somewhat familiar but that's all
the more reason why you need a variety
of people it's all the more reason why
you need a new outlook well find out
over the next couple of years how
Pixar's aggressive new pace will work
out but inside the studio walls the
focus is the same as it's always been on
creative collaboration and stories
stories story sometimes we throw the
whole movie out and start over
completely it's really a process of not
falling in love with your work if there
is a problem with the film we're all
gonna get together and fix it and we're
not gonna let go until we know we fix it
and if that means pushing a release date
or if that means delaying things on
other shows we'll do it and the most
important thing is we're not really
scaling up or changing the amount of
time for the story which is the one
thing I think we need the time for we're
creating more movies and putting more
people on them but we're back we're back
up so that we still give ourselves the
amount of time for story development
that we need
lovely work from Brian and that that is
our show
I want to thank Brian for going out and
doing that Nilay for being here you the
viewer for being so incredible I want to
thank ease this for just drop in a sick
just a sick record on all of us and and
that's it we'll be back next week with
more on the verge and until then there
is no until then
