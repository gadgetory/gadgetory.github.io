have been dissatisfied for hundreds of
years musicians have searched for the
next sound the next evolution that could
change everything and more often than
not the solutions and foibles have been
basically technological in nature
technological advancement in music has
always been a fraught process sometimes
it's an overt success with lasting
impact like when Beethoven decided to
add trombones to the orchestra for his
fifth symphony and sometimes the
influence of technology and music leads
to mixed results just ask any rush van
about the 1982 album signals I've been
privileged to perform in some of the
world's most famous concert halls but
it's always just been me and my clarinet
and anywhere from a few to a hundred or
so colleagues traditional classical
music and I do mean the stuff written by
dead white guys is by definition
unplugged I've always been interested in
the interplay between technology and
music electronics found their way into
the Symphony Orchestra as early as the
1920s and after all you can't put on a
great rock show without a backline and
the support crew of techs and engineers
it requires the great jazz drummer
Freddy Gruber once said you can have a
beautiful body and look marvelous but if
you're not breathing it's not alive so
what happens when circuits replace
physics and musical performance is it
still alive
martigny is a drum tech based in New
York City without people like him rock
shows simply don't happen Martin's been
on the road with some of the biggest
acts in the world including my personal
favorite rush his job is to bridge the
gap between technology and talent so
you've been doing this for a long time
you've worked with rush you've worked
with rush you've worked with rush sting
seal all kinds of people how is
technology different when you first
started helping people with their drums
and now right after the 90s with this
whole thing of like sampling and
triggering check one two in the house
right on we're ready to go it's how you
embrace it just like anything else can
you use technology to make a drum kit
simpler oh yeah absolutely
twenty Royster for example he shows how
to incorporate in the basic like five
piece kit all the sounds you need just
by changing samples so do you ever worry
about the long-term impact of technology
on drumming or music in general because
it's sort of the responsibility of
players and musicians to keep to keep
the humanity in the music making I feel
as always humans playing instruments as
always this is kind of like the whole
matrix thing you let the machines take
over or you or the humans take over I
spoke with Kenny Aronoff about it you
know he's one of the top session players
ever and I asked him a sec so do you
think because everything changed like I
don't think it's ever gonna change if
they want me to play I'm still gonna
play
technology and music advances because it
has two musicians demanded Jordan Rudess
the keyboard player from prog rock
mainstay Dream Theater has always been
interested in what the future holds
he even develops his own music making
apps and has worked with Rowley on an
instrument called the Seaboard grant I
spent my whole life learning how to play
the piano I went to Julliard when I was
nine years old my upbringing was very
very serious matter of fact I was in
closet improviser I would go and I play
my visual songs in my jazz music I'd
bring the kids into like a practice room
they don't tell anybody but here we are
right but really my focus was to be a
classical pianist and learning the piano
was everything but as I got older I
started to become more interested in
sound and synthesizers and different
possibilities eventually I ended up
leaving Julliard and looking for other
ways to express music when you first
started using technology to augment or
enhance or to evolve what you were doing
with acoustic instruments did you were
there new skills did you ready to learn
did you have to make sacrifices or was
it a whole new world I can remember
vividly when my high school friends
brought over a mug sonic six keyboard to
my house and also my mother's face when
she saw my friends carrying this because
she was like what is that it was looking
for the devil it's arrived at her house
but we brought it into my room and I
plugged in headphones at the time and
it's a you know a traditional kind of
keyboard but it has a pitch wheel on it
and the pitch wheel discovery was major
I started to move the pitch wheel I went
oh my god I think my brain like
literally exploded
and I realized then and over the years
how important pitch is an amplitude the
two very basic things controlling
amplitude in real time and controlling
pitch is a major part of expression
growing up with a piano which is you
know you play the note and you're not
changing the pitch it is what you play
is what you get which is so different
than so many other instruments like a
guitar where you play a string and you
can add vibrato or a wind instrument
like a clarinet again or a saxophone or
anything like that yeah pitch is such an
important part of music making you think
about like you know a guitar player is
like you know you look at Jeff Beck
Steve Vai you think about their vibrato
the speed of their vibrato the way they
attack the note the amplitude it's
everything it creates the style so here
we are with the C board and as a
keyboard player I'm able to do that
we sit here today in front of a Steinway
piano and this seaboard is really pretty
amazing although I've been involved in
the exploration of sound and all
different kinds of ways to make sound
since starting out as a classical
pianist this is really the first time
that all that exploration has come to a
point where I can really use my piano
skill and take it to another level
musical expression wise so tell me at a
technical level how this instrument
works the Seaboard
is basically poured silicone and
underneath the silicone are these
sensors so when your finger lands on the
surface it's actually triggering the
sensor that's below it and the sensor
will recognize position and will also
recognize pressure so as I press into it
it knows that and what's really cool and
very different than traditional
synthesizers these days is it every note
that I play is an independent message
that goes out you can bend one note not
the other you can play a three note
chord here and then just slide down with
this one this enables keyboard players
or anybody who is familiar with the
keyboard as a concept to add the kind of
expression that would we would want from
the musical instrument
technology's had a point right now where
we can really measure touch and the
experience and make it so sensitive
really as sensitive as we want it keeps
on getting better
it's important for people to realize
that you know technology is no longer
this kind of distant robotic type of
thing where it were at lacks expression
we're actually becoming closer to the
organic physical real human experience
with instruments like this than ever
before
and that's the whole point instruments
exist because the human voice alone has
never been enough to create the sounds
musicians hear in their heads that's
really the beginning and the end of the
lifelong struggle that is music and no
matter what technology can't replace
collaboration
music has always been a conversation
that happens among human beings it's as
true now as it was 300 years ago
artistic genius alone cannot overcome
physics but genius is often the impetus
for technological breakthroughs the
keyboards that Jordan Rudess plays today
exist because composers like Mozart and
Beethoven needed more from their
instruments and their aspirations and
achievements motivated craftsmen to push
the envelope technology isn't a
substitute for musicianship it's a tool
electronic instruments have potential
maybe even great potential and who knows
what the next truly Great Canadian power
trio will come up with but in the end
technology makes noise musicians turn it
into music</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
