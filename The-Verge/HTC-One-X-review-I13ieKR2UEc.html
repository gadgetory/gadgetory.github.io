and today we're looking at the HTC One X
I won't pull any punches this is one of
the best design phones I've ever used
and you get the immediate impression
that this is designed to be a premium
device which is exactly the image that
HTC is going for here the gentle curve
of the shells reminiscent of the Galaxy
Nexus but the similarities and their HTC
has better materials and has likely draw
more attention on the street
particularly in the standout white that
we tested some buyers will be
disappointed that the 1800 milliamp hour
battery in the One X isn't removable but
I wouldn't worry about it too much
getting through a day on a charge wasn't
an issue and I wouldn't be surprised if
18 T's model shipped with a slightly
larger cell to accommodate the LTE radio
and besides sealing the battery is what
allowed HTC to put together this
gorgeous seamless plastic shell
seriously everything about this design
is meticulous the micro drilled grilles
for the loudspeaker near piece this
smartly placed dot contact pads that are
aligned in such a way that they become a
design feature on their own looking at
the software since for the latest
version of HTC's Android skin is
debuting on the 1-series
and it's obvious that HTC has been
listening to complaints from customers
and people like us there's still some
sense trademarks here like the ring lock
screen that gives you shortcut access to
four apps and of course the instantly
recognizable flip clock widget but a
bunch of things have been cleaned up the
homescreen dock is now fully
configurable which means you're not
stuck with a permanent personalized
button and the recent apps list has been
removed from the notification curtain
which makes more room for you know
notifications since four is also based
on Android 4.0 which means you've got
the Roboto font throughout the system
access to Chrome for Android and the
test switcher though HTC has mixed it up
a bit
unlike stock Android HTC switcher is a
full screen app it isn't overlaid on the
screen it only lets you see one app
thumbnail at a time it seems a little
wasteful to me particularly considering
this gorgeous 4.7 inch display it's not
an exaggeration for me to tell you that
this is the best display I've ever seen
on a phone it's nearly perfect the 312
PPI pixel density puts it into retina
territory the color reproduction is
absolutely superb and is laminated
meaning you can tilt it 90 degrees in
either direction and it literally looks
like it's at the surface of the glass
and because it's an LCD colors don't
look blown out
it's not pencil and you don't run into
as much trouble in direct sunlight as
you do on some amyloids the only
complaint anyone could possibly have
about it in fact is that it's too big
four point seven inches might be a bit
large for smaller hands or people who
are used to something like an iPhone
three and a half inches or an original
four inch galaxy s the One X isn't
without its flaws though I actually
don't think since four goes far enough
toward toning down the experience gotten
really used to stock ICS on the Galaxy
Nexus over the last few months and since
still seems overwrought and over
designed by comparison with unnecessary
transitions bright colors and feature
tweaks that don't really do the user any
good and they make a pixel camera a
headline feature on this phone produce
surprisingly soft images that I could
instantly pick out as coming from a
camera phone rather than a
point-and-shoot I'd really high hopes
for the sensor on the One X so that was
a big disappointment would I recommend
the One X though absolutely without
hesitation
especially now that HTC is really
embracing the hacker community and
making it easier for folks to replace
the ROM if they like this hardware with
a less in your face you I would be close
to the perfect Android device the only
question is whether you want the One X
is great display or the One S is ultra
thin shell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
