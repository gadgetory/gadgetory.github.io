this is the kobo vox which is Cobos
colored tablet that goes up against the
kindle fire and the nook tablet and
while it is two hundred dollars like the
competition you get a lot less for your
money from the outside it actually
doesn't look like a terrible tablet I
actually do like the back the quilted
feel in hand but it's with the screen
that you start to see most of the big
issues the screen itself is made out of
plastic which makes it feel pretty cheap
but also the panel is really low quality
it is pretty bad viewing angles and it
just isn't that bright but the bigger
issue is actually the touch
responsiveness swipes and taps are
really sluggish which can obviously ruin
the entire experience there's been times
where I've just SAT here tapping the
screen with nothing happening
unfortunately that poor screen
experience is also bred with some pretty
sub-par specs inside you get an 800
megahertz processor and half a gigabyte
of RAM which would typically be okay for
running Android you get android 2.3 here
and it's a relatively clean version but
unfortunately Kobo doesn't seem to have
done much in terms of optimizing the
software Cobos also partnered with a few
third-party app vendors it includes our
do and Zinio for reading magazines and
it's also included get jars App Store
for downloading your own apps it's also
pretty easy to sideload your own apps
but unfortunately some of those
including Angry Birds just have pretty
terrible performance and you'll see in
Angry Birds actually there's a ton of
stuttering kobo's added its own reading
widget and has access to over 2.2
million books in its bookstore but
unfortunately the reading experience
isn't all that great because of that
screen problem and also the slow
performance it especially trails the
kindle fire when you look at the page
turn times for two hundred dollars i
think the answer is pretty clear Cobos
Vox cannot compete with the fire or Nook
Tablet its performance software and
hardware are simply inferior if you need
a cheap tablet this holiday season I
would definitely suggest amazon or
barnes and nobles
