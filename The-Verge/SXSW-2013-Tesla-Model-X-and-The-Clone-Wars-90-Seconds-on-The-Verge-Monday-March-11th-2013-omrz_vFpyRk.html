Southwest and if you can understand me

is 90 seconds on the first brought to
you by motorola we're in the last days
of South by Southwest Interactive and
yet again it seems like this is the year
of the hardware startup companies like
leap oculus VR and Leah are stealing the
show meanwhile the big startup trend
seems to be taxing ride-sharing services
like uber lyft and sidecar as for Google
zany antics this year it's a talking
shoe it is not a last a sneaker phone
like Tesla but can't afford the Model X
you'll have to wait a little bit longer
in its annual report to the SEC Tesla
revealed that it is pushing back
production of its Model X electric
crossover until late 2014 the Model X is
tesla's take on the SUV and is expected
to start at forty nine thousand dollars
after tax credits the extra time will
let the company focus on the Model S
sedan instead and finally a Star Wars
fan favorite is going away Lucasfilm
announced today that the animated series
the Clone Wars is winding down Lucasfilm
also teased a new animated show set in a
quote time period previously untouched
in Star Wars films or television
programming my three Ewoks the best
little Cantina on Tatooine Lucasfilm
will have war details in the months
ahead and that's it for today's top
stories stay tuned for our South by
Southwest elevator pitch of the day
we're launching an app called smack that
it's a social media game for the year
2000 the Apple send you a push
notification when there's a smacker
within 15 meters get smacked</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
