galore from Holograms to a robotic maid
but they also probably had an
astronomical electric bill as well as a
massive carbon footprint that's still an
issue for our own home of the future but
unlike the Jetsons we're actually using
some of that cutting-edge tech to solve
it as homeowners of the future will have
more ability to monitor our energy
consumption but before we get to that
let's talk about where that energy is
coming from because the home of the
future will always need power
we built our home to generate a lot of
its own power from solar panels
installed in the carport roof in fact
the solar panels are the carport roof
it's an integral part of their house
architectural II and that was part of
the design of the house from the
beginning Stan Pipkin is the owner of
light house solar here in Austin which
specializes in integrated solar design
when Carter put up panels on the White
House nobody liked them because they
were a big they were bulky they stood
out but he's just something entirely
different
this gives architects something to go
wild with you look around Austin this is
very different than most solar retrofits
that have the panels tacked onto the
roof
our solar installation is deliberately
an artfully designed made to feel like a
natural essential part of the house
itself I think the whole industry
understands it's silly that sort of slab
solar on top of the building why not
make the building electricity generating
itself this is Catherine Beisner
an expert in solar technology people are
definitely trying to make the solar
panels better-looking but still by and
large and residential putting solar on
top of a roof now a lot of them look
like just gorgeous black flat-screen TVs
and it's very low profile
you know I suspect we'll see a lot of
these products in the future
here's how the system actually works
each one of those squares individually
is a solar cell they produce selectively
DC power that flows to the inverter and
then it's changed to AC power and that's
what the house can run on and any energy
not used by the house flows into a
lithium-ion battery so let's say a
homeowner installs solar does that make
them impervious from a blackout so
unless you have a system that can island
away from the grid or basically a micro
grid your solar system will not help you
during a power outage so here in our
home of the future we have a battery and
so we're prepared for blackout that's
right so this is a really special home
you have energy storage that's wired to
your critical loads and if there's a
blackout you can pull that energy to
power your home this array it'll produce
enough energy to power say 60% of their
needs on a given day it varies by flouds
season shade I think for the house the
future we probably want that to be more
like a hundred percent is it possible to
scale the array absolutely the nice
thing about solar it's modular so they
can live in the house and then scale
appropriately over the first year right
and so now we're empowering them with
tools to actually manage their house
which brings us to our energy monitoring
our smart home integrator Pete Sanford
of smarter homes has given us the
ability to see a real-time readout of
the energy usage of our home we just
jumped from 900 watts to 4,700 watts
that jump is gonna tell me somebody just
turned on the air conditioning and it
gives you the idea of wow that's how
much energy I'm using wow we've put a
lot of effort into designing our solar
array and our energy storage system into
the house to meet the majority of our
needs on the other hand all of our tech
this house is probably gonna consume a
lot of energy you'd think so but a lot
of these devices are Energy Star rated
and they're considered low voltage items
your real energy hogs are gonna be you
know your non LED lights your air
conditioners it's the hot water so here
I've brought the control pad for my home
does that say eight hundred and
seventy-five watts yeah when we started
we were between fourteen and sixteen
thousand watts we worked really hard to
get it that low so let's go in and turn
on some air conditioners and then that
way you can kind of get an idea of the
spike as well so walk downstairs we'll
go ahead and drop that down to 70
upstairs and let's go back and see how
that's gonna affect our energy wow this
is pretty instantaneous as far as our
reading goes that's already jumped up to
seven thousand two hundred forty one so
at our house we loved what we did we saw
our new bill so we contacted Austin
Energy and we got this data from that so
this is before we automate it okay and
then here's after and it looks dramatic
just as it is but if you look at the
scale these spikes are during our
laundry times in our shower times and it
really enabled us to program our air
conditioners to where they weren't just
kicking on all day so this is what you
would do with solar so you know we hear
a lot of solar companies say oh this is
gonna cover 60% of your usage but how
would they know so having something like
this you be able to have the data to
support the value of having solar you
know seeing this energy usage laid out
right in front of you is a very
eye-opening experience because normally
you just use your appliances and you
don't think how much it's costing you
but once you see this the incentive is
to gamify it to see how much you can
save everybody the kids likes to see
that number low it's almost like it
turns into a mini obsession one of them
was like we're down to 450 watts and I
was like that's the lowest we've ever
been you win it's like a new high score
yeah exactly a new low score new low
score
I think that becoming more aware of our
energy usage is the first step
not only will homes the food should be
smarter about how they use energy but
they'll make us more aware of how our
actions influence that usage and even
for those just passing by the house acts
as a billboard for a renewable future
thanks so much for watching me explore
the energy needs and abilities in this
home of the future now I'm wondering how
would you power yours let us know in the
comments below and we'll see you next
week with a brand new episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
