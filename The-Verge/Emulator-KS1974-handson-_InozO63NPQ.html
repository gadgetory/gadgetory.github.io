it's an all-in-one touchscreen it
doesn't come with a computer attached
you attached via USB and you connect it
to either using HDMI or VGA it's
multi-touch so it's got four touch
points you can do all sorts of things at
once and the emulator software this is
actually sitting on top of tractors
subtract is sitting underneath and we've
made it multi-touch so the hardware
itself retails for 2,500 bucks you get
the hardware you get the software it's a
lifetime license software alone is 499
so you can buy that alone comes in a box
you can download it online as well the
software and then I'll just give you
this is this is the hardware it's a
solid piece of touchscreen is all solid
metal solid wood construction so you
don't have to worry about beating it up
it's quite having a weighs about 18
pounds comes with a rolly bag so you can
take it on the plane all that sort of
thing we spent a lot of time making it
you know look like an old-school mixer
no it's kind of that contrast from old
school new school so that's the hardware
now powering that is our software over
here called emulator modular emulator
modular is multi-touch midi controller
for whatever software you want whether
it's DJ software lighting software audio
whatever you want i'll show you here
right now we've got Ableton running
underneath she's got Ableton running
underneath and what I'll do is I'll just
click over to ours you can't see Abel's
in it's a it's a layer sitting on top
and if I transparency you can actually
see
so we want to be able to see certain
aspects of that so rather than something
like 10 show se√±or lemur where you have
to have a separate I iPad or whatever
and you look over in your computer this
one is all in front of you as a heads up
display so say for example I want to see
this part I just use this button here
subtract button and now I've got a whole
to what I need to see and now for
example I want to stop play record so i
go to buttons make my play button make
my stop button now on page one we're
gonna add some sliders if you want to
have some volume control you can make a
multi-touch now and the only reason we
sell the hardware is because we found
that in doing a lot of research with all
the different hardware's that they just
weren't accurate enough so when you went
to to do a dog or whatever filter and
then a play would do random things and
so we decided let's just make
our own hardware so that's what we did
and it's perfect it doesn't it doesn't
it doesn't make ghost touches it doesn't
do random things that you don't want it
to do now you can edit whatever page you
want oh there's two two different pages
so there's you could have ableton a
tractor or Ableton it whatever you can
have different different pages so that's
it that's emulator modular</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
