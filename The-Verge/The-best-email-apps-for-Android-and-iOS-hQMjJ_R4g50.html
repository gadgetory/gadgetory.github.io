that we hate dealing with email day in
and day out whether it's spam mail or
another forward from your grandmother we
have a lot to sort through and it's
something that most of us can't escape
now the best way to deal with email is
definitely on the desktop but mobile
apps are catching up fast and if you
want to get to inbox zero there's only
one that's going to help you do it a
good email app needs to load messages
quickly but it also has to let you do
things like reply archive delete and
schedule them with just a few swipes or
tabs it should also have a great design
not just so that it looks good but so
that it's also easy to use on iOS the
app that we recommend that does all this
and then some is Outlook you can do so
much with this app that it almost feels
like you're using the desktop version of
outlook but here you're only using your
phone like most email apps out there
Outlook has quick swipe options for
archiving and scheduling emails you can
also customize these to do just about
anything else outlook also separates the
clutter for you with a similar feature
to Gmail's Priority Inbox
and it seems to work even better it
breaks your inbox into two sections
focused and other and if that's not
enough control you can also set up quick
filters all of those do the most
important thing they save you time so
you can worry about something other than
your email but the best thing about
Outlook is all the stuff that it does
that other email apps can't do it
integrates your calendars and your files
from different services and you don't
even have to leave the app to use them
that also means that you can do things
like see all the files that you've sent
a particular person or quickly attach
files that you don't even have on your
phone you can even accept calendar
invites without even opening up a
message Outlook does all the hard work
for you
now there are a lot of other email apps
out there mailbox looks the best it's
clean it's simple and if you don't
handle a lot of email every day it might
be a good option for you the Gmail app
for iOS is pretty great too and if you
have a gmail account you're probably
already using it however and this may be
a surprise but Microsoft Outlook handles
Google services better being able to
access your calendar or your files
without leaving the app is just too good
to pass up if you want full control over
your inbox and the services that
surround it outlook is your only choice
on iOS now Android is a different story
don't get me wrong outlook is pretty
great on Android too but it can't beat
how quick and simple Google's native
gmail client is not only is it probably
the most
beautiful that it's all so fast Gmail
offers actionable notifications on
Android so you can do things like mark
emails is read without even leaving
other apps outlook is pretty good on
Android but it's just slower than Gmail
and it's a lot buggier than the iOS
version unlike with iOS Android is a lot
more of a level playing field when it
comes to email app so it'll be worth
your time to actually look around at
some of the other options boxer has a
really fast app that lets you do things
like add emails to a to-do list or send
them right to Evernote the my Mail app
has some cute animations and it's
sidebar offers the quickest way to
switch between accounts that we've seen
mailboxes design is even better on
Android but if you're afraid you're
going to delete important emails you're
probably going to want to look elsewhere
type mail has a powerful app too with
quick account switching and access to a
task list but the design is cluttered in
the way it loads emails is just too
counterintuitive reaching inbox zero may
seem like a fantasy and for most of us
it probably is but using apps like
Outlook and Gmail will give you the best
chance
