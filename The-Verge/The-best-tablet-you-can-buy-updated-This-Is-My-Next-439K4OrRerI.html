playing games watching video reading
books and magazines and all sorts of
other stuff
they can even be use as drawing slates
and in spite of the outrage from tech
nerds many people actually use them as
their primary cameras some people like
these tablets as their only computers
but for most of us tablets our secondary
device they complement our smartphones
and laptops a good tablet should be
lightweight fast well-built have lots of
apps available and be easy to use it
should also easily last through a day of
heavy use or multiple days of lighter
usage if I can't use my tablet from the
time I board a plane in New York - when
it lands in San Francisco its failed it
should also have a strong ecosystem of
accessories cases stand styli keyboards
and more that let me get even more use
out of it when everything is considered
it's clear that Apple's iPad air 2 is
the best tablet on the market it's very
well-built it's thinner than ever it's
lightweight it has a fast processor it
has a battery that easily lasts for days
and has a great high-resolution screen
the screen is easy to look at for
reading but is vibrant and colorful
enough for videos to look great too
there's really little to complain about
when it comes to the iPad air 2 is
Hardware they are - also benefits from
the hunches of thousands of iPad apps
available in Apple's iTunes App Store
virtually every major app and service
has iPad apps available many of which
take advantage of the air tubes larger
display and iOS is one of the simplest
and easiest to use mobile operating
systems so virtually anyone can pick up
an iPad and quickly grasp how it works
there are countless accessories you can
get for the iPad air 2 you can get
external keyboards external speakers
stylize cases and more so the air 2
really works great out of the box so you
shouldn't feel compelled to buy a ton of
accessory the air 2 is pretty much
everything you can want in a tablet but
if you're looking for something more
portable Apple does have another option
for you while the air 2 is the best
tablet for most people the iPad Mini 2
offers many of the same features in a
smaller size it's smaller 7.9 inches
versus 9.7 and slightly lighter making
it easier to hold in one hand for
reading it's easier to slip into a bag
or a big pocket and take it wherever you
go Mini 2 is also significantly less
expensive than Apple's flagship tablet I
find myself reading on trains and planes
all the time so it's actually the better
option for me it's not as versatile as
the air tube but it's more portable
which is more important for my needs you
might notice that I'm not
recommending the iPad Mini 3 which is
actually a newer model between the Mini
2 and the Mini 3 the only difference is
our touch ID fingerprint scanner and a
gold color option everything else is
exactly the same which makes the Mini 3
not worth its price premium over the
Mini 2 there are countless other tablets
available many of which aren't really
worth your time or consideration Samsung
is dozens literally dozens of tablets on
store shelves they all suffer from the
same software issues which makes them
confusing and frustrating to use they
are also very plastic and chintzy
feeling compared to the iPad many of
excellent displays and some even come
with smart pens for writing on those
displays those features aren't enough to
make up for the other shortcomings
Microsoft has been trying to figure out
tablets for years and its surface pro 3
is its best effort yet
when it's a much better desktop computer
than an actual tablet it's just too big
and clumsy to be portable or comfortable
to use for long periods of time and
while I can run lots of old Windows apps
they're still relatively few true tablet
apps available to it Google's new Nexus
9 is a valiant effort that's just simply
overpriced for what it is it's nearly
the same cost as Apple's iPad air 2 and
actually the same price as last year's
air but it lags behind in build quality
performance and app selection most
people are just better off buying the
iPad Amazons fire HDX is a nice tablet
with a good design and a bright display
but it's hampered by a limited app
selection it's really tailor made to
present Amazon services and make it easy
to purchase in the retail giant you can
actually get all of Amazon services on
the iPad still be able to do a lot more
and that's really it tablets haven't
really replaced the personal computer or
laptop for most people but they are
great for reading watching video playing
games and even getting some work done
the iPad air 2 does all of those things
better than the rest which makes it the
best tablet you can get</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
