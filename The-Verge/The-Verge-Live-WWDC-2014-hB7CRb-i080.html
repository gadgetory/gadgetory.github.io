world wide developer conference 2014 i'm
ross miller i'm chris sigler and god
there's a lot to go go through i will
have dieter bills a heck of an event
yeah we'll have a lot dieter bohn with
us very soon um come up from cisco yeah
san francisco but let's just get into it
here's the big news then we'll kind of
dive right in OS 10 10 point in Yosemite
is a brand new look notification widgets
actually spotlight which is basically
Alfred right iOS 8 health kit home kit
programs could apps can talk to each
other widgets new programming language
dear God and of course the continuous
client everything talks to each other
now they blew it out they really did so
let's let's just go let's just ask well
quick what would your personal reaction
to the whole thing I thought that they
hit well you know obviously we would
have liked to have seen hardware right
in a perfect world we would have seen
and I watch we would have seen a retina
MacBook Air we would have seen a the
mythical Apple TV the actual rectangular
box not just to set up you're talking
about the full set right um but but we
can keep dreaming and look let's be
honest Apple's can be doing some events
later this year obviously um right so
this ended up being a purely software a
focused event but if it had to be a
purely software a focused event I think
that they had on a lot of really
important points i just said on twitter
a second ago that it feels like they hit
they checked a bunch of boxes that have
been lingering for years that needed to
be checked off the the app to app
crosstalk in iOS is huge widgets and
notification center those have been sort
of on the docket for a while rumored for
awhile the the continuous client stuff
between OS 10 and iOS is really really
frickin cool i mean like you can take a
call on your phone on your pc finally I
just tweeted last week that I wish that
you could see your SMS is in the
messages app and it was 10 they're
fixing that so they're doing some really
cool stuff airdrop airdrop works now
between phones and pcs so again they
just checked off a bunch of boxes that
they need to check off I
that this is a great update to iOS and
of course they're bringing the design
language of OS 10 up to up to snuff so
right okay so let's let's dive in and
first of all mostly I think the widget
thing I do want to say that the widget
was interesting Craig federighi who had
every other performances mean hair Force
One hair for swollen as he's
affectionately called uh uh he knows
that widget has been someone's been
requested since iOS to that was the only
time that Steve Jobs name was invoked
actually and it took six versions to get
it right they got it right we'll find
out but real quick let's go for I was
ten because it was the quickest one of
the bunch it was maybe 20 minutes of a
two-hour presentation something like
that the other they kind of a s10 was
ten point 10 Yosemite right which Craig
federighi first called OS 10 weed yeah
that was a weird name it they were doing
weird like fake jokes this is like
corporate joke stuff now they were doing
yeah they were really yucking it up a
little bit for a while I mean look I
think that that federighi is not uh he's
definitely not a a stuffy guy and it
shows in the way that he presents but
yeah they kind of blew through OS 10
pretty quickly when you break down
everything that they were bringing to
the table obviously the aforementioned
continuous client stuff which i believe
the still unclear to me but I think that
it's all falling under the umbrella of
what they're calling handoff right which
is a better airdrop a phone call
integration between between your pc and
your phone caller ID works so if your
phone rings you see a pop up on the
screen that says so-and-so is calling
and SMS integration right right now it's
just i must be between handoff airdrop
maildrop iCloud Drive which is I guess
they're Dropbox competitor in some sense
i mean this is this is everything that I
cloud i think was promised to be years
and years ago that's actually finally
realized and in some right right and and
of course you can't overlook the fact
that they've completely redesigned the
operating system and now it looks like
iOS it's much flatter I think Josh it
was doing the live blog just kept
screaming glass and glass glass yeah
I'll be curious to get josh's full
download on how he feels about the
design cuz i know that he had some
strong feelings about iOS 7 what
came out and and they've obviously
adopted that design language for for
yosemite it's readily apparent that Jony
ive had a very strong influence there so
from what i can tell so far it looks
great the public is gonna be able to
sign up for this beta over the course of
the summer and then it's eventually
going to be free upgrade this fall but
you know to historically you've had to
pay a fee to become a developer in the
eyes of Apple and then you can go under
NDA and get this thing but now it's just
kind of opened everybody's you know I
think it's just realization like that's
just how information is dissipated now
like everybody's banks everything
there's gonna get leaked yeah house know
you might sell just be a part of it
that's exactly right yeah and I think
the most visual or X most functional
user-facing feature that I think is
gonna be exciting is spotlight which is
essentially I don't know if email it
still uses it but uh we use Alfred um
religiously at the office and it's just
like you know one hotkey you get
everything you want online or on your
computer and now that's just part of the
operating system right and thank God too
yeah no I mean if if you had to kind of
identify one theme throughout this event
it's that they're playing catch-up and
kind of picking and choosing features
from other platforms and apps around the
world it's obvious that they took some
inspiration from Alfred 44 spotlight I
feel kind of bad for the elfrid guys
yeah but I mean it's also it can now be
integrated much clearer I'm sure Alfred
will figure something out gonna give
like it's it's not all take care like
it's it's much better as I care I care
okay I'm really sorry you want hog I not
now maybe later um yeah so that was cool
but but I just keep going back to the to
the design because it is really striking
you think about the fact that that OS 10
is is what over over a decade a little
old now is that right over a decade old
I'm not making it moves up right I mean
is 10 point 10 number of schemes be
damned right sorry and and this feels
like the most drastic single design
iteration the in the platform's history
I mean there have obviously been some
pretty striking if you go back and look
at 10 points
or before that into the betas to you
know 10.5 10.6 10.7 there are obviously
changes but this is like a really clean
break a lot of glasses Josh said very
flat it's it's just it's a it's the
matchup that they needed with iOS now
that it's in seven and eight and they
had that that clean break last year and
the platform and before we get into that
I do want to like stop a second to enjoy
one club this is probably my favorite
part there wasn't a lot of Apple
executives that showed up it was
basically just Craig and Tim kind of
going back and forth we expected some
kind of like beats mention there wasn't
one except for like Donald ray that's
yes they did not eat at all dr. dre they
did call Bob I think we had that Cliff
Lee playing a second um a crowd Federer
he talking to dr. Dre calling him on the
computer yes wanted to make a phone call
to a new Apple employee that's that's
joining us is something we do from time
to time so let me just bring up oh this
here we go a little little welcome Paul
let's give him a wwc welcome so what's
up let's have my Mac dial via my iphone
I I talked to people like him all the
time of course very normal for me Wow
hey it's Craig federighi here hey are
you doing it this dre hey hey doctor
you're on speakerphone with via my mac
with over 6000 amazing developers here
at WWDC we all want to welcome you to
Apple
creating such amazing act yeah they have
created some amazing apps I we're glad
you caught here can't get fit for your
baton special work if you want to be Tim
into the office it be about 4 30 but i
think you know orientation new employee
orientation starts at nine so and you
don't to miss the free t-shirt so I
chewed 49 sounds good I can't wait to
get your work to keep it up well Dre
it's been great chatting with you I'll
see you around campus thank you create
awesome alright bye ok first off on
first mention Craig goes hello Doctor
it's not a first name no it's a little
not it isn't isn't maybe I mean maybe in
a formal setting if you're meeting the
good doctor for the first time talk your
refer to him as dr. I'm not sure and
then you just clear listen to Dre just
go off like on some script everyone's
applauding just getting through the
motions I'm just still in my mind having
a very difficult time rectifying the
chronic with what happened on stage
today it's just it's it's not what you
know it trey is known for his for his
work in music yeah that is very I would
say it is it is not of the law for lack
of a better term and so now he's in this
very corporate environment is frankly a
little difficult to park I think it's
such a much of stretch I think Dre's in
the business of making a lot of money
that's true um that's true and that
phone call alone made him a billionaire
yeah that's that's very true it well so
getting back to the point about beats
not being a big part of this
presentation I look the deal was
announced last week right I'm sure that
the the keynote today has been planned
or mostly planned for weeks if not
months so they you know they it's not
something that they could rely on and
they just didn't fit it in and that's
not to say that they would have had any
hardware to announce anyway so that's
true i mean there's also the software
portion which is beats music which is
right someone analogous itunes radio
also didn't hear anything about that
that's a very good point which was
surprised we did we
heard there might be a chance of the
iTunes radio app being separate mmm not
the case um although God knows I might
change also because of I don't know what
they're gonna do you have itunes music
you have music if itunes radio you have
beats music right it's gonna get a
little crowded on that one right let's
let's just don't jump right into iOS a
unless or anything else you wanna talk
about for a Yosemite at all i well just
the fact that that this is this is a
hell of an update update for fro as tend
to be free right it's one thing for this
to be a you know hundred-dollar update
but it's you know we we've we've kind of
gotten the sense from Apple that they're
they're moving away from that model for
desktop updates like they they have been
for mobile updates so in you're gonna
get a free operating system update this
is this is a great one to get that's
like a very small group oh if you get
any free operating system update but to
their credit that is something that's
big on the developer study because and
this is something hammered early on was
like fifty one percent of their
customers have upgraded to mountain lion
the newest version right which sounds
like a lot no no you mean you mean
maverick maverick so yes it's still it
sounds like a lot remember it's a free
download and the only got half to
upgrade I'm sorry I know it's much
better than windows 8 right well so
there are a few considerations right
there's the fact that there's a cut-off
beyond which the hardware doesn't
support Mavericks right so you got to
figure that a significant percentage of
that other half it falls into that
category and then there's the category
of people who just don't care and then
there's the group of people myself
included who believe that snow leopard
was the best version of OS ten of all
time and would prefer her that it just
be frozen there in time seriously snow
snow leopard was really really good what
is why would you want outdated operate
you know it it was just no a liquor just
okay after after snow leopard every
subsequent I'm sure there are viewers
right now on who I understand what I'm
getting at after snow leopard every
subsequent version of OS 10 introduced
more bugs than it fixed Snow Leopard it
was like they took I don't know if you
remember the the keynote for but I
remembered very well they made a very
very specific point of saying
developers look this is this version
isn't about features we're just cleaning
up that like we've been working on this
thing for many years now we're just
gonna take a breath clean it up fix some
bugs and spit out a new version and they
did it and it was fantastic and since
then every time you have to upgrade to a
new version of OS 10 you go through you
know a couple point releases we're full
buggy and i I'm I'm sure they go
somebody will be the same way absolutely
but here's the other thing also that and
this is it's a number saying to is Apple
I don't think honestly cares that much
training center and uh uh uh explain why
apple doesn't care about bugs well it
doesn't care as much about OS 10 here's
another reason why Mavericks what sits
at 40 million copies installed and
that's fifty one person the user base so
it's just a little over 80 million yep
okay compare that to 800 million iOS
devices as in there today yeah you know
a hundred million ipod touches they have
more ipod touches out there than there
claiming for for mac right so like what
they're focused on i mean he keeps
saying iOS iOS know as 10 as it was 10
they're not going to change them but iOS
is clearly the dominant platform of
course it's why he's been hour and a
half on it right and that was a when
they started talking about iOS was we
got this barrage of words that end in
kit right was there was health kit which
is accompanied by the creatively named
app health then there is a home kit
there is cloud came out kit and i think
i might be missing one or two and then
there was metal anyway we should talk we
should talk about all these things yeah
and I'm gonna have to ask you to kind of
hold my hand through metal and Swift
because those the ones that are gonna
sure yeah so let's just let's just go
into health kit which was a formerly
known in the leaks as health book
because it just looked like passbook
right health kit is the platform of the
sub platform and health is the app is
that right yes ok so what it what is the
what is the big thing I know it's like
it keeps track of a lot of stuff yeah
and they send it to Mayo Clinic right
they said they said it to me a clinic
basically it I get the impression that
there that they're trying to to obviate
doctors like a someday Apple is going to
be your done your phone is going to be
your doctor you think ave are
I mean I don't think I don't think
they're try everything replace my hair
look man in in in 20 years doctors will
be obsolete your phone will be your
doctor when you need surgery equipment
on the phone will sort of spring out and
operate on you know it's it's you know
that they're working with Nike and as
you mentioned Mayo Clinic to do some of
this stuff they they announced a lot of
partners I'm sure they're going to be
announcing more but it's apparent that
health and fitness are a big big push
for Apple right now and we've heard
rumors that that i watch that they're
allegedly working on which we heard
nothing about right at this event is
also fitness focused so you can see how
it kind of all creates an ecosystem and
if your sins almost almost somewhat of a
head-scratcher because in the finance
calls they do you keep hinting at new
product categories they keep saying with
a lot of great stuff Tim Cook I think
less than a year ago said we really like
wearable stuff for looking into it yeah
and this time they didn't even hit and I
watches they're like look this health
kit stuff it measures yeah how do you
get measurements may I don't worry about
it right like they did not even hint at
it no teases it was just aa we're
measuring don't worry about it that's
because in a few months you're gonna
have your i watch and we'll take care of
all the measure in a few months maybe I
don't know at this time dissident that
was one of the kids and then there was
let's just go through the kids I guess a
home kit this is the one I think fortune
or Forbes see financial time financially
it's one of the one of the f one of the
f-word holidays all at publications but
a home kid this was rumored it's home
automation it's not as big of a deal in
the presentation as it was in the
article but I'm here's your stance on
this one because it's just yeah your
phone knows what your house is doing if
you have the right smart home equipment
you can use it well I think that Apple
has the potential to bring gravity to a
standard it has a potential to do two
very important things in home automation
one bring gravity to a single standard
in an industry that has historically
struggled to find a common standard and
to simply bring attention to it because
it's kind of a wacky offbeat almost
hobbyist industry where it's like you
have these weirdos like my
self who buy all these different you
know wireless locks and and and and
lights and switches and all these things
and sometimes they work sometimes they
don't some use z-wave some you zigbee
some use some other weird standard so
high right now how do you control is
like a remote control you have are you
still just using a light switch because
then it's just nothing no that's that's
a that's a very good question and and
there there is no good answer there are
companies like crestron that do ultra
high-end home automation and they just
basically talk to everything and they
say don't worry about it you can buy
these ten components with 10 different
standards and we'll just talk to all of
them there's a a device called revolve
that we wrote about late last year look
kind of like a stack of CDs a red and
transparent stack of CDs that has a
bunch of radios in it and it can talk to
you know nest thermostats and a z-wave
light switches and whatnot um right so
yes I taking the bigger picture is
basically what Apple wants to do and
this is obviously an old thing that's
it's not all but took a couple years
I've been working on this like they want
you to talk to Siri and say Syria I'm
getting ready for bed please turn off
the lights stop looking at me right so
yeah exactly so that's the the software
that's the the user experience for this
thing but then on the back end they have
this home kit standard that devices will
be able to get certified through and so
you're going to see all these things
that have been just kind of like
plotting along on disparate standards
sometimes they work sometimes they don't
including like I said wireless locks
light switches air conditioners and
heaters and actually now that nest is a
google company I suspect that no love
will be lost between home kit and a nest
I don't think you can be seeing if he
knows we look at the partners and we've
got the list right here ness is nowhere
to be found nest is nowhere no available
and they used to be bffs I don't know if
you remember I believe that nest was the
first brick-and-mortar store they were
sold through was the apple store was the
apples yep yep and I guess that is no
longer the case or soon will not be the
case I mean of course you would think
because Apple and Google are rivals
except they did mention Google twice by
name the name
check google twice and microsoft being
once i would you pray for them yeah
whenever they use safari search in iOS
or o is tender like we're using google
search right and then the big extension
thing you know using actual widgets
which again to the next was being
translation like they're not being shy
about like actually talking to the
competitors when it's yeah of course a
convenient for them right and i think i
think it's it's a tacit admission on
apple's part that they do certain things
really well and they do other things not
very well and one of those things that
would be you know the barrier of entry
is simply too high to try to bust into
it is effective search right i mean like
think of how much time and money and
energy microsoft has poured into bang
which plays a distant second fiddle to
google in the global at least in the
north american search market which and i
hate i hate to echo a microsoft talking
point but again second place is not the
end of the world for this i mean no no
certainly not but the fact the fact of
the matter is you know apple has to
choose between you know embracing the
search partners and trying to go up
against them and you look at the
struggle that they that they've had with
maps right a prime apps and do they
really want to repeat that again with
something as daunting as effective web
search probably not you were like years
ago to kept tugging oh we have Wolfram
Alpha integration and what the hell
happen to that thing no still in there
like yeah if you if you Siri if you say
something to Siri something like super
nerdy like how many how many like
neutrons are in a whatever it'll pull
out pull from alpha so that's good yeah
but let's let that let's go to that
being translation up in the
extensibility because this is a part
that at once excites me it also scares
the hell out of me what scares you okay
well let's let's talk about what it is
first its extensibility is what they're
calling it it's this kind of a goodbye
to the sandbox it's apps talking to apps
yep which means finally open integration
it means like as a corollary to that is
like a course keyboard you can now
choose different ones and that's a huge
point thanks huge point no you know the
mail client still default the maps
clients default keyboard though it can
be swipe it could probably be swiftkey
and there's a new keyboard that Apple
touting that's its own keyboard
essentially right which is by the way a
swiftkey like in that right it tries to
complete phrases for you
so that that all like makes me super
happy super excited this is a long time
coming thanking widgets in the home on
the notification panel that being said
the part of this that scares me is this
is where you know Tim Cook talks about
like Apple is very virus free it's one
percent of the mobile virus market
assimilated the androids 99% no one
cares about Windows Phone god I'm gonna
kill after this ah but then once you
have this kind of thing we're like apps
can draw it data from other apps and
there's sandbox ideas over this is open
the apps is open the information up to
be more subjective to to viruses and to
malware III don't think so because all
of those components that you're
referring to are still going to go
through the same app store approval
process that they do now the only
difference is that they're now talking
to each other but like you know if you
trust app a and you trust at B then
there's no real reason that you wouldn't
trust a pay to talk to happy that's true
that's true but yeah you know back to
your original point about extensibility
in general in iOS 8 I this is
potentially the single biggest
announcement today it when you when you
think back to the progression and the
the maturation of iOS and before that
iphone OS over the years this has been a
sticking point for as long as I can
remember the fact that apps can't extend
each other the fact that you can't have
your own keyboard which is a huge deal
on Android the first thing I do whenever
I use an android phone is install swype
and you have a name will do that in iOS
so and and frankly at this point the
built-in don't get me wrong in iOS one
iOS to apple's keyboard was head and
shoulders above everything else on the
market today it sucks it's terrible it's
worse than Windows Phone stock keyboard
it's certainly worse than the Android
stock keyboard in KitKat and and really
a jelly bean before that so it's it's
it's good to see that they've done this
and I think that it's it could end up be
when we see where AB development goes
over the course of the next year that
could end up being the biggest deal here
right I mean but again we don't we
haven't seen anything of it the only
study showed was pinched identification
they shall our first party stuff that's
exciting you grow in line respond to
messages I think Facebook you can like
right well it's just like you know is
just like anybody's developer conference
it's like build or it's like Iowa well I
oh right you need to the first thing you
need to do is present the possibilities
to the developers and then in a few
months you see what can actually be done
and my guess would be that in addition
to the partners that they've worked with
so far to present the few demos that
they but they showed by the time we get
to an iphone 6 announcement they will
have a bunch of additional stuff on the
tape right so we should talk about this
more but thankfully hopefully luckily
lovely we have dieter bohn from San
Francisco live on the air DITA are you
there I'm here how you doing guys doing
very well it's a nice office kind of
gotta go out San Francisco yeah is this
is this is a vox West it's very
impressive we're lucky to be here that's
beautiful yeah also I'm not sure if it's
a video glitch or if you're just really
good at like miming um ah it is it is
good to hear from you so dieter you've
done a number of Worldwide Developer
Conference he don't never developer
conferences in general what was the vibe
like in their media versus dev so the
vibe was a you know pretty excited
pretty happy the media was really into
especially the stuff for iOS 8 the
ability the extensions i think they're
called the Sun stopper to nap so
everybody in our section seemed really
jazzed about it but then when they moved
on to the section about Swift the new
programming language the media section
kind of started be like oh this seems
cool the seam school and the developer
section which was of course the vast
majority of the room lost their minds
they were cheering and yelling and super
duper excited about it and I mean I'm
not a developer so I can't tell you
other than apples claims that it's way
faster than objective-c of course way
faster than Python what everything is
it's great about Swift but the
developers there seemed really excited
and that I think is probably going to
end up being the most influential thing
out of the
developers conference we look back on it
a few years from now right this is
actually a John Gruber who was tweeting
throughout the event node Apple
Developer know same thing media bet
media badge people are silent attendees
are going nuts this is huge huge news
the future of all apple development
which when you look at how small OS 10
adoption as versus iOS I think he's
right in that case yeah I mean do you
really need to see how this plays out
for the rest of the developers
conference scholars should i have for
swift is i'm sure that apple's right
that it's incredibly fast and easy to
use and the development environment and
this sounds so nerdy but this is a
developer's conference so this is what
what you know the big news was it seemed
really easy to use but my question is if
I like start learning how to use swift
for aya is that does that mean I'm going
to be less capable of making stuff for
other platforms now Swift can work along
with objecting like in the same app so
you know you can only pick Swift but
that might be a question right that's a
course in that they may change going for
obviously when Apple switched from I
guess IBM power pcs allowed to Intel
chips you know the programming language
went with it the architecture one with
it right now Swift and object to see
work side to side object to see of
course works on a lot of platforms
mm-hmm what happens Apple sees this is a
success and goes sorry guys well let's I
mean let's probably know Swift will work
just fine on windows at some point
that's true that's true right and you
know let's be super clear objective c is
already a very Apple specific
environment you don't see developers on
Windows or certainly on Android
programming and Objective C so I I don't
see this as being a protectionist move
and I certainly don't see it as being a
roadblock to allowing developers to
develop another in other platforms and
this is why I do not develop encode
thank you guys so much for clearing that
one up on my on my end um no but yes a
dieter above and all you also solves the
iOS stuff the OS 10 stuff what was their
kind of the feeling for that your own
personal feeling actually my own
personal feeling is the we'll start with
OS 10 I think it looks fine i think it
looks pretty good actually i'm really
interested in the continuity features I
think that's killer to be able to text
and to be able to just pick up stuff
from one device and move it to the other
device yeah and just start right where I
left off I'm super excited
that I'm probably going to switch back
to Safari from chrome because chrome has
been feeling slower and slower and all
the speed stuff they showed on safari
looks pretty amazing so you know it's
not it's not a kind of update that would
if you don't already like OS 10 get you
to switch necessarily but if you are
using OS 10 I think it's going to feel a
lot better at iOS 8 stuff like the the
extensibility software apps can talk to
each other I'm pretty excited for a
touch ID being opened up to the point
where iphone 5s i've been using an
iphone 5 all this time but the ability
to not have to punch in passwords
purchase price for me and yeah i don't
know a lot of it's a blur I'm glad
airdrop finally works about across
devices I'm glad they finally fixed that
yeah I mean after keynote supposed to
have to remember the millions of
features that they announced what so
what some of the stuff you guys have
been talking about yeah well I tier
point dieter I think that the the
handoff features are huge I I was just
tweeting last week that messages the
messages app on OS 10 would be so much
more useful if you could see both SMS
and I message so the fact that they did
that was big I was kind of blown away by
their phone call demo I thought that was
crazy and cool and not expected yeah and
I'm like yeah from RN to it was just
like seeing kind of all that kind of
great and I'm curious kind of a
corollary to that is like the SMS I
message stuff that's been kind of coming
to a head lately and like is this a sign
that's been fixed it's like they're
figure out how to get that work or is it
even worse ya know they even took a
swipe at SMS users during the the
conference right dieter yeah I was like
a people who bought android phones of by
mistake Tim said that wants and just you
know people that you hate those green
messages on the iphone the messages app
in general is a really interesting
section of the keynote because not only
are they letting you you know use
message from your desktop with texting
but they've added a whole bunch other
features so they've added the ability to
share your location they've improved the
ability to send voice messages and short
video messages you can just tap on the
out of button to you know actually
record a voice message or tap out a
button to just you know speak out what
you want to say and they also added like
quick
I think so it natural using natural
language prediction can guess what your
next word is going to be so from my
perspective that seems really
interesting because they're not just
taking out a general messaging client
they're actually going after other
messaging apps like facebook Messenger I
guess maybe even snapchat since you can
destroy stuff but that seems like a
stretch to me and maybe whatsapp it
really feels like a much more
full-featured messaging app and the sort
of thing I could actually see myself
using yeah actually do go back to the
COS like Oh trying to watch the stream I
might have missed something up some
things Auto self-destruct some things
don't what is the where's that I default
that again Ross what auto self-destructs
what doesn't it was it wasn't kind of
clear to me I maybe I just missed it on
the stream the audio station it wasn't
easy either actually they they glossed
over it i think that's it that you can
you can set stuff to slowly degrade and
disappear but I mean we'll have all week
to actually figure that stuff out and
then we'll have you know right the beta
when it comes and the actual release is
fall so we'll see but I don't think that
it's fair to think of it in the same
class of snapchat regardless of what the
auto-destruct messages features are I
think it's it's much better to think of
it as a competitor to say facebook
Messenger or what's that well there's
also that the name of it escapes me but
there's that enterprise-class snapchat
it's like snapchat for adults tinder no
is it as absolutely nothing to do with
tender your got a name drop in the intro
video they were like having people talk
about how amazing developers are I had a
guy like and there is the best yeah
there is and then like the kind of hell
out him for a second like are you gonna
say anything else about tinder how you
use it nope all right moving on speaking
of Tito kita we just need a rapid of it
any final thoughts from the keynote my
final thought is I'm really impressed
that they're releasing the 10 dot 10
beta to the public this feels like a
much more open much more accessible
Apple and the fact that there are joking
around way more and they are releasing a
beta it's just regular users sort of
admitting that people want to get in on
this stuff early is a really good sign
that Apple's opening up a lot yeah
awesome dieter thank you so much thanks
guys and I think that is like it's one
of the threads that we should kind of
opened up and I because Apple has a lot
more open in so many ways these apps are
more open OS 10 feels a little more
the keynote feels more opening like it
was more accessible yeah and to be fair
you know with the developers conference
I think that they've always been a
little bit more open than they are at
the consumer facing events because these
are there people right these are the
people that they need to bring with them
on this journey to apps lack of a better
phrase so it you know it being more open
and direct and kind of friendly and
jokey with them is natural but this
event in particular felt you know a half
notch different than usual in a good way
you know it was entertaining it and
actually you know in another sense to
it's a half notch toward the condo
developer centric we see another wdc
past of course they are developer
focused but they also have a nod to
consumers here's new hardware here's the
iphone 4 mm-hmm and this time is like
we're going to code on stage right just
make a 2-d game why not we're gonna show
you how it is right this isn't like
always expect at Google i/o for one of
the three four days of right comforts us
but you know this is kind of like where
Apple's gonna go for us like we're gonna
make jokes that developers love
multi-threaded rope if we're going to
you know make a little silly photoshop's
things is kind of like jump around and
if we're also going to show the stuff in
action actually programming in action
like that is that is a different kind of
Apple it's one that's catering not to
every audience but do a very specific
audience with this and you know to that
point going back to what I said at the
beginning of this I think we're in for a
really busy second half for Apple I
we're going to see I have to believe at
least three events right there they have
to do an iphone event they have to do an
iWatch event I can't imagine they would
want to bundle two events that big maybe
but probably not there they're gonna
have to talk retina MacBook Air they're
going to have to talk iPad and they
might have to talk Apple TV how do you
fit five major you know product shifts
for them into the span of six months I
don't know not to mention in the next
6-12 months we're going to see something
about Apple beats and all that kind of
collaboration like that has like be more
than just these timeout dotted line
because we don't know what it means yet
right really and you know of course what
they what they typically do is they show
ninety percent of the next version of
iOS Bay either in a dead
event or at WWDC and then at the time of
the announcement of the next iPhone is
when they show that other ten percent
right right I think last year was touch
ID was sort of the big reveal when they
announced the 5s this year clearly there
will be some additional ten percent so
to speak that they that they show at the
time of the iphone 6 might be a new
screen resolution for the bigger
displays it might be who knows something
they haven't thought it i mean the big
rumors that didn't happen this time of
course were transit and Google sorry
transient Apple maps he's right right
from their hopstop acquisition exactly
um you know they got the notifications
are presumably from the queue
acquisition maybe we'll see but um and
then also of course multitasking with
the ipad which has been rumored a lot
lately I was not likely going to make
this of course but that's something to
show later this year um are you hedging
on the iWatch and the apple TV unveils
any of that side as being as being 2014
announces yes I i watches a lock for
2014 I think I believe very strongly
we're going to see that this year Apple
TV I think could easily slip into 2015
but at this point at this point is just
kind of like a running joke that there
aren't apps for the Apple look at the
very least let me put flappy bird on
Apple TV like it's such an easy win
right we saw amazon do with fire TV
makes absolutely no sense that they
would continue to lock independent
developers out of that platform so i
think again it's good i think it's just
gonna be a really busy second half wrap
i think if you look at even like what
Eddy Cue set the the recode conference
last week or the code conference from
recode right now which is you know 20
million happy to Apple TV's clearly not
a hobby yeah you know he said we'd the
most exciting product category clearly
we gotta figure out what the hell is
tracking health data right it's got to
be something and I just could use a fuel
band right so yeah I guess we'll see but
um that's you know you know for us at
least that is that is kind of it 44
double w DC yeah the big key no we're
going to be obviously sticking around
the whole week talked a lot of people
try to get a little more information
especially on Swift mmm which is you
know Swift to metal a shoo-in for making
apple TV apps work and games of course
it's right everyone thank you so much
for joining us of course d
bone is at back lawn on twitter chris is
e power I'm oh no Rosco no II if you put
