the Motorola hint this is sort of the
smallest of the announcements that
Motorola had today it's a tiny little
Bluetooth headset they don't want to
call it a Bluetooth headset because
there's all sorts of stigmas with that
but it's a bluetooth headset it's made
to be super discreet and nice looking it
comes in this wood plus a bunch of other
materials that are designed to look
really really nice in your ear and on
one level it's just a Bluetooth headset
you put it in your ear you make phone
calls you can do voice control on the
phone and there's all this cool Motorola
assist in Motorola actions and stuff it
all work but on the other hand it's kind
of extra special for a Bluetooth headset
for the one thing it's time for another
thing it's super sensitive so it's made
to go in your ear just like this and
there's a sensor on it that recognizes
when it's in your ear and it'll
automatically turn on and connect and
then as soon as you take it out it'll
disconnect and even if you're on a call
it will route it straight back to your
phone so it's made to be super simple
and to basically be worn all day but you
can have it come and go as you please so
it's a hundred and forty nine dollars
it's designed to be used with the new
Moto X and the Moto G but it will work
with lots of other phones too there's
some special stuff with the way that
want to ex work that makes it even
better for voice actions but the Moto
hint is designed as really it's a
wearable it's not a Bluetooth headset
though it's kind of a bluetooth headset
it's going to be a really interesting
accessory for the Moto X this year so
the hint itself is going to get three
and change hours of battery life but it
comes with this case which is cool
looking and will help you not lose this
tiny little thing but it also makes it
get triple the battery life so when you
put it in it's actually charging you can
see from the light here and it gives it
about two full charges so in all with
this whole package together you're going
to get about 10 hours of battery life
and that's probably good enough for a
full day so the hint is kind of a weird
little accessory I'm not sure how many
people are going to get into it I kind
of like it but we'll see how it does
when it comes out with the Moto X it's
full</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
