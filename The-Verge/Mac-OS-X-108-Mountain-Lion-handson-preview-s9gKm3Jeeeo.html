here at the developer preview of mac OS
10 10 8 mountain lion don't let the name
fool you unlike snow leopard 2 leopard
mountain lion is actually a pretty big
upgrade over lion with some pretty major
features let's go through them when you
first log into a mountain lion machine
you're going to be prompted for your
Apple ID and to enable iCloud this will
pull down your app store information
your iTunes information it'll set up
facetime it'll set up iCloud ipod will
immediately begin pulling down your
contacts your calendars all your other
information so you're getting the ipod
experience right from first set up with
my own line the first major new feature
in mountain lion is messages it's
actually the ichat app but it's been
renamed to messages and in addition to
supporting google talk yahoo and AOL
Instant Messenger it now supports
apple's proprietary I message service so
you can see the interface has been
totally redone it looks a lot like the
iPad app and it actually just works so
if I say hello to Ross here it's going
to pop up there you can see it showed up
on the iPad it showed up on the phone
Ross can say something back to me he has
no idea that i sent him this from a
computer hey what's up i can pick up the
phone i can say nothing it's pretty
awesome conversation that we're having
right now so i said nothing showed up on
the computer it showed up on the ipad i
can go over here after Ross responds
with some cutting remark about what do i
want i want you to die messages is also
integrated with facetime so if i want to
go ahead and call William I can just go
ahead and call them directly for
messages it's going to open the facetime
app let's just start ringing come over
here have you answered William is a
panda bear pretty good man pretty good
lastly messages also supports the
classic services google talk AOL instant
messenger yahoo i can just go over here
I've got the window this is pretty
familiar window you can see paul's
pretty cool dude i can open up a regular
sort of IM window talk to paul than
usual way but all my messages will still
be logged in the new UI another major
feature of mountain lion is Notification
Center it's built exactly like the iOS
notification
Center when you get any message and
other apps so if i get an iMessage right
here you can see the notification pop
down from the top of the screen it's in
the top right and i can either click on
the new notification light this lights
up blue when you get a notification or i
can use a new gesture which is a
two-finger swipe from the right to the
left of the trackpad so i just swipe
with two fingers and reveal Notification
Center I can see here the two messages
of William sent me if I click on one
instantly pops me back into messages you
can get all kinds of notifications their
mail messages FaceTime there's also an
API so developers can send their own
notifications just like iOS ical is now
calendar you can see it still has the
same kind of gross texture at the top is
the line calendar but the interface has
been slightly changed calendars are now
in a permanent window on the left here
instead of being that kind of pop over
the disappeared reminders looks just
like the app on the iPad if you've seen
that you're me very familiar with this
it's so bare bones it doesn't have a
preference I like right now but it
definitely works and it syncs with
iCloud so you can get all your reminders
and audio devices next up is notes notes
has been pulled out of mail and made
into its own app in mountain lion it
looks just like the app on the iPhone
just like the app on the iPad you can
actually pop open a note and set it
aside you can set this to be always on
top so if I open up another app here
it'll be on top of Safari even though
Safari is open and I can close it and
it's still in the main list here you can
sync notes across different accounts
whether the bi cloud Gmail Yahoo you'll
also find share buttons throughout
mountain lion just like in iOS so here i
am in safari and to the left of the
address bar you can see there's a share
button hit Twitter it brings up the
tweet sheet i can type this is cool just
like a can in iOS I can hit add location
there's location services no zone in New
York if I so inclined I could hit Send
and tweet it out oddly there's no
Facebook or YouTube support globally
with the share button but certain apps
support it so if i look in quicktime for
example quicktime will let you send a
video to facebook and send a video to
youtube but that's only in quicktime at
the moment mountain lion also includes
Game Center which is not fully enabled
in the preview build that we have but
Apple demoted to us it's exactly a game
center on the iPad it lets you find
games
once you find your friends lets you play
against opponents it also lets you do
multiplayer against iOS devices Apple
showed us a demo of real racing on the
iPad playing against Real Racing on the
back mount line also includes airplay
mirroring which lets you send your Mac's
display to an Apple TV its output at
720p and it intelligently scales so you
have to think about what resolution your
computer's at you get stereo audio and
you can mirror games you can mirror
shows and videos from the itunes store
you can mirror pretty much anything that
shows up on your mac screen mountain
lion el sol includes a major new
security feature called gatekeeper which
protects max against malware out of the
box mountain lion will only run apps for
the Mac App Store and apps that have
been signed by the developer developers
can get security certificates from Apple
the new addition to the $99 Mac
Developer Program Apple is insistent
they're not trying to curate the web or
lock down what developers can do they
just want apps to be trusted by users if
you want you can still set your Mac to
run apps from anywhere and even when you
have your Mac lockdown you can
right-click on an unsigned app and run
it individually there's also a whole
host of other little tweaks and changes
throughout mountain lion there's no more
software update all software update is
handled through the mac app store when
you go and click on software update in
the Apple menu pops right up into the
update in the mac app store when there
are new software updates you get an
update directly Notification Center
Safari now has a unified address bar in
search field just like chrome there are
a bunch of view features for Chinese
users China is Apple's fastest-growing
market and they're making a big push to
cater to Chinese users there are new
input methods there are new accounts and
the share button supports a bunch of
popular Chinese services like YouTube
mac OS 10 10 dot 8 mountain lion is
available for developers today if you're
part of the developer program you can go
get a beta right now for consumers it
will be out in summer 2012 Apple hasn't
said how much it'll cost but it'll be a
paid update in the mac app store once
released</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
