needs one but everyone wants something
different out of them
I want a concise view of the day ahead
but you might want a spaced out view of
your week and someone else might want a
super-dense view of their entire month
so what's an app to do well some of them
specialize but most try to offer
something for everyone and the best of
them do a great job presenting your
schedule no matter how you want to do it
there's no one knockout winner right now
but there is one that have to lutely
nails the basics whether you're on
iPhone or Android that's Google Calendar
I know I know it's a boring pic but
Google Calendar is quick as a clean
design has some small touches that
really do elevated above the rest first
let's talk views pretty much every
calendar app has an agenda view day view
week view and month view but few of them
are as easy to read and navigate between
as Google calendars you're almost never
lost in here which is not something I
can say for a lot of other calendar apps
the other thing I love is adding new
events Google Calendar makes it super
easy by supporting natural language
entry so I can just write lunch next
Friday at 2:00 boots of Dan and I'm
pretty much good to go you can also have
reminders which will stay put on your
calendar until you clear them and
there's this neat goals feature that
will automatically find time for regular
tasks like workouts and cleaning Google
automatically uses art and photos to
identify your events and once you have a
location in there you can just tap on it
to jump over to maps and get directions
there are a few downsides though right
now Google calendar doesn't have a
widget on iOS and most other calendar
apps do Google also doesn't have
interesting calendars you can add like
sport schedules it doesn't integrate
with other apps and doesn't have weather
alerts or time to leave alerts most
other apps don't have those things
either but they are missed opportunities
okay but there are some other really
solid options depending on what you're
looking for and on the iPhones are a lot
of really interesting ones there's time
page which is really gorgeous and maybe
way too simple or there's calendars five
which i think is fantastic especially if
you need help respond to a bunch of
event invitations one alternative that a
lot of people love is fantastical
fantastical has excellent natural
language support maybe even better than
Google's and it has a customizable
widget and icon
which is great for at a glance
information the reason I don't think
fantastical is for everyone is it's love
it or hate it interface if you want
density here you go it is a dense agenda
view with a quick week or month bar at
the top of the screen I absolutely can't
read this but if you want a lot of
information at once this is a great
choice the alternatives on Android are
really different and often kind of
strange like this one what is it doing
why are their circles what's happening a
lot of calendar apps on Android go for
density which i think is way too hard to
read and others come off as twists on
Google Calendar to varying degrees of
success
there is one that stands out though and
that's digit Cal did you go stands out
in a few different ways first it has a
ton of view options so you can get a
split agenda in month view a full-on
month you even a full year view there's
also built-in weather information up to
two weeks out and for a price you can
subscribe to interesting calendars so
sports schedules TV schedules religious
holidays and other things like that I
also love that you can just tap on an
event to get a quick preview of it it's
really easy to read but as a whole I
find digital a little bit harder to
navigate in Google Calendar it also
doesn't have natural language support
for inputting events and you're going to
want to pay $5 to remove all the
built-in ads there's not a lot of money
but it's not quite adding enough to sell
me on the whole package the truth is
there is isn't a lot of innovation in
calendar apps these days there are a few
core features and most apps do them
pretty well
so until there's an app out there that
does something much better than the
basics I'm going to stick with the one
that does the basics the best iPhone or
Android that's Google Calendar this
tootsie rolls have been in there
do you test rules age down drop so tough
job
are you kidding me no God darn it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
