the razor edge the edge some format
anyway has actually been around for a
while it came out last year at CES as
project Fionna a hybrid tablet slash
controller slash video game console over
the next year Razer refined the look
made the whole thing modular and then
re-released it at CES 2013 as the edge
so there are three parts to the Razer
edge really the first is the tablet
itself it's a fairly normal looking
Windows 8 tablet an all-black rectangle
with tapered plastic edges and a matte
back the biggest difference the thing
that sets the edge apart is that it's
huge it's eight tenths of an inch thick
making it not only thicker than most
tablets but most recent laptops as well
it also weighs 2.1 pounds it's pretty
well made really solid and almost sleek
if that's possible for a tablet this
stick on the front of it all there's a
10.1 inch 1366 by 768 screen surrounded
by a pretty gigantic black bezel the
screen itself is okay it's a little low
res for device this expensive but it's
bright and has good viewing angles the
only part that's rough is the touch
screen it's just kind of unresponsive
often scrolling awkwardly or taking
three taps to do something which really
makes no sense on a device this powerful
there are a couple of reasons the edge
is so big but mostly it's to make room
for specs unlike anything we've seen in
a tablet before this is Razer says the
only tablet with a discrete GPU inside a
separate graphics chip that is basically
required for any kind of serious gaming
all that gets hot which is why there are
two gigantic fans on top of the edge and
as I found they're pretty necessary
along with the tablet itself there are
two accessories that are more or less
required to get the most out of the edge
one is the hundred dollar docking
station which adds three USB ports and
an HDMI port to the edge so you can just
drop the tablet in here fire up steams
big picture mode and game right on your
TV it works really well and since
there's only one USB port on the edge
itself you're gonna want more inputs the
edge is definitely powerful enough to be
your only machine but you'll need the
peripherals to make it work the other
necessary accessory is the 250 dollar
gamepad controller which adds the
two-handled controller to the tablet and
turns it into the project Fionna we saw
a year ago it adds a lot of weight to
the edge but it also adds all the
controls you'd need to play almost any
game you get two analog sticks and a
d-pad plus all the buttons and triggers
you'd get on an Xbox or Playstation
controller as well it also adds another
battery into the edge which it turns out
you kind of need as a PC the edge is
more or less what you'd expect
powerful enough to do anything you throw
at it it's SPECT like a high-end laptop
and it performs like one whether you're
streaming high-def movies or using
Photoshop or just browsing the web it's
plenty powerful it works great with an
external monitor through the HDMI port
or just by hooking up a keyboard and
mouse via a USB or Bluetooth but let's
be honest this isn't a tablet that also
happens to play games it's a gaming
tablet and I'm sort of surprised to say
this but it's a really good one
I played high-end games on really high
settings and the edge handles it all
really well there are basically three
ways to play one is with the controller
on your lap which is kind of like having
the most awesome iPad gaming experience
ever you can also hook it up to a TV and
play games with a mouse and keyboard or
a controller or just play on the tablet
itself the first two are really the best
way to play it works on a TV just like a
dedicated console or gaming PC would and
playing with the controller is a lot of
fun just using the edge itself isn't
quite as good the screen isn't great not
a lot of games are optimized for touch
and 10.1 inches is pretty small for a
big game anyway I played all sorts of
games on the edge and everything I tried
was playable not perfect when I cranked
up detail in Crysis 3 the frame rate
definitely dipped enough that I could
tell it was stuttering but that's an
incredibly intense game and it was still
playable slightly less intense games
like Borderlands 2 worked really well
and relatively simple ones like NBA 2k13
were perfect things did get worst when I
was playing in 1080p on a TV rather than
on the lower res screen on the edge but
most games were still totally playable I
never found a game I just couldn't play
on the edge which is kind of a
remarkable feat for any tablet no matter
how big the performance here is
definitely a full level below a true
dedicated gaming desktop or even a
device like razors played laptop but
it's way beyond what any other device
this size is capable of it does get
pretty hot and really loud when you're
playing games but neither is surprising
for a gaming laptop or really a problem
the tablet itself only gets about an
hour of battery life when you're really
gaming intensively and with the
controllers extra battery only gets
about two but honestly this thing is so
big and so heavy that you're not gonna
use it in public much anyway here's the
thing I don't quite know how to feel
about the Razer edge it's much more
powerful than any tablet on the market
and if you're in the market for a gaming
tablet it's really the only option but
if you're just a person who wants a
computer the edge costs $1000 for the
lowest spec model and by the time you've
purchased the accessories and maybe
upgraded to the more powerful edge Pro
you're looking at $1,500 for a gaming
machine
the edges performance is great without
being remarkable and if you're spending
this much money on a gaming laptop you
can probably do better for your money
but if you want a 2-pound gaming PC with
a pretty cool controller and you can
afford it you really won't be sorry you
bought the edge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
