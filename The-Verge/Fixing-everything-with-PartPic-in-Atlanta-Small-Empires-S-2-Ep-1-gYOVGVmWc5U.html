in Atlanta haha we can edit this I'm
Alexis Ohanian start-up founder and Y
Combinator partner over the last year I
went on a two hundred event book tour
and met people building small empires
all across North America now I'm back
with a new season revisiting some of my
favorite stocks from the tour a new
startup has three basic choices to get
funded if you have the cash on hand and
can create a profitable business
bootstrapping is one option bank loans
are another popular method but they
require interest payments that can drain
your resources
it's the third option popular in the
tech sector is taking venture capital
with venture capital the startup doesn't
pay interest but it exchanges a portion
of its company's stock and return for
the cash part pick a visual learning
startup from Atlanta is looking to raise
its first round of funding known in the
business as a seed round it will have to
court investors and sell them on its
potential for explosive growth because
the early-stage venture business is
based on returning ten times what is
invested
we're here in Midtown Atlanta just
across the street from Georgia Tech and
the techs where I'm very excited because
we're gonna be visiting a start-up in a
co-working space that's part of an old
hotel called the Biltmore now this is an
awesome startup called part pick which
is at a really pivotal moment that most
people never get to see they're right in
the middle of raising their seed round
of funding so I was working at a big
industrial distributor and I was doing
sales management there really shortly
into my time kind of working there I got
very frustrated because I had to filled
all of the angry phone calls from
customers who we'd sent the wrong parts
out to so let's just say you need to fix
something my vacuum cleaning robot a
machine that makes my vacuum cleaning
robot yes the machine that makes your
vacuum finesse let's say you need to fix
that it's gross it is broken it's down
yeah you need to find a replacement part
for it yes so you call mcmaster-carr
you wouldn't have a part number because
typically things that are coming off
machines don't have anything on them or
it's been rubbed off maybe older so
you'd have to say oh it's silver it's
kind of round the people on my team
would do their best try to help you so
they would ask you certain questions try
to figure out what category you might be
in they use this catalog I saw this on
stage you're holding this dead tree mass
look like a phone book yeah and they
literally use it to find it and this is
2014 yes and so you know I started
thinking about okay this isn't gonna
work for me like I'm not gonna be able
to survive it so I have to come up with
something to make this better part pick
is
visual search for replacement parts and
we are changing the way the industrial
distribution market sells parts so we're
talking about physical like like widgets
like my widget is broken I need a new
one
I don't know what it is I'm holding it
here and this is way to instantly would
take a photo of it and find out what it
is what it is and where to get it yes
so how did you get the next pieces in
motion you're like across literally
right now or across the street from
Georgia tag yeah so I really just
started hanging out there I was studying
for the GMAT and I had a friend who went
there and just led me into the library
but then I started seeing these posters
around campus for different clubs like
if you're interested come by different
speakers things like that and so I
started to go to those and talk a little
bit about this idea I have and just
enough to get introduced to people who
are in computer vision machine learning
those departments one introduction after
another leads to me meeting my technical
team how did jewelry buin to this it was
actually very easy Julia not work
together when we were at Google we
worked on a side hustle a 20% project as
they call it and we were extremely
successful we won business awards from
Google because of the work that we did
and you know Joe is one of my best
friends now and it's really easy to work
with her and so when she had this idea
we sat down we talked it through and it
wasn't long before we said that we're
just gonna solve this problem alright
let's see this in action awesome this is
a thing that the technical how will I
will give you 50 bucks if you were to
tell me what that I oh okay all right
it's some kind of a button I don't know
what it what is it I guess well last
part pick let's find out so navigate to
the apartment home screen tap on the
icon get a nice focused picture
confronting the photo so now it's
uploading into our database and you see
it's searching and within a few seconds
right now we're working at five to ten
seconds now of course a toto tank lever
there's on the tip of my tongue the
classic th five 5 1989 337 I thought it
was a three three six I got you which
it's a typical mistake and we allow you
to search
stores around you we've partnered with
national NGO to supply so they're the
first election you choose it I mean it
takes you directly to their website then
you can purchase it directly from the
site when this technology is you as an
enterprise model it sends the correct
part and other similar parts to that
sales rep for them to confirm the
purchase and place in the correct order
roughly how long ago did you guys like
really get started so we really got
started um coming actually coming out of
an accelerator right up in New York yeah
so we did NYC seed start and so over the
last year since the accelerator we've
really just been kind of under the radar
somewhat we I've done a few competitions
to kind of get some money to keep us
going but just really been focused on
solving the core problem there's just so
much work that has to be done over the
past year with the technology to get us
to a point where we can actually
implement with our first customer well
you've been running for the last year
based pretty much entirely off the
funding you got from that accelerator
and then prizes here and there
well we actually also got about 100k
from two family friends okay and then
I've taken on jobs done different things
along the way to put more money into
this sure but no one's really getting a
salary no one's giving me a salary
um consistently so so yeah we've kind of
had to do what we had to do to keep it
going so how's further ado the winner of
2014
TechCrunch Disrupt Enterprise disruptor
category from Accenture open innovation
is Mark pick you all had that great
outing at TechCrunch and TechCrunch
Disrupt was here first was that your
first trip to the valley with the
company yeah it was it was our
introduction it's a little like I was
really really nervous going into
TechCrunch I didn't know how he would be
received we're coming as a team that
looks quite different than most of the
teams people that are attending
TechCrunch have probably seen before so
that's one thing and then coming with a
solution for an industry that most
people haven't even thought to come up
with the solution everyone everyone's
trying to make the next step for sharing
cat photos there you go so they're not
really thinking about repair so you know
I really did not have any clue how we're
going to be received but it turned out
amazing I think it's very clear when
people start a company from personal
frustration because you can describe the
problem and your solution very very
clearly that's very nice that we got so
much support and people were just
rooting for us and saying you guys did
great
I love what you're working on you know
how could we help so it's been pretty
cool so I stayed out in California about
a week after TechCrunch to take meetings
so we were able to secure probably about
15 meetings while we were out there
fundraising is such a waste of time
right meeting with investors is not
doing the most important thing for your
business that's actually running your
business but it's a kind of necessary
evil and it can feel like Groundhog Day
because you're answering the same
questions over and over again saying the
same things over and over again but you
have to do with the same energy and
conviction every time because the
investor needs to believe in you and
founders are going to hear no more often
than yes but it could be a matter of
tens of meetings with angel investors or
I've seen as many as over a hundred
before a round gets done we're in a
nondescript office Park about 20 minutes
outside of Atlanta where is it a
national builder supply which is going
to be the first pilot customer of part
pick and I hear there are a lot of
toilets inside
every toilet should have a remote
control
Wow nice warehouse this is it this home
this Kevin not a Kenneth I probably
talked to Kevin warden on top of my why
were you guys back in kindergarten we
all scheming this whole empire yeah I
would have schemed a different time I'm
very familiar with Toto toilets I've got
a couple very big fan ten years ago we
would literally drive down to the
factory and if somebody bought one
online we would go pick it up and then
drive it back in my Toyota Tundra and
put it on a pallet or put it in a box
and ship it out I mean it was a
definition of just in time so a few
toilets and your Toyota Tundra has
become all of this right our business
traditionally was much easier because
people would type in brand names they
recognized Grohe hansgrohe American
Standard and they would type in the
suite the toto Drake and you could take
them from this manufacturer suite
species relationship and introduce them
to a result set had context what they
were looking for now that we're
expanding our product line into
industrial supplies and rough plumbing
the search terms are much more ambiguous
- not branded at all sir I hope
something's to give the house I just
let's pretend I'm handy and I tried
trying to fix this myself
sure so this is broken it is a copper
macaroni yes at the time yeah they call
it a copper 90 but if my mom would not
call that a copper 90 the not on
generally called a copper matter right
for Emily so that's what's changed the
game for us we have to figure out how to
take these physical attributes and put
them into some type of schema or
hierarchy dad our web catalog will
understand Amma's where Parker that's
where harp it comes in clearly I mean it
seems like something software or
technology should be good at solving how
did you get involved with a part Pig
with ten years of search term analysis
under my belt I knew that it was going
to be a
right and knew that current technologies
within text analysis just weren't going
to work met Jule at Georgia Tech she
showed up at one of the events that we
were talking about e-commerce and
digital marketing just like hey I used
to work at mcmaster-carr I had this idea
whenever else in the call center I was
like look that's exactly what our
situation is and so whenever Jule said
hey if I have an image I could figure
out how to model it I was like well I
have the products and I have the search
terms and I can introduce those to the
person that is looking for an item if
you could help service that translation
layer and if Jules willing to step out
we're going to give her the broom to let
the market decide of what she's building
has utility to know this is officially
fundraising load this is yes voila we
going to different cities I actually
spent a couple days in DC and then went
up to New York and just got back from
New York we've had a few follow-up
meetings with some firms that were
really hoping you know invest we've had
a few commitments for folks who want to
join but just don't want to Leith around
wishes those are the worst you know that
is a real talk all right
those are investors who lack conviction
I can use another word but I it's it's
so incredibly frustrating as a founder
yeah because it's like if you believe in
me now what should it matter you should
need to wait this is the end it's the
classic instead of the same investors
who are like I am not a heard investor
no I don't I you know but they it's it's
infuriating as a founder anybody who
knows the visual recognition industry
this is a truly difficult problem to
solve this this won't be solved with one
hundred and thirty thousand dollars from
friends and family around this issue
takes true investment where's the
biggest push back up yeah so um I'd say
the most common thing I've heard is we
like to see paying customers but even to
get started with a large corporation
like the ones who are coming to us
requires a team that's being paid it
requires a lot so that's the that's the
message I'm trying to get across to
investors it's just like when these
large companies come on board um we have
to be able to support what they're
asking for and with me here and other
people in different places it's it's
kind of impossible to be able to say
okay Home Depot we can have this huge
operation ready to serve you you don't
mean another thing is just location we
are headquartered out of Atlanta we're
proud to call it a linter home but when
we talk with investors we oftentimes get
the question are you are you going to be
headquarter in Atlanta or will you move
out to Silicon Valley the idea that a
start-up needs to be close to an angel
investor is kind of ridiculous right a
start-up needs to be wherever it will be
most successful its smothering to think
of an investor who wants to be really
close to you in order to have weekly
meetings now that I know right i mean
most investors actually think that they
are smarter and more helpful than they
actually are you're in manufacturing and
you're doing a lot of sales with
manufacturing companies that right now
aren't scaling because you have to do
the mini need space be close to those
manufacturing companies there is a huge
a major world-class tech university a
bunch of actually great schools in the
area a city with massive massive
companies right there are wealthy people
here there are investors here what's it
like trying to fundraise here in Atlanta
it's hard it's hard and you know ideally
we'd be able to be based in Atlanta be
funded at Lana um use Atlanta resources
you know because most of our team is
actually from Atlanta we have a lot of
ties to the city and so that would mean
a lot to us if we were able to
Malena be based in atlanta all that
great stuff but it's just not really the
way it's worked out because it went
ahead seen successes in certain industry
so like information security email
marketing so like part of what I'm
seeing is that investors will invest if
you're having information security
startup but for something like us is a
little bit yeah why haven't you
relocated the company that's a question
that we get all the time that we've been
getting over the last couple weeks since
TechCrunch is why are you based in
Atlanta why do you have loyalty to
Atlanta and it seems like Atlanta isn't
being as loyal to you um and that's a
great question honestly you know yeah
that's a that's a it's a hard one
industrial distribution really centers
out of you know the South the Midwest a
bit in the East Coast so we have access
to our clients Home Depot is is
headquartered in Atlanta Delta is
headquartered in Atlanta and our first
client our first pilot customer is
headquartered in Atlanta and there's a
number of others that we've been in
conversations with over the past few
weeks that have offices or innovation
labs in Atlanta we've already started to
generate a good strong pipeline of
talent from Georgia Tech Georgia Tech is
arguably the best signal processing
engineering school in the world
and we've been able to secure a top
talent from Georgia Tech and we would
like to continue you know investigating
you know what that relationship could
look like as we continue to recruit and
build out our team so Silicon Valley
investors
what are they risk by sleeping on
secondary markets like in Lana you go
into an investor meeting and it's one of
the first things they love to say is
that we don't invest in the product we
don't invest in the technology we invest
in the people and you know and and we're
really we're looking for smart people
smart people live everywhere you know
smart people don't just live in Silicon
Valley smart people don't just live in
New York but smart people live
everywhere and hungry people live
everywhere so if you're really truly
dedicated to the the value of a person
into that talent then you should look
elsewhere and find ways of bringing out
that hunger and that entrepreneurial
spirit in places where there's not a big
tech community in our own very small way
we're just mimicking the model that that
was established 20 years ago whenever we
test part pick quickly get it out there
see what works it works float it to the
top help tell other people that it's
working get the resource investments
both human resource and capital resource
involved to let it rise to the top and
then be a reference point a testimonial
to make it easier to sell to the next
guy that system everyone is on board
with this right now I honestly I do not
sleep much and people say that like oh
I'm grinding and I'm not sleeping no
really I I'm holding down a lot training
hours you sleep gonna die it's hard for
me to sleep even if I if I okay I've
accomplished all the tasks I need you
for today it keeps I keep it's just like
impossible to rest well it's hard
because I feel pressure because it's
like this is my big vision and I really
want to see it come to life but now that
I've brought other people on to and this
is now our big vision and everyone wants
to see it come to light and it's not
just me I feel obligated to my family
little brothers for example they think
that to be successful they have to
become really good at sports or they
want to become a doctor because that's
success but they don't see actually how
does it look to go from oh I just came
up with this idea and now we have hired
a hundred people and now a hundred
people can feed their families
as their big sister I want to be the
person who can be kind of that role
model for them there is something a
little unconventional about starting the
company and especially the role model
that you can play not just for your
siblings but frankly for a lot of people
right because you said earlier you don't
look like a lot of the people on stage
at TechCrunch Disrupt yeah why is that
important you I feel that I'm up for the
challenge I can just see it I can see it
which i think is kind of half the battle
envisioning like this actually can be a
billion dollar company I can see then
we're just at that edge we're just
almost there and we just have to keep
going I feel like there's a million
people that think I can't
and I've heard probably hundreds of them
say it to my face really yeah but for
every person that has something
discouraging to say there are literally
a million people that if I do make it um
that can be a role model too and that to
me is motivation and there are four
little boys that look just like me
who I really really want to show at the
end of the day it seems like this is the
everything is here everything is in
place all the basics that investors
should be looking for are there right
how does it I mean what what is I don't
know what is the thing that drives you
what is the thing that keeps you pushing
forward and it makes it so clear to me
that you're never gonna stop I just
really believe in what we're doing
and what it can be I just feel like I
haven't done everything yet I haven't
done everything that I can do
have more things that I can pull out of
my bag you know I can take out loans
there's just there's more that can be
done and I believe in it so much that I
will keep pressing until I don't know
what's the breaking point I don't think
I'm not sure but there's experiments I
want to run like sometimes to be honest
I feel like maybe it's me maybe it's
like the way I come off to people work
maybe my conviction is a little strong
for folks so I'm thinking well maybe I
should attain to someone else to pitch
it or to go into meetings with this is
this is not too far down on my list of
potential things and see how it goes
with it well I know you're not quitting
anytime soon jewel and I'm looking
forward to saying 10 years from now at
the Nasdaq launch of the IPO yeah I met
her way back when that'd be cool for all
the technology has done to lower the
barriers of entry to starting a company
there are still societal and structural
barriers that potentially stop us from
benefiting from the ideas and the
talents of some of the best founders
fortunately for all of us there are
founders like Jules we will stop at
nothing
in order to see their businesses become
successful and she will no doubt inspire
many more founders just like her to take
up the charge become entrepreneurs and
look after spending some time with her
and being here in Atlanta I certainly
would not
against jewel and for that matter I
wouldn't bet against Atlanta either
heart kicks certainly isn't the first
company to help customers replace broken
or missing carts but by taking advantage
of our mobile world Harvick is poised to
stand out amongst the competition by
using mobile solutions small businesses
can level the playing field with larger
competition one of the biggest steps is
to build a mobile-friendly site stick
with a simple layout and avoid excess
images that slow load times another
great way to connect with customers on
the go is to send text reminders of
sales or appointments utilizing apps
like Foursquare is a great way to
promote your business and offer special
discounts to customers who check-in at
your store and if you're looking to
really take advantage of your mobile
opportunity build a mobile app which can
