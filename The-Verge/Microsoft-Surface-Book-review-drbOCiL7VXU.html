it's not just any laptop it's a surface
laptop we've always won in Microsoft to
make a laptop and at first glance that's
exactly what the surface book is
as a beautiful 14.5 inch display that
makes colors really pop and it's
noticeable
what's also noticeable is the unusual
3x2 aspect ratio that Microsoft has
picked for the surface book it's just
like Google's Chromebook pixel it takes
a little getting used to if you're
watching a movie you'll get some
letterboxing but if you're browsing the
web and there's lots of vertical space
to read sites if you use a browser all
day you might fall in love with this
weirdly tall screen while Windows
laptops usually have terrible trackpads
Microsoft Surface book looks and feels
just like a mac books it's a joy to use
for our windows thanks to the glass
surface and the pure size of it
typing on the keyboard at first feels
like you have to press too hard because
there's very little to keep track of
here but once you get used to it it's
actually a lot better typing experience
I switch back to other laptops for their
keys film machine comparison but spacing
between the keys is really ideal on the
surface book and it feels comfortable
I really can't fold it Microsoft has
done a good job the really intriguing
part of the surface book is the new
fulcrum hinge its next around the base
and display of the surface book and it
looks awesome like something out of an
alien movie but it also reveals the
weaknesses of the surface book when you
close the book down the display doesn't
sit flush with the keyboard says an ugly
gap dust hair and all sorts of other
nastiness
now get Wrigley deposited onto the
surface book keyboard because of it it's
ugly but it's a compromise that allows
for the biggest surprise on Microsoft's
laptop it's also a tablet yes that's
right
it's a tablet that sounds insane but
watch you press this little button here
and it unlocks the screen from the base
you pull it off
and it's a tablet Microsoft has built an
entire PC inches display that doubles as
a touchscreen and supports a stylus
while the base unit and display combine
into a laptop that's not exactly
lightweight the tablet by itself feels
comfortably low because of the free
batoo aspect ratio it also feels that
you're holding a sheet of paper that
Microsoft insists on calling a digital
clipboard that actually kind of makes
sense you're mostly you want to use it
for notes because using it as a tablet
to play games and watch movies is a
little awkward without a kickstand
or case to prop it up
the fans of the surface books spin up
occasionally when you use it as a tablet
but it doesn't get warm as a result the
new surface pain is greatly improved
thanks to a new tip that has a nicer
feel on the screen but there's still a
slight lag that will rotate artists who
want to draw on this professionally it's
fine for note-taking though and there's
pen snaps and magnetically to the site
that's better than a pen loop but it
still always falls off in my back once
you're done using as a tablet you can
simply dock the surface back in and it
stays coupled together with magnets and
a new muscle wire lock that secures it
firmly in place
Windows 10 does a good job of switching
between the touch friendly mode and one
more suited to a keyboard and mouse
especially if you enable it to do so
automatically there's still a lack of
good touch apps for Windows 10 but it's
still like switching between using a
laptop and straight into a tablet it's
pretty seamless and apps snap back to
their positions so you can carry on
working as a laptop and vice versa while
it sounds like the ideal combination of
a tablet and laptop there's still some
drawbacks the hinge is a resistive
enough like a regular laptop so it
bounces a little if you're typing in
your lap or you touch the display while
you're using it as a laptop a lot of
two-in-one Windows laptops have the same
problem because they're trying to be a
tablet and a laptop and Microsoft has
probably done the best job yet but it's
still not perfect it's also a little
heavy as a 13 inch laptop at just over
three pounds and that's mostly because
the base unit the surface book is just
pure battery mixed with ports on some
models there's even a GPU in the base
that will make the pro apps and games
better even on the base model it's a
fast laptop for the majority of desktop
apps like Chrome Photoshop and basic
games from the Windows Store while the
tablet portion should last around three
hours might have claims up to 12 hours
if you're using as a regular laptop it's
not lying
during our own verge battery test we
found the surface book lasts nearly
thirteen hours for the base model
without the additional GPU it's
incredibly rare for a Windows laptop to
have great battery life I'm amazed it
lasts a full working day and more
however if you're using lots of apps and
really pushing it they expect around 6
hours of battery life so it's the
surface book really the ultimate laptop
that Microsoft claims is
nearly I say that because sometimes I'm
using the surface book and I really wish
might have just made a pure laptop the
display wobble is irritating and the
weird gap when it's closed means I have
to clean the surface book every day if
Microsoft can fix the hinge in future
versions and make it a little less bulky
and lighter then this could be the
ultimate laptop has a beautiful display
amazing battery life and the keyboard
and trackpad feel great if you really
need a laptop that transforms into a
tablet then this is probably the best
one out there that I've used but it's
not the ultimate laptop just yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
