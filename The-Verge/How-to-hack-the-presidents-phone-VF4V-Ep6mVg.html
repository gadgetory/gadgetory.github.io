off-the-shelf Android phone a New York
Times report on January 25th described
aides trying and failing to replace
Trump Samsung device and a string of
tweaks in the days since have shown the
president continuing to use Twitter for
Android that's a huge security problem
and a huge break from the norm finally
this year they said good news mr.
president we're going to give you a
smartphone I get the thing and they're
like well mr. president for security
reasons it is a great phone
state-of-the-art but it doesn't take
pictures you can't text the phone
doesn't work so basically it's like the
three year old everyone was placed on
when President Obama took office he got
a specially secured blackberry with no
apps no Twitter and just a handful of
numbers that he could call or text the
problem is any consumer grade phone
running Twitter is vulnerable to
thousands of attacks from all around the
world and if that phone is in the
president's pocket a lot of people are
going to try to break in if they make it
through they can turn the phone into a
live microphone broadcasting everything
you cheers back to the hacker to show
you how that works we've connected with
Zak lanyard director of research at
silence he's going to plant some
surveillance malware on our producer
Tom's Galaxy s6 edge we tweeted Tama
download link for what looks like the
weather bug app but alongside the
weather prediction Zack built in some
surveillance malware that can turn on
the phone's microphone and even the
camera that lets us check in on Tom
whenever we want you are at 40 point 704
a latitude is negative 74 oh one one
three three one two so we're running
Gabby honey when you got me over here
they should be in the middle of a
meeting yes you should be able to hear
them talking what I'm going to eat this
yummy oh I also can't make it tomorrow
probably seven seconds of audio
I've got their front camera and back
camera full contact no SMS messages
unfortunately or call it's true like we
created we could have put more there to
give you so here's what we got Tory are
you okay yeah what Karen you daddy's
right here nice very Duty for me that's
been yeah I mean moron it's a little
muffled because I think he was in his
pocket or something but it was I mean
it's perfect yeah you can work you got
this right here you one name is very
duty sister ah music okay let's move it
fast is great what's the next week yeah
it doesn't want to happen agree when do
you guys want to finally stop I can't do
it I can't do it next Monday I feel you
guys have a today they can't do it next
Monday unfortunately by the cameras why
be half bed so this was just a demo that
Zack put together in his spare time and
the real thing would look different a
couple ways we were relying on known
vulnerabilities in Android so we had to
trick Tom into purposefully downloading
the software but when we see
surveillance malware in the wild it's a
lot sneak you using undiscovered
vulnerabilities to break into an email
attachment a bad link or even a silent
software update it takes a lot of time
and expertise to carry out an attack
like that and for most users it's just
not a plausible threat but the president
is different
foreign intelligence agencies are
willing to spend millions of dollars and
years of work to find out the president
secrets right now some of the best
hackers in the world are in rooms in
Moscow in Beijing spending all day every
day trying to hack into the Oval Office
they take away here would be something
to the effect of when you have an open
ecosystem like that it's very hard to
really universally maintain some kind of
baseline procedure if they've done a
good job but in the end it's it's hard
because you have way more gates it's
just not going to be something regular
things so hmm
which app older devices like s3 s4 even
earlier is that five you don't and the
fact that certain people in power have
those that are more or less unsupported
it's terrifying if there's an unsecured
phone anywhere near the president those
groups are going to find it and turn it
into a microphone that was true for
President Obama and it's true for
President Trump the difference is it's
so far Trump seems to care more about
tweeting than protecting state secrets
yeah actually amber Ashley Hamburg lol
hamburger that real birth that is he
works he used to work here and now he
works with snapchat if he downloading it
oh he's in the contacts of the phone no
I mean we're going to we're going to
call in the drones on that that's that's
