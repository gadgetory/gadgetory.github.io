projector but the idea of losing my TV
is kind of scary but now with pocket
projectors and their quality image their
small size and portability maybe it's
time for me to actually buy one I live
in a crammed - New York City apartment
and I don't want to dedicate thousands
of dollars to a massive home theater
setup but with a pocket projector I
could put it anywhere in my house and
adjust the image size so make it big or
small I could also bring it anywhere
with me so I could even take it up to my
roof okay so if you don't know pico
projectors are smaller and more
affordable than what you usually think
of as a home theater projector a good
one should have decent battery life or
at least enough to last two hour movie
quality image and acceptable sound so
you don't have to use external speakers
also you should be able to play content
off your phone or laptop without much
hassle I tested the five best projectors
under $600 and the winner I found to be
the inker Nebula capsule for $350 unlike
all the other projectors the capsule
runs Android so it has apps built in
including YouTube and Netflix and you
can connect to your home Wi-Fi or your
phone hotspot if you're outside
it also supports airplay yes airplay so
I'm aired content from my phone on the
projector I'm actually connected to a
home media server so is able to watch
content from my phone on the projector
it also supports Android devices because
it supports miracast it has an HDMI port
as well so if you want to connect to
your laptop chromecast or a fire stick
you can do that too the capsule projects
at an 854 by 480 resolution with a 16 by
9 aspect ratio it supposedly reaches up
to 100 lumens of brightness but it
really can seem that bright and
definitely looks best in a dark room
Ankur says its battery should last up to
4 hours and I'm not sure if he'll go
that long that I can say I watched
Captain America Civil War which is two
and a half hours long and I handled it
just fine I wish it charged over USBC
like some of its competition but the
microUSB does the job
other than its Android apps I also
appreciated the capsule speakers they
were by far the best of any of the
projectors that soda can shape works
well to spread the sound around a room
anchor even advertises the projector as
a Bluetooth speaker and I can see why
it handles music and movie soundtracks
while regardless of where its place that
shape also helps with the projectors
actual placement because you might not
need an extra platform to raise it up
unlike other projectors that lie flat
you can control playback in the
projector in general through its remote
although you have to be within a narrow
range for to actually register commands
it also has a companion iOS and Android
app but I had trouble pairing my phone
in the projector the other obvious
downside to my pick are its fans which
are kind of loud but not the loudest my
dream projector would be silent of
course but I haven't found one that is
the capsule is the best overall
projector but if you value image quality
you might prefer the more expensive LG
pH 550 at $550 the LG is $200 more than
the capsule but offers 720p HD
resolution that looks great you can also
make lots of image adjustments including
brightness color and contrast it can
supposedly project a 550 lumens and ice
clearly saw a brightness difference
between it and the rest of the
competition but its speakers are
horrendous and it's bulky making it the
least portable of all the projectors you
also need to bring your laptop or foam
with you to supply the content you want
to watch there's an HDMI port so you can
connect a streaming box but that will
limit your ability to take this
projector outdoors I tested a few other
projectors as well I loved the slim
shape of the sony MP CD and the picture
quality was crisp and nice to look at
this would be my other brunner up its
primary downside is its speakers
the mini projector M 175 is sold in
Apple stores and has a cool angling
feature so you can aim it at walls
without a stand however an HDMI cable
weighs it down and makes it difficult to
use the axe of P six was disqualified
almost immediately because of its bulky
form and loud fans I flew to Chicago
with all of these projectors in my
carry-on which wasn't exactly a pleasant
experience but did prove that they're
truly portable the TSA agents who
obviously wanted to examine them were
shocked how small they were and is true
they're super tiny and that's really
impressive the pico projector field is
still developing but anchor has built
the most complete device for a casual
on-the-go user so go ahead and live your
wire free life and watch a backyard
movie thanks for watching if you use any
of these projectors in your day to day
life let me know in the comment I'm
curious about how it's going also if you
