here at CES 2014 and Samsung just showed
us its best TV of the year a 4k 105 inch
curved TV we got to just check it out
right now and the TV is truly a presence
to behold it's 21 by 9 so it's very very
wide 105 inches you can really see the
curve but viewing angles are
unbelievable and the back shows off its
quality the back is actually made out of
a curved wood panel with metal stands
it's unlike a TV we've seen before of
course the TV isn't really anything that
we expect anytime soon
there's no pricing availability a
speaker you can be sure it'd be quite
expensive
we aren't convinced to the benefits of
curved televisions the Samsung says this
is undeniably the future of TV it
believe that gives a 3d like effect we
didn't really see that in person it
turns out that what they're using is a
post-processing effect that adds extra
contrast to certain layers in the image
to make it look better supposedly it
really is changing the original image
and depending on how it looks to your
eye it might be better Samsung has shown
in the past that has ability to ship
crazy TVs like this last year at the
same event samsung showed off its crazy
easel TV which eventually did ship for
close to $40,000 in addition to the
curved 4k TV samsa has also shown off a
bendable television which can be
switched from flat to curved on the
press of a button it's just a prototype
for now and isn't clear what Samsung
plans to do with the technology it's a
pretty good tech demo Samsung is
convinced that these sorts of curved TVs
or the future let's see what its
competitors do next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
