Patel and the other people are not here
there's no one else here it's just me
The Verge chance to the podcast where we
talk usually about technology culture
and culture culture and really whatever
we want but it has so happens that Paul
Miller's out on the spirit journey of
some kind Josh kopalski is out shooting
a taping of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon
soon to be The Tonight Show with Jimmy
Fallon so we thought because it's a slow
weekend news and we've been running a
lot of stories on one topic lately that
we would dedicate this episode of The
Verge cast to that topic and so welcome
to The Verge cast special edition you
are being watched and we're going to
talk about kind of a crazy that's a
coming together of a lot of surveillance
topics a lot of state surveillance
topics and a lot of drones topics and
drones are also being used for
surveillance as well so I've got some
special guest with me carl franzen one
of our reporters ben popper one of our
editors and on the phone in the air in
the ether Matt Stroud Matt hey doing hey
man you look good you mean you look like
you are in fact surveilling us with that
headset yeah that's the idea I mean that
is terrifying actually I like that I
like the the the yeah the jaunty
microphone place it's like a pro gamer
rig yeah it's good so there's been a lot
of this stuff going on we've run a ton
of stories on it and basically everyone
is watching each other whether the
government's watching you whether people
want to watch the cops what the cops are
watching each other which is just not
okay and the amount of technology
involved is absolutely crazy so let's
jump right into kind of the big the big
story that really kind of brought this
together in our minds that are doing the
show which
Matt wrote a big piece on what taser is
up to they're mounting cameras and cops
essentially so we have a little clip of
video and this is astounding so just
take a look at north yeah go back west
hold on hey it's not all that get your
hands up now stop right there I'm gonna
tase you I'm gonna tase you if you've
not stop I'm gonna pay you don't let
stop this is absolutely insane it's
right what we're watching you he's gonna
usual he's gonna hit the guy he's not
kidding holiday stuff so that's terrible
so this is taser obviously that's a cop
of the Taser and tasers now mounting
well they're selling cameras that are
mounted on cops their first person
cameras kind of like Google glass for
the police Google last five point out
from and the cops are recording
everything you're doing so Matt can you
tell us what's going on you were at
taser you went to the headquarters
you're looking all this stuff what's
happening there um so what's happening
in in the general vicinity of taser
taser is located in scottsdale arizona
and right down the street from taser
from taser is a is a suburb of phoenix
called mesa arizona mesa arizona was the
first police department in the country
to start using these cameras they're
called the axon flex and they spend
fifty thousand dollars don't think they
got about 20 of them so it's just an
experimental phase but what they do or
what they're doing is they're mounting
these cameras on police officers glasses
among the
I like the on their ball caps and the
idea is that these cameras are streaming
video constantly whenever the the
officers are wearing these videos heard
these cameras there is video streaming
constantly to something called evidence
comp and whenever an officer wants to
record an incident i'll hit a button
that's on his chest and that from that
point forward it will be recorded
there's a 30-second audio delay after
the officer presses the button and then
after that there is both video and audio
from the officers perspective from his
from the perspective of his eyes yeah so
it's point of view and you can see
everything that the officer is seeing
and so the story is about kind of why
that technology is interesting and then
the policy implications behind you know
whether that's fair but what so really
grabs you know this all of this is that
this is the they're streaming to a
company called evidence calm which is
not the government which is not law
enforcement which is not sanctioned or
regulated by the citizens united states
it's just a private company the promise
is to do the right thing and then the
technology itself is just being
developed and deployed it feels really
weird I mean the first question that
comes to mind when I hear Matt talking
is like why do they decide when to turn
it on and off like yeah why not you go
on duty you turn it on you're on duty
for 12 hours and then you turn it off
right like I understand maybe there's
some considerations about how much data
you have but allowing them to
selectively turn it on and off seems
like asking for trouble yes I mean yeah
yeah it's a great question but I you
know I think too and maybe Matt you can
chime in on this as well but anybody
really uh is it is it that much
different than a you know the cops
videos that we're all familiar with from
like the 1990s like the old reality show
you know I mean is it because they show
had like the Heisenberg principle in it
right like you could never be sure what
they would have done if not for the cops
producer rent-a-cops cameraman right is
it much differently in cops is like
trying to be a television
yeah sure I mean that is that the sense
that you're getting it to me that they
they feel similar because you're
watching because you're only going to
watch the exciting stuff but the reality
the mundane reality is that most cops
like sit in a car all day long I think
that's part of it that's part of the
reason why these aren't recording
constantly there's there are file
storage issues if you can imagine
imagine a video recording for 12 hours
straight and having to keep every piece
of that video I mean that's that's a lot
of that's a lot of storage and the other
thing is is yeah well there are two
there are two peripheral issues here one
is that most of what cops do is sitting
around in a car and or on be not really
doing anything that's that's
consequential and the other issue is and
this is something that was mentioned by
the Taser spokesperson but cops don't
want to feel like they are being
recorded all the time and in fact the
way it was presented to me the reason
for that 30 second lag is in case
there's a conversation going on between
say one police officer and his partner
they don't want to have that on record
and they don't want the cops to feel
like they are being recorded all the
time sure who who who actually wants to
feel that way right I'm yeah they even
want their own privacy too i mean that's
yeah but they're not come on man yeah
like they're cops like I don't like I
you know what you you know who wants to
feel like the cops for being recorded
all the time Nilay Patel all the rest of
us who are not cops I I totally agree i
mean i think that that but i do think
it's a bit unrealistic i don't know Matt
you know you you studied this more in
depth in it than any of us and we're
grateful to you for it and you know I
just you know I do think it's a bit
impractical to imagine until we're all
surveilled at the same time that the
cops are always going to have this thing
on and recording every single
conversations they have among each other
like when they're saying you check out
that you know that hot person's
hommerson yeah it's Jagger neutral yeah
like that so check out that gender
neutral I'm just imagining a B is very
much are you saying there are you saying
that that's a good idea but they should
be recorded all the time I don't know I
don't that's why I'm not so I'm trying
to be a little question whiteout say if
they're not in the car I think that's it
right if
not in the car they might be getting
recorded well I really hope they want to
check out hot daddies and i'm putting
this agenda on or box earbobs how
Betty's are bobs in there in the car and
they whatever that's fine the second
they get out of that car and start
interacting with other human beings
right particularly the public who are
they they're committed like they build
an enormous amount of power right
because I think there's a lot of stuff
like four in New York right now for
example there's a lawsuit coming out
about stop-and-frisk which is not
necessarily incident it's like how do
you interact with the populace like are
you treating them like they're guilty or
like they're innocent you treating them
like civilians or like criminals and it
would be really interesting to just have
a lot of film about that you know like
why did you stop this person what were
they doing that was so suspicious right
I guess one thing Matt that I thought
was interesting about this story was the
one of the police chiefs was saying you
know at first a lot of cops did not want
this and now seeing how you know it
records what they do and kind of shows
them to be in the right or you know they
feel like it validates their job and so
more cops are actually asking for it and
so that I think is a kind of an
interesting dynamic there it is
interesting and I think that points out
something else there there are police
officers who feel that they can use this
to their advantage one of the stats that
I heard one of the numbers that i pulled
out for the story is that shortly before
May so went into this agreement with
taser there was a lawsuit a police
brutality lawsuit where the city of Mesa
had to pay out more than sixty thousand
dollars in one lawsuit and so you're
talking about that one lawsuit costs
more than the entire amount of money
that they paid for these cameras and so
I think what police officers are look
how police officer looking at at it is a
way to ensure that those kind of cases
don't have the solution to these cameras
being used only for police use is pretty
close to what you're talking about with
every interaction outside the car being
recorded I talked to a guy named in
Greenburgh or a green would follow this
thing Scott Greenwood because it civil
rights attorney his suggestion is that
you make it mandatory every time there's
an interaction with the civilian that
interaction has to be a record and if
it's not then the case has to be thrown
out of court
and that seems like the most realistic
way to approach this is that you require
every time there's a police interaction
between police officer in a civilian
that it has to be recorded well what
counts as interaction though I mean I'd
could totally get behind that too but I
just like again like you're saying in
the car Neil I like you were saying in
the case of officers being in the car
not having to film I mean what if you
what if you're pursuing a suspect i mean
do you do hope that there's a dash cam
or something that I you know I it would
seem like the line between when you're
interacting with a civilian or a suspect
what if you're cheap what if you're
tailing a suspect in your car is the
camera on that I don't know yeah yeah i
mean i think that there's also another
really interesting question brought up
you know about how this will play out
and nearly move things to say about this
in courts you know i was watching the
video that we created which was really
amazing and it sort of raised more
questions for me than an answer like
there was one where the guy was the cop
was scream you know put down the gun or
like stop agitating and i couldn't see
anything like I couldn't see if the
person he was shouting at had a gun he
said they had a gun and then he shot
somebody it's like how will that video
play out you know actually just attach
another story did which is totally
separate but we did a story this week
about animal cruelty yeah how these new
laws that they're trying to pass which
would keep activists you know from
masquerading or pretending to be farm
workers so they can film animal cruelty
and I used to work on a farm and I did
some chicken slaughters the chickens are
all armed the chickens were like drop
your gun chicken they fought back but I
think you know for me the striking thing
is they ever win no risings ever ever
result in any live chicken the point is
these chickens were humanely raised they
were fed organically you know they were
they lived outside had good lives up
into the poem we slaughter them but
killing something that is an idol of an
onion article yeah I'm pretty sure that
is killing something is messy and
complicated and it's not pretty and if
you saw that you were an animal rights
activist you would get upset even though
we did everything by the book where we
went beyond and I would assume it's the
same for a cop which is to say like you
know you meet the same drunk through two
three four weeks in a row and the fifth
time he agitates you and pushes you a
little bit off Cameron you punch him
back you know now that's recorded
forever and like it may look different
than how it it wouldn't you have the
four previous interactions
are you mad so how long does evidence
calm keep this stuff and I really want
to talk about evidence calm because that
to me is that's where this goes way off
the rails it's like totally now this
private company is determining what
we're doing with our records of like
Authority interactions what's going on
with evidence on calm how long do they
keep this stuff they keep records they
keep all of the recorded interactions
for 180 days Neela you probably know the
significance of that period of time
better than I do so what does 180 days
meeting to you uh you know number of
months pretty much I mean it varies from
state to state I would assume there's
some Arizona State statute that requires
them to do it requires the police
evidentiary procedures to last for that
long but it's different from every state
so I would imagine there's some sort of
state law they cover and SAT but like
that to me is crazy right because I'm
these cases can go on for a long time
they're like repeated instances of abuse
like you can't look at an officer's
pattern of conduct beyond like incident
by incident basis it is weird that you
know I mean I'm not sure Matt maybe you
can help us so who gets to see what's on
evidence calm and under what conditions
i think it's like first the police also
they can make edits which is weird and
it like keeps the original but they make
edits so you can show you edited
versions and then the prosecutors and
then the defendants you know and the
defense attorneys but citizens can never
see this stuff it's never just open to
the public as i understand it it is not
open to the public and in fact when we
made the video that we watched we made a
request to get that and it took quite a
while to get access to that video as i
understand it one of when a video is
made the police officer himself has
access to that video so he can tag it so
that he can label it so you can say what
exactly was online and essentially write
a video report on and then at that point
it then goes to an administrator and the
police department itself will set who
has access to who has administrative
access and then that person can can cut
the video in whatever way they want to
feel that it's needed and evan is calm
their reason for justifying that is
saying look like d the full on
video is still going to be available
whenever anybody makes a cut that person
will be identified as making that cut so
that's how it works so here's my
question what is the relationship
between evidence calm and any actual
accountable government institution right
are they just doing this and it's there
and you can use it if you want they make
their own rules about like you know you
can make cuts but well will you know
will keep track of it right I mean is
there any movement to make this official
because that's it's great that all the
cops have cameras but it seems to me
that the potential for the cops to abuse
the cameras to paint whatever picture
they want right is much higher than the
potential for this to use a transparent
way to see what the cops are actually
doing with the authority that we give
them I don't believe there's any
movement to make it official evidence
calm is actually run by Taser
International the core town is and so
yeah of course it is and so at that
point and there are other another thing
to remember like we chose taser
international profile there are all
kinds of other companies that are trying
to get into this space as well that have
similar products that have similar
systems setup to make these videos
available to prosecuting attorneys to
administrators and different police
departments etc and so like that's
that's a big issue as these things
become more promises to become more of
you Vic witness is trying to figure out
you know what sort of standardization
can we have to ensure that these videos
are not being abused or edited in the
loaded with you know what what's this
crazy not now I realize you're saying
which is like the they paid for this
system with public dollars and these
cops are working for the public yeah and
the video is being recorded as we're
paying their salaries and yet like we
don't have access to any of this is
totally but totally bizarre yeah yeah we
should be everybody should be able to
login and a question if we pay a private
company to like do it and to keep it we
should all have access or at least you
know we should have access within
certain condition I mean that rate mean
do you have access can you go to the
local police department be like I want
to see the log book I want to see every
report file today like there are limits
shins are where those limits come into
play and when you're at when you're
talking about 24 hour 12 hour
surveillance on the right of a person
like those limits are definitely need to
be adjusted well if if I had an
interaction with a police officer and it
was recorded they should give me a stub
at the end that's like here's your copy
you know I just had an interaction with
you the citizen you can go view the
video at ww prints at or chest yeah i
see i receive our surveillance receipt
the QR code that you scan and then it
takes you to a video don't use a QR code
I have some dignity alright alright this
is the police force Oh Matt what's so
you've got this sounds like what there
is what they're actually is going on is
that the police have created a market
for these systems right police
departments across the country are
saying we need this to protect ourselves
from brutality lawsuits to make it
appear as though our officers are more
accountable whether or not the systems
actually make them more accountable but
we need this technology for all this
host of reasons and a market is sprung
up to Phil to fill that need is there
any push to like make it a national
level thing to standardize these systems
to make it so that you know if you live
in illinois and there's one of these and
you move to montana and they're like
something will happen that you'll know
because right now I feel like people
think their interactions are the cops
are pretty much similar from place to
place to the go but I feel like adding
in a tremendous amount of video
recording changes that interaction I
mean it's part of a much larger question
like how how are different police
departments connected to one another and
in many ways they're not at all I did
not see a national push I did not see
any standardization outside of some
police departments I did not see a any
push to make this standardized on a
state level I did not see any push to
make it standardize on a federal level
and so you know I think that's going to
be the next step the ACLU there are
certain branches of the ACLU LC ACLU
that are looking into it and attempting
to establish policy but really it's it's
in a very early stage right now um and
so actually I'm curious by that what
does he still you say about this stuff
are they happy about it not happy about
it where's their wares their final stand
on whether or not police officers have
cameras
I was surprised by that the main person
i spoke with who this is that a
greenwood guy Scott Greenwood um he his
his recommendation is that these cameras
should be mandatory yeah that they
should be on every police officer and
that there should be a requirement that
like I said every interaction however
you define that interaction should be
recorded and so it was it was odd to
talk with him I assumed that he was
going to have problems with the
technology itself and with how the
technology is used but his the way he's
pushing it I mean he's saying you know
if we we need more of these on the
streets and once we have more of these
on the streets then we can have a
serious discussion about about some sort
of overarching policy to make them fair
so it's almost as if he was working for
Taser International I was talking yes it
was it was very much for them and he
said on a couple occasions that like
Taser International is really the
company that that hit the nail on the
head Erwin like this is the account of
this camera is really doing what it's
supposed to do and what dash cams have
failed to do and past which is record
police interactions from a police
officers point of view and so he's he's
he's all for it but he understands that
with that policy they can be abused
right what are the cops the ground
saying so that's what it's like we're
talking about this is a really high
level but like I have this image of like
a cop in mesa being like like you know
like casually hitting the button and
then like walking in the deli me like
what's going on here guys well like I
mean like one of the things that the
cops said and one of the reasons they
wanted it right was because citizens
effectively already have cameras right
like right and he showed that bust on
the bart subway platform and I've seen
dozens of subway videos in bus in New
York you know it's like where the
citizens I'll get their vantage point
and they all get to edit it and upload
it to youtube and like this is kind of a
they need to have their own PR outlet or
their own viewpoint on it you know they
need to be able to basically match the
technology that citizens have in the
palm of their hands but they got that
guy in the video we saw at the beginning
of this he didn't have a camera I mean
come on it was back was to the camp the
cops camera the whole time I was running
away that's right that's what I'm saying
I feel like when they when they deploy
this thing it's not it's going to be
when the when the suspect or the person
that they're in
they're questioning or pursuing doesn't
have a camera like specifically does not
that seems like the you know all the
videos that we see about that video I
think this is what's interesting about
that video that we watched and cops the
show they really paint a picture that
it's like action packed my police work
like this is what it's like being calm
and this is what we have to deal with
and if only you knew that like we're
chasing Scotty wouldn't stop and I
warned him 50 times I was gonna tase him
and finally I reluctantly tased him but
right yeah what the video didn't show is
a cop who kneeling on the ground begging
for forgiveness for that never happens
but there's far more routine bad cop
interactions right and he chases himself
yes I got a pen and allow you sad guilt
taste right it's a funny banned by the
way Gil teaser it's also gonna create I
mean just like like cops did you know
create sort of this cult of the hero I
mean you know like for anybody who
watches that and who's played a video
game it's like okay now you press X and
you jump over the fence and then like
you tell the guy not to go and then you
taste it you know it's just like it says
the first person perspective is so
loaded in our culture you know that's
gonna bring a lot of what I mean like
this may I bad cop interactions like I
don't know i went to the whole show i
want to hear bad cop interaction well
shall we all have stories like mine is i
went to school in the south side of
Chicago which is notorious for bad cop
interactions and one of my friends once
got caught for using a fake ID and the
cops slammed him against a car how old
were you guys at this point where he was
a legal age it was just a different name
that's not sure he was definitely not of
legal age right uh but he got slammed
against a car and he was really mad
about it right cuz I mean fine take my
fake ID do what I write to you but he's
like don't say me it's carding I bet
super annoyed and he asked the cop for
his badge number oh well in the cops was
that me know if you if you you can have
a badge number but the only place you're
going to get it is in a jail cell at a
police station and he was like you're
just gonna go you're going to leave the
situation right now and that there was
no like he was mad about it forever
right I'm pretty sure he considered like
going to law school just to remedy this
what's your friend kind of one he asked
the badge in the cop was like why have
to take you to jail to get the cop was
always gonna let him go the cop was like
literally is roughing in
because he could i right I and then that
that's like endemic like I there
countless videos my friends are all
activists in college and they're always
getting slammed around around like it
just happens that's yeah I mean you know
like well so my sister and her boyfriend
were just out there walking on the
street in brooklyn and she wasn't riding
her bike she was like sitting on her
bike and he was pushing it you know
they're like taking this romantic stroll
together and this cop like pulls up into
cars like you're riding your bike on the
sidewalk like i'm gonna issue a ticket
she's like give me a break i'm not
really riding it were blocked from our
house you know they get into a
conversation they get into an argument
my sister's boyfriend spends the night
in jail right right and so my fam when
my family heard this story you know
they're all like this is as soon as the
cop tells you to do something you do it
you're like grovel and you're like
totally submissive and then usually you
get off like that is how you respond to
police and some people either can't do
that or don't want to do that but that
is like what i have always been taught
and i feel like is that usually the
smartest yeah play well I mean that
veers into a hole you know other topic
about how different people being raised
in different socio-economic strata if
you will like learn different lessons
about how to interact with the cops
right and that was kind of the whole
thing that came up during the Trayvon
Martin you know that that whole debate
and and and that tragedy that occurred
and so you know I yeah I've had
interactions with the police as well and
you know I you know a law-abiding
citizen now I am now yeah as opposed to
right I haven't always been in my hole
and the hole on you know I'd be lying if
i said i abided every single law
everywhere that i've lived every single
day of my life but I generally break in
like four laws right now I thought so
yeah but which one in a in a world where
I have google glass and the cops have
this technology everyone you know and
maybe this is why the ACLU and those
guys feel like it's a good thing
everyone should feel empowered to just
be honest and like fought and like do
what is appropriate right so but is that
Matt let me ask you is that just the
nanny state like run completely amok
like we're all just recording each other
at all times so that we can like refer
back to some canonical record of our
interactions and like make it might make
up post xfast the judgment about who is
right and wrong is that the nanny state
or is that just the state of affairs
yeah we want to
he said she said clever clever bastard
he saw she saw right no but I that is
the truth it's the truth that on video
as art as our to face cameras tell it ah
right face to face face to face and
argue yeah and then you give video
evidence there for both of your point of
view and then you can discuss what
reality was what you need is a panel of
three judges whoever gets more you male
and they all live in water filled tanks
and then they decide what actually
happened and they release assume they
have to be mutants precognition Newton's
from the future exactly good so do we
want to talk about I have a good segue
from here that was doing other stuff so
I mean like it you know I wrote this
story about drones and in doing that
learned about some technology that you
know the military uses and which police
departments are interested in using and
you know we're talking about just being
able to see everything at all times the
military has this technology called
Argus which police are thinking about
deploying at a you know a slightly less
advanced level and it's basically a
drone that would fly over a city and be
able to record everything every car
everything that moves they would have a
complete record of that from every day
and in a certain sense that would be a
good thing you know like think about all
the people who are exonerated by DNA
evidence you know it would be like I
wasn't there that day you know I was
somewhere else well maybe this
technology could show you that and it
might maybe it would make easier to
catch people but when I talked to the
ACLU about this actually you know they
had kind of had the opposite reaction to
what they did with Matt which is to say
we don't want to live in a world where
the police are watching us at all times
just because they can like that's not
okay so well so what the thing about the
drones and we should this is this is
literally it just changes who has the
cameras and what the cameras are doing
right I think cameras if I was just
talking to Paul Miller and his big line
lately as technology is fundamentally
inert it's what you do with it so it's
like fine you can put cameras everywhere
and you can you can load the world with
cameras and point them at everything the
question is who decides what we're
putting the cameras at and who gets to
watch it later right and and when you're
watching it like what do you how do you
decide to act on it and I think that the
key difference with the cop cams the
axon flex cameras and like drones
everywhere is that the axon flex cameras
you're saying there are response to
their fundamentally consumer technology
being repurposed right it's all stuff
that we recognize we understand and when
you see a cop wearing camera on his
glasses like first nerd top and then
secondly like you know what's going to
happen right right your your balance of
power in that relationship hasn't
fundamentally changed because you can
just plot a camera to when it's a cop
with a drone and you don't know how high
the drum is in the sky what the drones
doing whether or not the drone can
launch a missile at you the balance of
power is completely changed like and now
it's now you're you're literally like
looking at a faceless technologically
superior Authority force that is telling
you we're watching you and judging you
and that changes your behavior i think
way more dramatically sharing cop cans
hmm but but but i think it at a certain
point it is like where do you draw the
line right like it's how much of a
surveillance state do we want to have an
effect already you know both of us grew
up in the Chicago area and and our lived
in the Chicago area and I you know know
that that the city government there has
like what some of the most the biggest
camera camera network I love it in the
world I get more tickets at chicago
street lights then any other place I've
ever lived it's like I go home now and I
you look at a red light in Chicago it
gives you a ticket and yet Chicago has
like the worst epidemic exam gun
violence in the country so it's not
working to discourage crimes not in
Chicago tily not so so even even with
that pervasive all seeing all those
all-seeing eyes or you know same thing
same thing in New York I think they
introduce something that was like all in
Midtown there was a bunch of cameras you
know I whether it's on a drone or on the
street I mean the question is where does
the surveillance stop like does do
people feel should people feel like
there's any place that they can go that
they're not being watched or have we
crossed a point right now where like you
should just assume that somebody's
taping you at well so that's I mean I
think in the UK like most people just
assumed rather being watching tvs in
London but that's being watched by
that's a network of private camera
operators right and they're not linked
and there's no central authority as much
as I'm sure the British government would
love for them all to be linked so they
could you know pervasively watch
everyone
well what's happening in the States
particularly with like domestic drones
and like we're going to fly drones
around and like the cops will have
drones and learn right random government
agencies will have drones like that
stuff that is starting to get linked
that is starting to be like I in the sky
Big Brother stuff so you actually just
went to a hearing an FAA hearing well I
other revising use of drones I listened
in on let's let's be clear was I
listened in on an FAA it was a public
call 24 for any citizen in America to
participate in this colony people
participated odd doesn't it was it
doesn't it was tough anyone in America
yeah and dozens participant of course
you know that that was actually more
participation than than I thought and
that's something that a lot of the
citizens on on the on the phone during
that call pointed out to was that you
know they felt like you know they hadn't
heard that this was even going on and
and or that you know it wasn't well
advertised that the FAA was doing this
but essentially the FAA was seeking to
gain public comment and response to this
proposed privacy policy it's going to
have for when it opens the door for
commercial drones to begin flying
basically anywhere in US air space into
2015 so it's it's trying to kind of so
here's my question about a drone and I'm
actually like very curious for this
because I love planes like and I I would
love to have a drone mm-hmm sure I think
it'd be pretty sweet to have a drive and
if you are a drone manufacturer please
call me i would love to play a card ran
but what is a drone like fundamentally
is it is it a quadcopter i can answer
that question I mean right now the word
is used very loosely yeah so the public
has a sort of conception in their mind I
think fueled by mainstream media of a
drone which is the predator drones you
know the stuff we use in Afghanistan
this guy right so nobody in America is
allowed to own and fly that that isn't
why that's why am I not allowed to own
and fly that and I ask you President
Barack Obama as a man who loves things
that both fly and explode right why
can't I had one so you could fly a
miniaturized version of that
that had no weapons on it you could fly
like a under 55 our g plane right so so
it's complicated so again I would say
when we talk about drones when we
talking about the predator or what I
just really were talking about as
unmanned aerial vehicles right and that
could be an RC helicopter it could be a
Predator drone is something that doesn't
have a person in it that flies and then
some of them are semi-autonomous meaning
they can adjust for wind they can return
to a GPS home you know like they can
take a no to go out and return to the
same spot they're smart and then really
what we want to talk about what we mean
what we hope what we were going to get
to and there's what Chris Anderson
defines distinctly as a drone is
something that's capable of completely
autonomous flight I say go pick me up a
taco then go drop off this package and
then come back here yeah and it does
that without moving anything even the
predator can't really do that right so
we haven't gotten to that point of sense
and avoid yeah we're getting there but
like but even the dress that's there's
what we're getting to right and what we
have right and then there's like what we
have is actually a huge spectrum and
people think of non drone things by this
definition is clearly being dressed
right yeah I mean you know because
basically drones now are everything from
a model hill a model airplane or
helicopter all the way up to a Predator
drone and in between the stuff that's
really interesting are the things like
that we reported about the Phantom yeah
you know which can go well over a
thousand feet it can fly over half a
mile away once it's half a mile away it
can pilot it cell phone here this
thing's awesome and so it can do a lot
of semi autonomous flight and you know
the people who produce this well they're
gonna they're perfectly willing to sell
them to consumers now yeah but they
would also tell you they think would be
a good idea if you needed a license to
fly something like this you don't know
and so they're happy to sell them to you
but they would ride that oh look I mean
look this is crazy we're flying over
Austin you know we have a camera mounted
on there if you didn't know what you're
doing and you flew into a power line or
you went too low you know you could hurt
someone is there's some physical danger
and and risks posed by these things in
that that was something that actually a
lot of the callers on this FA a call
that would that I listened to the other
week was they were private pilots like
guys that fly manned aircraft you know
the tiny little prom prop planes or
propeller planes or Cessnas and they
were worried about okay oh my gosh
FAA when you let all these drones start
flying into the air space in 2015 we're
worried they're going to collide with us
because it's going to be a bunch of
inexperienced drone pilots flying these
things around and they nilay patel yes
drown draw lying around and you're
drawing on drunk droning and you're
you're not gonna have a second thought
about flying it anywhere because you're
not yet not even a first thought not
even a first not even on a massage
around drunk man yeah I'm just straight
up side yeah I mean I think the answer
is really boring it's what Paul said you
know the technology is sort of you know
it's sort of morally neutral it's like
you could fly a drone as someone in my
article did on a search-and-rescue
mission and save somebody's life you
could fly a drone in Afghanistan and use
it to kill terrorists or use it to kill
civilians and you could fly a drone
responsibly irresponsibly you know it's
about the regulations we have in place
in and how people are using the
technology although i think that there's
some interesting questions we can talk
about now about sort of what is
acceptable so for example in my store we
talked about this famous case florida vs
riley and this brings us back to the
cops if the cops are flying in a
helicopter yeah and they have to be
flying over 400 feet and they're way
above your house they're now in sort of
public airspace yep so if I'm flying
over your backyard which would normally
be private and I couldn't look into
without a warrant I'm flying over it and
I can see down into it I don't need a
search warrant and so people have been
arrested like this the cops fly over
they see their growing marijuana in
their greenhouse and they can go and get
a search warrant arrest those people so
that brings us you know that's sort of
the legal precedent the Supreme Court
said that was okay so now it's like if I
have a drone can I fly it over the house
of someone I have you know can I stock
somebody with this like as long as I'm
in public airspace as long as you're
about 400 feet I mean it would seem like
the Supreme Court supports that at least
at least for the you know the the police
and civil agencies what so you know
what's interesting about this is that
I'm what's built into that fundamentally
is that the supreme court assumes the
police I've got of limited resources so
they're only doing things is a have to
for some reason and I think that there's
also like hierarchy in a police
department so like if you're like the
rogue cop and you're like that hot Bob
right is hot I'm going to put the drone
above his house but like your superior
the Commandant
to be like no like you have to catch
drug dealers or something with our
limited resources like flooding a market
or flooding a community that so now
everybody has the same resource and
there's no hierarchy changes the terms
of that decision dramatically no
absolutely because you could fly a drone
above a city all day for a fraction of
the cost of like a two-hour helicopter
ride yeah and so it definitely creates a
it's a technology that enables
ubiquitous and constant surveillance as
opposed to a helicopter where like they
knew that they thought this guy had pot
in his backyard they couldn't get a
search warrant so like let's do a
flyover and see if we can see something
and they did write the helicopter is a
much more limited resource to neil eyes
point then uh you know I'm gonna drown
in a quadcopter yeah by the way I'm
getting one of those pair of quadcopters
as soon as the show's over and I'm
surveilling the hell out of all of the
rank just constant low-level you guys
seen the life anti-drone hoodie I could
be wearing that yeah like makes you
invisible to the eye don't but then he
would know that you were at work and you
would you know make it I mean look at
this thing it's amazing the Phantom is
very I mean the difference is like there
are clear and this is where I think it
comes back to the cops it's always going
to be the cops it's we're sort of fine
with a huge network of private cccam
CCTV cameras there in New York they're
pervasive in Europe right everybody in
Russia has a dashcam to prevent against
police corruption right to prevent bad
actors from dealing with them and that's
fine that's like decentralized it makes
sense as soon as you like put them in
the air and get them out of your
physical space or your property or your
person now it's like now you're using
that technology to directly encroach on
other people in a way that only the
state has previously been able to do so
like another you know the other case is
the surveillance case that you need to
you know you need a warrant the cops
can't come to your grow operation and
point an infrared camera and be like as
a slight right because the courts say
they can't see that with their eyes so
if you're going to use an additional
piece of technology like you need a
warrant to go do it right and so it's
like we have all these lines we draw all
these lines around the cops because
we're like this is this is where your
behavior is prescribed but we've never
tionally not done that around ourselves
right because other human beings can do
it for us yeah right like that's we
don't want the government to say like
you can only fly your plane in the air
this this high-flying point and that's
like weird like we do weird stuff with
it yeah I mean I think that that is
what's creating such an interesting
environment right now with drones is
that the police and government agencies
are more or less explicitly banned from
using them in most states but hobbyists
are not and the technology is getting so
much better so much faster so cheap now
people are flying you know more powerful
craft the police and they can easily put
cameras mount cameras on them and record
that stuff but we need what we need is
Matt strata do a follow-up piece and
people are just follow cops and ice
around with drones right we were talking
okay can we step back for just a second
and yak about what the FAA's response to
those questions was I mean what sort of
regulations are they talking about to
make sure that you don't have just
swarms of drones everywhere running into
one another and in to assess lyst yeah
no it's a great question i think that
that was part of the you know what was
revealed on the call was either they
don't have great answers for that right
now and they're working on it the
problem is the FAA has traditionally not
dealt with issues like privacy so like
the safety issue you know they could say
maybe you don't you can't fly a drone
with an X number of miles of an airport
or commercial airspace that we know is
highly trafficked for instance but that
they haven't said any of that stuff yet
basically all they've done is released
so there's going to be six drone test
sites that they're going to you know
basically figure out how to start
integrating drones into US airspace and
there were there was a contest for air
fields around the country to become one
of these six sites and a lot of you know
a lot of different places a lot of
different government agencies want to
want to test the drones out there want
to be a pioneer in this effort but the
FA so far hasn't hasn't released very
many regulations on what publicly at
least on what will happen at those test
sites it's only released a pretty loose
privacy policy that has like four points
and it's just you know it's basically
like if you're going to fly drones at
any one of these six sites you need your
own privacy policy and it needs to
comply with all existing state laws
which is like obvious you know there's
that John your own privacy policies
right yeah
that's that's that's what they said in
in the FAA's privacy policy they said
you need your own privacy policy and
that's gonna be the private you need to
bring your eyes it's it's byop do i do a
pap but yeah I I talked to some mother
be OB yopp is amazing UIL PP that's
pretty good yeah I talked to some
sources and I would agree with what you
said which is that the FAA basically is
going to be completely hands-off when it
comes to privacy they are going to focus
only on safety that's going to be what
they're going to regulate and they are
not they're going to let the courts
decide about privacy they're not going
to touch that and so basically what's
going to happen is we're going to get to
a point where commercial use is allowed
and TMZ is going to have three or four
drones following every a-list celebrity
you know ten feet away at all times of
day and one of those drones is going to
crash into somebody or catch something
really nasty on camera and then there's
going to be a lawsuit and then we're
going to figure it out you know we're
gonna it's going to work its way through
the courts well I mean I think it'll be
before that and I really do because I
mean there are court cases I mean if you
look at property law or torts right
these like classic areas of law they get
way in the weeds real fat man we've been
litigating these cases for hundreds of
years like if I'm your neighbor my tree
grows high enough to block the Sun
coming through your window but you can
just sue me and be like cut down your
tree can I cut down your tree you cannot
cut down my tree I can't physically go
over there and cut not to part the
branch that's on my side you can cut
that you can cut the branches on your
side okay right but like what the keep
that a matter thing to do is like sue me
and be like that takes too long tree is
like what it takes too long but like the
first time TMZ puts a drone and Britney
Spears assuming that she hasn't signed a
contract to be purposely first first
drone reality show the first drone
surveillance target but as soon as that
happens there's gonna be a lawsuit and
immediate lawsuit right uh without any
of the bad stuff ok I see crashing right
just is this acceptable because they're
right there are torts and there are sort
of laws in place about peeping toms and
expectations of privacy and so as soon
as the private citizen right parks our
drone outside my window I'm gonna I'm
going to file lawsuit just say I have a
reasonable expectation of privacy that
you're invading right you know you're
evading my personal space and within so
that that reason watch that's that
the thing right that's as to the
government right you have an expert okay
so it's different it's different for
from a private citizen right but they're
they're also like it's like the First
Amendment only applies the government I
can call your speech whenever I rat so
speaking of a man I want you to keep
that in mind let's let's take this to
the next level yeah and Carl heard this
on the on the call with the FAA and
people have raised this question in some
of the interviews I've had if I can buy
a gun legally and i can buy a drone
legally can i put my gun on my drone and
yes use it as a weapon am i allowed to
do that drone gun yeah obviously know
what they didn't answer they didn't
answer and the FAA call was not for them
to answer any questions let's be clear
they were just receiving public comment
many of the comments were about like
really good ways to put gun I want to
proton am I join that one guy did
specifically say I got a comment this
would be sweet right yeah that's a
lawyer in Missouri said I specifically I
want to use he didn't say wanted to arm
his drones but he did say that he should
be able to use them for self-protection
and he said that every American should
have a drone and that that would
eliminate that that that would eliminate
the need for all other weapons I really
said I want you guys to go if you're if
you're at a computer go to youtube and
type in drone paintball yeah and you
could see you know a drone a guy rigged
up at home with a guy just asked and
maybe this is just getting a little why
is it that that the gun argument is
always that everybody should be armed
like fully all the time cuz the only
there's no there's actually there on is
there no balance in this world all or
not like it's like one gun or no got
it's like an one person thought of
putting a gun on a drone now everyone
should have heavily-armed roads that's
the only way please yeah please got it
there must be some middle ground
mutually assured mr. why are you drawn
so thoroughly to these slippery slopes
and then why must fling yourself down
like oh man the slope is slippery I
better grease myself up don't worry a
drone will be there on the other end to
save and or shoot you a break every
wondrin to watch you a cop hitting his
chest over and over again to bypass the
30 second audio delay and another
another drenna put your misery there you
go this is just how technology works you
know I was I was thinking about this
today and thinking about drones and
surveillance and it's like people the
people who invent the technology think
that they're going to be helping us
right and then somebody gets their hands
on the technology and turns it into like
a weapon right always finds a way to
misuse it the the guy from the nobel
peace prize is named invented dynamite
you thought it would like end all wars
and it just made things worse like you
know it's right now I was like that it
is cool that everybody has take a
dynamite now that's yeah I mean I feel
safe everyone with me yeah yeah I feel
so much safer right uh let me ask you
this Matt and here's my question for you
so from the the police perspective and I
know that you you mostly focused on the
head cams I mean are they as interested
in drones and using that stuff as they
are in the head cams or is that just
like a whole different basket for them I
get the impression that's completely
different really a lot of the people i
spoke with in mesa were a lot of the
cops i spoke with and they said so they
put us in touch with a bunch of people
who had already used these cameras so
they were comfortable with them and they
put us in touch with people who were in
the department who are familiar with
them and so these people are comfortable
with these cameras to find them but the
impression I got from for people who
were not outfitted with these counter
that they didn't want them really yeah
like it's going to just add another
layer of bureaucracy to my already
extremely bureaucratic job where I have
to fill out reports and now addition to
writing a report at the end of my of my
shift or whatever however many reports
are right i'm now gonna have to take
care of labeling this video is just a
pain in the ass and so the idea of
adding you know drone use on top police
officers shift i imagine probably go
over very well well you know what's
interesting is it in other context the
robotic or autonomous like assistant for
a government function like we love it so
like let yeah we should give robots to
fire departments right like obvious fire
fighting robots we should definitely do
that right the bomb squad should
definitely have one of those like bomb
robots yeah no question about it like we
should augment or otherwise replace
human beings in all sorts of situations
of the government is the IRS should
definitely have a computer I don't know
what they're doing right now I'm
abacuses yeah but it's weird that it's
it's whenever they interact with the
public you want
that person to be there and you want
that person accountable in a way that
doesn't change that balance of power
well Mayor Bloomberg was saying and you
sort of disagree with this before you
know a camera on a building is the same
as a drone in the sky and it's coming
you know he basically said you know deal
with it but I think that if you look
around the country the majority of
states 30 of them have actually enacted
legislation that would prevent police
departments and government employees
from using drones so I think the popular
opinion is that domestic drones for law
enforcement we don't want them and the
legislators are responding to that and I
would argue having you know done a
pretty extensive reporting on like their
capabilities that that's a bad thing in
the sense that fire departments or
police departments could really use
these to save lives and that we need to
be able to use them in a very limited
and well-regulated way for law
enforcement you know that if we cut off
our access to this technology between
even between now and 2015 when the FAA
is supposed to return their you know
their their rules of the road um alright
that looks is but this is what Matt was
saying about the helmet cams not helmet
cams the comp cams um glass even the
ACLU right Matt correct me if wrong even
in ACA you're saying we need more of
them out there so that we can craft an
appropriate set of regulations around
them so like for the drones it's like
well we have to build a critical mass of
drones in the sky before we know where
the boundaries are and that's me is way
more uncomfortable than comp cams right
it's fine give all the cops cameras
we'll see how it shakes out like the the
Delta between normal behavior and
wherever they end up will probably
relatively small and then we can like do
something to fix it with drones it's
like we're going to put a bunch of
drones in the sky the one lawyer in
Alabama is going to put a gun on it
missouri missouri he's definitely going
to our Miss Brown and then like sell
kits so that everybody can arm their
drones right and that's like you're
rapidly down the wrong slope before
you've ever had a chance to regulate it
but if you try to regulate it ahead of
the time you're gonna end up with states
banning drones and firefighters can't ya
know you make a good point which is that
uh right the glasses camera is not so
different from a cell phone but a drone
in the sky is extremely different and it
has it just has way more capability
there's nobody attached to it and
there's no risk to you know flying in
any way right which is why they're so
popular for for warfare because like I
mean and that's the another interesting
sort of like most American citizens
support drones overseas you run
Afghanistan but they don't want them
here where they want them overseas where
they let Americans stay out of danger we
don't want them here threatening our own
civil liberties and right privacy but
you know I think in this case I mean you
know about this as a lawyer it's just
that the states are going to be the
laboratories where we're going to figure
this out right and like some states like
Carl said are pushing to have the test
sites and think that drones will be a
big boon for their economy and so some
states will have lots of drones and
other states won't and once we see how
that goes for two years people's minds
may change but you know state that's why
I actually want to say to mind yeah
that's why I wanted to ask you to is
like I mean are we gonna end up with
like a hodgepodge of legislation then
around around the country because
everybody's figuring it out on their own
terms and so a court yeah Sam is gonna
rule this way in accordance that's the
Federalist way and in this case I think
some people feel that's a feature not a
bug like that's not a bad thing right
yeah you me cuz you want the laboratory
right you want you want some states to
go join crazy and see what happens right
and you want the other states to be like
we're going to go slower right until
overwhelming yet but I think what's
actually most interesting is what you
said about drones overseas right because
when it's a war we're like fine we're
going to go impose war on another
population and we'll do it at a remove
right so our soldiers will wear khakis
and polos and sit in a basement in Las
Vegas and they'll kill things over there
right in like there's no outrage about
it it's really weird like yeah that's
right you seen reports on this for us
like every week right like you know look
we're gonna buy another 50 drones and
like blow up everything over there well
i mean i'm gonna i'm sure some people
will think that this day me makes me a
sort of you know war criminal but were
longer if you look at the statistics
which were recently released you know
over the last 10 years and since the
obama administration took over the
number the percentage of civilian
casualties you know with each of these
strikes has really decreased and so i
think there's a valid argument to be
made that when you look at you know the
casualties on both sides of boots on the
ground versus the casualties of drones
in the air perhaps drones are the most
efficient you know i think they
feel wrong because we don't have to put
anyone in danger but they may be the
most effective way to fight terrorism
and no i'm not at least innocent lives I
don't agree that what I'm saying is that
once you once our government has sold
that like this it'd be like if your
Police Department on today tank right I
mean cuz they all do and we've actually
runs stories about how they're buying
these like heavily militarized vehicles
they did share they probably don't need
but like if you are like the local
police want to spend money on a tank
they really want to take and they say
they need one most people like no yeah
but they don't they definitely don't
need a tank right right like they are
not fighting a war in the drones like
the drone program has become so tied to
our notion of war and like how we're
fighting and effectively which may or
may not be true right seems to be
leaning true um that I think when people
are like and now the cops will have a
tank yeah actually the tank is an
unmanned flying plane that can stay in
the air forever it's like isn't that
worse than a tank like is that ultimate
like wouldn't you rather they have the
tank and they like they're always
authorization polishing the tank I like
looking at the tank talking about when
you're gonna go use the toilet they
never sneak up on you yeah either out
the tank is like yeah this is gonna go
to some really weird places but when I
was in Texas when I was in Austin take
us there I saw a number of college
students testing out a spoofer that they
had which was based on technology the
Iranians used and it was very low-tech
to take down very high tech yeah and so
criminals or whoever if I want to
protect my own privacy I could have
something over my house that basically
Bork's the GPS of the drone it's like if
you fly a drone over my house which is
my private property like yeah it's gonna
take down your drum you know I mean like
we're gonna enter a very wild space next
couple of years with these things yeah I
wild drone west but I mean you know that
I really want to drown like what I don't
want the cops to have a drone I want the
cops to always have cameras that are on
but I want to drown sounds good I think
that affair I would you should bring it
back onto the verge cast when you uh
when you get one there's one watching
right now oh that's what's filming the
drone has a gun yeah drone has a
makeshift God dashed yeah I I did want
to say before we close out i mean the
issue about you know this disconnect
between domestic drones and overseas is
it's more than just a raw numbers of
fighting
war for instance in terms of casualties
I mean it's it's it's about morality
right that's the that's the thing that
people get hung up on where it's like do
you value a human life less because it's
not you that's pulling the trigger it's
or you are pulling the trigger but it's
an indirect weapon system that is you
know flying thousands of feet above the
sky and eliminating the target and you
never have to see that target even a
sniper from you know the video a mile
away is is is is more connected to the
life that he's taking then a drone
operator some would argue and and I
would I would you know put myself in
that camp because there is a level of
abstraction there with the technology so
that's I think part of the issue that
the uncomfortability that people have
with with drone usage right but I guess
if my argument would be that this brings
us back to the cop cameras and seeing
how their jobs actually work or the
cameras in the farms and seeing what
actually goes on it's like you're just
seeing now what we people war has always
been like like a bombing in World War
two or you know a soldier shooting
somebody is really not different it's
just now it's all in video right and and
you could see it and you can do it
remotely and so that that sort of
changes the way we think about it
alright well we have to wrap Matt you
have any last thoughts before we have to
wrap up here i am so i have a whole
bunch of questions but oh and for a
later it hit me give me give me your top
two uh well actually just one I think it
started discussion which is you know
what exactly are police police forces
like local police forces thinking you're
thinking they're gonna do with drums
other than you know looking at a growth
or trying to them know they get the same
thing is II think here were they able to
do the same thing they'll do with their
super sweet tank which is habit what I
mean that's isn't that the answer I mean
like it lied around yeah fly it around
the extend force without having to like
put people in the way in a previous
drone Senate hearing they had a guy with
a sheriff's department and and he was
saying that they've actually used it to
try and and they quickly found in a
tragic case but an elderly woman who
went missing they found her body quicker
using the drone because an apparent
presumably she died of you know natural
causes or not she wasn't murdered she
wasn't killed and and so they found you
know and and and and the
point he was trying to make was that
know if we had found her sooner and we
could have using this drone then we
could have with dogs or people on the
ground yeah you know it could have say
it's a verla that's definitely drones
could act could and should be used to
save lives with search and rescue period
end of story as far as I'm concerned
yeah drones and I just want to clip that
for cops teen this is added same drones
good roads can use drones can save lives
and I think Matt any what was your other
question you have another one and well
now how exactly would that work so you
drones are flying around looking for
looking for people buying on the ground
in in odd circumstances and that will
have to I don't know he didn't he didn't
specify you know how we eating going to
detail the great detail about how they
how they used it that was just his that
was his point if you can read my drone
story there's a search-and-rescue story
in there you can yeah we can learn about
and we should we'll have links we have a
bunch of stories and all the stuff that
we've been doing again it's why we did
the show even exhausted number of
stories and this we wanted to spend the
time doing it unfortunately however we
have to wrap up the drones are coming
for all of us now stay tuned top shelf
will be on at five thirty eastern or
whatever time zone you're in I don't
know because I'm remotely located right
now and not actually here I'm a drone
body alright so top shelf a 530 stay
tuned for that you can reach all of us
there's all kinds of ways to get a hold
of us to attend is ben popper on twitter
Carl France and carl franzen Twitter
Matt Stroud you have the worst twitter
handle of all time which is yeah stir it
out it's like 5 s's 3ds right it's my
last name points every every letter r r
oo uu DD yeah it is terrible i'm sorry
our daughter to you bro ah pretty
difficult you can leave a comment on our
post you can you know send an email to
somebody forge cast of The Verge calm
I'm told or you can just send an email
to one of your friends or leave a
comment or talk about it whatever Thank
a vine shop make a fine I would love
seeing a drone if you look at our own
vine if you could hit me with a drone
vine that would be great it I July up
one last that I do want to say a little
self promo here the verge has been
nominated for
five different webby awards which we're
very proud of who you should go vote
because there's like a regular the ones
that give out and there's people's
choice we have a post up on the site you
should look at it if you feel compelled
