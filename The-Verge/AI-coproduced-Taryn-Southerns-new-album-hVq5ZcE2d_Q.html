ones Taryn southern is an online
personality who you might know from her
YouTube channel or when she was a
contestant on American Idol these days
Taryn is interested in emerging tech
which has led to her current projects
recording a pop album these two things
might not sound related but her album
has a twist instead of writing all the
songs herself Taryn used artificial
intelligence to help generate percussion
melodies and chords this makes it one of
the first albums of its kind a
collaboration of sorts between AI and
human music making AI software has come
a long way in the past few years to the
point where it can Co produce an album
like Terrance as a musician and producer
the idea of AI being able to do what I
do is freaky I met up with Taryn to find
out about the process of collaborating
with software maybe it's not as crazy as
it sounds do you view a AI when you're
working with these platforms as a tool
or a collaborator hmm
I've been using their word tool a lot
just in talking with you but I do view
it more as a collaborator and that it is
giving me source inspiration material so
a piano doesn't just give me its notes
and I would think more of a piano as a
tool yeah a tool is something we can
wield and a collaborator is something
you work with something we work with so
yes I would say AI feels much more like
a collaborator carburetor and a tool
because I can also still tell it what to
do right you have power over it yeah for
now yeah Taryn uses several different AI
programs to write her music including
software from IBM Google and ampere most
of these systems work using deep
learning networks a type of AI that's
reliant on analyzing large amounts of
data basically you feed the software
tons of source material from dance hits
to disco classics which it then analyzes
to find patterns
picks up on things like chords length
tempo and how notes relate to one
another
learning from all of this input so it
can create its own melodies how is it
affected your songwriting um well for
one I have a new language around music
that I didn't have before because I'm
not a musician I don't I know very very
little about music theory so I
understand minor chords and major chords
and I can plunk out a few keys on the
piano but my musical knowledge really
ends there and now using a I am I'm
writing my lyrics and my vocal melodies
to the the actual music and using that
as the source of inspiration so what are
the key differences between the
different platforms you've been using
the key differences are usability Watson
and magenta you've you've got to go and
github and sort of unpack the developer
language and I had to definitely brush
up on my skills with the help of some of
the engineers on these teams so I think
that that's a potential barrier to entry
with some of these tools is just that it
does require some some coding knowledge
ampere is I think the easiest it's front
facing the interface is super simple and
intuitive how did you find amber amber
was the first one I found because there
when I went online to search what tools
are out there I knew I knew of Watson
but at the time they hadn't released an
open source or public facing software so
I searched to see what else was
available and the first article that
came up my music focused on amber so I
went to their website and it was super
easy to use
most AI programs kick out MIDI and MIDI
is sort of like sheet music and that
it's instructions for how a melody
should be played it's not audio it's a
protocol amber builds tracks from
pre-recorded samples and spits out
actual audio not MIDI data meaning
there's something to listen to right
away from there you can change the tempo
the key or swap out instruments so you
can start with something played in one
style and change out the set of
instruments for it completely
different sound this audio can then be
exported as a whole or as individual
layers of instruments which are known as
stems stems can then be modified further
within a digital audio workstation so
there are a couple of other AI music
making platforms that are out there but
what differentiates
ampar for us we are like we've always
focused on speed quality and control and
control is a huge element especially as
an artist what do you want to manipulate
we're one of the few that you can
manipulate you know tempo key in
instrumentation you know you're like I
don't like this piano I'd rather have a
guitar do that or I want this other
piano in place of that so it's a lot
more of you working with it and then
creating the final product from there
what's the process then to get those
sounds into
amp√®re we own all our own audio content
we sample all our own instruments note
by note because we want artists to be
able to manipulate that so I have to
record a guitar every note every
possible thing it can do so that we can
recreate a performance from that versus
having a loop because we don't use loops
in anything whatsoever
everything is note to note terrons album
doesn't just rely on artificial
intelligence she also works with other
humans including her producer Ethan they
invited me to one of their recording
sessions for her song new world so I
could see how producers work with AI in
the studio
I like that with the AI material that
you are given new ideas that you
wouldn't come with up with on your own
but that you still have the freedom to
shape those ideas into something that
makes sense to you so there's still
creative expression involved and the end
result still feels like something that
represents me and Taryn and so I like
that to get a sense of the difference
between wearing AI song starts and the
finished product here is an early ampere
export
and here is the final arrangement by
Tara
a lot of times when other musicians come
in that have done a demo on a guitar
they come in they lay down that guitar
track and then we talk about what do we
want to build upon that whereas in this
case Taryn is coming in with her guitar
is Vai so she presents that and then we
talk about well what what do we see this
turning into and then we can add
elements around that and and restructure
it so it's still similar to the more
traditional sense of artists coming in
in many ways like music is the highest
form of expression that humanity has
it's like our last bastion last Bastian
and I understand that and it does force
change upon people in some form or
another and maybe some of that will be
bad like I like I said I can't predict
the future
I do think it's break people out of
their comfort zones and potentially
results in new forms of music which
could be seen as negative for other
forms of music like did did the rise of
hip hop and EDM take away from pop it
changed it changed it it changed it and
now we infuse EDM and hip hop into top
pretty pie right yeah and so I think
we'll see something similar
