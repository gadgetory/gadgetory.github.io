miles away from the office so I'm
currently on vacation in Iceland and I
just had to do a little bit of work a
day before I left on my trip I was able
to get my hands on the new DJI Mavic 2
unit I had with me was the Maverick 2
pro but will cover both the pro and the
zoom in this video I attempted to film
this in Iceland but the audio
yeah hidden wasn't great but now we're
doing this in the studio which works out
better since I had more time to test out
all the new and/or upgraded features -
now with over 8 hours of flight time
with 2 Mavic twos I'm ready to tell you
why these drones are changing aerial
photography the pneumatic tube Pro and
zoom are slightly bigger than the old
Matic pro Platinum you really won't
notice the difference at first but what
you will notice that it is heavier than
what you'd expect otherwise you're
looking at the same foldable design will
give a dramatic which makes it a good
portable drone it also has the same
props than in the Mac Pro platinum
meaning this drone is relatively quiet
one
the difference between these two is a
sensor size and B the zoom has well zoom
real optical zoom so lets you get twice
as close without losing quality
lastly the gimbal and both seems to be
really robust so you might get away to
crashing this thing that's something I
really don't have an interest in testing
but there are plenty of other youtubers
who love destroying gadgets for your
pleasure filming with the pro has been
great from connectivity various modes
and most importantly superb image
quality the one in CMOS sensor were
housed about optics doesn't make a big
difference when it comes to video and
photo quality ability to shoot 10 bit 4k
video and dialog truly helps to maximize
when you get out of it to zoom on the
other hand has a smaller sensor and it
doesn't have a true flat profile it does
set a sin alike which is what we signed
a Mac here but it just doesn't retain
the same amount of data you should be
aware that however the only way to shoot
dialog on the pro is if you're shooting
in h.265 which in theory is a better
conversion system but in practice isn't
widely about to be it reviewing footage
or a premiere am i relatively fast might
be pro has been a real struggle and i
had to create proxies for all of my
files
the maverick 2 pro is the first DJI
drone with HDR and it does make some
difference in exposure for certain
scenes but truthfully the log looks just
better to me also quick note I tend to
leave my white balance to auto just to
see what the camera chooses and to me it
seems to be a bit on the warmer side
although the colors do look very
accurate second out I didn't have
neutral density filters for this drone
so some shots didn't come out as good as
they could have CJ says the end these
are coming for both units but it'd be a
lot easier if those were just built in
from the start alright let's taste like
dealloc footage a bit more when you're
shooting in very low ISO 100 or 200
you'll get really clean footage
noticeable noise even when you zoomed in
you're still getting very good results
when bumping up the ISO obviously more
noise introduced especially in the
shadows it's more noise than you'd
expect from this drone but it's still
not as bad as where you get from the
smaller sensor that's on the Maverick to
zoom nevertheless footage again on the
matte
- Pro is the best you can get from a
drone of this size one more quick note
unlike the Phantom 4 Pro v2 which can
shoot 4k at 60 frames per second the
Maverick 2 pro can shoot 4k up to 30 not
a deal-breaker for me since I tend to
shoot at 24 frames and both can shoot
slow my at 120 frames at 1080p and I
only mentioned this I can have an excuse
to put this clip in the video another
new mode you get is hyperlapse
I do love how it's implemented in the
South where you choose your interval and
the total run time of the clip Mavic
dust arrests videos out of stitch on
your phone and it's ready to use
or close to it unfortunately the
hyperlapse footage isn't stabilized it's
too shaken basically unusable on a few
occasions it even randomly change my
exposure setting either way there's an
option to save photos individually some
more often or not I'll just process it
myself in after-effects and lastly
there's a dolly zoom which you obviously
get in the zoo model it lets you make
cool shots like this but only 1080p not
4k sorry the pros new sensor can shoot
20 megapixel photos and is someone who
shoots photos with this drone more often
than video it's a joy to use and they're
a big step up from what we had before
not only by pixel size but color just
means very accurate we've seen real-life
this isn't the case with the zoom photos
look great even though there are 12
megapixels but once they start editing
the RAW files the colors just they don't
look asked true on both drawings you'll
find all the same shooting ones you had
before panel vertical pan out 360
spherical photos and on the zoom you get
this mode called super resolution takes
nine separate photos which then stitches
together into one massive 48 megapixel
image in the differences or evident the
last thing when it comes to photos is
the new hyper light mode which
supposedly helps with noise reduction in
lower light situations here are three
photos shot in JPEG hyper light and HDR
to me there's a slight improvement all
of the three examples tried at 600 eyes
so look pretty noisy if anything hyper
light mode added a bit of chromatic
aberration although that is an easy
when it comes to photos deciding between
these two can be tough we may seem like
the pros better on paper because I was
bigger sensor but the zoom is a number
of features that you just don't get with
the pro the zoom and super resolution at
the end of the day it might come down to
price
all right that was a lot but we still
have a few things left to cover i'll
just gonna go through this real quickly
first one i just think - absolutely
loved it can comfortably say that this
is the first time i haven't had a single
interference with signal even when I may
be fluid further that I was allowed no
wishes there whatsoever it even gives me
1080p previews and caching right on the
phone so I can edit there but I really
don't see myself ever doing that second
one battery life advertised 31 minutes
of flight seems possible under perfect
conditions but most I got out of it
comfortably was 24 minutes just because
I didn't want to find myself in a
situation where I lose battery
mid-flight weird which actually happened
once different drone I'll tell you the
story in the iCard third one remote
control same ole design you find
original maverick and medicare plus the
screen although there's a switch on the
side which lets you toggle between sport
program and crepin mode and i'm happy to
report the DJ's greatest invention ever
is back
removable joysticks gosh I love those
things are we down here you want to
spend your sensors and tracking right
right right
okay first sensors there are two new
sensors on this drone the side sensors
which help you when you're tracking a
subject those are only active and tripod
mode and when you're using active track
there's also pair of LED lights at the
bottom of the dome which help with the
bottom sensors and landing and low-light
conditions whatever the Mavic twos now
also have 3d mapping feature that helps
it predicting where a person or a car
would go in the case they're obstructed
by an overhead object the drone was good
at follow me around and avoiding objects
but it wasn't super fluid it was a
little bit jerky when I went behind a
pillar I'm excited to see how this gets
improved over time here's the bottom
line
a lot of the updates that we got with
the pneumatics or updates you'd expect
better obstacle avoidance more sensors
better connectivity quieter operation
and yeah I get
longer battery life but it really stands
out is how these two new drones are
elevating aerial photography and
videography the pro gives you notice
really better video quality that you can
ever get with a drone of this size
well the zoom gives a new tools to
completely change how your drone
photography looks these new drones make
you think differently about the creative
possibilities you can get out of your
drone in addition to that these drones
just work great so you don't have to
worry about connectivity stability
crashing or any other headaches that you
used to have to deal with when flying a
drone instead you can just focus on
getting the shot all right I probably
shoot story earlier so here we go real
fast I was flying my Medicare which is
white by the way it was winter ran out
of battery fell into the forest I went
looking for it in the snow which was up
to my knees it took two hours to find
but apparently Hill says like find my
drone features a pink sound it didn't
really help that much but I found it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
