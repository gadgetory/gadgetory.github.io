$2,000 internet-connected Fitness spike
it's a huge kit among the home exercise
fanatics we're here at CES today looking
at Hilton's newest product it's a four
thousand dollar internet-connected
treadmill called peloton tread and who
better to give me a demo of the new
tread belt and CEO John Foley John
thanks so much for being here with the
verse I'm very excited to show you I I
think I'm excited to start running in
front of a crowd full of people all
right it makes running bearable okay
let's go get a demo
so how many live classes can I expect to
get per day so we'll have a similar full
roster of classes in the live class
we'll probably have 10 to 12 every day
live streaming from the New York studio
and then through the peloton we have the
on-demand library we have hundreds of
different styles of rides or now right
classes at this point this screen is
skewed yeah so it's more than 2 times
bigger than the peloton bike screen that
let's just get you to go into walk ok I
can throttle it back a little bit so you
don't get out of breath that's again
these are pre-programmed for your own
profile so whatever you like to run at
sprint at through there of course with
peloton we have the full leaderboard of
all the other people working out with
you you can get rid of the leaderboard
if you prefer you have your metrics
across here you could move the incline
over there
ok so this is how you so this is
different from my tread exactly so
you'll see your incline here ok
what's the highest it can go 15% all
right and then this increases speed
that's right you'll see that halfway
through the class you're asked to get
off the tread and go over to the mat and
get your weights out and do the full
body you know upper body part of the
workout and are you able to turn the
display so that you can you can see it
so when you're off well that's why we
made the screen so big and the
front-facing soundbar with the best
audio technology and in the category so
it surround sound on a treadmill yes
some treadmills have heart rate sensors
built in here why did you opt not to do
that that feels like a very 1980s
technology to be honest so ours is using
some old treadmill ours is totally
wireless with ant+ technology or
Bluetooth Low Energy whatever type of
heartrate monitor you have the tablet
will pick it up and display it over here
so if someone is already paying for
peloton's
indoor cycling classes yes is this
included as part of that subscription
yes okay they say nothing extra maybe
nothing extra but but that would mean
that they paid $2,000 for the bike
and/or thousand dollars to return you
you have to buy the hardware but from
the membership perspective you're thirty
nine dollars per month covers your bike
membership and your treadmill member so
what if someone was just using the iOS
app and wanted to go running with the
iOS running app did you do that as well
you ready your own treadmill in your
basement yes two years to yesterday's
technology obviously but you could
download our iPad app in a couple months
once we launch all of the club core
classes where you will be able to
consume the classes from any hardware
I'm curious about the economics
said no you announced this just a few
hours ago today and so far the early
reactions really seem to be in two
different camps people re they're saying
they're really really excited about this
maybe because they've tried pellets on
before or they're singing $4,000 for a
treadmill no way why is this four
thousand dollars so it's four thousand
dollars because it basically cost this
board that was nuts to make it's they
got a 32 inch touchscreen a front-facing
sound bar with the best audio technology
and the best slide technology and the
dead know itself so we don't make almost
any money on the treadmill so we had to
charge four thousand dollars but
interesting way as you think about the
affordability for if you're a peloton
bike owner we're bringing the peloton
treadmill to mark it at a $110 a month
price point and you think about back to
the scale within the household that's
fifty five dollars per person so when
you think about what you're paying for
your gym membership if you had at all
it's on biking a peloton tread in your
home why would you need to go to the gym
you have better hardware at a better
location for better instructors a better
community better software as you look at
your product roadmap over the next
couple of years
vision offering any type of low-priced
hardware lower-cost Hardware just to get
people on to the peloton platform maybe
a less expensive bike sure sure so as we
think about what we're trying to do
we're trying to bring fantastic
instructor-led group fitness to tens of
millions people around the world
you know $4,000 price point with $110
per month price we're also not making
any money on the financing so we are
doing everything we can to try to get
great platforms into people's homes so
that they get it get fit and lead
healthy and happy lives so is it in your
product product or back to introduce the
hooker costs devices I can't talk about
it
all right up right now today we're
excited about the pellets on shred but
again we will we're going to innovate in
all sorts of ways as you'd expect the
development of this point
