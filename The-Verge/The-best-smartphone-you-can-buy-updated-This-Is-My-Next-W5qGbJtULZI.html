buy a smartphone you probably know that
having your email your music your games
your Maps your photos your documents
your everything all in one device in
your pocket is awesome and if you have a
smartphone you probably use it all the
time which is why you know it's
incredibly important to get the right
one maybe more so than with any other
device getting a phone with the right
combination of hardware design software
apps camera ecosystem and battery life
is really really crucial it's also
really easy just buy an iPhone 6
no the iPhone 6 isn't the most exciting
phone on earth there's nothing shocking
nor incredible or earth-shatteringly
different about it it has a 4.7 inch HD
display which actually makes it smaller
than a lot of today's flagship phones
the display is gorgeous though laminated
right to the glass and curved ever so
slightly so that it feels great to your
fingers basically the iPhone 6 is the
best phone on the market because it does
everything and it does it all well it
has a phenomenal absolutely
best-in-class
eight megapixel camera and thanks to new
slow motion and time-lapse video modes
plus a new focusing mechanism it takes
better pictures and video than every
battery easily lasts a day more if
you're not staring at Twitter all the
time
touch ID is super useful now letting you
unlock your phone secure your apps and
soon pay for things all by just putting
your finger on the home button the six
is fast and powerful and is simple to
use as iOS always has been and iOS still
has the best app ecosystem with more and
better apps and games than absolutely
any other think about the iPhone 6 is
that it just doesn't have problems it
has a big screen great performance great
battery life great camera great apps all
in one really nice package it's not a
revolutionary phone but it is the best
phone you can buy there's a shockingly
close second place though and it's the
Moto X the Moto X is definitely the best
Android phone out there like the iPhone
6 the Moto X has almost no compromises
it has a great screen a fast processor
and a beautiful high-end design it has a
lot to set it apart - like the super
customizable design and really cool
voice control and always-on notification
it's battery life is good but not great
though and it's camera can still be
frustratingly inconsistent but in every
respect the Moto X does its job and it
has some really neat extra features too
if you don't want an iPhone or if you
want some more color or a lot more
Android you should absolutely get a moto
X from there the list of really good
phones is really long the HTC One is a
beautiful museum piece of a cell phone
with some useful extra software and
really good battery life if only it had
a better camera the LG g3 is a different
kind of hardware achievement with almost
no bezels in just this big beautiful
screen staring action then there's this
whole class of huge phones that some
people like and some people hate like
the iPhone 6 plus and the Samsung Galaxy
Note soon you might love them and there
are lots of good reasons to but don't
buy a huge phone until you've tried it
there's also Samsung's Galaxy s5 which
is a very good smartphone but is
entirely unexceptional without anything
to set it apart or the Nexus 5 which is
the purest Android phone but it's more
expensive up front and getting support
can be tough the list of Android phones
goes forever and honestly most of them
are pretty good it's really hard to find
a bad smartphone these days but it's
worth getting the best ones even if it
costs a little more Windows Phone is
getting better and better but whether
it's the Lumia icon or the 1320 what
they offer is less important than what
they're missing and seriously just don't
buy a blackberry just don't if you buy
the right smart phone you'll use it
constantly and you'll use it for
everything and you'll love it
so make sure you get the right one and
the easiest way to do that is to buy the
iPhone 6 it's not perfect but it's the
best thing out there</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
