second electric longboard from a company
called unique which you might know from
its line of Typhoon drones a lot of
Electric skateboards have hit the mark
in the last year but unlike many of
those you can actually buy an ego -
today it's one of the only electric
skateboards you can buy a regular
retailers like vnh Best Buy and Walmart
it's also one of the most affordable at
six hundred and ninety nine dollars that
price comes with trade-offs the ego too
isn't as nimble as the boost board with
a max speed of twelve and a half miles
per hour and a chunky belt the ego too
is a little sluggish off the line it's
all powered by a single 400 watt motor
which is a little on the small side but
it's still a lot faster than walking the
board itself is an 8 layer composite
deck with a kick tail shape and this
little design detail will appeal to a
lot of people the tail allows you to
tilt the board up over small obstacles
like rough pavement and sidewalks but
you probably won't be doing any tricks
with it
the deck and battery running along its
underbelly make the ego too very stiff
and the 90 millimeter wheels are pretty
bulky but they're helpful in riding over
rough terrain one area where the ego too
surpasses the boosted board is its range
unique claims that it can travel about
18 miles on a single charge and we've
found it perform just a little under
that charging the battery on the ego -
does take a long time around 4 hours
since the board weighs around 14 pounds
you better be sure that you can make it
where you're going unless you're willing
to bring the bulky charger - but the
biggest compromise on the ego - is its
user interface you control the board
with a spring-loaded Bluetooth remote
which can be recharged over microUSB you
push the button on the end to turn the
remote on and off and you also have to
flip a switch on the underside of the
board it takes a long time for the board
to respond to the remote so you really
have to anticipate your moves if you
need to speed up or apply the brake the
remote will also tell you how much
battery life is left in the board with
an LED blinking a sort of Morse code but
to tell for sure you have to focus on
the remote for a long time which is kind
of dangerous while riding in some ways
the ego 2 feels a lot safer than other
boards it's relatively slow speed and
solid deck make it feel sturdy and it
does handle gravel and bumps pretty well
unique made a board that anyone can buy
it's cheaper than the competition and
yes it comes with a number of sea
is trade offs but the ego two's stiff
deck large wheels slow speed and long
range make it a pretty good option for
the casual rider it's fun and it'll get
you where you're going but not with as
much style and grace as other boards on
the market
oh my god that truck almost ran you over
GoPro holy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
