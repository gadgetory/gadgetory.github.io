the first thing to know about the new
Apple TV 4k is that it doesn't support
4k or HDR on YouTube which what they're
basically two ways to review the Apple
TV 4k the first which is what I think
everyone else will do is to talk about
the interface the app store Apple's
content deals and all that stuff is
really important the second way is to be
a huge AV spec nerd which honestly is
what's in my heart but I think he has to
do both together because apples
decisions about what specs and formats
to support really influence a lot what
content is available so the new 4k Apple
TV is the first one to support 4k HDR
which is kind of a catch-up moment for
Apple's most 4k HDR TVs or Smart TVs
with apps anyhow and competitors like
Roku have been shipping 4k HDR boxes for
ever but the Apple TV 4k is the first
complete external box that supports both
HDR 10 and Dolby vision the other thing
to know about the Apple TV 4k is that
it's really expensive it starts at one
hundred and seventy nine dollars for a
32 gig model the Roku ultra is $99 and
the chromecast ultra is $69 and for all
that money you should probably able to
get the most out of your TV in your home
theater setup and with the Apple TV you
just can't so let's start with some good
stuff first the entire user interface of
the Apple TV 4k has been redone in 4k
HDR which is really nice the text looks
sharp the graphics are bright the icons
are clear and there's no mode switching
when you click around between apps and
shows and movies Apple is also selling
4k HDR movies in the iTunes Store
cheaper than anyone else
20 bucks instead of 30 Apple is also
upgrading all the purchases you've
already made to 4k HDR
when they get remastered another thing
to notice at Apple's low prices on 4k
HDR movies come because they make deals
with Hollywood studios but they haven't
made deals with everyone most
Disney and that means what other
services have saved Marvel movies and 4k
HD are Apple just doesn't yet so now
here's some bad news respects the fact
that the entire UI runs in 4k HD are all
the time means that apps that don't
support it like HBO GO get up scaled and
processed in really weird ways so we
watch The Dark Knight on HBO go and
blacks were way too dark the lights were
way too bright and all of the film grain
got turned into really weird noise I
asked app about this and they said that
wasn't their intent what they want to do
is preserve the movie as it is in SDR
even though it's being shown in HDR but
they're still working with content
providers and studios and app developers
to make it happen across their catalogs
I don't know when it's all gonna get
updated but right now it just doesn't
look good
Apple's big plan is that they'll sign
deals with cable providers who will
authenticate apps on the Apple TV and
then they can show you all the stuff
that's available to you just like a
really modern cable box but the problem
is that big cable providers like Comcast
and Verizon FiOS haven't signed up with
Apple yet and might never so you're
stuck just activating every single app
you can find that your cable provider
might support Apple could build some
hacks to help you get through it
but they're ideal as a means are holding
out for the deal but when it does all
work in the new TV app it's great you
get live sports alerts when ESPN has a
game going on you get breaking news
alerts when CNN is cut into breaking
news and it all just feels like a much
more modern vision of what a TV can be
there's a lot of other cool stuff
happening that really reflects the fact
that the new Apple TV has an 810 X
processor its base is a little iPad so
the ESPN app can show you four streams
of video at once and you can move them
around rearrange them any way you want
and because the Apple TV is basically a
little iOS computer you can do all sorts
of other things like play games Apple
told me they think of the Apple TV is a
video first device but they're excited
that games are there because it makes
people use the product more in terms of
hardware the only really notable thing
that's changed is the remote the old
Apple TV remote was actually really hard
to hold because it's exactly the same
top and bottom so now Apple has added a
little white ring around the Menu button
so you can feel it in the dark the
touchpad is still really really
frustrating
so there's one more bad thing and it
only affects a tiny number of people but
I'm one of them the Apple TV doesn't
support Dolby Atmos which is the highest
quality surround sound format available
and the real problem is that there's
actually nothing on the market that
supports both Dolby vision HDR and Dolby
Atmos sound which means I can't get both
the highest quality video and audio and
I just don't understand it the Apple TV
is really expensive as a really fast
processor Apple told me it's not a
hardware limitation and all of its
competitors support at most $79 Roku
supports at most the Xbox one S which
supports HD RN Atmos so I just don't
know why Apple won't let me unlock all
of the power of this box
here's thing I really really want to
light the Apple TV it's full of good
ideas Siri voice search is a good idea
having a really fast processor connected
to the iOS ecosystem is a great idea
having Apple one of the most powerful
companies in the world negotiate for
better movie prices is a wonderful idea
but Apple doesn't seem to understand
that their TV box is just a box it's
connected to somebody else's TV it's
often connected to somebody else's home
theater equipment and that isolation is
really holding this thing back so about
YouTube the reason the Apple TV doesn't
support 4k or HDR on YouTube is because
YouTube's 4k uses a video codec called
vp9 which Apple doesn't support because
Apple and Google are terrible at making
deals with each other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
