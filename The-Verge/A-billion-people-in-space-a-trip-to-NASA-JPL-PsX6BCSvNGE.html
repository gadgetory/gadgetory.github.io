Curiosity rover okay we're not really on
Mars and this is really curiosity's
sister robot but we are at curiosity's
home base NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena California and
while Rovers like this one have captured
the imagination of humans across the
planet scientists at JPL have even more
ambitious goals to one day have more
than a billion human beings in space
my name is Scott davidoff I'm
responsible for delivering the user
interfaces for the systems that command
the JPL spacecraft and the challenge is
that the next generation of Rovers and
exploration vehicles are going to be
tasked with doing many many things as
opposed to just one thing I mean it
sounds like you're describing basically
remote-controlled robotic avatars for
people well sometimes that's what it's
like though the avatars aren't always
like humanoid and so the mapping isn't
always as real as natural as a hand to a
hand so what are the biggest challenges
your you're facing right now trying to
translate human embodiment to robotic
body probably the hardest is the
delicacy of certain manipulations and
then being able to not have a full
picture of the environment
so what are you doing with oculus when I
show you three demos today the first one
is seeing through the eyes of the robot
so this is the first experience we're
showing you basically stereo paired
image warped on to a cylindrical display
you can see your your arm you can see
the pebbles on the distance the more
textured environment the more really
pops out at you from something like this
it's much easier to discern whether the
objects in front of you or it's the left
or behind you as opposed to just looking
at it in a 2d window this is incredible
detail from these photos hopefully you
give good feel what it's like to be on
lunch makes me want to take a hike here
this is an international space station
so I've taken all the u.s. modules put
them in here all right so I'm looking at
this robot now that's Robonaut 2 it's a
humanoid robot astronaut that's on the
space station to have help astronauts do
work that's a copula it's one of the
windows to look outside well hang
outside this is the entire space station
there you're looking at Earth if you
swim around and you see the son of the
moon this one's a little simpler we're
going to start you out at Gale Crater
again but this time it's a 30
interactivity environment this is one of
the ones where we think multiplayer
could be really cool is if a lot of
people could be in the same environment
exploring that environment alongside
this robotic avatar which is our Rover
it's very cool I can just feel my
stomach drop when I go up and down
so we're standing here in front of one
of the athletes one of the triathletes
actually athlete is a six-legged vehicle
it's actually two robots that combine
together to make one six legged vehicle
right now we have it in the single three
legged position it was originally
designed as a is a multi-purpose robot
to do things like cargo offloading on
the moon so if you imagine you have a
lunar lander that comes down and your
cargo is usually on top of the lander
you need to get that cargo off the top
the two triathletes can come up
alongside take that cargo up move it to
wherever you want and put that down what
that enables you to do is to build a
larger base on the moon from smaller
pieces one of the challenges of you know
landing on an asteroid is that bastard's
have very low gravity and if you come
down and as you come to a close approach
if you use your thrusters to slow
yourself down you can kick up all kinds
of dust and debris and that will you
know confuse your sensors cause all
sorts of trouble the other thing is that
because they're low gravity as you come
down you have a tendency to really
really bounce and these bounces can have
really long periods and asteroids are
generally on these these really long
periodic orbits of the Sun so you don't
have that much time to do your science
because if that asteroids on a 60 year
trajectory you've gotta land on that
asteroid do your science and get off
otherwise you're not coming back for
another 60 years
believe it or not landing a robot on an
asteroid isn't the most difficult
problem nASA has to solve how do you
control a robot that's so far away that
it might take as much as 20 minutes for
a signal to region we have systems that
help an operator to predict what the
robot is going to do and understand the
uncertainty in what it might accomplish
that's that uncertainty is being
introduced by that delay but still
accomplish their goals and inefficient
fashions
this is a prototype that we've designed
to allow people to control robotic
spacecraft like the athlete more
intuitively what's sort of unique about
this demo is that it's rendering a 3d
model in stereo much like if you go to a
3d movie you can see how things pop out
at you but one of the differences is
it's actually tracking where I put my
head so it creates a much more
holographic feel and I have a pen here
that's also tracked and so I can reach
into the space and I can actually grab
the robot and manipulate it around I can
grab it slims so we have joint by joint
control so I can sort of fly the robot
around and I can grab a single limb and
I can move a single joint you click on
its head and then click on the ground
you can actually laser things on the
ground so no demo would be complete
without being able to fire the laser I'm
feeling good about this projector name's
Riley I've Ron and I've been an intern
here for now there's my fourth summer
and you developed this iphone app which
makes this thing yeah exactly so last
summer that was my project they said to
me well controlling this thing is kind
of hard right now and kind of confusing
it takes a lot to keep people are a lot
of different parties who have an
interest in driving over around so
making it you know easy enough for like
a media correspondent to drive is is a
good is a good thing for us to do so
they said what's good choice while an
iphone is very ubiquitous the lab hands
them out if you don't have one so you
can you can get one real easily so we
use the iphone this so platform if you
guys have any positions open for over
pilots let me know this is my resume
so this is one of our robots it's the
Lemur robot and it has these micro spine
claws use that to climb rocks it's the
world's first rock climbing robot this
is a micro spying wheel each of these
little limbs here or legs has a hook in
it and those hooks grasp asperities in
the surface a little pips ledges bumps
protrusions and allow the robot to grip
that surface and and climb
the Lemur robot is related to the to the
two-wheeled climber the difference here
is that this robot lemur is designed to
climb in any orientation so it goes
upside down it goes on vertical walls
and we're also talking about using it
for asteroids which would be zero
gravity so that's kind of how they're
related this one is we call it a power
tool for astronauts you know drilling in
microgravity is a really hard problem
because the normal drills that we would
use on Mars are not able to be used in
microgravity there's no weight on bit
you know normally when you drill you're
pushing into the surface so on an
asteroid with no gravity you're just as
likely to push yourself away as you are
to push force onto the bit and it gets
even worse when you turn the drill on
you're just as likely to start spinning
around the drill as the drill bit is to
start spinning on the rock you know this
is kind of an early-stage prototype of
what astronauts might one day use that
add an asteroid to acquire samples
obviously there's a lot of work to do
before a billion humans are controlling
robotic avatars and distant planets but
the work is beginning here and someday
you might be an observer in space using
technologies like those you might
already have in your home including the
kinect the oculus rift or the leap
motion and if NASA's vision comes true
it won't just be robots or humans
exploring space and dependently it will
be an intimate partnership between two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
