looks a lot like the XPS 13 that's been
out since 2015 except for one pretty big
difference so yeah this is an XPS 13
that you can flip around into a tablet
that's not really a bad thing the XPS 13
is been one of our favorite Windows
laptops because it's got great design
great keyboard beautiful display and
great performance
now the two-in-one carries over most of
those same qualities except it has a few
other key differences now for starters
you got a deal with a few fewer ports
the XPS 13 two and one is a little bit
thinner it's about the same weight as
the normal model but it only has USB C
ports there's one here and there's one
here there's also a micro SD card slot
instead of a full-sized SD card slot
unfortunately you've got a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack
ad√®le also includes a USB c2a adapter
to get you started on your dongle life
the power button has been moved to the
side and frankly it kind of sucks
it's too small it's too mushy it's too
hard to tell when you've actually
pressed it I really disliked it on the
upside I really liked the little battery
meter that's on the other side and I
wish every single laptop habit now the
keyboard and trackpad are pretty much
the same as a standard XPS 13 which
means there's great key travel a back
light and a smooth and responsive keypad
the arrow keys are a little bit small
for my preference but everything else
about the keyboard is pretty great
what's new is this new fingerprint
scanner which works with Windows hello
lets you login super quickly and easily
and it's really convenient to use the
two and one is the same size 13.3 inch
screen as a standard model it's Dells
infinity edge design it puts the panel
all the way to the edges of the screen
which is really cool now on this $1,299
model I'm testing it's got a 1080p
display resolution which is bright and
sharp and really nice you can opt for a
quad HD panel if you want but I don't
think you really need to
now the other exterior design difference
is the placement of the webcam on the
standard XPS 13 it's in this really bad
lower left corner spot on the two-in-one
it's in a really bad low center spot
it's going to work for Windows hello at
at some point in a few months but I
wasn't able to test that I did test it
with conference calls though and I
really kind of hate it it's maybe
slightly better than the standard model
but not much at all if you're on a
conference call the view that everyone
gets is up your nose and if you start
typing all of your fingers start
blocking the camera which is just dumb
now you can get around it by flipping
around the display into the tent mode
which puts the camera above the screen
that means that you give up access to
the keyboard and trackpad they'll really
just needs to figure out how to put the
camera above the display like every
other laptop ever on the inside the 2 +
1 is a few key changes as well the unit
I've been testing has Intel seventh
generation Core i7 processor but it's a
fan 'less design so it's not as powerful
as the one in the standard model fanless
is great it's super quiet when I'm
working and it doesn't get too hot when
it's on my lap either I really didn't
have any problems there what's been
really impressed with the performance
I'm able to multitask jump between a
bunch of different browser tabs
different windows 10 apps without any
hang-ups and you're not going to want to
game on this and you're not going to
want to do heavy photo or video editing
but for everyday work it's actually
pretty great the two ones battery is
also good it's able to go about seven or
eight hours between charges for me and
since it's got a USB C plug if I need to
charge up I can plug in an external
battery now you may be wondering if this
two and one is any good at being more
than a laptop since it does do this
whole flippin thing I'm going to be
frank here it is 90% a laptop and maybe
10% of tablet vast majority of the time
you're going to be using it as a laptop
and maybe once in a while you'll put it
in tent mode to watch a video on a plane
or something like that but if you're
using as a tablet it's just too big too
thick and too heavy to really be
practical or not cumbersome which is
exactly the story with every single
convertible laptop I've ever used now
I'm left wondering why you would buy
this particular XPS 13 at all if you
want a good laptop the regular XPS 13
doesn't make you give up on ports or
power and is a really good laptop in its
own right the XPS 13 2 + 1 is a really
great laptop with few faults but
honestly I think your money would be
best spent somewhere else
well crunchies Lenna what do what do you
call that when people like to listen to
bubbles pop popping anger a little bit
of ASMR action we should be fast do you
want to kill</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
