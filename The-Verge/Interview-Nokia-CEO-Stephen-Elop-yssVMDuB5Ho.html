we're sitting with Stephen Elop CEO of
Nokia and we're here at CES 2012 talking
about what are we talking about today
we're talking about Nokia's re-entry
into the US market we had a lot of great
announcements over the last few days we
talked about our partnership with AT&amp;amp;T
and introducing the Nokia Lumia 900
exclusively with AT&amp;amp;T this is the scien
version here this is the cyan color
we've got it coming in cyan and black
you know LTE network amazing just
blazing speeds on the network and this
you have the this is the 800 so you can
get a size comparison
absolutely between the two let's and so
we took wait it's way much bigger screen
3.7 there 4.3 inch there yeah so we
announced that we announced that the 800
will be showing up in the Microsoft
stores yeah that was a surprise the
Lumia 710 starting sales in t-mobile
stores this week at $49 with a contract
which is just a great way to go after
the 150 million smartphone and tenders
the people write the people who are
there on a feature phone exact rate
they're looking for that up so let me
ask you I have a couple quick questions
I know we have a ton of time so really
quickly so you're selling the 800 unlock
there's a smaller phone are there plans
to bring that to other you're not gonna
have making any announcements but if you
see this coming to carriers in the US or
are we going from the 900 so there'll be
new for so we haven't announced any
plans for that with carriers in the US
but we did announce with carriers in
Canada the 7 i-10 and 800 are going to
Rogers and tell us how effectively so
you'll see it there so they're on their
North America and you're gonna see them
in Northmen know what you're going to
see though is just a continuing pattern
of additional devices at different price
points with different operators so you
know at each step of this journey it's
really exciting to be able to stand up
and say and here's the next element
because a big thing we've been focused
on at Nokia is changing the clock speed
of the company right you looked in
October just a few months after we even
signed the deal with Microsoft is like
here's a 7/10 here's the 800 then here's
the 900 with LTE support being shown so
you have to do anything without a
thousand next right we just have well
are you gonna go to four digits I don't
know how high the numbers could go but
right well I think infinite really is
the answer and we just have to
so so I have a question I was at your
keynote yesterday not your keynote but
your presentations here and you kept
referring to these devices as the first
real Windows Phone yes
now HTC makes Windows Phone Samsung
makes them LG makes them and your you
have a close partnership with Microsoft
yes what do you mean when you say the
first real Windows Phone what does that
mean what I specifically mean is that we
are doing our best work our best ideas
our best innovation for Windows Phone
that's where we begin we have a new
innovation you know here the for example
the optics in this we've made some
amazing advances and make the
capabilities of these devices and you're
getting me to point out and the very
first efforts land on the Windows Phone
platform with a number of others that's
not where their primary focus is right
so when we say the first real Windows
moment we're really saying is we're
doing the very best design the very best
hardware and coupling that with the
Windows Phone software and all the
services around it and really so you
think you're saying you think of it as
more from from the nokia perspective of
looking at the device versus Microsoft
saying hey we've anointed this the real
Windows Phone I mean every every Windows
Phone is running and this is one of your
points also is that you don't have the
fragmentation issues across Windows
Phone because you guys are all running
basically the same build but you're
going to deviate from that at some point
I mean you're at least going to add
there's gonna be an additive effect with
Nokia so then what happens there tell
explain to me how Nokia brings its DNA
because you've obviously got the
hardware DNA right and we know that the
software is relatively unchanged from if
I went to buy the HTC Titan 2 which was
announced yesterday that's gonna be
running the same software as this device
so what's the next where did a lot of
you know DNA today let me give you an
example one of the areas where we have a
tremendous strength is in location-based
services now you may think well that's
just a map or that's whatever but as an
early example of differentiation with
the Lumia products you get Nokia Drive
which is full voice enabled turn-by-turn
navigation in many countries around the
world
included in the cost of the device many
other platforms and environments are
paying quite a bit of money right right
and that's not enough as your as your
personal now and how integrated is that
with it with the phone I mean can you
jump could I jump from a Bing map search
into those who drive those things are
just beginning to be there so that's a
good example but this is the point as
we've just begun this journey you will
see so much more like that where the
Windows Phone platform and I emphasize
platform because a platform says you
extend you embrace you build upon it and
that's what we're doing to drive
differentiation and again our very best
work our focus will be on doing that and
so because they don't get such a close
partner with Microsoft on the software
side you know as well as making devices
will nokia drive come to HTC well we see
those pieces of the Nokia's brought in
go to other I mean if you're if you want
to keep an unfragmented ecosystem how do
you do that so the way you do that is
there's certain base elements that will
be introduced by Nokia and shared with
the entire ecosystem but we still
reserve the right to say hey here's
something that takes it a step further
for example Nokia Drive is an
application that builds on the
location-based services that doesn't
fragment the ecosystem to include that
in the cost of our device it just
differentiates us so I give you the
opposite example which we wouldn't want
to do and that is introduce some API is
an SDK or something that cause
developers to build applications on a
Nokia device that couldn't run on other
Windows Phone devices right that would
be it
so you want to utilize what's in what's
in this core of the OS without you
essentially don't want to create
anything new a new component that would
mean that HTC or LG or Samsung or any
other anything we want the court end up
with missing functionality because you
guys are right we want the core there we
may extend the core by contributing
things and others may build interesting
things upon that but we continue to
reserve the right say hey here's here's
a unique capability that we want to
enhance photography is a good example
where Windows Phone supports cameras it
supports a picture gallery that's all
good right but with the type of cameras
and lenses and things that we still have
ahead of us you can imagine that there's
special software that better interprets
the images or
you a better experience and imagery on
our devices right those types of things
right and that and that's going to be a
noticeable difference obvious yes so so
couple I know you're in a big hurry and
a couple of couple of questions and then
go but pricing and availability you I
mean you guys kind of danced around it
didn't dance what we didn't right I mean
well you very firmly you didn't announce
it but you said this is coming I think
you use a phrase something like in the
in the in the very short next months or
a few months or something like that next
couple of months so this is a q1 device
so we haven't been more specific than
the next couple of months okay and on
the pricing side we haven't provided the
firm price yeah but what we have said is
we intend to be very aggressive right
aggressive in the in the high-end
premium device we intend to be very
aggressive right because you've got the
710 which is kind of the on the lower
end of the scale yes in terms of pricing
but at the same time with even with the
900 we expect this to be a device that
first time smartphone purchasers will be
interested in putting in their pocket
right so we're going after them so so
when it comes to what no kit can bring
to the table down the road you guys had
you know you were doing Symbian you've
kind of left that behind you did a
device Amiga device which was kind of
almost a one-off now the n9 right and
you know there's a lot of good software
there a lot of good software design
gestural stuff yes can we expect to see
some of your haptics on the keyboard in
fact are amazing it just feels like it
almost feels like you're typing on a
real keyboard on that virtual keyboard
is that the kind of stuff that we we can
expect will it be that do you will you
work with Microsoft that close we will
first of all we will absolutely be
working that closely there's a number of
things that that typify a Nokia device
you know Symbian devices and on the n9
some things that you're already
beginning to see come over for example
the industrial design this started with
the anigh and carried on to the 800 is
now carried on to the 900 that's a good
example of a type of things that we're
doing is taking innovation that's been
successful in other platforms and
bringing it forward as well as
introducing new innovation right way so
so but on the software side I mean is
that will we see I mean would the
keyboard be a place where you might
collaborate something is any raw level
examples
our good ideas in areas where we could
collaborate know what we do is decide
which of those actually have the
greatest consumer appeal within always a
limited amount of time what are the ones
on which we need to focus because
they're going to serve our consumers
best but you will see specific examples
of elements of both Symbian and the n9
that will land in the future just as an
example with the n9 when we introduced
the n9 we said that even though it's a
first device on me go
and we weren't carrying on with me go
outside of the lab environment we said
that there would be elements of the user
experience elements of a development
environment elements of the of the
industrial design that we live on right
now what we've done since then is that
oK you've seen the industrial design at
the n9 landing in the Windows Phone
products we've said that the cute
development environment would land for
the next billion for the lower-priced
devices they haven't said what where
that user experienced that gestural work
will land but it's gonna land but it's
not it's not out of the out of the
question now there's a very good work
there that will continue on ok ok Steven
thank you so much we really appreciate
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
