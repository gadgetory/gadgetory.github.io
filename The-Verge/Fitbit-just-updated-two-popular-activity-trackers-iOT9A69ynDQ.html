Virgin today we're taking a look at two
new fitbit's the new Tippett's are not
entirely a surprise it had been reported
before that if it might be coming out
with some new stuff and on a recent
earnings call to CEO even said we're
going to have more products before the
end of the year let's start with the new
Fitbit flex 2 this is the follow-up to
the Fitbit flex which came out in 2013
this is really your basic activity
tracker it tracks your steps your
calories burned your distance traveled
and your sleep does not have a display
so you're getting some indicator lights
here it'll tell you when you've reached
activity goals or when you have text
message or call coming through but it's
not like you're gonna be able to cycle
through your data you're gonna have to
sync it with the Fitbit app on iPhone or
Android in order to see all of that
information there are no optical heart
rate sensors so this isn't gonna track
your heart rate one notable thing about
the Fitbit flex 2 is that it is cool and
quote swim proof zip it says doesn't
mean it's necessarily going to track
your swim activity but it means that you
can go swimming with it or you just
shower with it it has smart track which
is stiff it's automatic exercise
tracking feature and it has a battery
life expectation of around five days
which is pretty much on par with what
other Fitbit are these days another
thing worth noting about the Fitbit flex
2 is that you can pop it out and put it
in one of these bangles Fitbit is
selling three of these as an accessory
so that's a nice option if you're
looking for maybe a different design
aesthetic from some other Fitbit I will
say in general fitbit's have gotten a
little bit better looking between
something like the Fitbit Alta which
came out earlier this year and now the
Fitbit flex 2 and accessories like to
use and this is the new Fitbit charge -
I think this is the one that people are
going to be most interested in and I say
that because the Fitbit charge HR which
is the predecessor to this is actually
the best selling fitbit of all time so
what's new with the Fitbit charge - the
first thing you're gonna notice is the
display it is four times bigger than the
little strip display that was on the
Fitbit charge HR
it's not a touchscreen but this does
mean that you can go a little bit deeper
into menu options directly on the bin
itself so you use this physical button
here
to cycle through some of those options
and then let's say you want to do
different exercises you tap on it in
addition to the different look it also
does things differently so now the
Fitbit charge too has connected GPS the
charge HR did not have any option for
GPS this one still doesn't have built-in
GPS but if it's connected to your phone
over Bluetooth and you take your phone
with you want to run or on a bike ride
you can use GPS while you're working out
if it's also doing something called
cardio fitness level you know to be
clear this is not vo2 max but it's
something that's supposed to be similar
to estimated vo2 Max and they're coming
up with basically a score for your
cardio level of course we haven't had a
chance to test this ourselves yet to see
how well it works or how accurate it is
in addition to all that stuff I mean the
charge too is going to do things you
would expect a Fitbit to do it tracks
how many steps you've taken throughout
the day your heart rate distance
traveled calories burned attract your
sleep and then there are a bunch of
workout options in it as well I have to
say with the addition of connected GPS
this is a pretty appealing mid-range
Fitbit so that's a quick look at the new
Fitbit flex 2 and the Fitbit charge -
they're the same price as their
predecessors so the Fitbit flex 2 is $99
the Fitbit charge 2 is a hundred and
forty nine dollars they go on sale today
August 29th but they're shipping at
different times the flex two will become
available in early October while the
Fitbit charge 2 will ship in mid
September there are a lot of fitbit's
out there now if you're confused I don't
blame you
fortunately we'll have reviews up
sometime soon and will tell you how well
they work and hopefully help you figure
out which Fitbit is right for you if any
at all
hey what Fitbit are you thinking again I
don't really know there are so many no I
know I can't possibly keep track I was
thinking about the place no that thing's
ugly well what about the Ulta
I like that but what about the I don't
know there's so many zip one force
