verge lounge and flat sabbath and i'm
joined by frank azle from alienware and
there was XPS division and frank has for
us a new product and she won't talk to
us about it that's more a new color than
actually a whole new product but um we
know we launched the XPS 13 at CES last
year it's been a huge success for us
it's been deemed come pretty much the
world's best windows notebook so we were
very proud of the product and when intel
introduced the skylake processors in
october we updated it time to market
with intel so you have the sixth
generation processor and the USBC port
all the latest goods on the inside and
we increase the battery but one of the
things we kept hearing over over the
year in 2015 is folks wanted different
colors and gold was actually ranking
really high as a color that they wanted
to see on this product since we have the
aluminum finish on the a panel and then
on the bottom base so we're introducing
it here today at the show you have a
couple of laptops still kind of a quiet
show for you in the previous year CES
2015 you introduced your graphics amp
which is a breakout box to have the GPU
a desktop GPU that connects to your
laptop you're not making any such quite
as big announcements on that front but
you do have something to share with us
on the vr front we do it's a really
exciting time that I think 2016 not by
my account necessarily but by several
accounts has been deemed like the year
of VR so we're really excited about that
and we've been working for a few years
now with oculus pretty much since their
Kickstarter came out on on how we can
work together to really make VR a
possibility and to make it be successful
and obviously they own the headset
they've owned the content they're doing
I think a phenomenal job on that end
they need something the power that and
alienware was founded in nineteen
ninety-six we're going to celebrate our
20th anniversary this year and we were
founded with a very simple principle and
it's held us it's been it's been
maintained ever since then and that's
going to be what carry us carries us
into VR as well
and that is that you can always build
your own system you can always put your
own components together are you probably
going to do it better than anybody else
can do it for you and you'll be able to
do the same thing with VR good buy a
headset and plug that into your system
and upgrade your graphics card if you
need to optimize your software and
everything but um if you just want to
turnkey system you just want to focus on
the content you just want to focus on
playing the games and enjoying your
media not having to worry about the
technical side of what towering that
content you want support when you need
it you want somebody you can call for
questions technical questions and
answers that's what we provide that's
what we've always provided and we'll do
the same thing with VR so let's oculist
we're going to announce that our 1199
x51 system which meets all the minimum
requirements for the oculus rift
experience and our XPS 8900 with a
similar configuration those two machines
are priced at 1199 typically but if you
bundle them with an oculus headset we're
going to give you a two hundred dollar
discount to help make just that that
ecosystem a little bit easier of an
entry for you to get into and the most
important thing when is this going to be
available your partnership so on the
partnerships being announced today um
and it's uh mm-hmm the systems will
begin shipping in the februari March
time frame so as soon as headsets begin
shipping out to folks whether you
pre-ordered or you buy a system now or
you buy it then all the shipments will
start going out in February March all
right well thanks very much for your
time Frank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
