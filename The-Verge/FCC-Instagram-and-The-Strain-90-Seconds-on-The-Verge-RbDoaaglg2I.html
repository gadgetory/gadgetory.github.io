ellis hamburger and my favorite food is
you guessed it ham this is 90 seconds on
the verge forget Wi-Fi the FCC will soon
propose allowing airline passengers to
use cell phones while near cell phone
use will still be prohibited during
takeoff and landing but calls can be
made once the planes reached 10,000 feet
the FAA however would still have to sign
off on this and the final decision of
whether to allow cellular calls would
rest with the airlines what happened to
the good old days are hopping on a plane
with nothing but a pack of cigarettes
and fresh mad loads instagram for
windows phone has finally arrived but it
comes with some caveats while the app is
loaded with most of the familiar
features seen on iOS and Android it's
missing video upload and Instagram will
send you out to the smartphones default
camera apps to snap a picture it will
switch you back for edits however
Instagram says it will continue
developing the app and adding new
features to provide the best possible
experience for users and finally think
the vampire trend on television is over
nope blade to director Guillermo del
Toro is bringing his vampire book series
the strain to FX the series will follow
the Center for Disease Control as it
tries to stop a viral outbreak of
vampirism from taking over New York the
network has greenlit 13 episodes of the
show which will debut in July 2014 FX
seems to be banking on the show being a
hit it's already hired writers to pen 10
scripts before the pilot has even aired
and that's it for today's top stories
but coming up tomorrow I host my first
reddit AMA be PBM am HJ ask me anything
but please don't make any more hamburger
