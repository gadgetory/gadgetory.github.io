and I'm local vape bro nilay patel and
we're here at CES unveil 2016 nilay this
is where it all starts this is the first
thing it's the biggest thing on the
first day all the press lands rushes
into Vegas comes here gets dumped on ice
luge cocktails and then plays with toys
and it's amazing okay so Casey this is a
795 dollar laser headband that will grow
your hair for you using 82 lasers and
three banks so what meal is gonna do now
is he's gonna put on this laser headband
and it may spare him from the utter
devastation of male pattern baldness
this is the most darth vader shit I've
ever done yeah but if this can help my
already lustrous hair so every 30
seconds of vibrates facing that is such
a good look on you and then and then you
just move it back along your head I'm
told this device is FDA approved have to
be cleared so you can eat it and tell us
about your dog here okay its own latest
robot Wow so any control with this watch
yes something you wear can I can I wear
this watch i get rid of this garbage
does anybody need an avalanche 14 so
this is the watch far superior to the
Apple watch I believe because this one
controls a robot dog yeah direct
comparison can't control a robot dog and
on robot
just listens from beeps and then each
other so it's like a people extender
it's a beep extender so does it know
what kind of beach the biebs arms like
but what if I have like three LG devices
at all singing different songs yes what
will it name the tune have you thought
about Shazam integration you know every
year the technology is different but one
thing remains the same and that's the
CES ice luge and this mysterious glue
beverage that comes out of it to the
future that every year full of regret is
not a good okay see this is a sculptor
so what you do is you just spray
yourself right yourself and then and you
put this on your body in various places
yeah and it tells you how much a massage
shoots now yeah it will shame you free
choices and then a map of your body will
appear on your phone in 24 regions and
tell you your muscle fat percentage is a
massive fat percentage and your muscle
quality so just measuring your muscle
quality all over technology used to be a
way to justify sitting down for endless
periods of time now it's trying to get
you back up again if I'm horrible trend
we tell us about the tip of the weed
what's happening in there the peep yeah
yes the tip of the week across the board
it's the first six you're right i
complain about let's see another yeah we
gotta see the weed you know always been
a big fan of eating it's good just a lot
of hot air nice to me
no we got a little wearable device okay
I system hurts that's a very molding I'm
burning my this you are all right this
is a very comfortable bed I would sleep
on this bed yeah now this will track my
sleep I'm sorry well me like what do you
make of this year's CES avail I have to
say it's a little different last year
there's a lot of spectacle this year
there's a lot of sensors that make you
feel bad about yourself my heart is
about to explode my muscles are
inadequate I'm sleeping all wrong I
can't play the piano I mean I just
honestly everything here is designed and
measure something about my life that
sucks also I don't have a machine
communicating beam that is constantly
sensing my temperature and adjusting my
lifestyle as much fun in the center
crazy several whelming everything here
is designed to make me emotional i think
it's really amazing week in case there's
something very important we have remind
them and that is to subscribe to our
youtube channel subscribe to the verge
