Potter book series
JK Rowling has released a new story
online that offers a very brief glimpse
of Harry Ron and Hermione in their later
years all from the perspective of gossip
columnist Rita Skeeter Harry Potter and
the Deathly Hollows was released in 2007
bringing an end to one of the most
popular book series of all time but the
books and even the films were only the
beginning to a much much larger
franchise JK Rowling's book series
started in 1997 with a release of Harry
Potter and the Philosopher's Stone
since then the seven books have gone on
to make over seven and a half billion
dollars and then there were the movies
aside from launching the careers of
Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson the
eight Harry Potter movies have also made
over seven billion dollars the final
movie Harry Potter and the Deathly
Hallows part-2 is the fourth
highest-grossing movie of all time
in fact the seven other movies all
ranked in the list of the top 50
highest-grossing movies so it's no
surprise at the final film which was
released in 2011 was far from the end of
the story
since then Universal Studios has teamed
up with Rowling and Warner Brothers the
studio behind the films to create the
Wizarding World of Harry Potter a fully
interactive high-tech theme park that
immerses fans in the world of magic the
park opened in Orlando Florida in 2010
and expanded this year a similar park
will open this summer at Universal
Studios Japan and a third version is
planned for Universal Studios Hollywood
for 2016 and it doesn't even end there
Rowling is also producing a stage
production in London's West End that
will focus on Potter's early years
before heading to Hogwarts and then
there's Potter more a website which
Rowling helped create it gives fans
details about the world of Harry Potter
not given in the original series as well
as retells the original story in an
interactive way and provides a platform
for Rowling to release new material but
Rowling isn't stopping at just the story
of Harry Potter
based on Rowling spinoff book fantastic
beasts and where to find them the film
adaptation will be released November 18
2016 so yeah expect a lot of muggles and
magic in the decade to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
