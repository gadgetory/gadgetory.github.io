in Sunnyvale California at the offices
for project ara
it's the moonshot project out of the
advanced technologies and products group
inside Google and they're trying to
build modular smartphones that will let
consumers swap out components on the fly
it sounds like a nerds dream but the
real dream is to up and how we make and
buy phones in the future project ara
isn't the phone it's actually well a
project a chap a group that in some part
came out of DARPA is essentially just
making the instructions for how a
modular phone will work they're
developing the technology of the
different pieces to talk to each other
and working with partners to build
prototypes at the center of it all is an
endoskeleton an unassuming slab with
different slots where you can put in
modules there's some wild technology
inside this metal frame ara is using
next-gen super fast networking
technology to get all the parts to talk
to each other it manages power and lets
you hot-swap modules it uses wireless
capacitive pads so what the modules
communicate with the mainboard and each
other even the way the modules lock into
the frame is futuristic in this lateral
direction
they are held using electro permanent
magnets which is a pretty neat
technology it's a it's a it's kind of a
cross between a permanent magnet and an
electromagnet in that it has an on state
and an off state it uses a a pulse to
switch between those two states but it's
a passive component meaning it consumes
no power and both the off state in the
on state but all that technology doesn't
add up to a phone it's essentially just
networking it doesn't have your main
processor your cellular radio or even a
screen adding all those things on
piecemeal can make for pretty bulky
phone but a chap has managed to build
something that doesn't look completely
ridiculous trying to keep the form
factor of a device to something that is
that we think is is is elegant and
beautiful where each individual module
has this pebble like a sleek watertight
aesthetic associated with it and so as a
consequence that leaves because because
the form factor is is is defined by this
that leaves a little bit less area for
for functional components traditional
phones put as many parts as possible on
a single circuit board or even a single
chip pulling all those things apart into
separate modules has costs the phone
gets fatter battery life drops and
overall the thing gets heavier Eremenko
thinks that he can convince people that
the trade-offs are worth it
and so we want to make sure that that
that overhead that inefficiency is
minimized and we think the crossover
point is somewhere somewhere the
one-third overhead point we think will
come in at about one quarter for about
25% overhead and the the by crossover I
mean that's where consumers are willing
to trade some penalty in exchange for
the flexibility and for the richness of
the ecosystem and the ability to
customize functional and aesthetically
the aesthetics matter a lot
even if Eremenko Zam Bish's plans work
out people still have to want to use the
thing to get their a tap is working with
a partner to create a first-of-its-kind
3d printer which will be able to rapidly
build customized plastic shells for each
module what that means is that we'll be
able to create module enclosures which
on any given module are user replaceable
we call them shells and so a consumer in
the RO marketplace will be able to to
utilize shell maker apps to create
beautiful designs that are not just
unique not just custom but can also be
expressive to to the consumer this week
Eremenko Anna's team is finally getting
into the nitty-gritty of how ro will
work by hosting a conference for
hardware developers the group has an
aggressive goal of launching a real
product for consumers about a year from
now so getting there won't be easy and
they'll need the support both big and
small manufacturers to do it more you
think about project ara the crazier and
more ambitious it seems Eremenko is a
tap group itself consists of just a
handful of people they're working with
partners develop prototypes and create
the spec they're also on an insanely
tight schedule and strangely enough it's
a schedule they've imposed of themselves
so the internal team and in this case
the team internal to Google is very very
small very very lean and and we're here
for a very short period of time so I
have I had a two-year tenure and one
year into my two year tenure the project
is scoped to the team's tenure and as a
consequence the the philosophies of time
is not your friend and and innovation
under time pressure is higher quality
innovation it tends to get rid of red
tape it tends to get rid of dithering
and inability to make decisions
it tends to take away risk aversion so
so it's innovation under time pressure a
tap came from a team of people who
originally worked at DARPA pursuing
futuristic projects Eremenko himself had
plans for next generation war vehicles
and even something called fractionated
spacecraft a taps philosophy is to aim
high and demand that you make something
real something more than just a
prototype in only two years so the
ability to take sort of fundamental
scientific and technical understanding
groundbreaking physics and technology
and intersect that with a driving very
compelling moonshot practical
application as a consequence they
culminate they have to culminate in
demonstration they can't just culminate
in theory or PowerPoint or a lab demo so
so the the DARPA mantra is is that we do
demonstrations at a convincing scale and
what that means is that the
demonstration has to retire all the key
technical business and market risks
demonstrations at convincing scale is a
weird phrase but it's an important one
it means that project ara has higher
stakes than Google's other moonshot
projects like self-driving cars or
Internet blasting balloons by this time
next year the eight F group has to
actually prove that AR can work it has
to have a critical mass of module
developers and potential consumers in
fact they're targeting the five billion
people who don't yet have a smartphone
if they can pull it off it could be a
huge deal hardware manufacturers won't
have to try to convince giant phone
makers to include their parts on
big-name phones they can just sell them
directly to consumers consumers won't
have to throw away their old phones when
they want to upgrade and the H app team
well they're going to have to find
another crazy problem to tackle project
RL will be handed off to Google and
Eremenko we're moving on to the next
moonshot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
