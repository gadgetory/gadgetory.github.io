full day in space that's because early
tomorrow morning the NASA probe will
plunge into Saturn's atmosphere where it
will burn up and break apart but don't
worry this is supposed to happen three
two one and liftoff of the Cassini
spacecraft on a billion mile trek to
Saturn Cassini has been whirling around
Saturn and its many icy moons for 13
years now launched in 1997 the probe
traveled through space for seven years
before reaching Saturn in 2004 since
then Cassini has taken various paths
around the planet shifting orbits
numerous times to fly close by certain
targets its flight path looks kind of
like a big ball of yarn but that
complicated route has enabled Cassini to
make some big discoveries we now know
there's an ocean under the crust of
Saturn's moon Enceladus and that those
waters may even be habitable we also
know that earth-like processes happen on
the moon Titan such as methane rainfall
that creates lakes and rivers and there
are the photos stunning iconic views of
Saturn and its rings taken in vivid
detail by the Cassini's onboard camera
there's even a shot of Earth from
Saturn's perspective but Cassini's time
at Saturn was never meant to last the
spacecraft has limited fuel onboard and
eventually the mission team was always
going to lose the ability to maneuver
the vehicle in space and NASA doesn't
want to risk Cassini contaminating the
Saturn system both Enceladus and Titan
could Harbor life but we'd never know
for sure if the probe accidentally
wandered too close and exposed one of
the moons earth microbes so the Cassini
team came up with a unique way to
dispose of the vehicle the grand finale
in April the engineers maneuvered
Cassini into a new orbit that took the
vehicle into the gap between Saturn and
its famous rings it's an area the
vehicle had never been before and it
allowed NASA to get some up-close
measurements of Saturn and its
atmosphere Cassini has completed 22 of
these grand finale orbits so far and
with each orbit the spacecraft has
gotten a little gravitation
nudge from Saturn's moon Titan then on
Monday Cassini passed by Titan one final
time getting a gravitational goodbye
kiss that put the vehicle on a crash
course with Saturn now Cassini is headed
for Saturn's atmosphere no matter what
but NASA is going to get as much as it
can out of the spacecraft before it's
lost just before the dive the mission
team is going to roll the vehicle so
that its instruments point towards
Saturn's atmosphere while its antenna
points toward Earth that way
Cassini can send back its data on
Saturn's atmosphere in real time before
it finally inevitably burns up on entry
after it's gone though there's going to
be a lot of data to process heck it may
even take years for scientists to fully
decode all the information Cassini
captures during its last orbits and dive
into Saturn's atmosphere so the work
isn't done yet still tomorrow is going
to be a bittersweet moment for the
mission team which has been working with
this spacecraft for over a decade I for
one I'm not ready to say goodbye
