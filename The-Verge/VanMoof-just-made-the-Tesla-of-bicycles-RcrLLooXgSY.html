big city it's economical it's good for
your health but it's not without its
hardships you have a long commute or a
long way to go you can leave yourself
tired and sweaty and you're always
worried about your bike or parts of your
bike being stolen those are problems
that a Dutch company called vanmoof are
trying to solve when these two bikes
come to the United States this year we
try to completely redevelop the bike we
think it's strange that in the world
there are 10,000 engineers approximately
I don't know but approximately 10,000
engineers working to make racing bikes a
little bit lighter to make a mountain
bike more sturdy but only I guess 10
engineers are working to get a better
city bikes and we think that with new
technology and we can improve commuter
bikes so more people will start
commuting now that all starts with this
which is the electrified s it's the
company's flagship bike now it's
important to know this bike is electric
assisted that means you can't just power
the electric motor there's no throttle
or anything what it does is it helps you
as you pedal which is nice on a small
slope or steeper Hills like we're
heading up right now instead of being
exhausted by the end of the ride up this
hill I'm actually gonna feel really good
because it just makes pedaling so much
easier and there are different power
modes you can go from just a little bit
of assist to a lot and a lot makes it go
really fast
it assists up to 32 kilometers an hour
which is I think 21 miles per hour and
if you want to go faster you have to
pedal faster but that is the level that
it will assist you you can change the
amount of power that the motor delivers
to the bike too so you can have a little
or a lot and there's even a button
underneath the handlebar that'll give
you a bit of a boost you want to go
faster at any given moment all of that
is powered by an electric motor and a
battery that are actually inside the
tubes of the bike we have one of the
biggest batteries in the entire bike
industry it's like a 420 watt hour
battery and with that you have a range
of approximately 75 miles so you can
ride 75 miles electric assisted before
you have to charge it again what's
strange and really good about the
electric motor in here and the electric
assist is that it's not overpowering it
really doesn't kick in until you're
about half a pedals through and even
then it eases in it doesn't jerk you
forward and even this little boost
button here can give you a little bit of
a jolt but it's not going to thrill you
and scare you now it's nice if the bike
is it's not like some luxurious ride
with a bunch of shocks or anything it
actually kind of hurts when you hit
bumps just like a normal bike it's not
like the most luxurious experience ever
but it is a really nice ride especially
because you're not tiring yourself out
like you normally would now this bike
isn't just about the electric motor it's
also about a whole suite of smart
features and what that really hinges
around is making sure that you never
lose your bike that starts with an
integrated lock that you could activate
from your smartphone or from a little
key fob you can put on your keychain
after that you've also got wireless
connectivity which means that anytime
your bike gets stolen you can just hit a
button in the app and tell vanmoof that
it's stolen and they'll be able to track
it down for you
this sort of find your bike feature yes
it's something that I can pull up right
in the app or is do I need
like a stoning you you open that and you
report bike your bike stolen and then we
have a 24-hour support desk around the
globe and we will start finding your
bike back by ourselves so it's not
directly that you open the app and see
where it is but we will help you find it
find it back and so you talk about them
with being something that will change
the way people compete with bikes and
things like that up until now people
have only seen the electric ride s and
it looks like this very premium thing
it's got the electric assist cost a
decent amount of money yeah so up to now
we still have the smart bikes and the
stupid bikes no we have the smart mics
and the regular bikes and we want to but
we believe that in any couple of years
all the bikes will have the smart
features so we will be able to track
every bike back we sell and that's
really where this comes in this is the
smart bike this is essentially the same
thing as the electrified s just without
the electric motors it has all the same
smart components the security features
and everything else
it comes in a lighter frame and it costs
about $1,000 less now these bikes aren't
just unique because of what they can do
then we've also basically built them
from the ground up instead of picking
parts off the shelf and putting them
together they've built them custom with
a purpose and it really shows in the way
that they ride and just the overall
experience now that comes at a price
this one retails about 3,000 and this
one retails at about 2,000 so you're
gonna have to really buy into the idea
if you want these bikes but after
spending some time with these bikes I
can see why people would want to make
that investment I bought my bike off the
street for a couple hundred bucks
basically expecting it to get stolen at
some point if I knew that that wasn't
going to happen or that if it did and I
was able to get that bike back I'd
probably want to make that investment
too
