identify Russian interference we're
doing more we're requiring everyone
requiring I'm running political and
issue ads or running large pages to be
verified with a government ID we're
making ads more transparent by the end
of this year we will have 20,000 people
working on security and content review
at Facebook we are focused on fighting
fake news more broadly so a lot of the
work over the last year and a half has
been bringing on more and more
fact-checking partners all around the
world in different countries who speak
all of the different languages that we
need to cover I also want to talk about
data privacy and what happened with
Cambridge analytic I was a major breach
of trust so we need to make sure that
this never happens again
so we're taking a number of steps here
first as you all know we're restricting
the data that developers will be able to
request from people second we need to
make sure that we find any other bad
apps that are out there so we're
currently in the process of
investigating every single app that had
access to a large amount of people's
information before we made these big
changes in 2014 so we're working on a
simple control where you can clear your
browsing history what you've clicked on
the websites you visited and so on and
we're gonna call it clear history you're
gonna be able to use this tool to see
the information about the apps and
websites you've been directed with
you'll be able to clear all this
information from your account and you'll
even be able to turn it off having this
information stored with your account
going forward so today we are announcing
a new set of features coming soon around
dating there's gonna be for building
real long term relationships all right
not just hookups if you want you can
make a dating profile and we've designed
this with privacy and safety in mind
from the beginning you're only gonna be
suggested people who are not your
friends
this is Jennifer she's just moved to
Chicago she's interested in dating
the first thing she would do here is set
up a dating profile once she's done that
she can go browse events and groups this
will let her see things in the city and
groups related to her interests then she
can browse people
were there say she wants to talk to Jay
she'll start a conversation with a photo
from his profile then if he wants to
respond they'll do so in a private
messaging inbox connected to the profile
now let's talk about Instagram we're
announcing video chat and Instagram
you're gonna be able to just tap on a
new camera icon right in the the top of
any direct thread that you have and
you're gonna build a video chat
one-on-one or with groups you're gonna
be able to minimize the video while
you're chatting and using Instagram so
here I am in Instagram first I'll swipe
over to direct because that's where I
already have conversations with my
closest friends now let's say it's
Saturday and I'm trying to figure out
where we should go to brunch I tap this
button to start a video chat and soon
we're all able to hang out together now
let's pretend I'm looking for some
inspiration for where we should go I
topped this button and soon the video
player is minimized I swipe on over to
feed and at this point people can still
see and hear me but don't worry they
can't see my screen now once I find
somewhere I want to go I hit share and
then I send it back to the thread so my
friends could give their input now I can
share a sticker of whatever I'm
listening to directly to Instagram from
my Spotify app now anyone can also share
their latest GoPro footage directly to
IG as well now Explorer is organized
into topic channels based on your
personal interests and tastes we're
taking our Comment filtering technology
even further by launching a bullying
filter that hides language intended to
harass or upset people now let's talk
about whatsapp we're announcing that
we're bringing group video calling to
whatsapp soon too we're excited to share
the group calling is also coming to
whatsapp in the coming months ahead
where you can get together with friends
and family regardless of where you are
in the world
the big news I have to share today is
oculus co is shipping today
next is oculus venues which is going to
be your ticket to live social events in
VR like concerts sports comedy nights
and movie screenings you get to sit in
this awesome VR MP theater with
thousands of people and watch premium
events together like soccer live in a
hundred and eighty degrees we have a
great lineup of live event partners
coming to oculus venues live concerts
from AEG Live games from the MLB and the
NBA movie screenings from Lionsgate plus
comedy nights and tons of entertainment
from next vr that's oculus go for 199
you get access to over 1,000 apps and
games we're also launching a version of
oculus go with double the storage memory
64 gigabytes for 249 now if you have
some photos from your childhood home we
can now use computer vision to fill in
the gaps with this pointillism effect
and recreate the rooms of your childhood
home where you grew up so you're gonna
vote to go into VR with your family and
visit and feel like you are right there
it feels like you're in a dream it is
wild so this work of mapping out
immersive spaces is just another
important step on the path to creating
this real feeling of presence so first
let's talk about creating moments we're
doing this with interactive 3d posts on
Facebook with one tap you can bring a 3d
object into Facebook camera using our AR
technology this means you can grab a 3d
object right out of newsfeed and bring
it straight into your world and it's
launching next month moving objects into
VR takes this experience to an even more
immersive and meaningful level with a
simple 360 photo of her kitchen
and that 3d mixer object the virtual gen
can give me a tour this summer we're
rolling out 3d photos you simply take a
picture with your smartphone and upload
it to Facebook as a 3d photo so let's do
this
let's keep building together there's
never been a more important time for it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
