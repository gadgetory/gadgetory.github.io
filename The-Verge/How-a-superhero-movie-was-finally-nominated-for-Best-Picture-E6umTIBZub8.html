a Best Picture Oscar, and
that's a really big deal.
Just 10 years ago, The
Dark Knight was snubbed
for a Best Picture nomination.
It was a huge blow to superhero fans,
highlighting the gap between popular films
and award-winning prestige films.
The public outcry led the
Academy of Motion Pictures
to expand its Best Picture
nomination category
from five films to 10.
Still, it took 10 years
before a superhero movie
found its way into the Best Picture arena.
- I am not dead.
- So what happened between
2009 and this year's
Black Panther nomination?
To understand, we have to
look at The Big Picture.
The term &quot;blockbuster&quot; as a
reference to a hit movie
dates back to the 1940s,
but Steven Spielberg's
1975 thriller Jaws gave
it a whole new definition.
The summer it was
released, people lined up
around city blocks trying to get tickets.
It dominated the box office all summer.
In May 1977, Star Wars: A New
Hope was a similarly huge hit.
The era of the summer
blockbuster had arrived.
Every major studio wanted a
piece of the summer action.
The new breed of blockbusters
didn't often compete
for Best Picture at the Oscars,
but they would win things
like Best Visual Effects
or Costume Design.
But summer blockbuster season
is starting to disappear.
Now, big-budget escapist
spectacles come out all year round.
2019 is poised to be one of
the biggest blockbuster years,
with an adventure-packed calendar
that spans all 12 months—
a lot of which are superhero films.
But it wasn't always this way.
Since the 1980s, superhero
titles have increased
exponentially, and they only first started
appearing en masse in the early 2000s.
X-Men, The Hulk, and Sam
Raimi's three Spider-Man films
all skyrocketed to the
top of the box office,
breaking records and
setting a new tone for what
blockbuster films could do for studios.
Disney, seemingly realizing
what was happening
to the calendar year, made
some major investments.
It acquired Pixar, Marvel
Studios, and Lucasfilm
over the course of six years.
Warner Brothers also shifted its focus
toward grittier, more openly adult-focused
superhero movies.
By the time The Dark Knight
rolled around in 2008,
superhero movies were reaching a wider
and more dedicated audience.
It was the first time
the Academy was forced
to take notice of superhero movies
as Best Picture contenders.
People largely consider
the Dark Knight conundrum
as a snub because of the
intense fan backlash that arose.
The Dark Knight was hailed as
one of the most provocative
films of 2008, by both critics and fans,
who were used to cutesier,
more colorful movies.
- Why so serious?
- The Dark Knight turned
the genre on its head,
and kick-started a conversation about
what a superhero movie could achieve.
Marvel Studios has released
20 movies since then,
and its immense financial
success has pushed
Warner Brothers, Sony, and Fox to compete.
Superhero movies now
own every calendar spot,
meaning studios have to book openings
during the offseason
as well as the summer.
Black Panther, the first superhero movie
with a majority black cast,
opened in February 2018
and immediately started
breaking box-office records.
As superhero movies overtook film culture,
it became a wake-up call for the Academy,
which was already being
criticized as ignorant.
Conversations around promoting diversity
in mainstream films has
become a talking point
around the Oscars in recent years.
Movements like &quot;Oscars So White&quot; in 2016 —
when no black actor, writer, or director
was nominated in major
categories — forced the Academy
to radically change its own makeup.
The organization added
a wave of new members,
and looked outside its
usual nomination patterns.
But Black panther wasn't a shoo-in.
With the Oscars' steady and
dramatic decline in viewership
and anti-Oscar social media campaigns,
the Academy knew it was
time for another change.
It tried launching a &quot;Popular Film&quot; category
to acknowledge fan favorite movies,
without having to place them
in the Best Picture category.
It was similar to when the
Best Animated Feature category
was introduced.
But the Popular Film announcement
didn't go as planned.
The backlash was so immediate
that the Academy backed down
almost instantaneously.
People considered Black
Panther one of the best movies
of the year, not just the most popular.
They wanted to see it celebrated as such.
It took 10 years, but the Academy realized
that if they continued to
ignore superhero movies,
they'd be ignoring modern
movie culture as a whole.
They were celebrating
a version of Hollywood
that average moviegoers
weren't participating in.
They risked looking elitist.
Black Panther, which
was a monumental success
and one of the most culturally
groundbreaking movies
of the year, became the
ideal movie for the Academy
to regain its relevance.
But superhero movies aren't
the only new competition
for Best Picture.
Netflix also just got its
first Best Picture nomination
with Roma.
And actually, the
streaming service released
Bright with Will Smith, trying
to make a streaming version
of a summer blockbuster.
Disney plans to launch
its own streaming service
later in 2019, and will
be investing in more
big-budget content, and
so will competing services
like Amazon, Hulu, and Netflix.
Prepare for a whole
lot more superhero buzz
at the box office, and on your laptop,
and at awards shows.
Black Panther is just the start.
It took decades of superhero
movies to get here,
but this may be the beginning
of something much bigger.
Thanks for watching.

is actually forcing Netflix to change.
