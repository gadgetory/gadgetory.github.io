and give you a thumbs up in the oculus
rift and now I can finally do it motion
controls are one of the big things that
makes virtual reality a totally new
format and not just a fancy screen but
when oculus ship does rift headset this
spring its motion controllers weren't
ready it came with an Xbox one
controller which wasn't outright bad but
it felt limiting like the rift was
incomplete but just before the holidays
oculus has fixed that let's go back to
reality and take a look unlike
PlayStation Move or the vibes
controllers the oculus touch controllers
are molded for each hand powered by
disposable batteries on each one you'll
find a trigger for your forefinger and a
grip button that you'll squeeze by
making a fist like the Xbox one
controller it has a total of four face
buttons and two analog sticks plus
little buttons for menu options oculus
touch reflects your hand motion in a way
that's surprisingly close to just you
know using your hands for one thing
there are sensors all over each
controller so it can tell where your
hands are resting whether or not you're
pushing a button it can't articulate
every finger but it can guess that
you're giving somebody a thumbs up or
pointing your finger to poke something
in VR even when it's not serving a
gameplay purpose this is one of the
little things that makes touch intuitive
VR experiences still have to vastly
simplify your hand gestures
but it turns out that one of the
constants is picking things up and
holding them and touch does this really
well
closing your fingers around the grip
button really feels like grabbing
something in a way that's squeezing the
vive slightly awkward grip doesn't it's
a consistent standard that works across
almost every game and it leaves one
finger the one on the upper trigger free
for other interactions the analog sticks
can be used for anything from choosing a
teleportation spot to beaming objects
around and as with other motion
controllers you can wave touch to
simulate throwing a fireball waving to a
robot shooting a gun or just about any
other interaction the touch controllers
use a band of leds and the same external
tracking camera but the oculus rift uses
the box includes a second camera in
order to widen your range and oculus
suggest you stagger them three to seven
feet apart in front of you
after you set them up you draw a line
around your available space to create
what oculus calls the Guardian boundary
it's similar to the vise chaperone
except that instead of snapping into a
polygon the Guardian system directly
follows the shape of your line so try to
draw straight the two cameras can track
a wide range with excellent precision
but they can't track what they can't see
so touch them less reliable when you
turn around for true room-scale VR like
you can get on the vibe oculus tells you
to buy a third camera which is selling
for another $80 if you stick with games
on the oculus store this doesn't seem to
be much of an issue they're subtly
designed so you're almost always facing
forward even if you're teleporting all
around a map in a wizard duel or doing
slow-motion firefights and this gives
you a pretty good catalog the best games
we've seen aren't really long but
they're very playable and they're
polished in a way a lot of bad games are
even if a skills doesn't have some of
the big names so you will with psvr
oculus also has a great overall user
interface including things like its
avatars these slick stylized personas
that any riff developer can let you take
into their experience but motion
controls get a big head start on the
vibe so there are already a lot of games
designed around 360-degree tracking
we've seen some that work great on touch
but they feel specifically rift friendly
so others might set your controller
drifting in the default camera setup and
that's too bad because steamvr actually
supports oculus touch which makes the
rift into a pretty good substitute for
many five games I feel this touch gives
me confidence that we're not necessarily
going to have a VR platform war or at
least that I can enjoy just about every
PC virtual reality game without having
to buy both the rift and the vibe so the
biggest question isn't which one of
these platforms is better its whether
there will be enough development across
all platforms to make motion controlled
virtual reality of things oculus is
enthusiasms the funding games is a good
sign on this front but especially what
we're waiting to see how the whole touch
catalogue shapes up it's still an early
but if you're interested in the oculus
rift touches an absolutely integral
element even if it's sold separately I'm
sure we'll still see games that you use
a standard Xbox controller or the simple
oculus remote but it touches where
oculus is most interesting experiences
and some of the best VR experiences
period are shaping up it took years of
development to get it but this is the
oculus rift as it was meant to be at
least this generation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
