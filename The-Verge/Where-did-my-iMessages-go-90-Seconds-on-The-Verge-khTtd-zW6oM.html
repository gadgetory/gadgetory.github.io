one thing's for sure purgatory does
exist in its place full of lost I
messages I'm Nathan cycrin and this is
90 seconds on the verge Apple has
announced it plans on addressing the
notorious iMessage issue that leaves
many messages in limbo never to be seen
again here's what happens Apple's
default messaging app to text when two
iPhones are communicating and when that
happens messages are automatically sent
via I message this can happen over Wi-Fi
or cellular data and that saves you from
typical messaging fees and it works
alongside standard SMS the only visual
difference the blue versus green chat
bubble that means it when you're friends
with iPhones and texts and photos they
may continue to send via I message which
of course you never see and therein lies
the problem I message knows to send
iMessages when you're on an iPhone but
it doesn't know when to stop the problem
can be avoided if you turn off by
message before switching devices but
even then there's no guarantee it'll
work in a statement to recode apple says
it is fixed to server-side bug and that
it'll have additional fixes in a future
software update and the issue isn't even
anything new it's been happening since I
message was first released in 2011 but
recently frustrated users have been more
vocal life hackers Adam cash wrote about
it on his blog and separately an iphone
user in california sued apple last week
for losing her messages will apple's
next update finally bring an end to this
problem well years of lost iMessages
ever be found or will we forever be
trapped in a healthy relationship with
our iphone for more on iMessages check
out the verge coming up I discover I've
been doing this from purgatory the
entire time wait what</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
