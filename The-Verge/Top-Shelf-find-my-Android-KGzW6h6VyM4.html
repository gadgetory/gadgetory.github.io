smartphone is probably the worst they're
expensive they're precious and more
often than not they have a lot of our
personal data they're also thin small
and kind of slippery pretty easy to lose
their have stolen with an iPhone things
are really easy find my iphone is part
of the OS itself and you're prompted to
set it up from the minute you get your
device but with Android things are a bit
more complicated display Google's love
and cloud services it doesn't actually
offer you a way to track your lost phone
android is open now and it gives a
company's a way to do even more than
what you can do with your iPhone and I
guess we're gonna try some of them now
lookout is really the gold standard for
this kind of thing it has tons of
features and matches all of apple's
offerings it can even take a picture of
someone who tried to unlock your phone
and email it over to you the only catch
is that for these features you're gonna
have to pay to ninety-nine a month or
2999 a year there are cheaper options
though cerberus lets you record photos
and audio and even check for
unauthorized sim cards in your phone
where's my droid is also free but it's
more designed for when you've lost your
phone in your house or in the couch
cushions as opposed to when it's been
stolen or lost far away ultimately there
are plenty of reasons why you might
never get your phone back that's why
it's a good idea to turn on automatic
uploads to Dropbox for your camera and
make sure you're always backing things
up to Google you'll be able to restore a
lot of apps and data to any new phone
you get though unfortunately it won't
get everything so look this may be harsh
but the thing is devices come and go
sometimes by choice other times by
chance the most important thing as
always is to make sure your data stays
protected this is mine
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
