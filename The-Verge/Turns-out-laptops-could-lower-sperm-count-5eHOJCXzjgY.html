or are you more of a desk person I'm
almost always at a desk working but
sometimes I decide to work for my couch
or bed and in those cases my laptop sits
on my lap I do worry though
could my laptop be killing my eggs maybe
if you're a dude is it affecting your
sperm I really don't know so of course I
took my questions to some experts laptop
you shouldn't have any negative impact
on fertility that's dr. John Emory an
endocrinologist at the University of
Washington Medical Center who
specializes in male fertility and dr.
Sarah Vaughan and OBGYN an infertility
fellow at Stanford says the same thing
about fertility for women at this point
there haven't been enough real
definitive studies for us to recommend
patients again using lab that all right
so if this is the case why are we all so
worried about these laptops people's
main concerns when it comes to laptops
our external heat and radiation let's
talk about Heat first because that's
real radiation isn't really a thing but
we'll get into it so women in men's
bodies handle heat differently men's
testicles around the outside of the body
because they're sensitive to temperature
and require a cooler environment for
sperm production dr. Michael Eisenberg a
urologist and professor at Stanford
explain to me how the heat a laptop
produces could affect the male body
testicles are outside the body because
need to be a little cooler than the rest
of the body so anything that warms a
moment can be an issue and laptops can
certainly do that he cited an older
study that showed the laptops could
raise the testicle temperature a
centigrade but that was a long time ago
and laptops have improved since then
still and generally tell men to kind of
avoid it dr. Eisenberg isn't super
worried about laptops and their effect
on sperm but if someone struggles with
fertility
it might be worth eliminating even the
smallest of risk factors so it's
unlikely that laptop is gonna be the
whole story but as ganas work and I'm
putting together our plan to sort of
improve things it can be one component
both he and dr. Emory brought up an
issue with hot tubs
they say that studies show that a man
sitting in 110 degree hot tub for 30
minutes will experience a decrease in
their sperm count the temperature
affects their testicles and because
sperm takes two to three months to make
they might not see the results of this
issue until months later but dr. emre
says that's extreme heat for a prolonged
period
your laptop doesn't get up to 110
degrees temperatures that you would
achieve having a laptop even if it were
close enough to your testicles and most
laptops I'm patting my thighs but mostly
the laptop from their side the amount of
radiant heat that goes is delivered to
the testicles as well below that though
I would say myth for women their ovaries
which house their eggs are inside the
bodies that insulates them from external
heat factors they can sit in a hot tub
and not worry about the state of their
eggs
although pregnant women should not sit
in hot tubs but the ovaries unlike the
testicles are not external they're very
much internal they're very much
protected by the abdomen in the pelvis
in a way that testicles are not so I
don't worry too much about the
theoretical risk it's certainly not
something that I bring up with patients
doctors even recommend that women use
heating pads when they have cramps
during their period so laptops heat wont
negatively affect them in fact maybe it
could even help with cramps maybe
because the ovaries are just so
protected and they eat you know that we
use from heating pads has been used for
a very long time again these
recommendations change once a woman is
pregnant dr. Vaughn notes that pregnant
women shouldn't put direct heat over the
baby which kind of seems like common
sense but you know I gotta clarify I
don't want any of you pregnant we've
been putting heat on your baby so please
do not do that
okay so the heat from laptops won't
affect women's eggs and probably won't
really affect men's sperm although dr.
Eisenberg still says men should use a
desk if they're extremely worried what
about radiation the amount of radiation
that you can get from a laptop is really
pretty minimal it's probably about the
same amount of radiation you would get
flying across the country that's right
you're exposed to some radiation when
you fly and you're fine healthy human
dr. Vaughn said something along the same
lines but my guess is that laptops emit
radiation that's probably on the level
of radiation that you just get exposed
to and you're in the world
she also said women are allowed to have
x-rays even when they're pregnant so a
laptop can't be worse than that you're
probably fine
dr. Eisenberg though is always worried I
certainly talked to men about it's sort
of a theoretical risk and again as we're
looking at kind of the whole picture it
may contribute somewhat so I certainly
if it's easy and they can do it it's
probably
better or laptop to be on a desk rub and
in a lot he basically sees it as why
risk it we don't think men's sperm will
be destroyed by a laptop on their lap
but it's also not that hard to just use
a test really what you really need to
worry about our actual come behaviors
that effects birth there are other
threats to male fertility that are much
less esoteric and laptop we know that
you know drug use particularly opiate
will decrease reproduction you know
marijuana is an issue for male fertility
you know alcoholism it's not great for
fertility I'll probably keep using my
laptop on my lap because my eggs are
nice and safe tucked into my body there
chillin they're doing great but if you
worry about your fertility or have
experienced issues particularly if
you're a man maybe invest in a
comfortable reclining desk it's like
you're laying down but your laptops heat
isn't directly on you a regular desk
works just fine too
overall laptops don't appear to be an
issue for fertility so go ahead be lazy
in bed with your laptop there are other
threats to male fertility that are much
less and the tariff and laptop we know
that you know drug use particularly
opiate will decrease reproduction you
know marijuana</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
