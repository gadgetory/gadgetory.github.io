Google's headquarters with the all-new
Nexus 9 this is the new Nexus tablet it
is made by HTC and it's it's a lot like
the Nexus 7 only bigger it's got a four
by three aspect ratio a new 8 megapixel
camera and inside is a new Tegra
processor the the k1 which supposedly
makes it super duper fast otherwise you
know it's a it's an Android tablet it's
got you know material design on the
Android lollipop so you can see all
these cards flipping about here and
other cards here you can even have
chrome up Chrome another apps up and
have multiple cards so you can have you
know switch between them if you've got
google docs open you can switch between
different google docs so they're really
looking at this as sort of a
professional productive device it's a
little bit thicker than the iPad air
it's got dual speakers though so it's
gonna be pretty loud and you know even
though it's a little bigger than say the
iPad Mini it still feels pretty portable
although you're not exactly gonna stick
this thing in your pocket so the funny
thing about the Nexus 9 is it's kind of
an in-betweener normally you think of a
tablet it's either a real big iPad or a
little small you know iPad Mini or Nexus
7 this is in between that and so while
it's pretty good for movies it's got a
four by three aspect ratio for reading
or for doing stuff in the web it's sort
of hard to know how to think of this as
a super portable tablet is this a
high-end premier tablet it's a little
bit of both and maybe that's what you're
looking for if you are it starts at 399
for the 16 gig version but you should
probably step up to the 32 gig version
which is 479
so there it is the Nexus 9 it's
available in Wi-Fi and LTE directly from
Google in the Play Store
