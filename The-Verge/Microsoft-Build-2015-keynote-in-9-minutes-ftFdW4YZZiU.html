I'm challenging the creativity the
ingenuity that you all bring to build
new and great things on top of platform
innovations that we make available to
you what you will hear us talk about in
this conference and even in this
morning's keynote is perhaps the
broadest lens through which reviewed
developers development and platforms
this up until now there's been two main
ways that you can really write music
traditionally using pen and paper which
is very creative maybe not that
convenient sometimes or the digital way
which is very laborious to input but
very convenient once it's in that form
so staff that is handwriting recognition
for music notation let's just take the
pen and I'm gonna start writing in the
bar so it's very natural as I move into
the next bar the music notation is
recognized and turned into a great
notation thank you so how about we get
started by talking about how we're
moving from office from us to office
with partners let's talk about making a
presentation and when I'm doing this I
of course want a constant source of
high-quality professional photographs
that I can integrate into my slide deck
pick at me is a relatively new company
that is building just such a service and
it's provided an add-in here that lets
me search through the photos in those
surveys and paste them directly within
PowerPoint so here's an add-in that uber
has built that I can set an uber ride
reminder to show up ahead of time and
make sure that I get to where I need to
go as we switch over here to the iPhone
and it sets my pickup location the cool
thing is that it got my destination
because that lived in Outlook so I look
knew where I needed to be and now uber
knows where I need to go
it helps me search and discover the
content that my colleagues are using
there's something funny going on Oh keep
going I know you all waited very
patiently to hear about Windows and it's
now time to talk about Windows our goal
is that within two to three years of
Windows 10 s release there will be 1
billion devices running Windows 10 you
see the USA TODAY's live tile from their
new Universal windows application the
application uses our standard standard
platform controls so it resizes and
reflows as the application is resized on
the desktop and here it is running on
the Xbox filter down to just video so an
investment in this one
Universal Windows application they now
have phones tablets PCs interactive
television all covered with one code
base in one app my name is Technica
Garlin and one of the project leaders
working on the technology that will
enable you to build great Windows apps
by reusing a lot of the code you have
written for Android here I have an
Android device and on it I am running
that choice hotels up there I'm going to
switch to Windows Phone
I am also running the choice hotels app
this app is reusing the code you just
saw running on the other device you can
see that the windows graphics in touch
just work and in tomorrow's keynote we
will show you how you can light up your
apps experience with native windows
features such as live tiles and with
Microsoft services so today we're
announcing that you will be able to
compile the same objective-c code that's
being used in iOS applications within
Visual Studio on Windows great syntax
highlighting support for you'd expect
from visual studio including
highlighting all of the weirdness of
objective-c
and now we can debug it and execute this
tablet app on Windows I want to show you
some of the work we've been doing to
continue to tweak the design and improve
the visuals and the interaction we've
got the most used apps here we're
putting File Explorer settings power all
apps at the bottom we're bringing jump
lists back in so you can see here's File
Explorer with jump lists and this will
work for other apps as well thank you
project Spartan project Spartan you know
I have to admit our PR team has been
giving me and us a hard time because
they say it's not a great idea to keep
saying project Spartan when that's not
really the name of the weapon would you
like to hear the name of the new web
browser in Windows 10 ok let's run the
video
Microsoft edge is the browser built for
Windows 10 now I get the pleasure to
show you how to do incredible things
with Windows on no screens at all
Windows holographic embraces this notion
of experiencing life in three dimensions
by mixing digital content writing to
your world now before we start let me
explain the set up a little bit
Darren is wearing at Parliament and he
sees this globe open we showed you in
January right in his world now we also
have this custom camera rig over here so
that you can see the Holograms up on
these screens as if the camera is
wearing a hololens now when we introduce
Windows holographic the globe was just a
slide today Darren is experiencing it as
a universal Windows app and guess what
it's running on Windows 10 welcome to
Windows holographic these are simply
Universal windows apps that were placed
as Holograms I'm going to pull up my
holographic Start menu and I'm gonna
open up Skype I'm gonna pin them to this
wall right here that way every time I
walk into this room I'll see their
smiling faces and be inspired to reach
out to them yeah so all I need to say is
follow me now wherever I go in my house
my entertainment tags along I simply
place it and I can scale it as big as I
want
now mark is part of a team from Case
Western in the Cleveland Clinic we
invited them to use Windows holographic
to advance medical education beyond what
is possible with today's
state-of-the-art using holograms we can
easily separate and focus in on
individual systems for example we can
focus in on the femur and students can
immediately see some of the types of
fractures they may one day encounter in
the clinic let's learn a little bit more
about this amazing magical device that
is microsoft hololens we envisioned an
all-in-one device that is untethered
with built-in batteries hands-free and
floating on you you have to come up with
holographic you know because you're
constantly producing data every single
millisecond the enclosure wraps around
their users head to provide greater
weight distribution we have so many
sensors on this product to read all
those in real time and to do that in a
very power efficient way requires the
power of what they developed with the
new version of Windows please help me
welcome on stage my very good friend
miko b15 wake up up
say hello to the real b15 b15 control
panel this facial UI system is a
universal Windows app see you later Alex
later guys at the core of our company is
empowerment empowering us all thank you
and have a great rest of bill thank you
very very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
