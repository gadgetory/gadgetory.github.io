verge it is CES 2016 and i am here with
adam wilson the co-founder and chief
scientist of spiro i don't thank you so
much for joining us thank you so much
for having me so let's talk about this
week obviously BBA has been out for a
little bit and how has it been so far
actually how has the BBA been so far the
bb-8 launch was absolutely incredible it
blew us away in every aspect from the
you know the fan reaction to just how
crazy everybody's been about it I want
talk about what you're here for now
which is the force band this is a
wearable you're working on yeah so you
know you can control the bb-8 through
your smartphone with a nap and drive it
around and have it patrol and stuff we
thought there is a cooler way to kind of
experience the force in a new way so we
want to make a wearable wristband you
could control the BBA through just that
why make your own word well why not
integrate this with like an Apple watch
or a samsung Smart Watch or something
like that I think just control over the
experience really and the whole Apple
watching Samsung watch those are pretty
expensive items and and I don't think a
lot of children are going to be running
around with those so it gives like it
gives the accessibility to like the you
know the lower price range and what is
the price range we haven't described it
yet but we're working really hard on
making that it you know affordable for
everybody okay perfect um what's
interesting about this so is this gonna
work with the other spirit products as
well is this something we can kind of
say is get going toward the future this
is what's Pharaoh wants to try let's say
sphere is going to try other wearable
items at this band is specifically for
the experience of the Star Wars bb-8
droid so this one's tied directly to
this and only to this but sphere on
general you know we're going to get much
better making wearables after we put
this into the market and we'll probably
make a wearable for the rest of our
products and i will talk a little more
serious business journal because
obviously BB is not your first product
at all and you guys are going through a
much other phases basically what you had
before the big flagships pharaoh was the
ball without the head i was saying it's
done very well like this but when you
going forward do you see more these I
kind of branded ideas or something like
you really want take the company are you
looking to like also kind of keep the
key to your roots and we're gonna do
both we've realized that we're pretty
good at bringing characters to life we
can bring a character to life in a way
that I don't think other people have so
we think that that's really important
for us to bring characters to life but
we also have a whole new
knology stack that we're going to be
pushing soon that it's just kind of the
next version of spirits the next version
of all of this stuff it was interested
me when you guys were announcing the BBA
we kind of met with you guys you made a
point talking about how this is not just
a toy this is a robot this is something
we see has more than just entertainment
purposes can you talk me where I'm like
what that means for like spheres road
map where were you guys gonna see taking
your products yeah I think um you know
put the head on and all of a sudden
everybody thinks he's super cute and
he's a cute little friend or a companion
or something and that's almost like the
match of what you when you talk to
somebody about an animal or a pet or
like a cat or a dog they have that same
feeling they can't really explain why
they think it's still cute and why they
love it so much so that's part of what
we're trying to like really really focus
in on it's like those characteristic
personalities of the robot what else did
it can we expect from zero um we haven't
announced any of our other products but
those will probably be at CES next year
so you know we'll be able to give a
sneak peek of what that is but you can
just expect it to be really the next
version of what we would do you know
we've kind of reached the maximum of
character potential in a robot ball so
there's gonna be more from us well I
don't think you so much for joining us
