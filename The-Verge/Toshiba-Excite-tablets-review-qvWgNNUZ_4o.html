these are Toshiba's new excite tablets
the excite 7.7 the excite 10 and the
excite 13 they're mostly replacing till
she was old thrive tablets which were
big and clunky and they're designed to
basically be something for everyone the
hardware for all three tablets is pretty
much the same they all have aluminum
bodies and plastic backs that kind of
feel dimpled like a golf ball and
they're all silver and black and so they
look nice all together but you probably
won't be buying all three they're all
surprisingly thin and light which is
nice though the 13-inch are is pretty
monstrous just because it's a 13-inch
tablet
the biggest difference between the three
models other than just sheer size are
the ports on the Excite 7.7 you get a
microSD slot plus micro USB and on the
Excite 10 and 13 you get a full SD slot
plus micro HDMI plus all the other stuff
from the Excite 7.7 and the rest of the
hardware is basically the same you get
two decent cameras one facing the back
and one facing the front two decent
speakers that points sound directly
downwards so it'll get kind of muted by
your lap or a table but the sound is
pretty solid and power and volume
buttons that feel kind of flimsy but
work pretty well the other big
difference obviously is the displays the
Excite 13 has a 1600 by 900 LCD which is
fine so the colors are a little washed
out and contrast isn't great but it's
sharp the Excite 10 has the same LCD at
1280 by 800 which is pretty much
standard for a 10-inch Android tablet
and it really just looks like every
other tablet we've seen the Excite 7.7
though has a seven point seven inch 1280
by 800 AMOLED display and it looks
amazing it's just like the one in the
Galaxy Tab 7.7 it has super dark blacks
and super white White's great contrast
and color saturation really good viewing
angles just looks fantastic in terms of
software and performance all three are
basically the same
they run Android 4.0 point-three with
almost no customization beyond a handful
of bloatware apps runs Android pretty
well there's nothing special but no real
problems that we've seen before and
that's actually the whole story that
these tablets performance is solid
without being overly impressive NVIDIA
Tegra 3 processor powers all three
tablets and it's great it's the same as
we've seen on a lot of isuzu's tablets
and it's just a really solid to have a
processor videos look good and games run
really well the biggest problems gaming
was on the Excite 13 just because the
screen is so large it's actually hard
to reach the on-screen controls with
your thumbs sometimes and that's not
really a problem with performance it's
just kind of an awkward software of
quirk battery life is also pretty good
on all three and it gets better as you
go to larger screen sizes but what's
really interesting about this whole
lineup is how it segments tablet users
the Excite 13 seems kind of ridiculous
at first but if you just want to watch a
lot of movies or do some web browsing
and don't ever want to carry your tablet
around it actually makes a lot of sense
it has a big screen it's easy to use it
has good viewing angles and long battery
life but it's certainly not portable the
seven-point-seven on the other hand is
super portable and has an amazing screen
it's really great for reading or using
in one hand but it's not so good for
gaming or watching movies just because
the screen is a lot smaller the Excite
10 is kind of an odd middle ground but
maybe that's a good thing it's still
fairly portable especially since it's so
thin and light but it's also big enough
to be pretty good for movies and it kind
of makes clearer than ever that if you
want an all-around tablet ten inches is
probably about the right size in the 10
inch range there are so many other good
options like the transformer prime or
the iPad that it's hard to recommend the
Excite 10 especially at four hundred and
forty nine dollars which is kind of
right in the middle of the market the
Excite 7.7 is $499 which is really
expensive for a seven-inch tablet it's
more than twice the price of the Kindle
Fire or the new Galaxy Tab 2 the Excite
13 which starts at six hundred and forty
nine dollars with 32 gigs of storage the
other two come with 16 is also pretty
expensive but if you want a 13 inch
tablet that looks kind of like a
surfboard then you really don't have
another choice so you should definitely
buy the Excite 13</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
