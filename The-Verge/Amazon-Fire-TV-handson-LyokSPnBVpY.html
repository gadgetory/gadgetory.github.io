we're looking at Amazon's new fire TV
home entertainment box this is a very
similar box to something like you might
be familiar with a Roku or an Apple TV
it's about a five inch square device
very simple looking very monolithic
simple ports on the back for USB
Ethernet you got your optical audio out
and HDMI and power and inside it's got a
quad core processor two gigs of RAM
Wi-Fi connectivity and bluetooth
connectivity but other than that that's
the hardware the box you actually use
this box with this wireless remote which
talks to it through bluetooth it's got a
simple circular up-down left-right basic
controls and this voice search button
which we'll take a look at in a minute
optionally you can add the game
controller to the system which will let
you play games gives you a very similar
experience to might you have on a
Playstation or an Xbox with the dual
joysticks trigger buttons here on the
back wireless controller that's going to
sell as a separate price for about 39.99
we've got a very fast fluid interface
that Amazon is using it looks very
similar to the Amazon fire tablets
interface if you've used a Fire HD or
anything like that before you got access
to movies TV you access your Amazon
Prime watchlist all your video library
there's games on here like we mentioned
earlier some really impressive graphics
that we saw during the demos earlier of
asphalt 8 and an amazon published game
called 7-0 then you've got different
apps which you can access as well you
can access your Amazon Cloud photos too
everything is very fast responsive
Amazon is positioning this as a high
performance version of a home
entertainment system we're not going to
expect the lag that we see on other
devices like a Roku or other things that
frequently can be frustrating to use
just because they're not as slow and
responsive one of the things that
they're doing to make it easier to use
at home is the voice search with the
remote so you can do things like Ender's
Game
Ender's Game
let's try to forget them duck dynasty
there you go it does very quick voice
type of search so you can pull up things
without having to type in anything into
the screen itself which makes your life
a lot easier when you're at home on your
couch in your living room Amazon is
actually selling that's starting today
the price of the box is $99.99 and as
mentioned earlier you can get the
optional game controller for $39.99</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
