Chromebooks the state of them right now
is both amazing and kind of terrible
here's what's amazing in the education
market you can get really cheap
Chromebooks that do way more than you
expect but in the terrible camp Google's
been trying to push the state of the art
for with partners and the hardware
hasn't gone that well Google is also
trying to get Android apps to work well
on Chrome OS and that also is it working
most of all we haven't had a true
flagship spare no expense Chromebook
since the Chromebook pixel - which was
two years ago spare no expense you say
how about a Google made Chromebook that
starts at a thousand bucks and can go
all the way up to 1650 it's this the
pixel book and I can't tell if it's
taking in Windows or the iPad or what
but I can tell you it's a pretty
incredible piece of hardware now this is
a laptop and laptops mean specs and so
we have to start there basically if
you're hoping for a high-end laptop spec
there's actually a pretty good chance
that it's here the base thousand dollar
model comes with an Intel i5 processor
the seventh-generation KB link that's
paired to eight gigs of ram which is
quite a lot for a Chromebook and there's
also 128 gigs of storage which is also a
lot for a Chromebook the touch screen is
twelve point three inches in a three by
two aspect ratio which works out to 2400
by 1600 pixels there's two USB C ports a
headphone jack a backlit keyboard and a
battery that Google says is good for
around 10 hours of mixed use there is no
SD card slot though if you want you can
drop money on a faster processor more
RAM and more storage all the way up to
that 1650 for an i7 16 gigs of RAM and
512 gigs of storage you can also spend
an extra 99 bucks on this all new pixel
pen which is a Wacom style stylus with
pressure and angle sensitivity it lasts
for about a year on a simple quad a
battery the pixel book weighs just under
two and a half pounds and it's only ten
millimeters thick and get this there are
no fans even on the top tier processor
those are the specs which are important
because if $1,000 chromebook didn't have
top dollar specs that would be
bad now let's talk about design damn if
this isn't one very good-looking
well-made laptop it's entirely aluminium
and it shares some of the design with
the pixel phones because it has this
glass shade on the back for the Wi-Fi
antennas when you have it closed it
looks pretty much like a solid hunk of
aluminum except for the hinge and this
indentation for the keyboard the palm
rests are made out of as Google calls it
advanced silicone but they're
comfortable to rest on and they also
protect the screen from the keyboard
when you flip it around they also double
as anti skid feet the trackpad is glass
and it feels just right the keyboard has
0.8 millimeters of key travel which
isn't very much but it feels much more
like a traditional keyboard than what
you'd get on say a MacBook or the
surface pro tablet and really I just dig
the aesthetics there's this symmetry
between the pad on the keyboard deck and
the shade on the lid this is a kind of
design that I think Google could stick
with for a very long time and I kind of
hope it does because it's great Google
is also introducing some big changes to
how chrome OS works on the pixel book
there's a new launcher that looks a
little bit nicer and it makes it easier
to distinguish between Android apps and
Chrome apps you still launch it with the
same key it's the one where your caps
lock usually is and it still has a good
old Google search field on it but
there's a whole new button on the
keyboard well okay technically there's
two but I'm not counting the hamburger
menu button that new button is the
Google assistant key Google assistant on
the pixel book works pretty much the
same as it does everywhere else you can
speak to it or you can type to it and
the assistant will respond audibly or
not depending on how you ask your
question one clever thing it doesn't the
pixel book though is it automatically
offers search suggestions based on
what's on your screen when you hit the
button but if you want you can opt out
of that you can also use the pixel pen
to circle stuff on your screen and then
the assistant can search for stuff based
on that too but for me the bigger deal
is that Android apps on Chrome OS are
finally finally coming out of beta
they're supposed to be a lot faster and
more stable now especially on this very
fast machine you can resize Android app
windows and generally just use them like
desktop apps and some companies like
Adobe and Microsoft are working really
hard to release versions of their
Android apps that work
on Chrome OS it has a 360 hinge so you
can put it into tablet mode but
unfortunately tablet mode still doesn't
support split screen apps and I'm gonna
have to test all of this to see if it
works as well as google claims but if
nothing else I'm glad that I finally
actually get to judge the quality of
Android apps on Chromebooks without
having to put a beta asterisk at the end
of it oh one more thing
if you have a pixel phone you can turn
on tethering automatically from the
Chromebook just like it works on Apple
laptops with iPhones I don't have quite
as much to say about the pixel pen I do
think it's need but it's another thing I
want to test before I can give it any
sort of final judgement one nice thing
about the pixel pen is you don't have to
pair it at all and you don't have to
plug it into any weird ports in the side
of your device to charge it I'm just not
sure if it's worth 99 bucks and I know
you're waiting for you to talk about the
price so let's address it I get the
feeling that Google is sorry not sorry
about the price if smart phones cost a
thousand bucks now why shouldn't a
Chromebook especially one that's this
good Google is confident in this thing
and it's gonna be selling it in stores
in the US everywhere starting October
31st so who on earth is this thing for
well it's the people that just want the
best thing and this is very clearly the
best Chromebook that you can get but
Google will also tell you that this is
about the future all your most important
apps are made for phones and the web
hopefully isn't going away anytime soon
and this device is built for that future
and if Google can make Android apps work
better on Chrome OS then that future
might actually come to pass</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
