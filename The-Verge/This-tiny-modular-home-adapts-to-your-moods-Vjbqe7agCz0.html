on
it's at the verge if you look at
construction and housing now
technologies and afterthought we want to
create a world where houses are made a
lot more like cars or iPhones one of the
things we're trying to do is not compete
against the typical high-rise or the
typical single-family home we're looking
in the areas in between we can extend
the casita to make it a couple of
bedrooms we can make disaster relief
modules workforce housing a talk idea
the casita is not for a particular
demographic it's more for psychographic
and it's folks that want to live lightly
and have home with them in a new kind of
way your home should feel like yours so
we wanted to create something that we
call moods so for example when you say
hey Alexa turn on cinema the TV turns on
the lights dimmed down the volume comes
up we want it to be the primary
interface between the user and the
casita when we first started we created
this board we caught and called it our
IOT board and the idea was we had a wide
range of categories of devices that we
knew we needed to integrate together to
provide this overall experience inside
the casita a lot of times those devices
don't communicate using the same
language we have reached into each one
of these technology platforms and built
software that bridges across them so
this is a low voltage enclosure box
it houses the brains of the casita so
when I talk about the brains I'm talking
about everything from the processor that
controls all of the devices one of the
unique things about it is that we have
complete programmable control over it so
that if we need to remotely power
devices on and off we have the ability
to
do it from a software perspective we are
aiming to be rolling a caseta out the
door every 57 seconds that's how fast my
quality guy rolled a Cadillac out the
door our first three are going in
backyards here in Austin long-term we
are aiming to go ultra dense and that
means taking these micro units putting
them on small pieces of land in the
urban core and going up the ultimate
mission of casita is to solve housing
for all and you can't just solve it by
just making a cheaper house or throwing
some IOT in it it's a very complicated
problem casita is a solution not just
for micro living but for living in
general and the way that we want to live
in the modern day and the near future
all right thanks for coming by now get
the out of my house
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
