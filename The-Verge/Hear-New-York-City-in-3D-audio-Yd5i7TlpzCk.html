it's gonna be pretty cool I mean it'll
be cool without them but trust me it'll
be a lot more cool if you put on
headphones a couple years ago I was on
the internet looking at pictures of
Radiohead in the studio because look at
me of course this guy's on the internet
looking at pictures of Radiohead in the
studio and I came across this picture of
Thom Yorke the lead singer playing piano
with this little mannequin head with a
hat on and little audio cables coming
out the ends of it and I was like what
is this thing
luckily there's an even nerdier person
on another Radiohead site who was like
this is a binaural microphone it's a
special type of microphone that has two
microphones embedded in the ears and
when played back on headphones it will
sound like Thom Yorke is in the room
with you playing piano just for you this
blew my mind I got extremely into
binaural audio and guess what listen to
this this is binaural audio right now if
you're wearing headphones
over here there's people walking on the
other side you should you get at car
honk
maybe they'll replace that in space cut
the other camera so well how we're doing
this is with this other microphone it's
not a mannequin head this is made by
three do and check this out get a little
close here so this looks like a real ear
and it actually flexes like a real ear
so it looks kind of funny but it
actually plays an important role and the
way we hear things before the sound gets
the microphone it bounces around all
these little surfaces and shapes sound
in the same way your ear would shape
sound before it reaches your eardrum
hello my dear you should be hearing me
on your left side right now and now you
should be hearing me on your right side
my dear initial googling zuv the keyword
binaural will lead to some goofy results
the most popular being binaural beats
now these aren't recorded with a
binaural mic they're just different
tones in different years meant to elicit
such things as creativity sleep
concentration sexual stimulation opening
your third eye all kinds of stuff it's
not really science but it is
pseudoscience and if you believe in it
hard enough maybe the placebo effect
will kick in
do you feel your third-eye opening but
by far the most popular form of real
binaural recording comes in the form of
ASMR videos you know those videos where
people crinkle paper or talk very softly
please for some people this triggers a
very pleasurable tingly feeling the
virtual barbershop is a classic follow
me as I move around the back of the head
to the left then there's also ASMR
unboxing videos there's tons of these
and then there's this guy this guy is
very cool he has so many views I'm
pretty sure this is his job oh my god
but let's get deeper into the science of
vinyl the same way we use two eyes to
see in 3d we also use two ears to hear
in 3d the way we do that is arrival time
loudness and frequency range or Tambor
so when my girlfriend's bird chirps it
arrives first in the right ear and then
a tiny fraction of a second later it
arrives in the left ear not only that
but it should be a little bit louder in
the right side finally the timbre or
distortion of that sound wave through
the space bouncing off the walls around
your head and when that sound finally
arrives in each ear
the shape of the sound has changed so
much that the difference between the
same sound of the left ear and the right
ear can tell us where it came from
that's why things like distance between
ears their shape and the density of the
material between them is so important
I know you're probably thinking what
about 5.1 audio yes 5.1 is immersive but
it's not exactly the same let's say
you're watching a movie and an explosion
happens on the left side of the screen
it's been paired with the sound of that
explosion coming out of the left speaker
wow that's a very cool effect it's still
not by normal Dolby 5.1 and Dolby Atmos
can't replicate it even though they're
so complicated
really for binaural recording you just
need those microphones to simulate human
hearing and a left and right channel and
the thing is this isn't even a new idea
people have been using techniques like
this since the late 1800s
look at this lady but binaural audio has
grown in popularity due to one huge
thing VR virtual reality right now VR
headsets do a pretty good job of
tricking our eyes but they usually
ignore our ears the good news is that's
changing pretty fast there are a decent
number of companies working on not only
on aural microphones but also the
software that simulates binaural audio
for virtual spaces and there are a few
tests of this concept floating around
the internet one of the most impressive
was this virtual Beck performance where
they made this 360-degrees stage and
covered it in not only here on at sixty
degree cameras but also tons of these
Omni binaural microphone heads using
face tracking the video and audio
followed the movement of your head it
worked out pretty well it's pretty cool
it's too bad that it's back I'm just
kidding back Beck's alright it was very
cool oh and the Omni binaural
microphones were made by 3d oh that's
the same company that made the
microphone we were using at the
beginning of this video
so you might not be able to tell but
this is actually the outro montage to
this video you might not be able to tell
because it doesn't have like a cool song
that it's edited to but I just wanted
you to be able to hear this audio you
know stand clear of the closing doors
please
so that is binaural audio and here is
one of my cats eating wet food and
here's Bev thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
