screen like the one on your laptop your
phone your TV your tablet Nielsen says
most people spend on average 10 hours a
day staring at a screen do these screens
damage our eyes I'm a blogger and yeah
I'm definitely in front of a screen at
least to 10 hours a day I grab my phone
first thing in the morning and then I
use it on the subway commute all day at
work then a small break for yoga then on
the subway ride home and in bed am i
damaging my eyes are you damaging your
eyes are we doomed here's the good news
screens aren't going to make us go blind
the devices that we use do not appear to
cause long-term argument that's dr.
Rebecca Taylor an ophthalmologist in
Nashville Tennessee instead of real eye
damage you might experience my
discomfort like blurry vision dry eyes
watery eyes and tired eyes these
symptoms even have a name it's called
computer vision syndrome I know my eyes
feel heavy after a long day of staring
but a doctor isn't going to worry about
my long-term health so don't be scared
by that really intense name still my
eyes are irritated and it's annoying we
likely experience computer vision
syndrome because we blink less when we
stare at a screen
according to optometrist Allison boseong
from the University of Iowa Arab League
rate slows pretty significantly in some
studies up to about two-thirds so about
67% slower or less blinking and it's not
easy to consciously blink more I'm very
aware of that you'll probably look a
little bit crazy if you try so instead
use eye drops to keep your eyeballs
moist make sure they are for that
purpose and not for redness relief take
breaks too most doctors recommend the
20-20-20 rule for a 20/20 row a 20/20
rule which says that for every 20
minutes that you're on a computer or
staring at a screen take 20 seconds to
stare at something 20 feet away
it requires more energy to focus at a
near target that it does to focus at a
distance target if I was concentrating
on the typewriter all day long what I
still have these same symptoms
absolutely so it doesn't matter what
you're viewing it matters that you're
doing after two hours of screen time
take 50
minutes do anything but stare at a
screen that means don't look at your
phone either try talking to some Eamon's
I don't know other less obvious factors
affect our eyes - it's not just the
actual act of staring at a screen that's
to blame for our eye problems the tech
we own and the way we use it matters to
our monitors can contribute to these
issues for example if your displays
refresh rate is 60 Hertz meaning it
refreshes its images 60 times a second
your eyes will constantly try to refocus
meaning they'll tire out more quickly
there are muscles inside the eye if
you're gonna sit down at your desk and
you're gonna flex your bicep for eight
hours in a row you may need a little bit
of a break the unfortunate news is that
most gadgets feature displays at 60
Hertz
you can try buying a new more expensive
gaming display with a faster refresh
rate or a new 120 Hertz iPad pro or
maybe even the razor phone another more
manageable tip relates to your eyes
distance from the screen keep your
monitor an arm's length away from you so
about 25 inches and position the screens
that you're looking down in it at a 20
degree angle your screens contrast and
brightness might also be worth playing
around with increase the contrast on
your screen to make the letters clearer
and don't use tiny fonts
I love tiny fonts I know this might be
annoying aesthetically but tiny fonts
strain your eyes so bands tiny fonts do
not use them now I haven't mentioned
another big problem you might be
battling which is glare glare can make
it difficult to stare at your screen and
will additionally hurt your eyes an
anti-glare screen filter could help ask
an anti glare coatings on glasses also
try to avoid having extreme sunlight on
your screen or harsh overhead lighting
your screen experience is highly
dependent on your environment obviously
so you want to make it perfect
along with glare maybe you've heard
about blue light coatings and blue light
filtering glasses they're super trendy
right now and glasses shops are often
trying to convince customers to add them
onto their orders blue light these
companies say is a major part of the eye
strain problem but doctors have
countered that these special lenses
really won't do much to levy a Thai
stress there are several products out
there to protect our eyes from our
computer but there's no data that
supports that that that is necessary the
American Academy of Ophthalmology
doesn't recommend
because they won't affect your actual
eye health like they won't prevent
macular degeneration or glaucoma however
companies like Felix gray which builds
blue light filtering into its lenses as
opposed to relying on a coating still
says their tech helps I met with David
Rodger one of the company's co-founders
to talk about blue light filtering and
how his company tries to address the eye
strain problem but if you are dealing
with that 5:00 p.m. headache or like you
know the your vision is a little bit
blurry or you're you know you're just
rubbing your eyes at the end of the day
right and glare two of the primary
reasons that people are feeling these
affects we thought throughout 50% of the
blue range the thing is there having
been enough studies that show blue light
is harmful for the eye and David admits
his glasses are for short-term comfort
there's needs to be a lot more studies
before we're able to say anything
conclusively well we're really trying to
say hey to everyday comfort like we're
trying to provide that lots of
scientists agree polarization of lenses
they attack layer all of these things
that are available to us help ease those
symptoms it's sort of like a bad day
they don't treat the symptoms they just
ease the symptoms it could be good and
it's not bad so I kind of leave it up to
people and you know it can't improve
their comfort and now in actuality we
need blue light to function as humans it
stimulates us and wakes us up blue light
could present a problem at night when we
need darkness to help us fall asleep
because it suppresses melatonin so
filtering blue light could be useful at
bedtime which is why Apple launched
night shift
although tests of that technology and
similar apps are inconclusive ultimately
if you're worried about computer vision
syndrome or just the amount of screen
time your eyes experience take a break
don't look at your phone your TV or
laptop before bed read a book do a
crossword watch the sunset relax you
know you look like a person who likes
gadgets you probably like food too you
eat food right our sister site eater has
a show called the kitchen gadget tests
show and you should check it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
