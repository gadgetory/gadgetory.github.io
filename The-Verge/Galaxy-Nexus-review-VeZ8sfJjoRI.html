verge and we're looking at the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus this is the next flagship
Google device designed by Samsung in
conjunction with Google the device
itself is really thin it's about as thin
as the iPhone 4s or iPhone 4 which is
kind of amazing but it has a gigantic
four point six five inch 720p display
which sounds big but because of the
thinness
it just seems smaller than it actually
is inside the device has some pretty
hefty specs as well it's got a TI OMAP
dual-core CPU clocked at 1.2 gigahertz
has a gig of ram and in the US it will
come with LTE on Verizon's network with
32 gigs of storage and in europe and
other countries you'll be able to get a
16 gig version with Penta band HSPA+ the
device has a 5 megapixel camera on the
back which can do 1080p video at 30
frames per second and it has a 1.3
megapixel shooter on the front the
device has an NFC chip on board as well
as Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS the usual
assortment of light sensors
accelerometers gyroscopes etc as well as
a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and a
microUSB port but the big story here
isn't really about the hardware it's
about the software it's the first device
running Ice Cream Sandwich aka
Android 4.0 which is the latest newest
version of Android it is a continuation
of what the company was doing with
honeycomb 4 tablets but they've brought
a bunch of that stuff to phones and
they've brought the OS to parity for
both devices the operating system is
wildly different than any other version
of Android that we've seen on phones
it is completely revamped in pretty much
every way there are new apps as well as
big changes to existing apps there's
pretty much not anywhere on the phone
that hasn't been affected in some way by
the changes to the software animation
seems smoother touch response feels
faster and more precise it just is
generally a better looking and better
performing OS there aren't any physical
buttons on the Galaxy Nexus unlike
every other Android phone that's ever
been made and the software takes
advantage of that you now get on-screen
buttons for home back and your
multitasking menu all of the core apps
in Ice Cream Sandwich have been altered
in a pretty major way and there are a
few new apps as well one of the new ones
is the people app which is basically
your address book but now it plugs into
social networking services so not only
do you get a nice-looking grid of your
contacts but you can also flip that grid
over to see if they've been updating
their Google+ account and presumably
Twitter or Facebook if they decide to
plug into this Gmail has been completely
altered it looks a lot more like Gmail
on Honeycomb tablet it works way way
better than previous versions of Gmail a
lot more of the controls are exposed so
you can quickly get to the buttons and
options that you need without having to
hunt around in weird menus and it's
faster its smoother you can flip to new
messages by swiping left or right which
is actually a motif that you see all
through the OS calendar has been altered
fairly significantly you can now pinch
to zoom to see more or less of your
calendar appointments which is great if
you've got a lot of appointments clearly
I have cleared my schedule
Google Talk has also been updated just
like in other apps you can swipe left or
right to see different conversations
you're having which is really convenient
Google's even cleaned up this settings
menu and they've they've added a few
things here like data limiting options
where you can set warnings for yourself
or set caps for yourself if you're
worried about going over your data
limits you're also able to see the data
that individual apps are using as well
as limit the amount of background data
that those apps can use which is pretty
handy if you think something is eating
up a lot of your data in the background
the browser has been significantly
improved in fact it's one of the fastest
mobile browsers I've ever used it loaded
up our page which is fairly heavy pretty
quickly and scrolling zooming in was
smooth on other sites it performed as
good if not better than any other mobile
device I've used including the iPhone 4s
it's just a really great web browser
Google is also
altered how you use tabs now you get
this nice little tab menu with these
squares you can swipe away when you want
to get rid of one of the tabs that
you're working on all in all it's a
outstanding mobile browser the keyboard
is massively massively improved in Ice
Cream Sandwich not only is prediction
better but it just seems smarter in
every way it gives you better choices
when you're typing you can tap on words
for quick replacements and it does some
of the stuff that I have always wanted
it to do which the iPhone does really
well like know that you type two words
without a space and it asks if you want
to separate them so that's really handy
Google has also brought over the
multitasking menu from honeycomb but
with a little tweak you can now swipe
away applications that you're not using
it's kind of reminiscent of cards and
webOS but I'm sure that the head of user
experience at Android Matias Duarte had
nothing to do with that even though he
basically created webOS one of the more
significant changes in Ice Cream
Sandwich is happening with the camera
the camera software is a million times
better than older versions of Android
it's super responsive you can tap to
focus it does face detection getting to
your settings is fast and easy but even
better than that you get a bunch of new
stuff like panorama mode where you're
able to be guided through shooting a
panoramic shot and when you're doing
video you get some really interesting
real-time effects that aren't exactly
super useful but they're pretty cool to
play around with you can see here that
you're able to turn on some of these
goofy effects like big eyes or small
mouth or squished head and they they
work pretty well they actually do fairly
decent head tracking they don't have any
true utility but they're fun to play
around with and it shows the power of
the device and the software additionally
when taking still photos you now get a
bunch of editing options you can add
different filters which are very
Instagram ish and you can also do more
detailed editing like like cropping and
redeye reduction rotation and a bunch of
other options that are fairly advanced
for a mobile phone one thing about the
Galaxy Nexus that's been a little bit of
a controversial subject is face unlock
it's a new fee
that uses your face to unlock the device
it can be unlocked with a photograph
apparently we've seen reports on that
recently google says it's not really a
big security feature I don't think it is
either
it's certainly not essential it's cool
to show off to friends but I I wouldn't
recommend using if you're actually
concerned about the security of your
phone though it does work most of the
time one cool thing that really is 100%
non-essential is that Google has stuck
in the easter egg in the operating
system you can see here if you tap
repeatedly on the version of the
software you get I guess what's
basically an Android nyan cat and if you
hold it down it does this animation
which is great
totally useless but also totally great
in all the Galaxy Nexus is an awesome
phone the changes that Google is made to
Android are really substantial this is
not a small bump it's not a slight tweak
it is a total revamp of the operating
system and most of the changes 95% of
them are for the better the device
itself is big but not too big in my
opinion the screen is pretty amazing a
720p display even on a screen this large
looks really good to my eyes I think
it's probably the only screen out there
right now that can compete with Apple's
Retina display on the iPhone 4s it's
definitely one of the best smartphones
ever made I would say it could be the
best smartphone ever made if the build
quality were a little bit higher maybe
if it weren't made out of plastic but
that's a pretty minor knock against it
it's definitely serious competition for
something like the iPhone 4s and
surprisingly for me it's one of the few
devices I've ever reviewed that actually
lives up to my expectations if you're
thinking about getting an Android phone
especially if you're on Verizon or going
to be on Verizon in the US or you're
able to get it on another carrier
outside of the US in my opinion there's
no other choice</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
