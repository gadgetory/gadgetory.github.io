so that means it's time
for new Samsung phones.
(upbeat electronic music)
Samsung doesn't have one new phone,
not two new phones, not three new phones.
Samsung is releasing four
new Galaxy 10 models.
There's a lot to talk about here,
so I hope you guys are
ready for some specs.
Now, the standard S10 line is coming
in three different variations:
there's the S10 model,
which has a 6.1 inch screen,
there's an S10 Plus model,
with a 6.4 inch screen,
and then there's a new S10 E model,
which has a smaller 5.8 inch screen.
Now they've got various pricing
and features across the board,
and I'll get into those later,
but there's a lot of things
that they share the same with,
and that's gonna start
with this new display.
The new display is called
an Infinity O display,
it's Samsung's edge-to-edge
design, like we've seen before.
The S10 and the S10 Plus model
still have that curved
design on the sides,
but what's new this year is there's
a new hole-punched kind
of design for the camera.
Now on the S10 Plus here, that means
there's two cameras in this
little cutout on the screen,
but it allows the screen to
flow around it without a notch.
We've seen it on a couple
other phones before,
but it really allows for a
full type of screen display,
and Samsung says the screen-to-body ratio
on the S10 Plus model is
as high as 93 percent.
Now, inside the phones, there's
a lot of similarities too.
They're all using the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 855 processor,
there's ranging between six to twelve
gigabytes of RAM, depending
on which model you choose.
They're all gonna start
with 128 gigs of storage,
and if you go for the S10 Plus,
you can get all the way up to
a terrabyte of storage inside,
plus support for micro SD card slots.
They also share the same features
that we've been used to
on the Galaxy S line,
like IP 68 water resistance,
fast wireless charging,
now has the ability
to wirelessly charge another device.
You can put another
device on the back of it
and charge it, which is kinda wild.
There are two other familiar things,
one good and one, well,
it's the Bixby button.
It's still there, it
still does Bixby stuff.
But the entire S10 line also has
a headphone jack, which is great.
There are some special features
that are unique to each model.
Starting with the S10 and the S10 Plus,
these have a new ultrasonic
under-display fingerprint scanner.
So you can see, there's no
fingerprint scanner on the back,
it's not using an eye
detect type of system,
it is a fingerprint scanner
embedded in the screen.
It's a little different than the one
we've seen on One Plus, which uses
an optical design fingerprint scanner.
This is an ultrasonic
one, which Samsung says
should be more secure, harder
to fake, and more reliable.
However, if you're using a
tempered glass screen protector,
it's gonna have some problems working,
so Samsung says that it is working with
third party screen protectors
to make sure that they work
with the new S10 models.
Now, if you go with the S10 E,
which is a little bit
lower-end of a model,
there's no under-display
fingerprint scanner,
the fingerprint scanner is on the side
with the power button, it's integrated
right into the power button there.
The other big difference between
these three phones are
their camera systems.
All three of them have at least
a dual camera system with ultra-wide
and standard wide angle lenses.
The S10 and the S10 Plus add a third
telephoto camera to the mix,
giving you three different perspectives
at the click of a button. You
can kinda think of it like
having a whole camera bag full of lenses
right on the back of your phone.
On the front, Samsung
has upgraded the camera
to a 10 megapixel sensor
that can also shoot 4K video.
If you get the S10 Plus, you also get
a second front camera for
better portrait effects.
Samsung has also added to the
software features in the camera app.
The scene optimizer mode now has
30 different scenes to choose from.
There's a new shot suggestions feature
that can help you with framing,
and the video mode has a new
super-steady feature to
stabilize your shots.
It can also shoot in HDR10 plus,
which the displays of all
three S10 models support.
As usual, there's a lot going on
with the cameras on the S10 line,
we're gonna have to
have really a deep dive
when we get some time to review these
and test them out to talk more about them.
Now the hardware on the
S10 and the S10 Plus
is definitely the most premium.
You got the rounded, curved design
that we've seen before from Samsung,
it's got a aluminum frame, glass back,
there's actually a ceramic
back option on the S10 Plus,
if you opt for 512 gigabytes of storage.
They're stunning to look at, the screens
are super bright and super colorful.
A lot of familiar features,
like you'd expect from a Samsung phone.
Now, if you're looking at the S10 E,
it's a little different.
Obviously it's a smaller
phone than the other models,
but the screen isn't
as curved on the sides.
It's got a little bit
bigger of a bezel around it,
it's a flatter design, and you don't have
the option for the
ceramic back on this one.
That's gonna be reflected in its price.
It starts at 749 dollars for the S10 E,
while you're stepping up to 899 dollars
for the S10 and 999 for the S10 Plus.
So you are saving a little bit with this,
but mostly it's just
a more compact design.
In terms of like, specs and performance,
it really should be very
similar to the other models.
Now that covers the three phones
that we're gonna see first, but
Samsung's also releasing a fourth model.
It's the new 5G S10, it's the first
5G phone from Samsung to come out.
That's gonna come out with
a bigger 6.7 inch screen,
it has another camera feature
on both the back and the front,
and it has a 3D time of flight camera,
so it has better 3D depth perception.
Now, Samsung hasn't really
let us touch it or use it yet,
so we don't have too much
to say about that one,
other than it will be coming out
in Q2 of this year as
an exclusive on Verizon
before it arrives on
other carries later on,
on AT&amp;amp;T, Sprint and T-Mobile.
So that's all of Samsung's
phones this year.
You got an S10, an S10 Plus, an S10 E
and eventually an S10 5G.
Now, the S10, the S10 Plus and the S10E
are gonna be available for pre-order
starting tomorrow, February 21st,
and then they'll be shipping on March 8th,
so these are coming real soon.
We're really excited to
spend more time with these
and get these in for review,
and we'll have plenty more to say then.

announcements that are happening.
