liftoff of osiris-rex it's seven year
mission to boldly go to the asteroid
Bennu
and
that Atlas 5 rocket is carrying NASA's
latest spacecraft the osiris-rex the
probe is on a mission to reach a
near-earth asteroid once it gets there
osiris-rex will grab a sample from the
space rock and bring it back to earth
and what's in that sample could tell us
a lot about the early solar system and
maybe how life formed here on our own
planet
that's because asteroids are considered
tiny snapshots of the primitive solar
system most of the planets and moons
have undergone a lot of geological
activity since they first formed 4.5
billion years ago
asteroids even here they haven't changed
all that much since then so they still
contain some of the same chemical makeup
of the solar system when it first got
started studying those chemicals can
tell us that the building blocks for
life like organic molecules and amino
acids were present from the very
beginning or if they just showed up
later on to figure this out NASA is
targeting an asteroid named Venu but
what makes this space rock so special
well it's a little bit like Goldilocks
everything about it is just right for
one it's in an ideal location to make
good time NASA wanted an asteroid
traveling on their earth-like orbit
between 1.68 use and point 8a use it's
also a good size for getting a sample an
asteroid that's too small can spin
pretty fast causing any loose particles
on its surface to shoot out into space
then he's big enough so that it's spin
isn't totally out of control
and finally it's made up of the right
stuff NASA researchers wanted an
asteroid rich in carbon those kinds of
asteroids are thought to be the most
ancient and unchanged since the early
days of the solar system that means it's
samples could contain the early
molecules that led to earth life
sampling venue may be the main priority
but osiris-rex will also help us better
understand if asteroids are going to hit
us in the future during its mission
osiris-rex will study something known as
the Yarkovsky effect it's a way that the
Sun can manipulate the course of an
asteroid you see the Sun emits solar
radiation which can slowly change in
asteroids long-term orbit over time that
makes it hard for astronomers to predict
exactly where an asteroid is going to be
in a hundred years
so when osiris-rex is at Venu it will
study the sun's effect on the asteroid
allowing astronomers to make better
orbital models it's going to be a while
before a thyristor xcs in the action
though the spacecraft will cruise
through space for the next two years
during that time the probe will come
back by earth to get a boost from our
planets gravity that will put a Cyrus
Rex on the right path to start
approaching venue by September 2018 as
it approaches the spacecraft will start
mapping the surface of been new thanks
to early radar observations NASA is
pretty sure there is loose material on
Bennie's surface but osiris-rex needs to
find the right spot to scoop it up over
a two-year period NASA will select 12
sites that could be good for sampling
and then narrow it down to two final
sites once they have the site they want
the spacecraft will try to tag the
asteroid in July of 2020 osiris-rex will
move in close to the new and deploy the
tags damn it's a tiny robotic arm with a
sampler head on the end arm will touch
the surface of venue and give it a whiff
of nitrogen gas that will cause any
loose materials to shoot up into the
sampler head it's a quick process that
only takes five seconds but if
successful nasa helps to pick up 60
grams of material that will be the
largest sample to come back from space
since the Apollo missions NASA can do up
to three tagged attempts in case one
doesn't work out but eventually a Cyrus
Rex will have to head back to earth in
March of 2021 that puts the spacecraft
back at Earth in September of 2023 a
capsule containing the asteroid sample
will fall back to our planet and land
softly hopefully in the Utah desert and
when scientists opened up that capsule
they'll be one step closer to getting
answers about how our galactic
neighborhood came to be going as the
master
getting some samples just another day
Naza yeah high abuse only got something
like dust I love you iris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
