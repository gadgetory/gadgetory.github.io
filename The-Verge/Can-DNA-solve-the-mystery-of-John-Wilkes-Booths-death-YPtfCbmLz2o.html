to finding new information I think down
deep the people on the other side know
that we're right that's why they have
ferociously opposed any and every effort
to do any and every scientific test to
determine the truth these people are not
real historians they're afraid they are
afraid of the truth
here's a Xerox of one of the main
articles the Rolling Stone magazine
article of July 1st 1976 they really
sensationalized it a conspiracy theory
to end all conspiracy theories the
startling revelations of young Nathaniel
Orlick I'm Nate Orlick and for nearly 40
years since I was 15 years old I have
been involved in researching the
question as to whether John Wilkes Booth
was really the man killed and Garrett's
pardon and have ended up becoming the
leader of the group of people who
believed that probably he was not killed
in Garrett's barn the standard history
is the John Wilkes Booth killed
President Lincoln on the night of April
14 1865 and was able to escape out of
Washington and of course Booth was with
David Herold his henchmen and while they
were in the storage barn of a family
named Garrett federal soldiers
surrounded the barn and demanded that
the two of them surrender Harold by all
accounts did surrender but the other man
in the barn refused to surrender
they set the barn on fire one of the
soldiers put his pistol up in the air
shot the bullet happened to just go
through one of the slats of the barn and
happened to exactly find the back of the
neck of this other man in the barn and
supposedly that man was John Wilkes
Booth when I was 15 I was at a friend's
house just up the street from here and
saw a book called the web of conspiracy
and the very last page of the section
where they have like pictures was titled
puzzle for history and it showed a
picture John Wilkes Booth and then a man
who had obviously been deceased sitting
in a chair
and he mentioned in that page that there
was this alternative theory that John
was with maybe wasn't the man killed in
the barn and that this guy sitting in
this chair named David II George who
supposedly committed suicide by poison
in 1903 was really John Wilkes Booth in
the book and mentioned a book by a man
named finest Elle Bates who was friendly
with a man who claimed that he was John
Wilkes Booth who ended up being David E
George the basic idea of that book was
that there was a man who said his name
was John st. Helen living in in small
town in Texas in the 1870s and his best
friend his lawyer was this guy named
finest Elle Bates one night
Johnson Helen got very sick and thought
he was about to die and he called Bates
over and he said before I die I want to
tell someone who I really am
I'm really John Wilkes Booth the
assassin of President Lincoln inform my
brother Edwin if I die the guy recovered
and a couple weeks later he said to
Bates you remember when I told you I was
really John Wilkes Booth and Bates said
oh yeah yeah I remember but you were you
know you were very sick you were
hallucinating don't worry about it he
says no I really am John Wilkes Booth
and now that I've gotten off my chest
I want to tell you the whole story all
these things said to me wow there's
something here and president resigns
just to publish historical research and
February NATO Orla WAC SGA president
announced that he planned to resign from
his office
president or Lackey retired to his home
to continue work on the history by
proving the John Wilkes Booth did not
die when reported appearances on
regional television helped the president
to gain Fame so there I am and Here I am
with with my cabinet John Wilkes Booth
in reality was not killed by the federal
government officers in 1989 I decided to
go on my vacation to Enid Oklahoma
ended up meeting with one of the
prominent civic leaders and he said you
know we've been trying to get the TV
show unsolved mysteries the NBC show on
solve mysteries which at that time was
one of the top-rated shows 30 million
people saw it every week to do a story
about this to John Wilkes Booth escape
Union troops at Garrett farm only to
kill himself 38 years later in an
Oklahoma boardinghouse the history books
say no John Wilkes Booth died in 1865
four years later his remains were
returned to Maryland and buried in an
unmarked grave in the family plot
perhaps their rest the definitive answer
to this unsolved mystery the very next
day the cemetery got a call from some of
the descendants of John Wilkes Booth
collateral descendents saying if these
guys want to exhume that body
don't let them the same day I got a call
from the Smithsonian Institution and
they said we would love to do an
exclamation and we want you to let us do
the examination of it because we're the
Smithsonian Institution of course I was
delighted that that was the case they
were going to do dental records and
particularly something called
photographic superimposition where you
take pictures of someone and they're
about 100 pictures that everyone agrees
or John Wilkes Booth and you superimpose
it on on a skull if it matches it
doesn't mean that's the same person but
if it doesn't match it can't be the same
person and when they showed all the
evidence that we had to the extended
family 21 of the 22
the sentence agreed that we were
probably right and they signed onto it
hi I'm Joanne Hume I should have just
gonna what do you want me to say do you
want me to say I'm a descendent of the
Bluth family what they just give me how
far you want me to go well somewhere
between fifth and sixth grade the summer
that I was going to be going into sixth
grade apparently I was being dramatic
and my mother said oh stop being so
dramatic she said you just like your
relatives and I said well what do you
mean and she said well you're related to
a family of famous actors so he said oh
who and she said Edwin Booth and I
didn't know of too many other boots so I
said oh is he related to John Wilkes
Booth and I just expected the answer to
be don't be ridiculous
but the answer was yes he is John Wilkes
Booth's brother and then she kind of
like took a like a breath and then said
listen you're going to be going into
sixth grade you're going to be learning
about the Civil War and I want you to
understand now they're going to tell you
that John Wilkes Booth died in the barn
he did not die in the barn
he lived many many years afterwards the
family always knew it and that you're
just going to have to kind of learn to
live with the fact that what you're
being told is incorrect we were just
trying to get permission to exhume this
body from the cemetery we didn't think
anything of it we just thought okay
let's dig this person up and let's see
are we related or we not related and you
know when my mother finally died and I
always say she really died of a broken
heart and she decided I want to know
who's in there if this is not John
Wilkes Booth then we need this person
out every John Wilkes Booth then that's
fine
then we know and so it was all set to be
done the Smithsonian was all set to do
it and then a group of historians who
believed that booth was killed in the
barn contacted the president of the
cemetery
William Tribble and convinced him to try
to block it
as a human being I am fallible I've made
many mistakes in my life and in fact I
may even have made a mistake in
concluding the John Wilkes Booth wasn't
killed in the barn I'm not a hundred
percent sure as I often say would be the
first time I was wrong about something
there's no shame in being wrong but
there is shame for historians people who
call themselves historians to block an
attempt to get the truth Greenmount
cemetery knows what the right thing to
do is and in fact it would be much more
scientifically feasible to do an
exclamation now so I originally met Nate
about two years ago originally Nate had
just asked some questions if we have
this type of material if we have these
bones would it be possible to get DNA
from them to address the question of the
identity of John Wilkes Booth we would
need a biological sample from the person
who died in the barn because that's what
we're testing to see if we can identify
that person and DNA is essentially
useless unless you have a comparison
sample the plan that we were that we
recently were going to do was to take
the DNA from one of the three vertebrae
that were taken out according to all
accounts were taken out of the Mankell
in the barn they've been at the National
Museum of health and medicine all along
and we can now compare the DNA there
with the DNA from his brother Edwin
Booth was the only member of that of the
family not buried in green mound if the
DNA in the vertebrae have the same
mitochondrial DNA as Edwin booths
actually wouldn't completely prove that
they're brothers it would just prove
that they're related but even I would
concede at that point however if they
did not match then with absolute 100%
certainty they couldn't be brothers if
they're not related they're not brothers
and so within five minutes we'd have the
answer if the museum were to grant our
request for a sample for genetic
analysis they would just be cutting a
very small portion of this bone just a
small enough amount as you see in this
test tube here and that would be enough
for us to be able to perform the Chan
analysis unfortunately now just a short
time ago we received the answer from the
Department of the Army that even though
they themselves say that they are
tempted to do this that they do not want
anything that's going to destroy their
specimen despite the fact that our
expert says it won't destroy the
specimen on the one hand I completely
understand because in order to do any
type of DNA analysis on bone we do have
to destroy a very small amount but on
the other hand the technology is so
sensitive today that we would use a very
small amount just 0.2 grams our starting
material of bone powders all we would
need in order to do this type of
analysis we the American people own that
museum and we the American people have a
right to know the truth if why are we
spending millions of dollars to run a
museum if when the the biggest crime in
American history the issue of what
happened to the man who killed my
opinion in most people's opinion the
greatest president we ever had but they
won't even give us a fragment of their
specimen why on earth do we have
specimens when would it ever be used the
American people should insist that this
museum that we owned let us do this test
and get the truth out whatever the truth
is there or DNA hits being done all the
time like I said if you can find richard
the lionheart under a under a parking
lot and if you can find Copernicus in
the you know the ruins of a church and
you can prove these people or we lead it
to and or who they are then I just don't
understand why history does not want to
be either confirming this is history
correct or this is history incorrect
I am a scientist at heart I want to be
able to use the scientific method and be
able to approach these questions
unbiased it just seems like there are so
many things that could have potentially
happened that we might not know the
answers to and in terms of trying to
solve this mystery it seems like the DNA
might be the only chance we have to do
that
I just feel with what I know and what
I've been told of what I've learned I
don't know that I would ever believe if
the government came and said okay we
have proved that this is John Wilkes
Booth I would have to say okay how you
prove this to me I don't care who else
you prove it to prove it to me so I
don't see it putting it to rest in our
and I think that's what people are
afraid of they don't want to change
history of 150 years ago I don't want to
change history I just want to know at
every step of the way that we talked
about I felt like the story had so to
speak ended because my goal always was
to just do the best I could the only
people who lose are the ones who don't
try even I think our bitterest opponents
would grant that we have given them one
hell of a run for this and so I have
never felt anything other than that
we've succeeded other people now have to
step forward and do their part if they
do we can all in the end we can all win
if we get the truth
