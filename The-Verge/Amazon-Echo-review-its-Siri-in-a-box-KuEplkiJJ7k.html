I'm cooking or lying in bed or playing
video games and I suddenly remember oh I
need more batteries or I need to pick up
my laundry in exactly 24 minutes maybe I
just want to hear some Dave Matthews
Band like right now in every one of
those cases I do the same thing I say
Alexa and then command Alexa to do
something set a timer add batteries to
my shopping list play ants marching and
crewed up and this thing this black
cylinder about the size of a can of
tennis balls that's sitting on my shelf
responds the echoes to things it's a
Bluetooth speaker and it's a personal
assistant let's get that first one out
of the way now it's a terrible Bluetooth
speaker it has this really awkward
connection system and just bad
tinny shallow sound since it has to be
plugged in all the time you really can't
take it anywhere it's just never going
to replace a real wireless speaker even
being able to search for music is nice
but not when it's just prime music I
Heart Radio and tune in but of course
calling the echo a Bluetooth speaker is
like calling KITT from Knight Rider a
car the whole point is everything else
the echo can do everything Alexa can do
you can change her name by the way if
you have someone named Alexa or Alexis
in your house but you can only change it
to Amazon so if your son and daughter
are named Amazon and Alexis you're
basically just screwed Alexa I can add
things to a really basic to-do list in
the companion app or to a shopping list
but no she can't just randomly order
things for you that show up in two
business days though that would be
awesome
Alexa can also take basic commands and
answer basic questions I think half the
time I used it to check the weather or
find out how many tablespoons are in a
cup one cup equals sixteen tablespoons
but from telling jokes to looking things
up to telling you the time Alexa is an
incredible fountain of useful
information how many ears does Captain
Kirk have three his left ear his right
ear and his final frontier and most of
the time it works and when it does it
feels like magic Alexa can also tell you
when the Civil War ended or who won the
Knicks game last night although I guess
I should say she usually will tell you
these things because sometimes she just
won't
sometimes Alexa doesn't hear me right
even in super quiet rooms and sometimes
she hears me right but refuses to answer
the question instead making me open up
the companion app and go through my
search history to find it the app is
fine and it works on Android and iOS in
addition to Amazon's devices but it's
also a hundred percent not the point of
this device to make it ever so slightly
easier for you to search the internet
with an app
for the most part it does work in a
quiet room but as soon as you say Alexa
play some music and some weird prime
music playlist comes on it's just over
she can't hear you anymore she won't
tell you she doesn't hear you either the
blue at the top comes on as if she's
doing something and then it just goes
off for all the reasons that the echo
feels so simple when it works it's
maddeningly unhelpful when it doesn't
yeah sure you can press the button on
the top to make sure the echo is
listening but by the time I've walked
all the way over there to do it it would
be easier to just pick up my phone
there's also a remote but taking that
out of my pocket is as much work as
taking my phone out of my pocket I
mostly think Amazon was smart to make
you plug in the echo to use it because
it means you don't need to worry about
it being charged and turned on all the
time but the idea that you can just
leave the echo where it is and use it
anywhere it's just not true you'd have
to buy basically one for every two or
three rooms which is just crazy I've
found it most useful in the kitchen
where I'm always doing other things with
my hands anyway so I left my echo there
the thing about the echo and with any
voice control device right now is that
it works a lot and when it works it's
awesome but by the time I've spent two
minutes yelling Alexa volume three while
she blasts whatever Huey Lewis and the
news song she found on Amazon Prime I
just give up if the echo were a great
Bluetooth speaker I'd say buy this thing
right now
it's going to get better fast as it gets
more apps more content and more smarts
and it's almost worth it just to have a
voice controlled way to add things to my
shopping list while I play video games
but for $199.99 pker and it's the
craziest most unreliable personal
assistant ever she's the best until
she's the worst
until she just completely ignores you
while she plays Katy Perry at her desk
I want the echo to be great and I want
one in my house I think it'll get there
but it probably won't be this version</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
