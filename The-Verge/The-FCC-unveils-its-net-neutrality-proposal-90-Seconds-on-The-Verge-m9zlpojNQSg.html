those in favor say aye aye opposed the
eyes have it the order is adopted and
with that the fight for net neutrality
begins anew I'm Ross Miller and this is
90 seconds on the verge the FCC today
has voted 3-2 to to accept Chairman Tom
wheelers new open Internet framework
while the new proposal has been amended
from it's more controversial text it
leaves open the question of internet
fast lanes which many see as
fundamentally undermining net neutrality
but you wouldn't necessarily realize
that hearing the commissioners speak
ahead of the vote an open Internet means
consumers not accompaniment not the
government determine winners and losers
we cannot have a two-tiered internet so
I support network neutrality but I
believe the process that got us to this
rulemaking today
is fought dispute this fundamental is
not for us five unelected individuals to
decide instead it should be resolved by
the people's elected representatives
prioritization is not a bad word it is a
necessary component of reasonable
network management there is one internet
not a fast internet not a slow internet
one internet now that it's passed the
proposal will move into a 60-day public
comment period followed by 60 more days
for a response
the FCC hopes to have the framework in
place by the end of the year for more on
net neutrality check out the verge now
go and make your voice heard</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
