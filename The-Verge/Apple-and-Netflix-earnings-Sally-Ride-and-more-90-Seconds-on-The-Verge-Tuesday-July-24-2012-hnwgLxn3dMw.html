let's spend 90 seconds on the verge
apple today reported 8.8 billion dollars
in profit for the fiscal third-quarter
that's impressive figure but it actually
falls short of analyst expectations with

frivolous okay Apple is blaming rumors
very quote pause and customer purchasing

million iPads over the same period and
CEO Tim Cook announced a release date
for OS 10 mountain lions it's tomorrow
like less than 24 hours from now
surprise meanwhile Netflix post its own
quarterly earnings today marking
returning profit but unfortunately very
little subscriber growth the company
says his profits in the u.s. continue to
fund international expansion anew as of
yet unnamed market is expected in the
fourth quarter this year and as for the
next season arrested development that is
still on track for 2013 also this week
we mourn the passing of Sally Ride the
first American woman in space dr. ride
answered a newspaper ad for astronauts
in 1978 she eventually flew on the
Challenger in 1983 and again a year
later on the subject of becoming the
first female American astronaut in space
ride famously quipped it's too bad this
is such a big deal she passed away at 61
and that's it for today's top stories
tune in tomorrow we'll show you what
comer buns work best over your favorite
exoskeleton</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
