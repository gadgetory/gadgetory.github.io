you need to go so uh I want to go first
I want to know about the imac it seemed
like everybody like kind of lost their
mind when it came out and everybody was
talking about how thin it was and all
this stuff's like is it is it really as
incredible as they make it sound so what
happened was something i met came out
they they showed they did a very
dramatic introduction the imac is a
masterpiece of like visual trickery so
that it came out it was super thin and
it looked as thin as like the screen on
a macbook pro and then phil schiller
rotated it and you see the gigantic
round back in gigantic is the wrong it's
not dragon it's just compared to how
thin you think it is the actual depth of
it is is like surprising so it does look
it looks very thin and it's a really
aggressive kind of bit of like optical
engineering that you've got this like
flat five millimeter edge but as soon as
you kind of get around it all the way
you see how deep it really is and so
they did make it thinner in that you
know they got rid of the optical drive
and they're doing this crazy fusion
drive thing inside which sounds to me
like a regular hybrid hard drive but
that the thing that shocked people the
thinness kind of dissipated as soon as
you get physically in front of it and
you see that there is depth behind it I
will say the display of the imac is but
gorgeous they're not calling a red and
display i don't think they can do the
visual acuity math they need to do in
terms of pixel density to call to retina
display but all the other kind of like
techniques are there right so it's it's
optically bonded they're using the same
scaling software on the retina macbook
pro their pixel doubling and all that
stuff and it looks beautiful so you know
i think they just I think the average
distance that you should away from a
desktop doesn't let them say it's right
in a sleigh but if you get a little bit
farther back you definitely can't see
the pixels uh you know I would ask a
little bit about the 13-inch macbook pro
with retina we are in this or even
earlier it's got a sky integrated
graphics it's close to the macbook air
in terms of graphic quality but it's
also outputting four times number of
pixels how was the performance when you
were trying out the 13-inch retina
pro uh so I when they announced the
13-inch retina look freaked out like
that's the computer that I want because
I don't want to run it at retina
resolution I want to run it at the same
resolution is my 15 inch macbook pro and
you can do it runs you can set it to
write 1680 x 1050 which is my computer's
resolution so I was very excited about
it and then they announced new
integrated graphics and I was very sad
um but so I got to play with it a little
bit and I you know there was a big crowd
of people and you know we didn't get to
do everything we wanted to do but I did
run the 1080p iron man trailer
simultaneously with like a multitrack
GarageBand file with one of the demo
files while scrolling around a 21
megapixel raw file in aperture all at
the same time and the cpu monitor only
ever hit fifty percent did you know
spiked above it here in there a little
bit but it kind of was steady at fifty
percent so my sense is that apple's
figure out how to push all those pixel I
mean it's a lot of great graphics card
nobody's excited about it but apples
kind of figure out how to make it
perform adequately if that stuff I think
we'll have to see you know for me I
think that's enough right i mean well i
come to events I take photos I put him
on the Internet I think that's me great
for me and the screen resolution is
great for you know people Jordan our
video producer he still had a big
quizzical look on his face when I was
doing all the stuff with it so I think
we'll have to you know put it through
the review and see what the performance
is really like but just at a quick
glance trying to max it out I really
couldn't push it much harder than that
technical follow-up question what did
you think the iron man trailer uh I'm
pretty irritated because I never
actually got to watch it cuz I was like
I put it on and then I had to like
listen to this crappy Garage Band guitar
lick while scrolling around a photo so
the corner of it seemed amazing and I
will say that the default garage band
guitar lick song works really well with
it it's kind of like a dark side of the
moon thing but other than that I ain't
get to see it so Neil I sit tight for
one second we've got hands-on with the
new macbooks I believe so we're just
going to run that and then we have lots
more questions for you
hey guys it's neon with the verge I'm
here with the new 13-inch macbook pro
retina display it looks very much like
the previous macbook pro only it is far
far thinner because it emits the optical
drive it's got some newports here it's
it's got the new Mac safe port it's got
two Thunderbolt ports USB 3 on the other
side it's not an hdmi port obviously SD
card slot and another USB 3 obviously
the big change here is the retina
display this has an effective resolution
of 1280 by 800 but because it's pixel
doubled you can't see the pixels it
looks amazing you can also run it at
1680 x 1050 which is a resolution of the
old 15-inch MacBook Pro which is great
so this has a lot of potential for Pro
users if you have a 15-inch macbook pro
there's you have every reason to look at
this and particularly important is this
thing seems to perform really really
well so we put together kind of an
insane test here I've got GarageBand
open I've got a 1080p iron man 3 trailer
and I've got aperture with a 21
megapixel raw file open this is the cpu
monitor you can see all four cores are
kind of barely doing anything I'm gonna
start iron man i'm going to start
GarageBand this is a cacophony of sound
and i'm going to start scrolling around
an aperture let's get iron man open here
and you can see everything's just kind
of working pretty well and the cpu is
only about at half so although it has
integrated graphics until HD 4000
graphics and it's pushing this ultra
high resolution screen performance seems
to be actually really great erasing kind
of a big worry people had about those
graphics powering this display so that
is the 13-inch macbook pro with retina
display it's a great product if you're
like me and you have a 15-inch MacBook
Pro you have a whole new reason to want
a smaller computer
Neil I you still with us yeah I'm here
cold funny cuz that I just literally
heard myself say everything I just said
it was really awesome it was pretty
awesome so that your you Ross you made
the interesting point that this is a 15
inch if you have a 15 inch pro this is a
great alternative what do you have an
air do you feel like this is a good
upgrade you think it's worth it uh it's
definitely thicker than the air uh it's
it's a more you know it's just a more
massive machine there's more going on in
there I wouldn't be racing upgrade if I
had an air but if I was if I was one of
the many many people who want to move
down like down the line to the air I
would probably stop at the 13 inch pro
because that me nuts it's the screen is
incredible right so looking at that
screen versus looking at the air screen
i think is a no-brainer so if you're
wanting to go down to the i think apple
us to figure out what its next move is
with these machines because the air is
extremely thin in light it's beautiful
computer but the it's clearly a
surpassed 1 level technologically by the
pro and you know maybe that's for the
best you know for the longest time
there's i couldn't think of a good
reason to get the 13 inch pro over the
air and now there's a couple really good
reasons to do it so maybe apple
stratifying its line a little bit more
that way but i would definitely get the
probe over there that's what we've been
a lot of impression on your hands on is
about the ipad mini the imac the macbook
pro got your impressions from the
theater the one thing I would ask that
you personally me like we're kind of
planning for this event we were talking
what is Tim Cook gonna say we were kind
of convinced he'd bring up maps a little
bit I r you particularly thought he
would actually bring up maps in some way
they did the public apology not a single
mention at all so yeah I don't know man
they talked about iOS 6 a lot they
talked about how great their software is
I talked about all their successes did
not you know Apple events are structured
very predictably right so you know
they're always the same you sit down we
get a bunch of stats about how well
they're doing there's always a shot of
the in apple store usually some
far-flung place that I can't go to
and then yeah there's a little bit of an
update on something right and I it
seemed like you know the maps would be a
great place to go and say you know we're
we're basically turning what has been a
bit of a failure into success we're
updating it we're making it work better
and I just didn't do it and I kind of
understand why you know at the moment I
didn't understand but they did so much
today they packed so much into this
event when they were doing the mac mini
for example it went by so fast if you
blink you missed it like he was just
basically like here's a list of specs on
marinas fast I can look at all these
sports okay that's emeka man you gotta
go oh there's sir version thousand
dollars finally talking about the imax
really thin gotta go and like it was
about as fast if ever see an apple go
through an event so you know spending
time talking about a failure you know
this this kind of machination between
you know this didn't work out well and
we fixed it here's an improvement when
they could just talk about products that
i think people are very excited about I
understand why they didn't do it I think
it would have been nice to see a kind of
a metric update you know on where the
maps were and where they've come but
that'll just appen over time and you
know it's be honest the iphone 5 is
selling gangbusters this iPad Mini is
gonna sell crazy I don't be more worried
about the maps I they're expecting Apple
to fix it in Apple's working fixing it
are you gonna grab night that me wanna
come Johnny what really uh I don't know
man I have that I this new game i play
with apple products where I swear up and
down that I'm not going to buy it and
then I go to a store and I play with one
and then I'll even then a couple days
later i come back and i i say i'm not
gonna buy and then i do so but if you
don't everything that's how i have a
nexus 7 that's probably how line up with
a surface but you know it 329 it's not
it's it's it's a it's a surprisingly
good price point i think the next year
we'll see one come at 249 and that'll
like dramatically change the stakes of
this game but I you know I think I
wanted to make it I think Apple targeted
the form factor and they built whatever
product they needed to build that form
factor and that hit 329 I think next
year you know if they do it the way they
did with the original iPad where they
brought it down 100 bucks in fact could
that could really make an impact on
these lower price tablets i think google
still has a lot of
a lot of potential 199 at the Nexus 7
you know I think well for I see some
updates the nexus 7 coming shortly right
and we'll definitely talk about that
more obviously we I think we could do
another verge cast on Thursday after the
Microsoft band will probably another one
on Monday talk about Google yeah there's
only like 30 more like 34 this is the
first fun event which is really weird to
think you had this week is it so long
it's a long week we've got out of us I
mean I you know I say kind of a final
thought here is that it's very rare just
you know when we when we did the iphone
5 event it was apples focusing the
iphone 5 and they put out these ipods
and you know the ipod touch is great in
the odd pod nano is like why did you
make this and it there apple's story
didn't seem like it had gelled right
they were just updating this phone the
software seemed very kind of like timid
now kind of in in some the sheer amount
of updates they've done to all of these
products you know Tim Cook's sat on
stage and we've updated almost
everything here the only one that's
missing is the mac pro so sorry guys
here no one's ever gettin in your back
prayer but they've updated all of their
major products in really dramatic ways i
think the iphone has proven to be a bit
more of a substantive upgrade it's still
you know iterative product but i think
many people have them are seeing kind of
the true level of update that it it is
over the 4s very few other companies are
doing this level of like complete
product line of reinvention every year
and i think what's really interesting is
that google and microsoft they both got
events this week they're both going at
you know particular microsoft's case
they've got to reinvent windows and say
here's our here's the beginning of our
stablish strategy whereas apple is now
saying our tablet strategy is mature the
foundations built and we're right we're
ready to start splitting it off into
other products that hit hit different
targets and different price points you
know microsoft you will have a lot of
catching up you know Google's got to hit
the top end of the market you know the
Nexus 7 is a great product it's a you
know for one day 9 I think it's frankly
an amazing product but google has
nothing to compete and you know 10
inches nothing to say you should replace
a laptop with this Microsoft is going
straight for you should replace a laptop
with this and nothing to compete with
you can read with this or here's a small
it's only Apple it's now hitting all of
the kind of the marks while still
revamping all of its computers and doing
all this other stuff and it's doing so
you know I will say that I was pretty
down after the iphone 5 I thought the
company needed to find kind of a new
path of the canoe aggression kind of the
dis event and I think Josh you're saying
it to this event to me is a very
aggressive they're moving they're moving
all their platforms for even you know
even if something is mundane as simple
as calling the new iPad at the Lightning
connector the ipad 4th generation I mean
they're just showing off like they're
just flaunting that they can change a
generation of the product that quickly I
mean it really is just a third gen ipad
with a new processor in the lightning
connector but they're trying to move
everything as forward as fast as
possible and I think this whole week
we're going to the industry will shake
down after google's done after microsoft
is done after you know windows phone 8
is coming out soon as well so there's
there's a lot more to come this week but
i think apple's played a very strong and
here awesome I think it's a great way of
summing pretty much everything up it's
almost like you've been wanting to do
this all day all his pent-up need to
talk and we just had to make sure you
get it out immediately yeah that was
like that was like written like you had
a teleprompter or something that was
that was not beautiful Jordan actually
has been right with standing in front of
me riding it live nice so all right you
guys let's go go do something other than
cover an apple event game retin we'll
see you when you back to New York
alright I'll see you soon but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
