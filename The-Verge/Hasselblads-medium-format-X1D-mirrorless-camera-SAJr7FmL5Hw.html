with me the new Hasselblad x1d this is
the newest camera from Hasselblad and it
is the world's first mirrorless camera
with a medium format sensor what that
means is that the sensor inside of this
is enormous it's bigger than any other
mirrorless camera you might have seen
whether it's a compact one or even one
with a 35 millimeter full-frame sensor
like Sony's a7 series this one's even
bigger and what that means is that
you're going to get better image quality
in theory you get better low-light
performance better color reproduction
better dynamic range it's really kind of
like the holy grail of digital
photography and hospital as put it in
this camera that's way more compact than
anything else it's done before it's
roughly the size of a Canon Rebel SLR
it's a little bit heavier of course it's
made out of aluminum much more solid
feeling much more robust and tough it
has a brand new lens mount and
Hasselblad is announcing some couple new
lenses for you can see here new lens
mount with the sensor there this here in
my hand is a 90 millimeter lens that's
launching with it there's also a 45
millimeter lens that's coming with it as
well and Hasselblad is going to be
coming out with an adapter to use other
eight system lenses from its larger
platforms on the back of the camera it's
a thoroughly modern mirrorless camera
you've got a 3-inch touch screen on the
back electronic viewfinder your usual
controls dual SD card slots outputs for
hdmi USB C microphone inputs and outputs
it does actually shoot video at 1080p if
you want to use it for video the real
thrill of shooting with the x1d is for
it stills 50 mega pixels of resolution
14 stops of dynamic range shoot sizes up
to 25,000 600 which is a bit higher than
the Hasselblad h6 camera even great for
portrait photography or anything else
that you need to be on the go it's not
going to be good for sports it only
shoots a couple frames per second the
autofocus systems not nearly as fast as
other cameras for those types of
purposes but if you're a portrait
photographer this is definitely
something to lust after of course you're
gonna have to pay for it the body itself
it's like $9,000 you had lenses to it
all in for the new lenses with the
camera you're looking probably around
$14,000 which is a significant
investment for anybody especially even a
working photographer but it is a lot
less than you might pay for an h6 which
starts at $27,000 so it's a really cool
interesting camera
it's coming out later this year you'll
be able to get one towards the end of
this summer and we're looking forward to
spending more time with it
how you doing</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
