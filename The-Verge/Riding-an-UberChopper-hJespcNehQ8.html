and Las Vegas can be a real drag traffic
gridlock crowds and thousands of thirsty
tech companies trying to get your
attention so we decided to Hale an uber
and get out of town or a few miles above
town this is uber chopper during CES
gadget lovers with money to burn can
hail a helicopter through their uber app
thanks to a partnership between maverick
helicopters in the ride-hailing company
it's a total marketing gimmick but what
better way to escape CES and see the Las
Vegas skyline than to soar above the
clouds in your own personal helicopter
let's be clear the uber chopper doesn't
take you from point A to point B it's a
99 dollar pleasure ride and that's about
it
and uber has done this before offering
helicopter rides and some major events
like Khan and Coachella spots are
limited so get to the chopper if you
want to ride so it's not totally
irrelevant to overs dreams for the
future
last year the company released something
called uber elevate which was a high
concept flying car project it's about
actually building cars that could fly
through the air over traffic instead of
through it but we don't have flying cars
yet but there are a couple of tech
startups that are working on prototypes
it'll be a long time before we actually
get those so until then you may just
want to hail a chopper</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
