the virtual one with endless beats that
just keep jamming and jamming we're just
gonna dance the whole time this is
really mean it doesn't always do that I
don't believe you Crichton hey everyone
has good so this is a very special
edition of The Verge cast there's a big
trial going on in the world apple vs
samsung it is a major i would say it's
probably the biggest technology related
trial in the past five years maybe for
the next ten years and there's a lot to
talk about with it there's a lot going
on and the past to verge Cass we've had
we've talked about it at length but I
don't think everybody wants to keep
hearing about it every single week for
half an hour on the regular verge cast
so it turns out you know we have a big
staff of people and we have I am joined
today by brian bishop who is been
reporting with for us live from the
courthouse every day the trials going on
and we have Matt meharry who is a rock
star and he is actually a patent
attorney and he's been doing it the
coverage for us and with us on the
patent stuff for since we've started
basically right Matt since the verge
first day at lunch yeah I can't hear
Matt actually can't hear myself either
so you perfectly honest with you now can
I hear Matt testy yep there we go so
Matt you mean you were like I think one
of our very first hires actually yeah it
came on the first day of November first
yeah yeah so anyway so I figured since
we have Brian there we've got Matt and I
just like to spew my own opinion without
any recourse to fact or reason we should
talk about the trial we're going to be
doing this every week
trials manage another month I want to
say hi Brian yeah right now is scheduled
through the fourth of September yeah so
about another month the trial head of us
there's a lot going on each week and I I
know there's a big appetite for in-depth
analysis of the trial but again I think
it's best of both worlds for us for the
three of us to be able to break it down
in depth every week and then we can kind
of do highlights in a regular verge cast
and that way we want to annoy the people
who do not care about patent lawsuits so
let's go right into it this I think was
the past two days have been pretty
dramatic in the trial Brian you want to
kind of take us through what's happened
so far and what happened in past couple
days yeah definitely I mean last time we
spoke I believe was uh was on Thursday
Friday we had a bunch of witnesses from
apple and we're still in the Apple phase
where Apple is calling up all their
witnesses so friday we saw scott
forstall we saw phil schiller we saw a
couple expert witnesses yesterday we saw
Susan care who was a an icon designer
that worked on the original like mac OS
and had done work for facebook and
microsoft and they're also a bunch of
you no more crazy objections and
accusations from Samsung and you know
judge lucy koh getting really really
angry yet again which seems to be part
of the circus of the whole thing um so I
you know friday was really cool because
we with Schiller and forestall we got
some looks you know and how the iphone
was created we saw some of that with
christopher stringer earlier in the week
but there was some more specific stuff
with those two guys Schiller was talking
more about the marketing aspect of it
you know just how we knock from was
introduced how they didn't do a lot of
marketing they slowly ramped it up with
that Academy Awards I don't know if you
remember they had you know if everybody
experience the famous people making
calls yeah exactly and it's talking
about you know like what the reaction
had been and he real Apple does do his
team does do some customer surveys in
terms of you know talking to people that
have bought up with products you know
Steve Jobs has said famously we don't go
in till you know ask customers what they
want turns out they do ask Apple
customers what they think about the
products employment but I thinks that
for their soul I mean the distinction
there is yeah i think that they don't
say what should we make next they say
well we sold you this what what about it
is good what about it is bad which i
think every kia exactly i mean that's
actually i think one of the main things
that we're learning about in this trial
is how all these companies run and they
mean they all pay attention to each
other they they in the way they
generally market themselves and the way
they generally talk to the press about
it you know they pretend that you know
Samsung pretends apple doesn't exist
Apple pretend Samson doesn't exist
pretty much everybody pretends HTC
doesn't exist which is sick burn but the
reality is al pay a lot of attention to
the other products in the market to the
other companies what they're doing the
directions of the market and there's a
lot of that coming out and I think one
of the really interesting things is just
how deeply apple pays attention to its
competitors because they run around
insisting that they just make the
products for themselves you know they
don't care what everybody else is doing
they want to solve problems that you
know they themselves you know the Apple
employees and executives once solved and
it turns out that you know who is it was
Eddy Cue was using a galaxy tab and he's
like there's a market for seven inch
device to keep telling Steve Jobs we
have to make one because i'm using a
galaxy tab they have a there's a
conference room at apple with the
android war room is that what they
called it brian and where they just pay
attention to how android phone makers
market their products and that you know
they're responsive to it and i think
we're seeing a lot of that come out but
it's balanced i think and this is what
happened yesterday and what apple's
really been pushing samsung on with how
deeply samsung paid attention to the
specific iphone and how they should
change their products or tweak their
products to be more or less like the
iphone yeah and this has been kind of
crazy because there were a number of
documents that came out you know
internal samson documents talking about
you know what the company's take on the
iphone was they called you know
Samsung's own products when compared to
the iphone they said there was a crisis
in design one quote was a you know it's
the difference between heaven and earth
when you compare the usability of the
iphone vs samsung products at the time
and was interesting one of the witnesses
that Apple called was a a marketing
officer for samsung telecommunications
of america and he basically said you
know that was just hyperbole don't pay
attention that that's just us like you
know working the ranks up and get
everybody really excited as they can go
and work harder but it's hard to really
believe it cuz you know the stockmen
that came out yesterday in its
entirety we'd seen clips of it before
where's basically Samsung comparing at
the time the galaxy s before had been
released side by side with the iphone
there's like a hundred and thirty-two
pages talking about you know getting
everything yeah icon design like the way
like the keyboard overlaps you're
looking at mail like incredible my new
shake every feet and you know in the
obeah yeah it's in it's pretty insane as
it goes far beyond just saying I'm going
to see how they're doing stuff they were
looking directly at how the iphone did
stuff better than their phones and stuff
they could do to make it better and a
lot of times what they suggested to
improve upon were things that you know
we're adopting iphone functionality so
yep Matt imac look I think you I'm gonna
ask you what you're about to say uh so
you were you sent an email today to me
and Brian saying this goes way more this
isn't really related to the patent stuff
but this goes way more to the trade
dress stuff can you kind of explain what
you mean by that yeah and after that I'd
like to see what I'd like to learn a
little bit how like how that came into
evidence because it's crazy broad covers
things that have nothing to do with the
case really a lot of the features and
none were covered in the patents I don't
think I don't even think it talks about
does it talk about the scroll back every
no fit now has I things Barisan in there
I mean it's really like I mean I wasn't
even able to read all of it it's it's so
nice kimpton yeah it's insane just the
level of detail that they that they went
into to compare each feature and and
normally when you have a case like this
you'll you'll go into it and this kind
of evidence doesn't come in in this big
bulk you'll have a couple features where
you try to show copying and 44 if it was
just the utility patents that were play
in this case you'd have you know three
features and those features if they're
not covered in those documents don't
come in but because they have the trade
dress claim as part of this case which
is going to more the look and feel in
the overall you know thing that makes
iOS iOS they tend to they have this
broad they have much the green light is
just insane down the amount of
information are allowed to get in
because of just the nature of their
claims and I think this a pizza and it's
great because it paints the picture that
they want it's great for them I'm not
saying it's great it's great for Apple
because this is
information they need to get in for
their narrative on copying and to prove
up their their their trade Forex dress
claims in general because copying such a
huge part of it so let's I actually want
to talk about crate redress just a
little bit before we get into sort of
the nitty-gritty of what actually has
been happening the trial and I think
this is one of the biggest points that
is being misunderstood about this trial
versus apple vs motorola or apple vs HTC
or the inevitable Apple versus Google
which I still believe is coming all the
other cases in the world has been patent
cases and pretty much utility patent
cases right Matt there they're about
software patents they're about the
scroll back feature on the iphone
they're about you know scaling and
rotation like isn't there there's one
that's scrolling where if you you lock
in a XY axis it doesn't panted left and
right very nitty-gritty software
features yeah design patents are tough I
mean they're Darrell to be easy to get
but they're they're narrow so I'm you
have to almost be a direct copy in order
to assert it and that's why they've been
able to do that especially with like the
first line of galaxy s phones in a
galaxy tab but what I'm saying is I
think the figure claim Apple's bigger
claim in this lawsuit has always been
trade dress it's always been you made a
bunch of phones and you copied the are
look and feel and you sold them to
people knowing with a deliberate intent
to mislead them in the marketplace in
that I think that's fundamentally more
important than the patent stuff I think
if Apple was forced to choose I think
they would stick with the trade dress
claims and throw out the patent claims
obviously they have the whole set of
stuff so they don't have to choose but i
think the trade dress stuff is broader
and it is actually more meaningful to
Apple in the marketplace I think that's
why the hurry and the joy right man
that's why they had Phil Schiller
talking about how they marketed the
iphone how they invested in the brand
because that's basically the argument is
it's a it's a consumer confusion
argument it's we invested money in
letting people know what the iphone was
letting people know that the ipad was
letting people know I OS was and now
Samsung is coming along and deliberately
trying to free ride on our investment
into what these things look like how
they're marketed what they appear like
in stores I don't know mean Brian it
seems like Schiller he made that
argument pretty well man on
cross-examination Samsung kind of
attacked him a little bit i mean how'd
that go I mean he was good overall he
was human very close to the party line
like you know that we've seen all the
Apple witnesses kind of say like the
Apple employee rather witnesses you know
about creating beautiful objects it was
interesting they asked me to what his
reaction was when he saw the galaxy tab
and he could just basically said you
know I thought they were going to copy
our entire product line you know and
they've tried to go in like hammer
everybody about you know this notion of
confusion and dilution and is it really
reasonable to think that you know rigger
consumers would go and be confused
between the two devices when you you
know when you see like a startup screen
for example you know on a tab when you
start it up that's been like one thing
that Sam's like attorneys have done like
I think three times now you know
basically kind of like a great way of
theatrics they put me of an iphone or
you know a samsung phone or a tab
underneath you know the overhead
projector and basically you know turn it
up and say like hey do you think he
would really be confused if they saw
this and really think this was an iPad
or an iPhone but Schiller held up pretty
good all apples witnesses have held up
pretty good actually except for an
expert witness they had named Peter
bressler's who got hammered and started
to falter a bit on Monday wait wait he
got hammered by the attorney or he got
like wasted on the stand that'd be
amazing what it is like it what I can't
do very amazing yeah we like water
picture of scotch yeah yeah wait so what
happened if I actually I think that
one's really really interesting because
that seems to be Samsung's strategy that
is from my perspective that is working
very well is when they dragged the
experts down into the muck and they say
here the millimeter difference is I mean
hows that's going what's our strategy
there um you know basically you had like
these broad you know emotional arguments
about copying and the big picture stuff
that Apple's making and they are just
diving down to these really granular
granular levels you know you know
basically saying like is this you know
there's like the radial measurement of
the iphone is you know is 13 millimeters
here and in this other phone it's like
10 millimeters and that's not exactly
the same is it and kind of drilling down
these really really my new differences
we sought with Susan kare yester
day about the about the differences in
the the icons like really really my new
differences when in her example she was
talking about the overall visual and
impression and it's hard to see how it's
playing with the jury but the longer
they do that and the longer they drag it
out you know that just sticks in the
forefront of your mind and like it's
hard to go and say yes this overall
impression is X and that's terrible when
Samsung can point to like you know ten
differences basically you know amongst
the set of icons or amongst the design
or things like that one thing with
breasts so that was really really funny
he was showing the patent for the ipad
which you know according to the the
design language of the illustrations
basically shows that the back of the
ipad has a reflective surface that's
like the 0 35 actually not the only 35
patent the patent was derived from the 0
35 prototype and basically they brought
out the galaxy tab 10.1 and they said
well look at the back of this device you
know it has a matte finish and they
brought it up to bressler and they were
saying you know can you see yourself you
know in the back he's like oh it's it's
reflected you can reflect light off of
it like can you see your reflection sir
like really hammering ho it's it's not a
reflective service you know which is
kind of like part of what stringer to
point it out and you know when it's in
the illustration for the patent and
we'll eventually I respect to those eyes
well guide that like you said it goes
back to Neela original pointed if they
if they were more involved in the trade
dress claims they this new honest the
getting down in the weeds by Samsung is
a lot less important it's it's crucial
for the for the design patents that
Samsung do that because that's really
how they distinguish themselves over
what are narrow patents and I think it's
still a mistake I think two mistakes
that Apple's made in this case is they
didn't they didn't narrow it down enough
they should have got rid of they have a
design pad in the case on the icons
which is so narrow and that's what
Samsung was focusing on was although we
don't have this Nikon all right kind of
different color you know has a different
shape on this part of it those are all
important things in it gets lost but
your back and slides Apple really put
the me a zoo m9 the m8 that is amazing I
didn't see that so if you don't know
where we've on the screen we've got the
trial evidence or August seventh
on an apple what the its alternative
designs for home screen we've got the
blackberry torch to nokia n9 which is me
go and then meizu m8 and what's
hilarious to me about that is the
amazing m8 is one of the most outrageous
iphone curves i think ever mega maze
you've started their company building
hilarious curse of the iphone hilarious
clones of the iphone so it's pretty I
mean having apple throw up what is it
like almost admittedly an iphone clone
to show that samsung could have done
something else it's pretty ballsy it's
that's remarkable to me sorry I
interrupted you my god no no it's so I
guess my point is that the if you look
at some of the claims that still exist
Apple's allowed samsung to take on this
tactic of getting into the weeds and
discrediting some of the experts but I
think they could have done a better job
of preparing their case because they had
enough there you don't have to go in
with everything you have you go in with
your best and do a trial like this
knowing that you have limited time and
you have a jury that's going to want to
kill themselves after about four weeks
of this so you really I think in some
ways they narrowed it down some pretty
key elements and it needed to keep some
design patents in and maybe a utility
patent or two but you're right they
really should have focused more on the
trade breast and I think they're trying
to but getting lost with their design
patents in there they have designed pad
on the icon which is ridiculous and I
think in the end they they're really
either gonna have to kind of change
focus and maybe now it's just the big
picture stuff so we're not really
getting a feel for the entirety of their
case but I'd like to hear from Brian
just how that's working because I heard
a lot of things about the testimony it's
related to the icons and I'm confused by
how how it's being dealt with by by
Apple and Samsung and how something like
that document that came in yesterday how
that even got in and what the fight was
or how the fight will has turned out
there was fought over in general to get
it in its yeah it's interesting we've
only seen a couple slides of that in
court some came in last week basically
comparing the
kahn design and then a you know a couple
more came in yesterday I came in with
the Susan kare testimony but that and
thing and in its entirety hasn't been
discussed it's looking a lot of this you
know evidence that we're actually seeing
nila you mentioned like the comparison
with the mizu phone the only compares me
actually brought into court as far as
alternative design was the blackberry
torch so some of the stuff is probably
you know going with the jurors when they
get you know when they're deliberating
but it hasn't been introduced you know
hasn't been shown and slides in court
yet um but that whole document like
that's part of the the 132 page dr.
Singh that we've seen from the very
beginning it may have even been in like
the opening presentation I can't recall
but we've seen bits and pieces of that
from the very beginning of the the thing
but we didn't have an idea that was like
that massive and it constituted that
many comparisons so they do seem to be
picking and choosing their battles and
Neil which one of those they're going to
represent to make a most effective
argument but in terms of traitorous
overall it's my impression that the tray
dress argument is getting diluted in the
courtroom because they can be really
specific with some of these are the
design patents trade degress seems a bit
nebulous also you know they had an
expert you know yesterday Tuesday
talking about the notion of dilution and
even that was kind of you know nebulous
don't feel like I'm making a really
strong argument that connects there and
you know these are hard things to convey
to a jury like Apple has been really
good at making an overall emotional
argument and there's a lot of evidence
that supports that but getting down to
the nitty-gritty it's it's hard to sell
people I mean it truly is and you're
seeing it watching a day to day how
these people react is just a lot of you
know my new show that it's it's hard for
people to latch on to and its really
easy for samsung to go and like you know
pull up a couple of things you know and
make its you know feel like the overall
pictures and you can be dismissed so
actually let's talk about the people a
little bit Brian and how what's the jury
like you know it's a you know there was
interesting you know selection process
we talked about it last week you know
people from all walks of life people
that work in different industries there
are people that you know and the jury
pool that were and you're like engineers
that had patents yeah you know from the
most part they are very very engaged and
they seem to be very very with it and
interested we did all the Google Oracle
stuff people start checking out because
the patent stuff you know an API stuff
was so granular and so this hard to
follow here you know Apple is doing a
good job of keeping it you know big
picture enough so I think people are
really really engaging people
for their taking notes they're really
really they seem to be present in the
courtroom and you can kind of see that
shift in body language when people start
checking out and for the most part they
are still into it thus far on their den
29 jurors now because one had to go and
leave because of hardship issues yeah
didn't she like from most crying right
because her job and let her leave or
something yeah exactly um but everybody
they're still there nobody else is left
yet so that's good I'm like a lot of
Nexus 7 I gotta go um exactly what's the
judge saying to them about looking at
the news I mean this is big news right
it's it's all it's on the front page of
CNN um yeah every every time we break
every time they you know the end the day
she always says to them you know don't
discuss it amongst each other don't
watch the news cuz there was that whole
thing you know last week with Quinn
where he leaked the stuff to you know to
the press and he or she questioned each
jury one by one to make sure they hadn't
seen any news articles about it so she's
very very aware that that's you know
happening that that coverage is out
there that is getting so much attention
and like I said like you know three or
four times a day whenever there's any
sort of break she has this whole little
routine that she tells the jury do you
know to not read stuff don't discuss
keep an open mind um yeah so she's been
on top of it and run to that and then so
i guess the flip side of that is what
are the lawyers like because it seems
like the lawyers are both very smooth
and not able to get away with a lot of
theatrics because of the judge right and
that's just a sense of getting what's
going on for me no no it's it's totally
true like I mean we haven't seen a lot
of John Quinn Samsung I want to
Samsung's attorneys since all that stuff
went down last week we've seen a lot of
Charles their joven you know talking to
witnesses Michael Jacobs who also tried
in the other case for Oracle has been
questioning a couple people this week
you know and they're all fairly together
there's a certain amount of frustration
on the part of Samsung just because
there are just lots of things they're
asking for that they're not getting and
the reasonable they're not getting for a
lot of them these are like discovery
issues things that weren't just closed
earlier you know things of that nature
so it's not like she's going out of her
way to hammer them or there's just lots
of things that are asking for every day
that they get hammered for when we saw
it just you know earlier this week were
they basically accused Apple of
tampering with the evidence of one of
the phones make it look more like the
icons on the iphone you know it was a
joint exhibit for the it was the
epic touch 4g i believe and it may seem
like you know it's so good but basically
said like you know we think they tamper
with it here we've taken our own picture
that shows how it really is out of the
box yeah I'm making this big deal
because they said they took a picture on
Monday night shooting on sunday night
the picture was dated Monday had the
clock and date on there they said oh it
has the google search box on it out of
the box the picture didn't have it and
co's just getting pissed like she just
doesn't want to go and deal with any
kind of crap and so anything like that
that looks bad that looks like they're
trying to pull a fast one she's just
shutting it down and it's happening on
both sides it's not just on samsung but
does feel like there's more frustration
on Sam set for more so therefore they
are getting less just buying of the law
of averages well Matt so let me ask you
there's a lot of there's a drumbeat of
judge Koh you know our readers say it
all the time that she doesn't like
Samsung is this Samsung I mean to me it
seems like there's a few things going on
one it seems like Samsung decided to
change its narrative and its defense
sort of at the last minute and they
change tactics and how they were going
to defend the try on how they're going
to prosecute their case and so there
it's thick they're having a difficult
time trying to execute that change
because I have to ask her a lot of stuff
that she's not giving them then there's
the Samsung keeps on doing crazy stuff
that the judge doesn't like like sending
out a press release of evidence that was
excluded all that sort of thing and then
there's just that you get the sense that
she doesn't want to deal with anything
period when Samsung knows it and they're
building a case for an appeal so Matt
what's your take on like how those three
things are kind of playing out i mean
it's samsung just going for an appeal
are they or they just trying to change
tactics and kind of failing now i think
it change tactics that you know the big
issue for samsung and the reason i think
they keep kind of pounding on these
issues am really going back to the judge
over and over again to try to get some
of these issues resolved it's because
they're not going into this trial I mean
technically they're a better counter
plaintiff but they're on the defensive
end they don't have the kind of smoking
gun stuff against Apple
that Apple has against Samsung you know
when you look at things like that
evidence we saw yesterday that's whether
they talk about in trial or not if the
jury sees it and the during deliberation
it's going to have an impact and there's
things like that and that one may not
have been fought over but I think just
from the beginning they've been more on
the defensive but I do agree that part
of us because throughout discovering and
right up until the beginning a trial
they really just didn't have cohesive
plan together and when you change it up
at last minute like that you know good
judge isn't gonna allow it to happen for
many reasons I don't think she's it all
been I think theatrics like this occur
in every trial even small trials tit for
tat you know you accused us of
destroying documents so we're gonna
accuse you that's nothing new I just
think the magnitude of the case in the
drama that surrounds it has just
amplified everything to the point where
co is just she's done with it yeah she's
uh she's she's a she she wants to get
through the trial and I think she
there's probably sort of enjoyment in
that for her but all this this sideshow
stuff is his outer last nerve so I I
don't really I don't what I'd look at
what she's doing I don't see anything
abnormal from what you normally see from
a judge it's just there's so much of it
because so much is happening every day
that that it gets amplified so let's
talk a little bit about what's gonna
what might happen there's one more day
of the trial right Wednesday rep right
not wednesday friday right price writing
this weekend what's happening on friday
but what's what's going to happen then
there's a couple more expert witnesses
for apple coming in there's nobody you
know nobody big-name you're going to be
like oh that person you know like we've
seen the last few days but it feels like
there's gonna be no methodically going
through their case with their expert
witnesses and there's not a whole lot of
people left you know on there rolling
witness list and we put they only
haven't won to say about five or six
people left and you know and there's not
a lot of time that they can go and
really use now they know they have
everybody's limited to 25 hours I don't
have the counts right in front of me but
you know but apples you know been using
a bit of it there's a there's about four
or five people left on their witness
list so they're going to be wrapping up
you know probably like it you know you
know next week is going to be a five-day
week where it's all been three day weeks
up till now so they're in a rep of their
case
probably by mid you know mid next week
that's just crazy I mean if you think
about it and we wrote it up and we did
our first kind of preliminary or a
preview pieces on this the case itself
is Apple's case alone is unimaginable it
with regard to the the amount of proof I
mean that the narratives are great and
it's what makes it interesting to us and
it's what kind of keeps a jury involved
but if you don't prove up your case with
respect to every piece of IP every pad
and every trade dress in the case with
respect to every Q's product you're
really kind of leaving the door wide
open for for a big loss you know at the
end of that deliberate got a many phones
that's the thing did this case should
not samsung you mean Samsung and do it
out there doing great job of putting
these phones out there but for Apple for
them to be having any conversation at
all in this case about the galaxy ace
which has been put out or the droid
charge or whatever like those are the
wrong phones to put in front of the jury
you need like Babel wants to make this
argument that Samsung copied their
they're protected rectangle they needed
to focus on I would say the galaxy s
variants I don't think any of it is
Samsung's other phones and what they did
with TouchWiz a samsung received in us
enough punishment in the world for
putting out the Droid Charge like it
that is my fundamental belief right it
was a bad phone people it it's not they
accomplished anything with it what they
what they really accomplished something
within the galaxy ace and all these 25
phones right Matt there it was it's
around there right yeah it's some
ridiculous number of phones but the
phone that's important is the galaxy s
and the galaxy s2 because those are the
phones that sell the most that make
Samsung the most money and quite frankly
represent the biggest threat to the
iphone and so Apple like made this huge
mistake this absolutely huge mistake by
adding in all of these other crappy
Samsung phones and you know some of them
might are different the Droid Charge
looks appreciably different than the
iphone TouchWiz doesn't but what battle
are you winning by putting that in front
of the jury
saying compare the icons and I you know
I I think that speaks to apples hubris
and arrogance a little bit where they're
saying we really do we really do believe
that this stuff this look and feel of
the iphone is ours and maybe that's not
so true when you look at just the
software on a piece of hardware that
looks different and I think that for the
jury pulling all that apart and deciding
it on this phone the galaxy can we pull
up a picture of the galaxy ace galaxy
ace really looks like no I mean it's
such a I mean it's a low-end samsung
phone it looks like a low-end samsung
phone nobody no human being looks at a
galaxy ace and says oh that's an iphone
i think a lot of people out of looked at
a galaxy s or and I I tell the story a
lot I think a lot of people looked at
the the fascinate on verizon in
particular and said that's as close to
an iphone or verizon said do a lot of
customers you don't want a particularly
to women customers they said you don't
want to draw it because we market this
is a robot that will murder you we don't
have the iphone but we have we have we
have the fascinate and they saw the
fascinate i mean if you look at the
galaxy ace i mean this is just like it's
just a phone like it has kind of nothing
to do with any phone design ever made
like it just looks like a thing and to
me it's talking about this phone that
meant nothing to anyone ever where they
should be talking about the phone that
you know apples narrative gets stronger
if they say samson put out this flagship
phone i took this huge amount of market
share from acid diluted are you know our
branding and it's just it's a cultural
phenomenon unto itself and they did it
by stealing from us that's great saying
they made their crappy phones look like
ours is samsung should spend all day
talking about that because who cares i
think that that to me is the story of
this trial it's you get you know i think
there's a certain amount of let me put
this a different way you know pawn came
out with the pre you know there was a
lot of elements of the pre that people
thought apples gonna sue them over it
and they never nothing ever happened why
didn't anything ever happen because pre
was never a competitive threat to the
iphone samsung some of their products
are so may
that conversation should happen but a
lot of their products aren't you know
apple doesn't compete in a lot of these
spaces I think the epic 4g isn't added
issue that has a slider keyboard yes um
apples naughty those are all in the case
because of the OS utility pads I mean
that's the dilemma Apple has is they're
trying to they don't want to have the
suit focus only on the look and feel
they want they want to have these
nuanced utility patents in there that
they you know I I don't know if that's a
that's a balance between the attorneys
that represent apple and Apple's own
level of confidence in the you know some
of these iOS features or if it's just
that somebody's done a bad job of kind
of knowing this case down but I don't
think they've ever been willing to just
go after just a design in the look ya
know if I wanted to keep those utilities
and if there are people on the chat
telling you to the galaxy s was popular
in Europe I'm not disputing that that's
great i'm glad cheap phones are popular
on the world samsung is an excellent job
of filling that market this is not about
that this is about the this trial and
trying to prove to nine people on a jury
that some phones copy some out some very
specific elements from another phone and
you can't do that when you when you
literally broaden the conversation to 25
devices and i think ultimately the jury
is going to get I mean Brian have they
gotten through this are they are they
doing representative groups of the
phones or they do they just get all the
individual phones if they're doing all
the individual phones but I mean
speaking your plan before that that
strategy that Apple's taking is already
you're seeing you're seeing both Herthum
and you're seeing like why I device
specific strategy but you know works
better we talked about them you know
showing a samsung attorney showing the
startup sequence for different devices
hey the phone they used was the droid
charge because it comes up and it says
droid and like it immediately you go
there's no way he could go and compare
that that's that hurts Apple right yeah
but Apple with you know with a doctor
care they were very very careful to go
and compare the iphone icons and that
those you know Dawkins we saw yesterday
about icon design with the fascinate
because that is a really compelling case
because you see like what the
preliminary icons for the S word then
you see the fascinate variant and how
that's so similar so like you kind of
like in you know in two different
examples it's
really really clear how much a one to
one device comparison helps them and
that's the problem with apples case it
mean that's that's where it hurts them
the most because if they were focusing
on trade dress it maybe even design
patents not the other things they could
focus more attention on defending
against that because really actual
confusion actually comparing the boot up
sequence and things like that for the
two phones is only one factor in
determining whether or not there's trade
dress infringement or delusion so but
but they kind of have to skim over those
things they don't have the time or the
resources within that limited trial
period to actually focus on what matters
and so they get kind of I don't know you
can tell us Brian whether or not they
did a decent job of rebutting that but
my guess is they really couldn't it's
hard because you know you have somebody
say you know our consumers actually
gonna be confused and to be fair you
know most people when they're like
learning about a device you know they go
to bestbuy you're not you know desolee
gonna be turning it on right you're not
gonna start going to see that startup
sequence that's not guaranteed by any
means but it's a compelling argument to
a jury you know an apple you know they
brought up an expert talking about you
know how you know how many people
associate apple with you know the look
of the ipad of the iphone and their
their arguments in terms of dilution and
even you know you know trade dress
awareness they're all very broad and
vague they are glossing over all this
stuff and it's not as specific as
pictures you know those things work
really really well but these other
things there's still nebulous concepts
and it doesn't feel like up to the point
they've done a good job explaining that
to the jury right and to be clear the
reason I'm focused on how many phones
are and the reason that these broad
arguments are hard is because at the end
of the trial the jurors are going to get
a sheet that says galaxy ace does it is
Apple's trade dress valid does a galaxy
ace infringement yes or no does it the
alsace and fringe this patent yes or no
and they're gonna have to do that for
every single phone and that to me is
just bonkers like to put a jury in that
position it like maybe increases your
chances because you have more literally
more boxes marked yes that they can fill
out so there's more of a chance to win
on one claim against one phone that's a
good strategy but the the core of their
case
is definitely Samsung copied us in like
that they can tell that narrative with
one device they can focus on one yeah
that narrative is huge copy is for
dilution and trade dress infringement is
huge it's another factor in addition to
actual confusion so all the same a total
evidence the best buy or whether or not
somebody would distinguish between the
two startup screens could be offset by
apple with all this evidence of copying
but instead of just being thrown in
there is general information to kind of
color samsung as a bad actor but in the
end the jury SP will connect that
argument was something on their jury
instruction sheet and it's tough to do
what do you don't even remember them
talking about that phone hey look at
this phone on the jury sheet you have no
it won't get to go back and look through
documents it's just the narrative only
carries him so far during deliberation
yeah I mean now we'll see I mean I have
do you think they're gonna the jurors
are going to sit there rifling through
that 132 page document and say this is
pretty obvious what they did I mean it's
some point you think Apple has to bring
it up you like look at this huh yeah
somebody assess look through five pages
in skim the rest and pretty much get the
message I mean Matt let me bluntly would
you characterize that as like a smoking
gun or is that just another piece well
it's not smoking gonna direct evidence
of you know a point of proof for
infringement necessarily but it's a huge
smoking gun I think as far as kind of
your gut feel whatever you're gonna as a
juror I think it's uh it's one of the
things you'll have in the back your mind
every time you think about what they're
doing you think about the kind of the
credibility of Samsung's defenses it's
certainly important I don't I don't
smoking I would call it that yeah yeah
so you've come around you started with I
won't call that and now it's so let's
look this over Matt Ryan next week Apple
is going to wrap up and then Samsung
goes on the offensive now and they've
got a whole case about utility patents
to prove up what do you think their
tactic with that is going to be how do
you think that's going to shape up I
mean I think they have a
our job in front of them and you know
with that case because this stuff is
just inherently granular it's inherently
in the weeds it's going to be hard to go
and get people really really involved
and Apple is going to be able to say you
know these or you know reasonable
patents I mean it's gonna be you know
there's the whole issue of you know of
the you know the the chipmaker that
apple buys the chips from you're already
having a license this is gonna be hard
for me to go and sell it I think just
out of sheer like you know jury apathy
and that's not to say the jury's not
great and isn't like involving isn't
excited doesn't wanna do a great job
it's just hard to make things that
interesting on that level of granularity
for regular human beings it's just a
challenge we saw with your the other
trial yeah I mean I was I mean that was
Oracle's problem it would the copyright
is that trial and I don't know if people
out there listening and they didn't
follow the Google Oracle trial what we
learned from there was the copyright
days was super interesting it was super
great it was big personalities and they
copied us in lines of code and we can
line it all up and say what works and
how it does it and it was great to track
that and then the patent phase of that
trial started and it was literally like
a downhill slide of how interesting it
was it was big claim charts of like here
are patents and here are technologies
online up to it and you know Apple has
that problem they've got to do it right
they've got a show that the claims of
the scroll back patent are infringed and
I undoubtedly have to do a claim chart
at some point but then they've got this
other they've got this alternate
narrative of they copied our look and
feel people are getting confused Samsung
has only utility patents to prove up and
they're in they're going to jump right
into the look at this specific
functionality in one of our software
patents the iphone infringes it because
of this claim chart that says it does
that mean and worse yet they have to
deal with the friend issues which again
puts images she's my colors them in this
light that they don't want to be in yeah
how is that gonna matthew you have any
ideas on how that's gonna play out when
samsung goes on the relative ah their
case is gonna be incredibly dry and I uh
mine but but you know they don't care if
they lose they if they win against their
defenses against Apple they don't care
if they lose their own offensive case
yeah matter I mean what if they if they
if they win against Apple they win
regardless of their own right claims
does it matter if they win on some of
the phones and not on some of the other
phones so how do you see that playing I
mean I mean I'm so focused on some of
the phones but and the fact that Apple's
so many phones in the case but what is
that let's say they went on the galaxy s
and not in the droid charge and they
went on you know they do then they pay
money okay I don't see any effect market
wise of this case because none of the
current phones were even in the case so
you're not going to get so what good is
an injunction do against the galaxy s
right I mean they'll just pay up some
money um that's an S inherent problem
with these cases they move so slow that
by time you get to trial you know your
your five iterations past the phone is
in trial so um that's why plumber
injunctions are so important to the
plaintiffs in these cases so I I don't
know I mean I I think there's a chance
you'll see some of these phones
especially design patents galaxy s um
pretty good chance they might be found
to infringe if the pads aren't
invalidated but I just don't I you know
I guess if they can avoid injunction and
they're not going to get a junction on
every phone that I mean it just doesn't
work that way you don't get any
junctions on these future phones that
don't exist or the phones that aren't in
the case so um it could just be a big
money pay out but it's not all that big
really I mean yep it's huge well new
piece of their sales right and that's
yeah but woke me nuts it was apples
asking for like two point two five
billion dollars i mean it's not a small
amount of but for samsung yeah that's it
exam so your cells off a division
they're like well we've been making jeep
engines for five years we'll just sell
that division like that's not actually
what happened by the way that is not
that is not a formal legal analysis by
me something so a jeep factory to pay
that's not going to happen well we've
gotta wrap up we're going to do this
every week so next week there's five
days of trial next week so we'll have to
squeeze it in somehow but every week the
trial goes on there's a lot to unpack up
just an enormous amount of information
it's coming out of this trial both
in-house samsung and apple developer
products how they think about each other
as competitors
and frankly I I think we're learning a
lot about how Samsung is going to
develop products in the future and I
think the s3 the galaxy s3 is a really
good example of Samsung kind of learning
that it has to be different you know
it's a great phone I don't if you guys
have used it apart from I don't like
pentile screens I can I can like
perceive that there's some great at
whatever I'm just I'm in the weeds um
but it's a great phone and it's very
very different than the iphone it did
feel everything about it is different
and I think Samsung is learning and I
keep saying this about Samsung in
general is one samsung learns that it is
an enormous enormous company that owns
every piece of the technology industry
and has a major presence and they're
confident enough to do things on their
own without thinking about the rest of
the market in a very significant way
like I think that will change things a
lot uh you know I was talking to chris
sigler who is one of our senior editors
and he was like you know if people don't
think Samsung is innovative and they're
not literally at the top of their game
right now they're crazy Samsung is doing
some of the best work you know in the
consumer technology industry they just
have to get away from thinking that they
should that they need to be reflective
of something else that because the
iphone is popular they need to run out
make an iphone they need to figure out
how to go make something better and
different and I think there I think that
is happening with them oh yeah we got to
keep mind a lot of what's what we're
seeing in the evidence was when they
were initially working on there yeah
2000 centers more I don't oh yeah and
Eve's ome the fact that they're doing it
differently now is is anything pretty
evident yeah and you know what I want
really bad is a galaxy note 10.1 I'm not
gonna lie to you I don't think anybody
what can I mean that it's like my dream
look I'm again way in the weeds um so
that's it for the verge a special
edition any final thoughts gentlemen you
know I just gonna say like you know the
point you just made matter what happens
with the trial no matter what you think
on either sides of it i think it's i
think your act is that accurate what
you're saying Eli and I it's actually
it's great that you know that it's
leading to innovation you no matter what
you want to what stance you want to take
good bad pro apple pro samson whatever
you think happened I think it's
undeniable that it has gone an increased
innovation on their side and that is
increasing choice in the market and that
is good for consumers because now we can
get a phone that's you know that are
different and are more very
and that's what you're safe that's a
nice proposal yeah see Matt Matt's ready
he's ready to jump in with ants are a
good thing we got it gotta move beyond
him I you know I don't the trade dress
stuff I get it I get exactly why that
some of these software patents are
stupid you know Samsung has a patent on
one of the patents at issue in the case
playing at mp3 while you navigate menus
and other application that is the
dumbest patent in the world I mean in
terms of what you should be allowed to
issue software patent on that is it Matt
I know you and I argue about what is a
software patent and it really
incorporates hardware all the time but
that functionality saying that is
covered by a patent is is stupid just
flat out stupid and you know I think a
lot of apples scrolling patents are
pretty dumb right i mean you have a
small device you're using your finger to
scroll there's only so many ways to
solve the problem how to make a good
experience of doing it so that stuff to
me is way down the weeds being stupid I
think apples I mean again I think that
the trade dress stuff and that we built
a brand and your free riding on it I
think that's really interesting to me I
think that's what we're going to see out
of this case and you know one thing I
was talking to Phillip burn on Twitter
who used to info saying he used to be at
SlashGear and now he actually works for
samsung as a product tester and I was
like you know what I miss is there was
an entire period of wild Samsung
hardware form factor innovation just
bonkers like will make it flip open
it'll be a triangle little slide the
screen will be in two different pieces
and that is all gone because people are
like we have to build an iphone and I
would love to go back to that I would
love to see these companies to wild form
factor innovation and really make great
products that are tangibly different
they don't have anything to do with
looking like an iPhone and if we get
there I'll be very happy I'm going to
right now you put they do it of eight
they just like you said to do a war on
corners or you know some little tweak to
think just to get him around yeah the
iphone i er but i don't think in the end
it's it's really all that innovative so
he just got to be room for that i would
think what's up Sam okay let's wrap up
this this week sometime next week Brian
there's a trial and when there's trolley
and Wednesday yeah it's all weekend so
ends it at seven-thirty
7 30 is when I could officially ends
eastern time eastern time so maybe we'll
do one late on Wednesday next week we'll
figure it out but we'll be doing this
every week the trials on for the month
let us know if there's something you
want to talk about if there's a specific
question you have you can leave it in
the comments will definitely try to
answer I mean I really want to give
people I know there's a lot of questions
out there and I want to answer them for
everybody so let us know there something
you want to talk about or an issue you
want us to get into and we'll do it
gentlemen thank you very much this has
been a virg cast special edition do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
