and what i have in front of me is the
acs
Zen watch 3 this 4 issues is a novelty
because it's a circular Android wear
watch whereas the previous M watches had
more of a rectangular shape and also is
a novelty for all of us because it has
three buttons on the sides the first
Android wear watch at least and am aware
of that has three puzzles inside you
have the usual one and then you have a
couple of programmable ones which are
used to essentially a shortcuts to your
favorite apps on the watch besides that
it's pretty much standard Android wear
and whether a true sports the
distinguish itself is again with design
everybody kind of tries to do it with
design so that means stainless steel it
means Italian leather the more expensive
option is with Italian leather and
there's also the silicone strap and it
means some quite I was like polarizing
color schemes there's this I think the
opponent rose gold option which is quite
copper in color there's also a dark from
metal and I believe a white version so
you get free options for the same watch
free which also has free buttons so a
lot of praise with this so speaking of
freeze the exceeds in watch free also
comes with free accessories so you have
a wireless charger you have what stand
and you also have a little battery pack
which actually attaches to the bottom of
the watch and extensive battery by
another 40 percent but besides that you
really just look and another Android
wear Ward's which kinda has the same
problem is the Apple watch insofar as
smartwatches have already proven their
utility and their versatility in the
same weather let's say smartphones them
but any case you find is attractive and
you're intrigued by it it's going to be
available from October in Germany in the
United States the price here in Europe
is going to be 229 euros with a silicone
strap or 249 euros with the leather
strap</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
