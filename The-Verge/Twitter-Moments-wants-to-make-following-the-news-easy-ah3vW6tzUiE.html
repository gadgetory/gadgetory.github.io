been that it's too hard to use average
people would pick up the app and they
wouldn't know who to follow or what a
favorite was or what a retweet was and
this year that actually became a big
problem
Twitter's user growth plateaued the
stock price plummeted and Twitter had to
figure out what its next step was and
what they decided to do was to try to
build a version of Twitter inside the
main app that would be easy enough for
anyone to use they're calling it moments
and it rolls out today so this is
moments it's a new tab inside the
Twitter app tap it and you see a list of
the day's top stories they've been put
together by a team of Twitter engineers
in New York
along with media partners that Twitter
worked with like Entertainment Weekly
vogue Major League Baseball and moments
is comprised of moments
what's a moment well it's basically just
a collection of tweets and when you tap
on one it opens up and you'll see eight
nine ten twelve fifteen tweets that are
a wide mix of things they can be text
only but most of the tweets you're gonna
see in here are visual you'll see photos
you'll see videos uploaded a Twitter
you'll see vines and Twitter's try to
build these moments so that they all
feel like they have a beginning middle
and an end you swipe through them with
your thumb and you see a kind of
thumbnail sketch of that story if
there's anything you want to know more
about you can just tap on the the image
or tap on the text and you have options
you can favorite it you can retweet it
or tap this little ellipses button and
you can perform a whole host of other
actions like if you see a really great
tweet you can follow the person who
tweeted it or you can share it with a
friend by sending it as a direct message
so Moments has multiple sections it
might remind you of a newspaper it opens
up in a section called today which is a
basic mix of the day's top stories
there's also a news tab for kind of
straight hard news but then you'll also
find sports entertainment and a category
called fun that includes all sorts of
weird things like here's the world beard
and mustache champion
chips and the idea is that you'll be
able to see all of these things even if
you've never followed a single person on
Twitter even if you have no idea what
Twitter really is they're also building
it so that it will highlight interesting
conversations on Twitter so if two
celebrities start going back and forth
you'll see everything they had to say
you'll see one more interesting thing in
moments and that's a follow button
sometimes when there's a big event going
on like the Super Bowl or the Oscars you
can see a follow button next to it
inside moments and if you tap it it'll
actually bring tweets from that event
into your home timeline so if you're
browsing Twitter during that event
you'll see all the best tweets from the
Oscars from the Super Bowl showing up
alongside the tweets of those people who
you do already follow so if you're a
power user of Twitter this is the part
of moments that you'll probably find the
most interesting the idea is that all
those great like jokes and pieces of
commentary that you were missing before
because you didn't know where to look
Twitter's finding them using signals
like favorites and retweets and just
showing them to you because it knows
that you're interested in the event and
when the events over those accounts that
you were seeing in your timeline they
just all disappear and you get back to
your home time line so will moments
bring a billion people to Twitter it's
hard to say if you're a power user of
Twitter moments literally was not built
for you the real question is how you'll
feel about it if you've never used
twitter before and now that it's
available we're about to find out the
answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
