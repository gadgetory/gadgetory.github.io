we're taking a look at the Kindle
paperwhite the device itself is not
really that notable it's a small black
rectangle with rounded corners it feels
really good in your hand actually it's a
little bit thinner than the previous
Kindle Touch and the display is a bit
less sunken down in the plastic housing
which is good because it's a touchscreen
display it's kind of reminiscent of
holding a book in your hands it's the
right size the right weight and it feels
really good when you're holding it there
are a couple of small drawbacks to the
hardware the previous Kindle Touch had
four gigs of storage this only has two
gigs and the previous version had a
headphone jack this has no headphone
jack and no audio output so there's no
text-to-speech or anything like that
what it lacks an audio it makes up for
with its display though the device uses
Amazon's new paperwhite technology and
you can adjust it using on-screen
controls it can get very bright and get
very dim the screen of course can be
used in direct sunlight or under regular
household lighting and this display is
actually higher resolution than other
Kindle models as I said touch responses
is really quite good on this display and
the ink refresh rate is the fastest that
I've ever seen on an inked device
turning pages on books happens almost
instantaneously and navigating around
the device using the latest version of
the Kindle software is pretty snappy the
software itself is a lot more like a
tablet OS than the previous Kindles it
has a home screen which is somewhat
reminiscent of the fire and Fire HD home
screen it shows the last book that you
were reading and the items that you have
stored in the device that you can swipe
through you can also flip it over to the
cloud and grab stuff from the cloud that
you've not downloaded yet and it gives
you recommendations down below your
content you know for things that you
might want to purchase because Amazon
loves it when you purchase things the
software definitely has capabilities
that older Kindles don't for instance
you're able to read comic books on this
device you can even zoom in on the
panels and flip their panels the way you
can on the
Fire HD and other fire models like other
Kindle products this is an ad-supported
device though you're able to opt out of
the ads for an additional $20 the
battery life on this device versus older
models was excellent in fact amazon says
it gets about the same battery life as a
standard Kindle and in my testing that
was definitely true the device doesn't
come with a charger it does come with a
micro USB cable and you can plug it into
your computer to charge it the device
retails for $119 with ads and 139
dollars without ads for the non 3G
version the 3G version comes in at 179
dollars which is pretty pricey for an
e-reader and then of course another $20
if you want to opt out of ads and some
more money if you want a charger for
your wall in all the Kindle paperwhite
is a terrific ereader the software is
fast and intuitive the display is crisp
and the battery life is outstanding
Amazon's taken an already good product
and made it a great product and I
strongly recommend this device for
people who really love reading</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
