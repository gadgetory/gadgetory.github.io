people go to talk you can hear what they
think you can go to network what it also
turns out that they run what's basically
a tiny comic-con where everybody just
goes to game this is the South by
Southwest gaming expo ok so it's not
just gaming it's comics and computers
and all kinds of companies you'd expect
to find at comic-con or pax there are
lots of brands here but they're not
activated they're engaging unlike most
of South by Southwest you can get in for
free and it's a weekend which means it's
also almost exactly as crowded as packs
or Comic Con it's kind of like creating
a mosh pit people get to try out demos
like this which is a game played with
Toby eye-tracking tech well I'm using my
eyes to even throw rocks there's also a
line for I cracked asteroids and I
tracked Assassin's Creed so like I
picked that up and I'm not shoot it up
there
I picked this up I'm not moving my hands
at all and I'm gonna shoot it up into
the right one of the most striking
things is that unlike almost every other
event I go to there are a ton of kids
here and they're all wearing oculus
rifts it's adorable
so I'm gonna try to head to the street
fighter tournament which is like a sea
of sanity and personal space
so every single convention there's
something that takes like the most
ridiculous hardware prize and the truck
that has the gaming consoles that pull
out of it and then you can play and then
you pop them back in and presumably like
stop on the side of the road and play is
definitely a it's really like a tiny
convention inside a convention but while
South by Southwest is gonna go on for
another week this only last three days
it's actually really cool to see
something that's free and open to the
public so they can see the stuff that
sometimes just ends up getting showing
it I need conventions but I'm also
realizing that no matter how much fun it
is to watch kids learn I'm going to use
the oculus rift I'm so much too old to
actually do this I'm gonna go back and
interact with some brands</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
