we're checking out the new instagram app
for android which is available today so
we've got it side by side with running
on an iphone 4s and a droid razr and if
you've used the iOS version before it's
pretty much exactly the same and if
you've used it before you can use your
exact same account on an Android device
it's currently only only available for
phone camera phones running 2.2 or later
so anyone using a tablet isn't going to
be able to run Instagram but it's
essentially pretty much the same UI so
popular is here because it's a slightly
larger screen you they can actually fit
more photos onto it scrolling tends to
be a little bit clunkier but it's the
same basic experience you know titles
are a little bit different and and you
can see that the way that android
highlights used to these different tabs
is a little bit different from the iOS
but it's largely the same thing one of
the nice things about Android though is
that if you click through to your
profile it takes you directly to your
profile page whereas in iOS it brings
you to this really kind of confusing
menu that isn't really super clear and
so on Android you can jump directly in
and search right from here whereas on
iOS you have to jump in and there's the
kind of vague fine friends and search
Instagram and if you want to actually
jump to your profile page you have to
click through yet again we took a pretty
much the same photo on both phones the
filters are almost exactly the same on
boast of both devices the big thing that
you won't find on Android is the ability
to to any tilt-shift effects so while
you can do it over here the option just
isn't available you are able to add
borders and you're able to add any
filters and what we found is a little
bit slower than iOS actually is a lot
slower the filters tend to be pretty
quick over here but it takes a couple
seconds to apply on on this droid razr
but it's essentially the same effect and
once you've applied your filters the
sharing process is essentially the same
so it brings up details on both sides
you can geotag one of the things that
you will find that isn't in the android
app is the ability to share to flickr
which is a big one and post risk so
instagram for android is pretty much the
same app that we've seen on iOS and it's
available now for free on the google
play store</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
