love technology these are stuff so here
take a look at this and thanks again
Jimmy thank you so that brother don't
you everybody hi I'm Paul Miller with
the Burj I'm in a car right now and I'm
in upstate New York I'm about to check
out g e--'s research labs and I've been
tweeting back and forth with GE just
trying to get a vibe you know which
what's chi Ã¨ into you know what did GE
eat for breakfast and you know this I
think I have a lot to learn you know
I've got a lot of a lot of questions you
know I'm ready to find some answers so
we are the central technology
organization for june and in that role
we support every GE business from health
care energy aviation to transportation
it's great to make the center of all
that stuff going on in the world so this
is GES new wat station ecosystem so you
know you can show up here charge your
car and stuff but they also want to tie
into surrounding services you can maybe
reserve a rental car we actually went to
that not rigid purchase the pizza nobody
really knows what's going to happen or
how it's going to be used but by packing
all the smart technology in there
there's some really potentially emergent
applications that could come out of it
but mostly it's going to be for pizza
what are these what is closet or so this
is this is cancer right look at this I'm
like a professional already enhance
we've gotta put aside wireless patient
monitor literally still closets in the
dorms so I'm a GES trip optimizer which
is sort of like an autopilot portray
that's right thing the trip optimizer
does differently it anticipates where
this speed reduction is and backs off on
the slide also it only goes to idle how
do you do blue sparks blue sparks yeah
maricar you toggle the joystick back and
forth and you get the blue sparks and I
casio speed boost
with a laser we bring our components
together with square edges bring them
together use the high energy density of
the laser to penetrate straight through
that I was told like if you're making a
battleship you're saving hundreds
thousands of time you know I am actually
looking I haven't welded a battleship
yet I was probably that's what I'm
looking at doing and it turns out I
there'd be a lot of waste of metal on so
I'm just shopping around for the best
way to create a battleship this is a
Deadman switch that allows us to start
and stop the process and if if the laser
kills you wall it's welding I would like
all the Monaco and the province will
stop even though you'll be dead the lace
purple stuff which is everybody else and
great all right let's do it fire
oh it's battleship grade no well I think
about the world I think about our world
our shared planet shared existence the
resources the finite resources we have
think about energy and smart grids and
electric vehicles eventually I just
think about the great research they're
doing here in the middle of New York
State somewhere somewhere at the global
research center mr. Paul Miller signing
off I actually have no idea what they do
up here yeah I get the overwhelming
impression you didn't understand a lot
of stuff do that um I found cancer is
interesting that you've gathered a year
like that is</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
