you, I don't even remember
how I found it, all the
signs were like,
this should be a product
that will pan out,
but that really quickly changed.
- We treated Kickstarter as a tool to see
hey, we wanna get an
energized group of backers
who really wanna see this
new concept come to life.
Even so, the campaign
ended at the end of 2014
and it was mid-2018 that we finally
started fulfilling the
Kickstarter and the pre-orders.
- Hardware is notoriously hard
and fulfillment there is
particularly challenging, right.
There's just way more
complexity to the manufacturing
of a complex gadget and then
shipping it then there is
to publishing a book or
producing a board game.
- Creating a gadget cost a lot of money
so creators often turn to
crowdfunding to raise cash.
But even if they raise all the money
they could've ever wanted,
if they aren't fully ready
to make their product it
could end up being delayed
for months, years, or worst of all,
it might not ship at all.
Crowdfunding companies like
Kickstarter and Indiegogo
are aware of this
possibility and are changing
their business so that supporters
don't end up empty handed.
But the ultimate question
is who's responsible
when a product doesn't ship, the founders
who pitched their dream or
the crowdfunding platforms
that gave them the money-making tools.
This is In the Making. (upbeat music)
- We were grad students together
at the University of Illinois
in electrical engineering
and we wanted to do a
robot and I have four cats,
Dave had a cat and we
were really interested
in doing a product where you
could launch it right now.
- [Ashley] Mouser is an anonymous
cat toy that bounces back
when cats knock it over,
the team successfully funded
the product on Kickstarter in 2014.
- The terminology we kind of
use is Kickstarter classic.
So back when we launched the whole idea
was hey, here's this thing
that's never gonna exist
unless a bunch of people get behind it.
And you set this limit
that we've gotta get
to this much money or
we can't even build it.
- Okay, so let's pause for
a second and run through
how crowdfunding works,
there are a ton of platforms
but for the sake of this
video we're just gonna talk
about the two most-known in the U.S.,
Kickstarter and Indiegogo.
Kickstarter requires
campaigns to be completely new
and never seen before, creators
only get to keep their cash
if they reach their
goal, Indiegogo however,
lets creators come over from
other crowdfunding platforms
and sometimes they can keep their money
even if they haven't reached their goal.
- I think we originally said 18 months
and this was, actually I need to check,
but this was the strategy,
high goal, long timeline.
- We had really supportive
backers and it's kind of amazing
and I think there's two reasons for that.
One was our communication
style which we tried
to be very open and we didn't
give really constant updates.
That just seemed false
because we were looking
at big milestones and
giving this false sense
of positivity when there are unknowns.
- I think the saddest part
for us was the total span
of our project development
was 20, 25% of cat's lifespan
so when you have a thousand
backers, it's gonna happen
where cats pass away that
were hoping to play with this.
- Mousr took four years
to ship their product
which is a really long
time, but that's the risk
with Crowdfunding and
actually, these backers
are lucky they received
their product at all.
Sometimes campaigns raise their cash
and then disappear, like iBackPack.
- The very first complaint that people had
was he retroactively decided
to make a iBackPack 2.0
and and at that point I was
like is the 1.0 even done,
like what's even going on.
How do we even know that the
first product was even done,
are we all getting
upgraded, what's going on.
So it was just a lot of uncertainty
and he was going back and
forth with his stories a lot.
He also added some
upgrades for new backers
that he wasn't going to allow for people
that had already backed it,
was so there was an uproar
about that and it seemed
like every single time
there as a story that changed people
would call Doug out on it,
Doug of course is the founder.
And he would respond
with extremely derogatory
and rude comments, this is like his quote.
&quot;What is wrong with some of
you, have you not read the post,
there are 160 of them, we
kept everybody up to date
at every second of the way,&quot;
which he didn't by the way.
&quot;We are making the iBackPack
sensational in every way,
regardless of what the whiners
say, you know full well
that this project is a work in progress.
Nobody bought a bag or any product here,
you pledged to fund
this project regardless
of how long it takes, go ahead and read
the licensing agreement,
if you want to whine
and moan and groan, call me.&quot;
So now it seems like oh,
he's just hiding behind
the terms of service that Indiegogo has.
- These backers created a Facebook group
to try to figure out what
happened to their money
and to iBackPack, the founder
occasionally wrote them
with minimal and hostile updates
but eventually went silent
after blaming battery
issues for the delays.
The backers still don't have answers
but this past summer the FTC
began investigating iBackPack.
The government agency
only once previously fined
a crowdfunding campaign and at the time
it said it would only
prosecute if there seemed
to be outright frauds, so without the help
of a government agency, backers
have nowhere else to turn
but the crowdfunding platforms themselves.
And Hao thinks they
should take responsibility
in situations like iBackPack.
- I do feel like in a perfect world
they should be responsible and they should
protect their backers and
protect the users of the product
because they're taking
money for it, right.
That's basically the service
that they're providing.
They're saying okay, we're
allowing future merchants
to promote their product and
we're advertising it to people
on our website but for them to say,
okay, well if the product doesn't pan out,
it's not our problem, I
don't think that's right.
- Kickstarter and Indiegogo
have traditionally said
that investments come with risks,
but that pressure from
backers hasn't gone unnoticed
and it's even forced a fundamental change
in Indiegogo's business model.
- So what we're now doing
is for a subset of campaigns
on Indiegogo, we're actually guaranteeing
that that product will
ultimately be delivered.
Actually you were the
first person we talked to
about guaranteed shipping,
we're now calling that
guaranteed delivery, and so the backers
that back those projects
can back those projects
with the confidence that that
product will be delivered
or they will get their money back.
I think realistically
it's next to impossible
for a platform to be able
to fully protect the backers
on the platform, in large
part because it would
be impossible for any platform
to be able to fully evaluate
that entrepreneur's ability
to ship that product.
We've had entrepreneur's that have raised
over $10 million and we've had questions
on whether they can
actually ship $10 million
worth of product like the FlowHive
is good example of a product
we had a few years ago
which was a beehive and it was
very inexperienced entrepreneurs
frankly, from Australia
and sure enough they shipped
every FlowHive to every backer.
It's almost impossible or us to be able
to really know whether an
entrepreneur's gonna ship or not.
- Where to do you think
Kickstarter's responsibility lies
to backers, because
what I've seen a lot of
is the backers get angry at the platform,
they're angry at the
creator, they're just angry.
So how do you think
about Kickstarter's role
and responsibility in this?
- Yeah, Kickstarter's obligation
is we're gonna be stewards
I think of this system and we
can have the most influence
honestly at the outset of the campaign.
Before the transaction
takes place is much better
than winding up in a situation
than after the campaign.
So we put a lot of emphasis
on putting mechanisms in place
to make sure that the creator's
are being transparent.
We've verified their identity
that they are publicly visible
as individuals, not being able
to hide behind a pseudonym
or a corporate name or anything like that.
And having rules in place
and mechanisms in place
so that backers can really
vet the campaigns right.
We assist them where it's
really the backer's decision,
discretion to evaluate these campaigns
and understand the risks involved.
And our responsibility
there is to make sure
that backers, creating a fair
system that is transparent,
where backers do understand the risks.
- Both Kickstarter and Indiegogo have also
started partnering with
third parties like Avnet,
Dragon Innovation and Aero Electronics
to make sure creators have the support
they need to get through
the manufacturing process.
- What an entrepreneur
can really do to help
with manufacturing is
really think through exactly
what's needed in the bill of
materials for that product.
And to think through both how that product
is gonna be manufactured and
shipped before the entrepreneur
sets the price for that
product in their campaign.
- Manufacturing is just
hard, even if you do
some of that upfront homework,
factories go out of business
or they change, quotes
change, and so you can be
on top of a shifting
landscape, often you're getting
components that aren't up
to quality specifications.
And so you have to go
back and do it again.
Entrepreneurs tend to be optimistic people
'cause you have to be a little bit crazy
to be an entrepreneur and
delusionally optimistic.
And so it requires really thinking through
how each of those components,
each of those steps
could go wrong a little
bit to really understand
the challenges of the
space, but there's a lot
that can go wrong or there's challenges
that you'll have to overcome
that you can't foresee
at the beginning with hardware.
- After four years of
delays Mousr has shipped
to all its backers and is even working
on new products, they're
on Amazon and even
some physical retail stores
like Best Buy, overall,
they're a crowdfunding success story.
- You can't even fathom
how much energy and thought
and time and passion goes
into every detail, right.
The mouse itself, the software, the app,
everything, and then to have
somebody condense it down,
just be like, software sucks. (laughs)
I think you just have to
develop a way to handle that
'cause they're taking
years of your hard work
and condensing it to a really
short, really negative,
not well thought out commentary,
but if you can laugh
at that you'll be fine.
- We just really wanted to put something
that was ours, we weren't
a part of a big company
and we did this little
thing where every detail,
how it looked, its
personality, how it sounded,
the video we shot to promote it.
Everything was ours and for us
it was like a rock and roll album.
It was a piece of art
that we put together.
Not matter what happens
in the future we did that,
and if you kind of have that
attitude it helps sustain you.
- Crowdfunding really does
give independent creators
the power to launch their own companies.
And oftentimes, it wasn't their intention
not to ship, the crowdfunding platforms
are on the right track to take
some of that responsibility
but ultimately it's on
the creators to ensure
that their products end
up in backers hands.
So before pitching your dreams to backers,
make sure it's grounded in reality.
So who do you think is responsible
for products that don't ship?
