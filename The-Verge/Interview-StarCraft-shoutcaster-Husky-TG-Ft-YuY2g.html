with husky yeah man I'm HDS esq what's
going on and husky does lay down
interviews yeah and are a very intimate
never eaten it in your hotel room yeah
we would get in bed we hold hands
sometimes a lot of times yeah I would
say more than others good gentlemen
technique amen so I wanted to raise it
up a notch we're going to go to an
escalator can you explain your job what
what do you do basically I mean I do
shout casting for starcraft that's kind
of kind of my thing and my face just
announcing games on you yeah basically
Simon if you watch whatever sport you
watch there's almost always an announcer
I'm trying to imagine a sport without an
announcer and it sounds kind of boring I
don't know if there is one but it's
basically like if you were to watch a
basketball game are the example I like
is if you're really into American
football it just imagine it as if you're
watching the football game from the sky
and you can see what everyone was doing
the entire time I'm the guy who's
announcing kind of what's going on and
all of that it looks like one mule will
go down the little one trying to sell
bugger he will get it there is only one
marine over here unfortunately they are
attacking the evo chamber I don't think
a little what should be doing this
because they all these are going to be
inside the base especially once the evo
chamber goes down and deed it does those
SUVs have taken out both the mules and
now just going to be an SCV versus
circling battle here as these larvae
injected servings are just rampaging
through the little ones beso game one
looks like it's going to be an extremely
short game didn't even have time to talk
about both the players and look at that
the little one is going to GG so can you
explain in one line for each race what
the starcraft races are and what that
means yeah there's the okay i'm going to
try it with one line anyway there's a
protoss terran and zerg so there's three
races that you can play and anyone
familiar with RTS games at all you
basically build up bases and kill each
other so everyone does that but the
Protoss are kind of futuristic and other
units cost a lot of money and they're
all fancy aliens basically the Zerg are
more primal istic they're kind of like
bugs or if you ever seen starship
troopers they're the bugs they're
basically just like that and then the
Terran are basically they're the humans
but they they're kind of more they're
like if Texas was to go into space
I'll try to how the Terran so I'm pretty
rugged yeah they're kind of like the the
Marines from aliens okay second movie if
you ever seeing that that's what they
were mining also so you play protoss yes
I'm not too high rank so when you're
watching all the pro gamers and
everything they are David they put me to
shame man they make me go like a total
noob so I I just try and play protoss as
best i can been playing it since I was
11 years old so there there's no
switching now once once your protest you
never go back so not what do you like
about protons I kind of like how since
their units cost a lot each unit itself
is really powerful okay so you don't
have as much stuff but they are all
really really powerful so it's about
kind of like babysitting a few important
units rather than dessert for example
they have a bunch of stuff is running
everywhere and that just hurts my simple
brain so I like keeping my big ball of
units that are really good but very
costly and it was kind of like that in
starcraft one and i don't know i just
always been like that that place down
how is this tournament going at nana wha
won the invitation right ampionship
which would seem to forget it's actually
insane if you look at on paper basically
he beat the two players who had won the
gsl three times each and he plays
Protoss yeah he plays Protoss and so for
someone to play protoss and beat those
gsl champions it's the only two players
that he beat to win the gsl three times
which is actually pretty insane the gsl
is like the biggest most competitive
tournament out right it's held in korea
and for him to win not being a korean as
protoss it was like hardly anyone would
ever predict where that to happen so for
him he's been training he has a lot of
korean people that he trains with him
all that it is definitely paying off so
mad props to him I was really great it
just confirms what I always thought
about what I didn't what I couldn't be
sure of that I am able to beat the best
players so it's good for my mentality so
you cast games how do you make it that
is that you
I mean it's been what I've been doing
full time for about three years now and
for about half of that I wasn't making a
single penny like I wasn't doing any
events I wasn't even taking donations or
anything like that from fans and I've
always had super supportive parents so
anytime there's any trouble at all
they're just always like we'll just move
back in with us and you can keep doing
what you're doing and that was a huge
relief because when I was doing it in
college and all that it kind of affects
your grades when you don't go to class
is what I've learned so uh yeah so
thankfully they were actually extremely
supportive i think most parents would
have been like wait you're playing video
games instead of you know getting a's in
college what's happened to my son but no
it actually worked out they've been
super supportive and i'm just able to do
it full time I travel around a lot to
all the ML geez hey mr. bitter I
couldn't I couldn't help notice that
you're drinking last refreshing das over
there yeah did you know that under the
tab there's a code where you can redeem
the points to get exclusive MLG gear
really yeah you can get hats t-shirts
sweatshirts and more you just have to go
to drink nas calm and there's going to
be a lot more info there you know what
there's the code that looks that looks
so refreshing I I think I'm gonna buy
one oh thanks look it's already open
outstanding I am ready to be a better
gamer now all right so not my soul is
now the devil's uh we have actually a
pretty house call an emoji sponsor the
devil no no I'm cause I'm calling how
horrible of an actor and how shamelessly
i can plug something for hours four
hours man have you seen my xperia play
phone that's based good i do and then my
youtube channel is kind of my focus
where I have it's like 500 I don't know
exact company it's about six hundred
thousand followers and so those are
people who are tuning in to watch
starcraft they like it kind of as a
sport it basically is a sport and it's
kind of taking over bars everywhere
there's kind of bar crafts going on yeah
i attended a bar craft it was so much
fun awesome yeah so it's kind of like
the people the stories i love are like
when the when the hockey bros come in or
our rugby or something and they're going
to their bar to watch the games and
there's all these nerds watch the
starcraft and they're like what is this
so that's that's a really good sign and
that's really healthy for for starcraft
yeah so it's just basically all
starcraft full-time it's the best best
job ever I'm telling about you can make
anything interesting so if there's
there's something you like you should
pursue that and just find a way to make
it interesting and people watch look
thank you so much for your time thank
you very much as well MLG I will
absolutely thank you thank you husky
