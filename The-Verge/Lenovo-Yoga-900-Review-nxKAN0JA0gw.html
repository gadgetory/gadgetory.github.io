have they made the world's greatest
laptop not exactly but they have managed
to use this hinge as a way to try to
sell more Windows 10 devices this new
yoga 900 has a faster processor better
battery life even more keys on the
keyboard but do you really need all of
this flexibility with the yoga 900
lenovo has made all of the right updates
from last year's yoga 3 Pro it has a
faster processor a better keyboard and
improved battery life it's also running
on Windows 10 which is a markedly better
experience than Windows 8 but just keep
in mind the laptops ability to twist and
turn is still little more than an
occasional convenience the Lenovo yoga
900 13 inch laptop can be found for as
low as 1099 right now but creeps up to
$14.99 for a top-of-the-line model
that's not a cheap laptop but Lenovo
which is probably still best known for
its laptops for business has always
positioned the yoga at the highest end
of its consumer laptops with the
exception of the exposed metal hinge the
yoga 900 is primarily made of magnesium
alloy it achieves a premium feel it's
good-looking
it has a nice leathery palm rest nobody
will think look at that cheap plastic
laptop or look at that black box of a
ThinkPad lenovo has even gone so far as
stamping a yoga emblem on the top of it
rather than the usual Lenovo branding
its quad HD plus multi-touch display is
rich looking and colors look bright and
true to life
it weighs 2.8 pounds and is also super
thin measuring just over half an inch
thick this is actually slightly heavier
and thicker than last year's yoga 3 Pro
laptop but when you consider all the
stuff included in this one like Intel's
new skylake based core i7 a notable
upgrade from last year's Core M plus a
claim of two extra hours of battery life
it's forgivable all of the standard
ports are there with the addition of a
USB C port and the backlit keyboard now
has a top row of function keys while
it's always nice to have these extra
keys there is something a little bit
awkward about the keyboard layout now
the shift button feels small and cramped
and the Delete key feels just out of
reach it's also worth noting that the
first
laptop I tested had a bad trackpad but
the second unit is working just fine
so overall the new Lenovo yoga 900
checks off almost all the boxes for a
new laptop and improves upon last year's
yoga 3 Pro and the areas you might
expect should you consider buying it
that depends in part on how badly you
need or want a flexible laptop
it looks cool it's great for brand
recognition and the software
automatically recognizes when you're
switching between modes but in truth I
almost never needed the full convertible
capabilities of the yoga even when I was
on an airplane there's a large bezel at
the bottom of the display squeezing it
into a 16 by 9 aspect ratio so it's good
for stuff like Netflix but not your
everyday stuff getting any productive
work done in any mode other than
standard laptop mode is kind of a joke
in certain apps like Kindle just aren't
optimized for it so it looks weird
whether you're holding the tablet
horizontally or vertically given that so
many other PC makers are launching
convertible Windows 10 pcs this fall
including Microsoft's own surface book
which has a detachable keyboard Lenovo
yoga design feels a little less fresh
than it has in the past so let's put it
this way if you have $1,400 to burn on a
laptop you definitely won't be unhappy
with this newest yoga but you'll likely
love it for the basics and not for
bendiness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
