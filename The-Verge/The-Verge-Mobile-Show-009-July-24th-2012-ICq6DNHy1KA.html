carriers on the show but we don't really
talk about our thoughts and our feelings
about where we are in the universe and
where this tiny little orb is that's
hurtling through space this rough blue
little marble in a universe that's
rapidly expanding and heading towards a
cold uncaring oblivion where no one sees
us no one cares we're just dying and
gone we might talk about that of the
original so actually on a related topic
we're probably gonna talk about nokia
stay tuned for the Virgin Mobile show hi
I'm Peter bone Oh blood cell i'm david
pierce i'm chris ziegler actually I see
there it's really good to be here you
are makes you more mysterious to have a
different name underneath your your face
it done you nobody knows who I am it's
great this is a virgin mobile show it's
episode 9 for the week of july twenty
third and lads back and we are
incredibly happy to have him back and
he's wearing a shirt which is which is
great disappoint and he has that yeah
isn't that great all over in two weeks
ago yeah I am so I don't know if you
guys heard but my apartment flooded like
a month ago it's a sprinkler went off in
the bathroom and most my stuff was fine
but i did lose like my electric razor so
i bought a new one and i decided okay
I'm gonna shave this beard off and um my
girlfriend had you know complained about
the beard a little bit so she comes home
after I do this favor shave it off and
she's like wow you you look kind of
stupid you should grow that beard back
just I wasn't gonna take it I 3mon so
just cool it's okay we're saying this is
a virtue and all that stuff yeah you can
make for me it's just a case of not
shaving this morning yeah I like to
think that's like 45 minutes of Vlad
growing his hair yeah just this is the
black 15 minutes shadow I like it's a
blad shaved right before the mumble show
so he actually just constantly walks
around with the razor just all the time
just shaving Wow so in terms of news
this week it was pretty much all
financial results financial results
financial results um we we got from yeah
we've got it from verizon AT&amp;amp;T and like
they do they're making a ton of money I
think verizon the big news out of
verizon was that half they finally
reached the halfway point for
smartphones so hassard postpaid
subscribers are using smartphones they
added almost 900,000 new subscribers as
well and I don't even know what their
profit was with something ridiculous I
mean it always is yeah 15 and Asian
maybe he's almost feet ahead of that 18
he's a bit ahead of variety in terms of
smartphones grabbers is proportion of
the overall number i believe 480 is now
sixty one point nine percent so they're
few percentage points ahead which may be
0 into the iphone and the fact that AT&amp;amp;T
had so much more time to start selling
that to people before verizon maybe i
don't know a european I don't even know
was verizon yeah uh what's up what's
verizon's percentage oh yeah uh no I
just mean what is that is that a thing
yeah you're just jealous you coming up
my jokes I promise to have funny ones by
the end of podcast you're just jealous
because carriers don't control every
moment of your life all the time and you
wish that they did is really what it is
that is correct I think I do find myself
family I do find myself in existential
moments where I wish your mobile carrier
would just step in and take care of me
we get by taking my money right so the
thing about 18 tease results is they
they're bragging that there are poo
which we have talked about before the
average revenue per user is a still
getting larger it's the highest in the
industry they're making what like 60 50
65 bucks per customer which is and
that's per month I'm assuming that's
pretty high I don't know I it's we
complained a whole lot about eighteen t
last week with the the rumor that they
might be charging extra for facetime
access and
I mean I don't know their companies
they're making money they're making
plenty of money I I don't have any
sympathy with with profits like these
that you know they don't have the
resources to build out their networks
and and get the spectrum that they need
and I'm absolutely on board with you and
here's the thing that comes to my mind
one thing that I thought about today
when we addressed the 18th earrings it
was I believe for the quarter they had
3.9 billion dollars in profit net profit
native everything else and the thing you
have to consider with that is that 3.9
billion over three months is over a
billion a month I mean it's really
complicated mathematics but ok and
that's how much the company's making in
just pure unadulterated cash falling
down into their coffers like this isn't
reinvestment money and I don't even know
that it's necessarily dividend money I
don't know what AT&amp;amp;T is position is it
serves a student it's just cash so for
example if AT&amp;amp;T wants to reinvest if
AT&amp;amp;T wants to make investments into
infrastructure that stuff actually shows
up as an expense on a tts you no-account
sheets so when you see 3.9 billion in
net profit what you're saying isn't
money that is potentially go to be
reinvested it's the stuff that's ATT
investors well I don't know but
investors again that fence didn't but I
mean what it what how this profit
actually go it's actually good point
which I don't even know like you get
pure profit you don't do a dividend who
gets that money but the point is it
doesn't stay in the industry it doesn't
benefit or help anybody it just kind of
gets sucked out you know so that's the
money that comes out of your pocket it
doesn't come back in to rebuild the
industry or to build up 4g
infrastructure it just go someone we are
such communists I mean I am let me screw
it like how is it beneficial okay we
have this and and this is the thing that
people say about capital is it's a great
great season for extracting value
right but the point is okay we've
extracted 3.9 billion dollars worth
value and then it just kind of
disappeared the thing about profit is it
doesn't benefit anybody like if profit
in all circumstances was reinvestment
money that would be awesome terrific
like if every single quarter AT&amp;amp;T just
reinvested like nearly four billion
dollars into everything into systems and
then AT&amp;amp;T came back and said actually
guys we don't have money we need to
raise your prices I think people would
understand you know but at the moment I
mean as European like one of the big
scary things for me if I ever thought
about really came to the US was how
horribly I will be raped by American
carriers and the fact that I would even
have a choice about who's doing it to me
right it will be a teensy of horizon and
it probably just a teensy because
verizon cdma and that's horrible you
know yeah I need a phone that i can swap
sims in and out of well I think the
theory like the the counter-argument to
this seems to be that Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T
come out and say well we invested all
this money and infrastructure and you
know we built these networks and now
you're paying off all this money that we
already put in but at the same time I
can't imagine that you know if they're
taking in four billion dollars in profit
every quarter that that money you know
that they're constantly paying for this
infrastructure that they already paid
out for and eventually you know they've
paid it off and now it's just as you
said filling somebody's pockets and
going nowhere but then again lots of
companies have excess money apple has
whatever 100 billion dollars in cash and
we've all been for ya ya know well the
director sample doesn't doesn't least
spectrum from you know the people of the
United States disparity so I mean yeah
there's this is so good he know I was
gonna say there's a there used to be a
history when 18t had monopoly of the
company feeling like it had a public
duty and a public trust to serve you
know the phone lines and provide good
call quality and you know respective
their customers basically and now that
it's been broken up and you know we live
in the world we live in
in the US it seems like there's there's
less of that and so I mean it's you know
we can't begrudge a corporation to earn
profits that's what a corporation does
that's what it's for that's what their
charters say but nevertheless it's still
like just in terms of thinking about you
know the next time AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon comes
out and you know spins a poor me story
I'm just saying like I don't have any
sympathy for that no agreed and the
point you raised is exactly why I'm
having this mini rant and I promise to
have a full-size ramp late to run today
I homes and did the point where exactly
the important one which is there AT&amp;amp;T
and Verizon operating systems which are
fundamentally important to American
people and to the American economy like
if you don't have reliable 3g and now
soon 4g networks you're falling behind
you can't compete economically and a big
strength of the united states is the
fact that particularly with LTE and
particularly with myself being in the UK
and see how delayed that rollout is you
know you you're one of the leading
nations you in terms of rolling out ot
like Verizon AT&amp;amp;T of actually done that
really aggressively and really well so
credit to them for that but the fact is
they're still operating something that
is fundamental to the nation in the
country so in those circumstances you
kind of have to impute an extra level
responsibility on these companies
whereas Apple I mean what would the hell
if Apple stops making iPads and iPhones
you know i just might shock a lot of
people but the world isn't gonna end
right we American economic
competitiveness isn't gonna end because
there are no more iphones there are
replacement-level devices for iPhones
and iPads and all of these things but
there is no replacement level
alternative for verizon's 3g or 4g
network or AT&amp;amp;T which actually if i can
come come up with a very small little
digression to do with the olympics in
the UK they had a similar snafu if you
like where they privatize the security
around the Olympics and they hired out
private company
and they pick the one that of a lowest
bid the lowest cost like they do like
you do and then what ended up happening
is that now the government is having to
call in soldiers from the army to fill
in because the private company couldn't
provide a security personnel she's just
bring it um and my conclusion putting
the two things together is that when you
have something that's really fundamental
to a country you kind of have to think
long and hard about why you would ever
want to privatize it you know if it's so
important that the government can't let
it fail such as Olympic security and at
least in my opinion mobile networks then
maybe the government should be running
those things in the first place and then
maybe as teacher says guys are getting T
and Verizon kasuba do their private
operations by leasing that from the
government or from mistake do you treat
them like utility we've got you know
power companies yes honors where I mean
the those are all run by private
companies and most countries at least in
the US and they're just well regulated
and yeah yeah so I mean yeah does one
thing that's my thinking you kinda have
to regulate either regulate tightly oh
just run it run it by the government I
mean I could say that it was companies
to get here in the UK yes they run
private operations but they don't do
particularly well I don't really see the
whole point of privatization seriously I
just a hundred percent taxes and let's
go information cording to their ability
to each according to what Blatt feels
like I mean that's yeah I'd sign up for
that actually I've been on there yeah um
another earnings story came out nokia so
before we go no I have one more thing
that this is and this is just occurring
to me as I read over the earnings things
again um do you guys think that it seems
to me from reading these earnings
reports that 18t still has a huge iphone
advantage and that that's kind of
driving AT&amp;amp;T and I wonder like they you
know everybody sells the iphone now you
can buy the iphone on US cellular now
but it seems like you know 18t sold more
iphones than verizon did
and thus I think in a related note it's
smart phone numbers are higher it's like
a lot of the new people who come are
buying iphones more than are buying
android phones percentage-wise versus
verizon and it seems like you know
people still think of ATT as the carrier
where you buy an iphone then i would
make a good point though H&amp;amp;T don't
actually say how many iphones are sold
as usual with these financial reports
they're being tricky with their wording
so they say this sojourn quotes of 5.1
million smartphones so sales but they've
activated three-point-something million
iphones which means we don't really have
a direct comparison between a direct way
to say of AT&amp;amp;T smartphone sales they've
sold so many iphone because for example
you could you could have bought one in
Europe we could have bought one
elsewhere portable to AT&amp;amp;T network you
could be a replacement device that
you're talking about so we don't
necessarily know but I think your point
David is solid that I do feel similarly
that people think of ATT first when they
think about that's kind of taking a
while to finish the fruit I guess the
message that you can get it on every
single carrier well don't forget that
AT&amp;amp;T you know even though their LTE
network is is getting pretty widespread
they still are way behind verizon and so
verizon was pushing LTE phones more than
probably 18 t was so I mean on AT&amp;amp;T in
most places in the country the fastest
you know networking you get on worked
with the iphone with the verizon you
could get out a faster network if you've
got another device so i would expect
that once we see an LTE iphone that
those numbers will probably start to be
a little bit closer but i mean your
larger point that people think of ett is
an iphone network or think of the iphone
on AT&amp;amp;T i think is totally true and i
think that the fact that there are so
many older iphones out there that you
know are still perfectly good still
getting handed down to teenagers still
getting you know given to friends or
whatever when somebody upgrades is
another reason why a tts continues to
activate a ton of iphones okay
perfect segue you know what else is on
ATT the news on Android yay not very
many of them though flat are you using
that phone as your daily driver now I am
I am I honestly am this is Olivia 900
and I honestly am using it as my daily
driver and I am not actually suffering
for what it really it's it does a decent
job and you switched on someone else
right yeah I mean this is part of my
rent I don't really want to get into me
a little weight then um but so long as
you you imagine there are no apps in the
world if you just think there's this
software which is on the phone and
that's it and there's no other ecosystem
to tap into your fire I know some
problems so that means you don't think
dropbox exists you're fine it's so good
now I'm screwing around but honestly
like I use the media player I really
like the calendar the email client is
decent has issues but it's decent I mean
look it's fine it's a vulnerable phone I
think and okay i'll just say the big
reason why i actually switch to this and
also these review units by the way i'm
not spending my money on like a billion
poems I'll hand these review units back
eventually but yes I had a 1x and while
I was away in Bulgaria I used the galaxy
nexus two weeks with jelly bean which is
gorgeous I was so right when i was
logging into the galaxy nexus till the
best android phone like I'm convinced
now and chris is just completely nuts
and bonkers um but yeah so I use a
Galaxy Nexus and then it came back and I
switch to the 1x and just the on-screen
keyboard and some of the other escorted
media sync recedes of sense just pissed
me off to such a degree that I was like
screw this and I went to leave me a 900
which actually has a really really nice
on-screen keyboard like this again
windows phone they really have the basic
fundamentals in place and ready tell you
that the on-screen keyboard of the
camera app which jellybean actually kind
of tease a little
you know the whole swiping in from the
side to look at images you've already
taken yeah so the fundamentals me we've
said this before the fundamentals winner
phone are there an air in place so I
wouldn't necessarily well I wouldn't at
all say that I would use the Lumia 900
permanently but for a while it was a
change of pace I think it's pretty
pretty cool hey is that one of the best
design phones it's really swing so I am
a trading my personal galaxy nexus for
Olivia 900 what yeah what's happening
what's happening I don't understand oh
yeah yeah we have a review unit of
Galaxy Nexus around so if I need to use
a nexus I i still can but the bottom
line is the only windows phone that we
have on the west coast is my own
personal windows phone which is a
original samsung focus no detail
shipping you want and be patient please
faster man faster it's a it so i'm doing
i'm from i need need to have a modern
windows phone as modern as you can get
right now on so um i'm straight up i'm
doing it i'm excited this is gonna be I
feel like I've had this experience with
you like a dozen times now Jeter where
you're like I am switching it's gonna be
great and then eight minutes in your
like this is terrible i'm going back to
the Galaxy Nexus yeah well I've been on
the the galaxy s3 for about a week and
it's grown on me quite a bit although
i'm still out using s voice um and i
still wish that the multitasking key was
there instead of a long press but uh you
know chris is right he's like the ghost
looking over the entire podcast like
touch was is so much better than sense
it is so much better than sense um I guy
I think my one I just got a cyanogen mod
alpha on it right now and there's a
bunch of stuff that's broken on it and I
don't care like I'd rather use that than
sense at this point um okay I i I'd yeah
on that point though I need to show you
something and
I think it's available on my lumia 900
that might be good this has been a bit
unstable but okay people who are
listening to the audio of this podcast
are not going to really benefit from
this but take a look at this under video
it's a big button on this phone that
means one of the most disused pieces of
capacity key software I've ever seen
like I've never touched that I i think
if you dust this phone for fingerprints
the onespot you never find my
fingerprint is the big button it's just
useless like I don't even use search on
a google phone which is google search
which is better than being searched and
the very rare times when i use it
actually do search with a microphone so
i do voice search run android which
works decently well but that's the only
time i ever bought it to do if i want to
actually search something i open up a
browser window it's quicker for me aah i
didn't go to a really nice conversation
with i got a really long conversation
with our news manager out here brian
bishop talking about how underutilized
search is on phones just because it's I
don't know it it doesn't seem to be as
fast as and as convenient as it needs to
be on Android and iOS and even Windows
Phone like we stepped backwards from
where we were with blackberry and
windows mobile and webos where you had a
keyboard just there waiting for you to
start typing into it to search for stuff
and like hitting that extra button and
waiting for the UI to pop up the search
bar and then waiting for the keyboard to
appear and then start typing like that's
just enough wait time where I just I
don't want to bother I'd rather just you
know look for the icon or you know pop
up the browser window but datura see
it's the economics of it as well um if
you have an application and you know
where it is what in order to access it
what you do is you swipe to unlock the
phone you do a few swipes you might have
to open up a folder but it's just kind
of big motions and big sweeps that you
do we give thumb let's say whereas if
you want to search for something as you
say you have to bring up a search menu
too
game with and then he had start typing
away and big rough in precise wipes are
so much easier than actually typing
something specifically as a name this is
why i use voice search on Android as I
mentioned because again that could be
more impressing it can be something you
do actually on the move as opposed to
stopping and typing something in I mean
it's my book like okay we gotta we gotta
get into it like so Nokia's earnings
they they only sold 600,000 handsets in
the quarter lumia handsets in the North
America and I think overall they sold
for the quarter i want to say four
million yeah i was four million yeah
four million and then seven million to
date and then their their quote was that
it was gloomy activations were flat up
after the windows phone 8 announcement
which i mean basically my sense is that
the windows phone 8 announcement and all
the convention that we did about oh it's
going to destroy Lumia sales is it going
to hurt Lumia sales it's like it maybe
it did but they were already you know so
borderline and low to begin with that
like you know even a hit from that
wasn't a huge blip on their their sales
radar like they they are already out of
selling it to people that we're in the
know is my concern or my fear at least
in the US yeah I think that's a fair
point I mean look to me it's encouraging
insofar as nokia still seeing growth in
terms of Lumia sales um and I do also
like to take the contrarian view with
respect to nokia which couple years ago
was we have so much market share how
could things ever turn bad and Chris and
myself and Thomas recovery in Europe was
saying dudes you need to figure out
touch screens are you gonna you know
crash and so now I'm actually taking the
opposite position nokia has been
persistent in saying we have the cash
yes we're losing money but have cash
cover it so i guess that's where those
profits go they go into coffers and
people actually save them it's kind of
unusual for the Western world and but
yeah okay so nokia has the cash it says
you can do this periods this
transitional period yes it's stretching
out to be you know months and months and
now over a year i guess but there is
some sunshine on the horizon with
Windows Phone 8 and with whatever is
going to come later in the year I I mean
my perspective is yes the numbers
themselves are rough and Nokia lost what
was it like a billion dollars during the
quarter or something other yeah yeah i
mean that's rough i I get it but then
and nokia still has reserves it can
still kind of weather the storm and then
come back so if we get something with
the sort of iconic design that we saw
from nokia n9 which got continued in
figs like the Lumia 900 nokia still has
a chance like as far as I'm concerned
the latter part of this year is just
going to be the crunch time for nokia um
and I think the what's what's really
interesting to me about Windows Phone 8
is less the software changes which are
fine but that finally Windows Phone 8
will have real you know top-of-the-line
specs attached to its handsets and it
makes me think like Nokia I think did
the absolute best it could have within
the constraints of Windows Phone and it
made a gorgeous phone it has you know it
has its issues it's not a fantastic
processor it has you know the obvious
ecosystem issues but with Windows Phone
8 the Lumia 900 won't it might get a
little better but what could be much
much better is the next Lumia phone and
I think that is I mean if I were nokia
I'd be furious right now because like as
soon as you launch this flagship phone
they say oh we have potential for much
better phones running this better
operating system so I think it's for
right now they just need to stall as
long as they can until they get a real
shot to launch the best phone they can
possibly launch which will be you know
720p and multi-core and NFC and all this
stuff and then say here's a phone that
we think can actually compete on the
broader market well that was supposed to
be the Lumia 900 I mean
that's that's the thing I mean we talked
about the Lumia sales are doing well
well Lumia sales is a you know the
distinction that they made for their
windows phone products and of course are
going to grow because they started at
nothing when they first started selling
these you know earlier so I mean I don't
the thing that's interesting to me that
you brought up David is nokia hasn't
competed directly against iphone and
android sort of on the same spec war and
there's always been this sense like we
know that there's another version of
Windows Phone Cummings can be better we
know that their hands are tied in terms
of specs I can't remember how long it's
been since nokia was like straight-up
head-to-head going against other
flagships you know with no caveats in
the market I mean like in 95 I mean how
far back do we need to go that's so like
that'll be really interesting and I
think the most interesting thing is at
least as far as the u.s. goes windows
phone 8 is going to see probably verizon
putting some serious marketing muscle
behind it and we're going to see these
these carriers you know once again
starting up the game of playing the
different OS providers against each
other and they're going to be throwing
Windows Phone into that ring and you
know we saw 18t do it a little bit but I
think with Windows Phone 8 we're going
to see it a lot we're going to see not
just nokia but you know other
manufacturers that are you know still
playing in the Windows Phone game really
get a big push from US carriers and I
think it's going to be really
interesting to see if at that point with
modern hardware with competitive specs
and with competitive marketing help from
the carriers if it can compete like if
all that happens if they get all of that
and it still doesn't take off in some
small way that's a big problem like
there's only so long that Microsoft can
can stick around and keep trying with
this stuff and they really need a win
with Windows Phone 8 oh absolutely i'm
to your point about when knockos lost
competing if you speak with the fanboys
Nokia's never stop and it's just that
the world has kind of gone weird and
stop by okay device which is a totally
awesome blog I think
even the most strident symbian fanboy
would have to admit that now those idea
you don't know get a man's phone is sort
of knowing that you're you're buying
into a different ecosystem relative to
what else is out there like it's a
smaller ecosystem in terms of apps and
yeah it's in terms of apps in terms of
support from developers and like it
could you could still say it's competing
on a one-to-one ratio but there's
there's that little caveat that like
sure yeah you know the peer review is
competing on 121 but really it's not
really your sort of you understand that
you're getting into a different kind of
ecosystem with that and and I feel like
Nokia hasn't as always had that little
caveat you know for the past few years
in our way of course and and also to did
you say didn't okay so 600,000 a muse in
the US it was that the number they look
at in the UN water yeah yeah quarter
yeah I don't America it wasn't it wasn't
just the u.s. it was North America so
can opener but I believe that's roughly
the same as the previous course of the
quarter before that I was by half a
million units the luckiest owed in the
US so it does seem again North America
sorry it does seem like no kids
penetration of that market which again
has been a critical one it's the one
that project Thunder was about and the
Stephen Elop empathy empathy emphasized
you know growing in the u.s. and North
America in general it hasn't happened so
that again that's that's a problem today
but the reason why I do speaks excited
I'm excited but choosy look at nokia's
chances positively is precisely the
thing that David social it's the fact
that you kind of finally drop the chains
of Windows Phone 7 like I like the fact
we're on this phone 7 I the fact that
you get a unified user experience across
all devices it's good thing but and the
bad thing is that the very latest
devices are stuck with limitations that
were present with the very first devices
so as we've discussed nokia not
upgrading the Lumia 920's phone 8 is
rough right well no other windows phone
7 device
is getting windows phone 8 is rough for
everybody who's bought one and who maybe
was an early adopter and wanted to show
faith in microsoft cetera et cetera one
at the same time you got the Apple
fridge is getting iOS 6 and all these
things that you know you kind of want to
try and ignore if you want to be happy
with your life in it smartphone but
aside from all of those things um while
i was in Bulgaria as i said i've been
using the galaxy nexus and i recall i
tweeted about three weeks ago the
perfect smartphone today is the galaxy
nexus with the Nokia 808 PureView as the
camera because as we know the Nexus
camera sucks so while oh sweet Bulgaria
for a couple weeks I tried that
experimented and to poke with me right
and I try to live that lifestyle the
first thing to say is it has a really
work you can't really have two phones
you gotta need to use one phone and then
just kind of accept the camera set up
for the camera or pick a phone with a
really great camera and instead of for
the software which aaron from our
european team is inclined to do with the
808 PureView i would argue very much
against it because uh yeah yeah i mean
this is what whole bunch of reasons but
one really great example if i was
answered is when i was on a bulgarian
seaside and we'll me my friend was
struggling to get any sort of web
connection we didn't have sim cards I
mean it's a massive thing to even like
procureur sim card never what a micro
sim like a micro sim is a mystery to
those guys and put okay will you have a
sim card will finally found a Wi-Fi spot
and I left my galaxy nexus in the hotel
room went out with the aid away p of you
because i thought i would want to take
pictures we got Wi-Fi I got into Wi-Fi
with the 80 IP of you ma that's the
other thing my friend had Olivia 900
with it he was fine right he could skype
with people he could twist good um but I
had the 808 and I was like what can I do
now can i upload pictures but i don't
have dropbox and here the only option
bri that I had was like emailing
pictures to myself which kind of sucks
the preloaded
official Twitter client with it which
everybody has said is bad but he really
shouldn't be bad it has this peculiarity
where if you don't have a sim card in
the phone you can't turn the application
on you can't use the app to talk without
sim card which is equal parts stupid and
absurd and this wasn't no skype client
so I couldn't get in touch with anybody
so I was literally at a cafe with Wi-Fi
out in this phone and wondering what in
the hell can I actually do with this
connection and this phone and it was
basically nothing like that there's
nothing it's like you could take
pictures with it or you can make phone
calls with and that's where I went but
the reason I can be kind of optimistic
about nokia is because i thought well if
i could still have this camera and I
could take my friends leave me a 900
functionality essentially take Windows
Phone and slap it on to the camera of
the 808 PG I might actually be okay with
the fact the Galaxy Nexus was in my
hotel room or if it was no one any you
know and then I might even say that's a
phone that's worth swapping against
alexis ford eater but not a losing 100
yeah what you should do is you should
just you know by some duct tape or like
a little hinge and make yourself uh a
fold-out flip phone with the purity on
the back and the Lumia 900 on the front
just just crammed together it's gonna be
easy to just get a DSLR and stick a
freaking tiny smartphone on to it
honestly but this is my point like your
trading guy successfully 100 I'm saying
no don't do it Aaron wants to trade um
what is he using at the moment I think
he's got a galaxy s 248 away p of you or
maybe use the 808 PureView the second
phone in either case no but if you
combined to you take the pair of you
stay bulimia any I just stick Windows
Phone 8 on top of all of that that's a
competitive phone you know particularly
like nothing can sush the 808 PureView
on camera performance like my family had
pointed shoot cameras with them I was
taking the best photos with the pew I
just left every other camera at home
it's a great camera and and nokia has
exactly what you need to push windows
phone 8 forward it has
ability to design great things and when
you have the specs and when you have the
software together it can do it and I do
feel like they can survive until let's
say October time and do it come on four
year of nokia for europe well but then
we're back to the point that you made a
little while ago about how like if apps
weren't a thing windows phone would be
fantastic but apps are thing as I have
this conversation somebody while ago
saying like if it were two thousand
seven windows phone is the best
operating system and it's not even close
and I really believe that but then it
you know everybody else came out with
app stores but that's why I think
windows 8 could potentially be huge for
windows phone 8 because now you can
develop the apps together and you know
even in like that they're launching
Windows Phone 8 after windows 8 and that
could be huge because then you've got a
month for people to start really
developing apps for Windows 8 that can
start migrating their way to Windows
Phone 8 and I think that's the real
chance that they have it's just a quick
correction Aaron just even me to say
it's not true he's not swapping any
phone for the excess faithless users
second phone so Aaron is saner than
dieter at the moment we're just saying
something if you I've ever seen the
guy's haircut yeah Aaron's crazy we can
just say that um okay so well while we
have been podcasting apples earnings
have come out and 8.8 billion profit on
35 billion revenue 17 million iPads
which is a big increase sales of iphones
dropped to 26 million compared to 35
million the previous quarter but you
know they always drop this quarter
basically it I mean it looks like I mean
the calls going on right now and so you
know we'll have more color as as the day
goes on but it looks like you know it
was a small miss but it's a small miss
relative to what analysts you know have
been expecting and so I know it's still
huge like they've got 117 billion
dollars in cash on hand they're doing
fine it just seems like finally finally
after so
many years everybody sort of figured out
that Apple post big numbers and are
starting to expect big numbers from
Apple well instead of yeah yeah they're
finally getting used to this game that
Apple plays where they way underestimate
what their next quarter is going to be
and so then it always looks great
because they you know out do all of
their own expectations so analysts are
like well they're clearly lying so we're
just gonna weigh over shoot that and
then that'll maybe be the answer yeah
yeah what I'm gonna say dieter is kind
of understanding it when you say people
are getting used to I proposing big
numbers either on big numbers these are
just you know industry crushing numbers
take humongous I mean this is why that's
the other thing analysts if you if
you've ever read analyst reports and
estimates they aren't afraid to be
aggressive like some of them make their
name on the basis of the fact that they
go way overboard with things and way
overestimate things like Google stock
price and all of that stuff just because
you know they want to stand out so they
go really aggressive and then maybe they
get lucky and Kings actually pan out so
even when you take the really aggressive
guys and their estimates are beaten
Apple was just the as Davis says I mean
yes Apple underestimates things to do
the classic thing of under promise over
the liver and now maybe analysts are
wising up but the scale of it is I mean
I don't think it's really comprehend oh
I mean let's let's let this into context
we just talked about nokia having enough
cash on hand to survive through this dip
and you know get itself re-established
in the smartphone game i think we're
looking at 5.15 billion cash on hand and
US dollars that nokia has or let their
liquid assets that's less than what
Apple added to their cash on hand this
past quarter 117 billion is where
they're at now so like you know the
amount that Nokia was able to add or
lost from its cash on hand was like
literally a rounding error when you put
it on the scale of what Apple's been
doing that made me really sad actually
I mean and Athens revenue is bigger than
Microsoft and Google combined which is
just wild yeah I mean uh you know really
amazed me is that uh ipod sales are only
down ten percent over last year like who
is still buying ipods if you don't
already own an ipod why are you buying
an ipod it just doesn't make any sense
to me i do feel like it's that is ipod
touch yeah I mean it's saying it
accounts for more than half of their
ipod sales but like just buy an iphone
or I mean is it kids that's my only
theory is that yeah kids are still
getting me touches writing the London on
the ground today that was my impression
I saw a couple of ipod touches and it
was kids playing games so maybe it's you
know Steve Jobs was absolutely spot on
what he said it's a great gaming machine
and it's been at the time he was saying
it to cover the fact you didn't have a
front facing camera but yeah and it's
the cheap gateway drug to all of apple's
other bigger more expensive devices too
yeah yeah good man I mean Apple can
actually like retire right now not
release another product not ship another
product for how many decades whatever is
keep the exact same level of staffing
exact same level expenses and yeah we
never can like take a decade of it and
still be one of the Mafia's companies in
tech yeah I mean they're they're content
stores the app store in the itunes store
was 4.1 billion in revenue like nobody's
operating at this scale nobody else is
even close to operating at this scale i
and and like every quarter I promise
that I'm not gonna sit here in boggle at
how much how big apple is and how much
money they're they're breaking in but
even with this you know relatively
disappointing quarter it's still like
the thing that I just can't get away
from is just the scale relative to what
anybody else is doing its it's like one
or two orders of magnitude bigger even
even in a down corner it doesn't matter
because the scale is home
bigger it's like whatever no I agree but
let's let's think about the positives
though I mean I I do feel like the Nexus
7 is gonna be really really significant
device for Google and it's a space with
the kindle fire where we also expect to
have a new kindle fire sometime or
anything too soon we're in terms of the
price range anyway it's just a place
where Apple isn't competing right now in
those affordable tablets google has a
strong enough app and contest or Amazon
is a strong enough having contests or so
at least even-even while Apple is
generating one of this profit and
revenue at least that do you see good
you know a good opportunity and good
potential for competition so I'm not
really as worried as you might have been
looking at intel's dominance of chips
let's say a few years back say a decade
ago or whatever um it's always good to
have competition so it's kind of like
okay apples making a little bunny but at
least Google's making moves I do like
Microsoft's aggressiveness you know with
a surface tablet and wood windows 8 and
all of that stuff we'll see how it all
pans out but at least this competition
going on and we we don't really it
doesn't really seem to me like we're
gonna end up in the situation where we
just have you know an incumbent who
isn't forced to keep innovating you know
like for example the iphone let's call
it the iphone 5 the next-generation
iphone it can't really afford to be just
an iphone 4 T right like right ever fall
in the oven for s way too similar but
you can't afford to have another one
that is just the same you do need to
upgrade there are other guys pushing you
and guys who will take your position if
you just kind of sit in the same spot
and he's a hope so that is how we're not
just buying things because their iPhones
right anyone we are yeah we go I mean
look I mean when someone asks when
someone asks you on the street here what
phone should i buy and you don't know
them from p
what do you say ma'am just get an iphone
I mean that's that's just how it's gonna
be for a while but that really took yer
I really took your your attempt at being
hopeful and just shut it down no I kind
of disagree I think I i still recommend
iphones to people but i think if if they
if I mean and is there's no way this is
going to happen I really can't imagine
this happening but if Apple comes out
with another iphone that doesn't have
LTE well I'll stop recommending iPhones
to people and like that's you know it's
an obvious thing that they have to
upgrade but that's that's to your point
Vlad that like people have come out you
know Apple claimed it was a battery
thing and then motorola comes out with
the razr maxx which both has LTE and
lasts forever and so like that's not an
issue anymore and they need to Apple
needs to figure out a way to compete
with these things and especially as
Android gets better and the skins get
better like Motorola's Ice Cream
Sandwich skin is great and the Smart
Actions is really cool and I'm a huge
fan so and now Apple has these real
things that it's lacking in and I like
the razr maxx last longer than the
current iphone even though it has LTE
and it's faster and the Smart Actions is
cool and it has NFC and all this stuff
and like Apple legitimately has some
catching up that it needs to do
especially in these particular features
which i think is great how so totally I
agree and the other thing is I I have
been noticing the fact that the gap has
been narrowing like we kind of you know
being involved in the industry all the
time we kind of missed these things and
the way things change but I I think back
to when the iphone 3gs was the latest
iPhone just before the iphone 4 came out
um so what was that two thousand nine
ish yeah yannick that's right whatever I
mean maybe 2 2 2010 um when the iphone
3gs was the latest iPhone it was so far
ahead of any Android phone it wasn't
even close by the smoothness of the
interface was untouchable by god that's
bedtime reviewing a playing around with
android phones for months and then i
picked up a 3gs start scrolling around
it i was like dude I've been wasting my
time
like this thing is so far ahead of
everything else why are we even
bothering like 3gs at the time was just
a massive chunk ahead of everything else
it was just way too easy to say best
smartphone Ivan free Jess you're done
clear finished whereas now we can have
arguments and they can be legitimate
arguments as opposed to like drunk nilay
patel rants well it's like no god dammit
for the sake of such as such it used to
be this and that again that gives me
hope that will continue to have a
competitive environment in Mobile which
is what we need ultimately and and you
know part of that part of what we need
is still knock it like whatever happens
I do feel like we need some European
design Flair so we don't end up with a
whole bunch of products called Max and
capitalized like the razor and missing
vows or inter cap like the iPhone mean
seriously iphone ipad all of these names
they're ridiculous Ice Cream Sandwich
honestly like if you're gonna name a
product don't have Japanese people named
it cuz you'll be a sequence of
alphanumeric nonsense and I have
America's name it cuz then it'll be just
straight nonsense like I don't know who
ed maybe French people right French ping
sound classy you don't understand what i
mean but it just sound classy right
that's true yes i like a live phone from
live oh yeah that was a chinese company
coming up with that name for you know
what see uh do we want to talk about
Beats Audio now beats audio bought a
controlling interest back in their
company back from HTC CNN had reported
that HTC maybe wasn't doing everything
they needed to keep the relationship
going like not meeting their financial
something I mean I'm just I'm just
disappointed that HTC has had such a
rough time of it lately I was really
hoping that the one series that they
will come
ring back and instead you know they add
this I think what we have to call as a
boondoggle with with beats just a
distraction mmm like they're they're
just I it's really disappointing because
I really kind of want to root for them
but like they're not winning anywhere
right now yeah i mean look as far as I'm
concerned it's hcs vote because of sense
like Android the Android that Google
gives you has a rock-solid perfectly
usable on-screen keyboard and then you
screw that up yeah and you force me to
come back and fix it and people are
telling me who uses the stock keyboard
on sense get swiftkey gets the antigen
mod get such and such it's like mmm I
don't want to write I paid my money for
this device NHC screwed it up and now
you want me to work on removing the
screw up like that's the exact opposite
thing this is why we commend guys like
vizio right because sean hollister just
reviewed recently the vizio thin and
light laptop and I mean as a laptop it's
not great but one of the great things
about it is that it's just straight
windows with no bloatware right yep yeah
and thumbs up keep doing that you know
we everybody appreciates those things
and I'm sure Vizio gonna be able to so
at least on these laptops just on the
strength of the fact that there's no
bloatware there's no noise it just
windows and you can just get on with
using it and you don't need to go for
all of these hoops and as what HD does
with sense i mean AC try to minimize
senza to try to improve it and all
really helpful and enthusiastic ababa I
mean it's a you wrote up a mini
editorial about AC finding its design
roots again but it just wasn't good
enough I don't think yeah didn't make it
yeah so I mean look HTC is going to come
back probably later this year with new
devices jellybean devices for sure right
and did hopefully they do something
strong and impressively Windows Phone
and that kicks awesome back up again I
do i do you feel like we need um you
know HTC and guys ago G by David you
reviewed the LG 4x HD and that was the
highest-rated LG we ever had and we need
those guys keep guys exam second check
because the whole apple vs samsung
conversation i am so sick inside of it I
would love for 2013 to be a conversation
about apple vs samsung vs LG vs. HTC vs
nokia but is Sony right if Sony's still
alive and kicking yeah I mean and the
thing is it seems like everyone is just
a little ways off like Sony makes great
phones uh Aaron are crazy Aaron just
reviewed the expiry you and you know
there's a lot to like about it
especially design wise but they ship it
with Gingerbread and that's just you
can't do that anymore um that's the same
right but they've also updated I think
it was the Xperia P to ice cream
sandwich and it's a huge improvement and
actually makes that a much more
compelling phone and there was the
Xperia ion in the US which is the same
way like it's a great phone except that
it has gingerbread which is just
absolutely unforgivable and then HTC
makes a gorgeous phone with an
incredible display and sense is too much
and you know on and on and on there's
just one small thing removed from having
a really really really compelling system
and my great hope and I'm sure this
won't be true because it never is is
that at least one more person will
figure it out in the next six months and
we'll have a real legitimate third
competitor because we're not that all
day yeah um Judy for me samsung samsung
is the closest with the the gut luck cs3
I mean honestly I mean they're selling a
ton of them and you know it's like I the
way the 1x looks to it but like it's a
good phone it's a good experience and
you know they haven't messed up android
too much but it's just I don't know I
find it boring and I i find the iphone
boring like i'm just i'm bored i want
more charged action I want more people
you know legitimately fighting instead
of getting eaten down dieter wants to
see the nokia n-gage may come back
that's good work oh man I would be all
about that means it works we don't had a
sidekick in a wily there might be time
actually did you see this uh this this
droid x fake thing that that's getting
made somebody made a fake PS vita shell
and loaded it up with ice cream sandwich
and has also pre loaded it with a whole
bunch of rom emulators so it's just a
straight-up completely fake PS vita
running android so that you can play
roms on it that's amazing and it's cool
toy to 360 so it takes into the droid x
360 yeah that's pretty good that's like
everything the Xperia Play should have
been and wasn't at all at all at all at
all yeah dude that's actually hard were
designed by SEO principles so it's like
how do I get on anybody's search engine
for any reason to do with gaming your
android call it a droid stick x360 in
the name make it into a PS vita look
alike and it oh and it can play
playstation 1 games something about why
the emulator but yeah all you need is
let's see how many people we can get to
sue us if they can find us before we saw
oh you can sell spray-z phones in china
that's okay Oh should we talk about
Sparrow the google acquired them and
they're not gonna update their app
anymore yes i want it there i'm just can
I just sit here in saab for the next
like 40 to 45 no sound a Gazette is not
allowed but we will permit you to have
good proper rights please no so I
actually don't have I don't even really
have a rant I think this is the most for
me it's like the most high risk high
reward thing ever I'm a serial switcher
between apps and the gmail app for
Android is legitimately great
gmail app for iOS is just you know a
nightmare hell works the world yeah it's
awful I hate it I hate it I wanted to
die that's just the end um and so my
great hope is that DOM and his team will
show up at Google and say listen let's
just you know call Sparrow gmail change
some of the colors and here's our new
app you know it has this multiple
accounts it doesn't crash all the time
it has push because gmail has figured
out how to do that so that like I'm
excited about that and if they're if the
sparrow ideas are just brought to the
Gmail team I think that's really
exciting and especially really exciting
for iOS users because the email system
on iOS is awful and it's the thing I
like the least about my iphone by a
million miles so the like that's a
beautiful dream but I mean listen it's
not gonna happen that quickly even if
that is what the goal is or you know
just add some like sparrow features to
the existing gmail app or you know
whatever they're going to do the thing
that was great about sparrow was they
iterated it so quickly and they can move
quick and they're nimble and you know
they can make a great app independently
and they can respond directly to use
your requests and features and they talk
to everybody and inside the giant
corporation that is Google on the team
within the team with the manager who has
another manager even even if google has
like you know perfected not having
crappy bureaucracy and I imagine they're
better than most companies there's no
way that they're going to be able to
iterate as quickly as I did as an
independent company or yeah or like you
know just be as responsive to user
requests because it's going to need to
get put through the corporate machine um
you know I don't want to you know say
they shouldn't have done it but I mean
that google offered to buy my company
that doesn't exist I would probably
seriously consider it um but
nevertheless like it's it's a bummer for
people who love the idea of independent
apps I mean the thing I tweeted when I
saw this news was rip chat or email back
in the palm OS days there was
you know the equivalent of Sparrow back
then was a sinkhole chat or email that
was basically the first app that could
handle I'm at idle which gave you push
email over i'm at and had a million
configuration options basically anything
a user asked for he he baked it in and
so calm hired and like chat or email
died and look the palms email client at
the time which was called of i forget
what it was called starts with a V Paul
meatballs email time like got like one
percent better and then died so I mean
in terms of like loving apps and loving
responsive developers think it just it
can't get better there's no way this
purchase is going to turn into something
that is more awesome than what Sparrow
is was becoming so my counter to that
and this is again back to my great you
know dream of rainbows and unicorns is
that Google with Google+ did kind of
proved that it can iterate quickly and
make a really good at like Google+ what
I care right what Google really really
cared about making Google+ a good
experience and in a matter of only a
couple of months went from a pretty bad
app that was just a wrapper on a you
know crappy mobile site to a really good
really attractive app that's you know
one of the best out there for social
networking stuff and so when it wants to
do it it moves quickly and does well and
especially with this you know newfound
design sense that Google seems to have
found can do some pretty great stuff and
so what I hope is that you know Sparrow
didn't take a billion dollars and just
you know go rest on their laurels at
Google they think I hope that the pitch
was we think you can do this great thing
for a lot more people in a lot more
places and I hope that that's real and i
believe that Google can do it I just
hope that they do and if not I will
literally come on this podcast and cry
every single every single well it's also
interesting in light of the fact that
you know Apple has taken google maps out
of iOS 6 and so like Google you know
they've got you know some apps on the
iphone and you know we just have been
complaining about gmail like they need
to that you know they know the iphones
not going anywhere and they need to have
a bed
experience for their apps on the iphone
and you know assuming that that's what
day they're gonna put the sparrow teams
toward you could be right I could be
doom and gloom for nothing and I take it
all back and I'm still blanking on the
name of that palm OS email client and
I'm not gonna rest until I remember it I
have just add to take deep decide on
this V anniversary because first mail
and congrats theta good Joe Lee because
I mean the point about the flexibility
of the independent developer and also
just the decision-making authority to be
able to make decisions quickly is an
important one it really is I recall an
article where it was mentioned that some
research was done in to brainstorming
right because brainstorming is a really
popular thing that took off in line to
1950s and 60s where you get a whole team
together and you say this is our problem
let's come up with solutions and then
they all start thinking up things and
putting things up on a chalkboard or
whatever they were using at a time I
mean you guys watch Mad Men you will
know better than me and and what they
found actually with the research is that
bracelet me doesn't she work it slows
things down in fact like there's too
many scattershot ideas this like one
person speaking one direction other
person speaking another direction and
and what you actually benefit from is
essentially dictatorial rule where one
person sets a tone sets the agenda etc
and everybody follows along and works to
that kind of thing and my evidence to
say that the same is true in goo goo is
Mattias towards his arrival like he
arrived ice cream sandwich pops up and
all of us were like holy crap Google now
actually has android design like there
is actually a thing called Android
design as opposed to android has
apparently been designed by somebody or
something somewhere right this is this
an idea that is some sort of frost some
sort of direction where the designs go
um now I am wary of how much
30 disparity we're going to get because
with their own app it was a case of if
you want to make a change if david p is
emails us and says guys this is really
important let's do it or you should do
it uh you know the sacrifice person team
right they can just decide yeah you know
David Pierce is a intelligent handsome
man we should follow this advice let's
do so this is the one Jesus point about
being nimble it's like fine there's a
change it happened and it's probably a
good change and it moves things forward
in goo how do you get that sort of
authority I mean I feel I feel like
Matty's was the exception right Google
hide him and recruited him on the
premise that they would give him a
really wide brain you know there was
they would essentially let him decide
whatever the hell we wanted to do with
Android and you can kind of tell that he
has this freedom to make design changes
and design language changes are we going
to see the same with a sparrow team are
they going to be allowed to run loose
with gmail I don't think so because
Jamie was so fundamental to Google's web
services and Sparrow are still kind of
you know he who wanted it they're just a
small group of you know successful
designers yes a successful that's why
they were both but again do you trust
the sparrow team enough to just let them
have gmail and firm bar with it I don't
think Google would I think you're
probably right and that makes me sad but
you know what I'm more worried about is
is Twitter and and then the corporate
policy coming down to the third party
apps makes me really really nervous yeah
so go ahead dinner okay well so I mean
uh I was at the the all things media
conference and the CEO Dick Costolo was
there and I wrote an article cotton ma a
social broadcasting network instead of
just a social network and um I was
totally right
like so they've been they've been making
noises recently that they're going to do
something to change the rules for
third-party apps they took linkedin its
integration and they killed that and
they've just been making a lot of noise
about these coming changes to their
developer api's that are going to be
stricter and they say they're saying
stuff like we want people to build off
of twitter we don't want people to build
off Twitter want people to build into
Twitter you know they need to make money
they need to make advertising and they
can do that in their own apps and on
their own website more easily than they
can off of tweet bot or plume or
whatever other third-party app you you
can name and so like nobody knows
exactly what the rules are gonna be but
you know it's clear that somebody
somewhere wants to just kill off third
party apps and all the efforts party
apps and make it look like a big allure
like Facebook actually where you know
there are third-party facebook apps but
they're not really you know that bite
use they're not very official blah blah
blah but everything sort of plugs into
the Facebook ecosystem as a platform
yeah an app platform even and ben popper
actually wrote a really good article
about this back on July night like it's
coming twitter is gonna look more like
facebook and your favorite third-party
app may not work nobody knows or it'll
work differently or something which
blows I mean completely blows because I
am so freaking invested into Twitter I I
start to feel anxious if I don't tweet
for like two days in a row I am like one
of Twitter's most loyal employees and
yes I do work at it I have multiple jobs
i work with twitter for flickr or
google+ very occasionally um and your
male model yeah yeah that does the one
unpaid job oh yeah it was also the
unappreciated one I tweeted a picture of
myself
she lost me 10 followers ah we know at
the same time has to be actually at the
same time uh that's that's a really
interesting one about manipulating your
Twitter audience because i lost 10
followers the immediate wake of posting
a picture and then the next morning I
had gained 20 so it's kind of like okay
I lost one chunk of my audience who okay
just using and abusing me just for tech
news and again the new chunk that
appreciated me for myself and my body
just really important ok this is this is
some food Twitter um whatever it is bad
if you could make this segue work I will
prove you without I'm so curious where
this is going right now whoa okay that's
the point the point is that I feel like
I personally am over-invested in Twitter
I feel like a lot of people are and
Twitter strength is always being the
fact that it's just kind of there you
know it it just gives you the foundation
and the basics and then I mean it kind
of like what the Costello said you build
on top of that you say things you use
twitter to do things right and yeah part
of it you know whatever is Twitter or
where there is any other web service
mobile is a huge part of it and a huge
part of it going forward so killing of
the point clients is not good because
third point clients have consistently
been better than Twitter some clients
this is my biggest problem and Twitter
be more like Facebook again makes me
wanna cry like David wants to cry with
respect sparrow because facebook is not
the direction I want Twitter to move
into I want other things to be like
Twitter I don't want Twitter to be like
Facebook where things are so tiring you
know clogged up and nasty and unpleasant
just yeah you know I I kind of just want
Twitter to stay exactly as it is
whatever chain is twitter i mean this
this whole argument the Twitter's making
sounds like the one
that the carriers are making which is we
don't want to be a dumb pipe that we
funnel your data where you want it to go
and the end there they're wanting to do
again what you said what Facebook is
doing which is say we own the whole
experience and facebook went has gone
even further and on the Facebook Connect
stuff where it kind of underpins these
other sites but and Twitter does that to
an extent but not quite as much but
Twitter seems to be saying like we don't
want to be just the thing that you know
delivers your data we want to be in
control of everything and be able to
advertise to you ourselves and you know
I'm not it on the desk this is what if
urance has Twitter's I mean Twitter
doesn't isn't a you know their private
company they have a private network
basically and they're api's exist at the
I don't know what the words that the
will of the king like they can they can
change or pull whatever they want
because it's not an open spec it suspect
controlled by them I mean there's this
this group called a app net that's
trying to basically build an open-source
Twitter competitor and so they're doing
something kind of like Kickstarter
they've got 20 days they want to reach a
half a million dollars and then they're
gonna you know try and launch and I mean
there's been some other attempts to
create sort of open api's for something
that's a lot like Twitter and I mean if
they go down this path and their ends up
being a huge backlash and they don't you
know carefully manage how they're going
to turn themselves into Facebook more
like they don't have a you know a
monopoly on this kind of service like if
somebody can build something and enough
people move to it it'll it'll change I
mean you know maybe maybe Google is
excited to try and swoop in on that I
don't think that's likely i think that
twitter the different kind of service
from google plus but like they I don't
know what percentage of there was a
study that like somebody figured out he
analyzed million tweets and what
percentage of users actually use
third-party clients yeah was this guy
Benjamin Mayo who went through and found
this is a you know relatively
unscientific thing he went and found a
million tweets which is a lot but
nowhere near the actual scale of Twitter
obviously and sorted it by clients and
the numbers are really interesting that
the top
see I think he found 70 point eight
percent of his total originated from
first party clients and at most 29.2
percent of people use third-party
Twitter clients which is really
interesting yeah in part of it actually
be smaller because some of those are
coming from like tweet buttons and stuff
right right yeah like the i think the
the web number is may be skewed i'm not
sure how quite how it's all calculated
but what i thought was really
interesting is that twitter has gone and
kind of systematically purchased all of
the really popular third-party ones like
i expected one this looks totally
different than I thought the top for our
web with a huge lead and then twitter
for iphone twitter for android and
twitter for blackberry which is really
surprising because you know that those
would be the top four but they surprised
me but then you get down to like
TweetDeck is way up there and then it's
like oh well twitter owns them and
they're all and the mobile web is high
and all these apps as you go down
twitter seems to have seen them and said
we you know you're clearly doing well
and doing something right we're just
going to buy you and that makes me
wonder like when r is twitter willing to
have a bunch of different first party
clients because that to me mitigates a
lot of the problem like if they're
willing to say you can't build a tweet
deck competitor but we're going to make
tweetdeck really good because it's ours
now and you clearly like it then I'm not
okay with it but more okay with it but
if they're going to come out and say
well this is Twitter for Mac this is
what it is this is what it looks like
this is what you will use and ditto for
Android and iOS and the web and so on
and so forth that's what makes me
nervous oh yeah Twitter actually owns a
lot of Twitter clients and a lot of
different ones that I had kind of
forgotten that no I agree with you and I
do you feel like the kinds of Twitter's
bought have been uncontroversial e
strong ones and good ones right it
bought Tweety and I mean oh that's fine
so long as Twitter actually maintains a
strong user experience that's fine the
thing that I'm quoting against is or
like the analogy that I was going to go
to mention earlier is that the reason
cockroaches survive as long as they do
is because they're simple and their
basic and they don't need to evolve
and in many respects twitter is like
that I know it's not a very flattering
analogy but it's like that it's got
something really really right in how
basic the communication is between
people it's added somebody useful and
fundamental and handy features like
picture previews and things are there
and just kind of enhance things in in
the right direction right that's good
but for the most part twitter has now
really reach the sort of critical mass I
mean if you watch BBC news reports over
here in the UK nowadays it's like
Jonathan English and then underneath is
twitter handle it's that widespread you
know people finish off news reports and
say if you want to comment on the story
you can find me on Twitter at
such-and-such spot so actually total
doesn't really need to be so aggressive
about trying to be like something else
like Facebook again and the thing that
I'm questioning is the thing that I'm
worried about is Twitter trying to be
too aggressive in whatever sort of
evolution it thinks it needs to do
because I don't think what does things
that need to do is you thinks it needs
to go public it thinks it needs to make
sure that it is monetized well so that
it can pay its employees and then go
public and then you know please its
future you know current and future
shareholders and so that I mean don't
don't be confused that you know this
move is about making sure that they've
got a long-term business where they can
make real money and they do it really
the questions mean well brio money in
quotation marks but they already have a
business yeah but we can't we can't ask
them to keep their business small just
because you know we like it better right
I mean what we can do is we can take our
business elsewhere if we don't like what
they're turning into yeah and if that
does that's just a warning point I was
gonna make a nice quick one if you
recall when dig was a DI GG remember
that site when he existed that's it what
is absolute peak it felt like it was a
juggernaut like you couldn't get away
from dick like every website on the
that cared about getting traffic cared
about getting on dick it was that high
was that epic was that great and then
dig did this really revolutionary design
and kind of screwed itself and now
nobody cares now right is the major
website serving that kind of audience
and big is essentially nowhere to be
found so all I'm saying is fine Twitter
wants to evolve Twitter wants to do
better but it takes very little actually
to just completely piss off your entire
audience and as he says alternatives can
and will crop up like the basic
functionality twitter has can be
replicated by people smarter than I and
uh naw dians can be developed I mean
imagine for example such some other
company with a lot of um how to put it a
lot of credibility with the online
community so somebody like valve and a
way that they develop ste right mm-hm
the same thing can really happen with a
new social network you just you just
need enough discontent to you know steam
up around Twitter which only never
happens because I do like it and I have
work hard to build up my followers you
know you know I already invested just
leaving be well I don't change go to too
much think that's all I'm saying do you
remember um do you remember the dick bar
the which drove everyone away from
Twitter this oh yeah crazy ass I mean so
what's what's crazy about that and you
just made me think of this Vlad was that
before the things like the dick bar
which everybody hated I don't remember
was actually called it's just I was the
quick bar but it's close it's the tick
bar that's better um the dick bar drove
everybody to you know tweetbot and
tweetdeck and all these other clients
and if they get rid of those it's going
to drive people to Facebook and Google+
and you know that could be much more
dangerous is that they're bad decisions
drive people not only away from Twitter
apps but away from Twitter and I don't
is that might just be a conspiracy
theory but it's it's like people really
really really hated that quick bar and
if
if the only other option had been let's
go use google plus i really think people
would have gone and used google plus
that's true because the next I want to
go to use google plus I really I'll be
fine it's good but no no this butter is
it's limited ok finish yeah yeah agree
but google plus the only thing I need to
do is sort of a freaking web interface
which has vast quantities of white space
which goes disused and then you have
this really narrow band of content in
the middle if they could actually have
somebody who's familiar with web design
work on their website I could you know
find myself little bus I can live with
that yeah so you know to the needs to
watch out I'll take like ten percent of
my photos of the Google+ I mean all you
have to do is repost that picture you
posted on Twitter and everybody's coming
to Google Plus for you I think that's
that's clear no that's my point about
how the other half are going to I don't
know find another verge European editor
I guess Aaron can be a good substitute
for me so long as he gets a haircut
hahaha Jersey area there's another thing
I met up with the London team I not
nobody particularly cares but I met up
with London teams today and all of them
are scruffy make not one of them is
shaved in the past week two of them have
haircuts that are like white person
afros it's outrageous you know two weeks
away and old standards drop it's
terrible terrible I mean the only reason
I'm keeping the beard again it's a
45-minute shadow I didn't have time to
show you to the photo podcast but uh in
a reason I'm keeping a beard is to kind
of keep that going and chris's absence
when chris is back i'll probably make
myself presentable yeah it's like it's
like the Olympic flame somebody has to
keep it and it doesn't matter who it is
but as long as somebody has it we're
okay oh do you don't don't get me
started the Olympic flame the number of
times i think is gone out and people
to artificially turn it back on is the
whole tour of the UK um so we try to
snatch it when it was on tour which is
like yeah yeah but if you want to steal
something don't try to steal the Olympic
flame man honestly that's like how are
you gonna get away with that think about
it what a story yeah yeah so I'm gonna
wrap this up cast up now that we've
complained about twitter if you want to
follow us on twitter while it still
exists you can i'm at back line vladas
at flats ever David is at Pierce David
we're all together at verge and we will
be back at you next week thanks for
watching thanks guys
