Michael Shane and thanks to a daily
regimen of yoga and meditation I'm in a
constant state of relaxation don't
interrupt me or startled me during 90
seconds on the verge another day another
NSA leak a new report details how a
secret NSA program called dish fire
collects nearly 200 million quote
untargeted text messages every day
including names phone numbers and images
one key factor is that while dish fire
collects both data within the US and
abroad the data from other countries is
stored for far longer the saddest part
about all this new revelations about the
NSA don't even really surprised us
anymore Netflix continued its award
season run this morning with its first
Oscar nomination the square a netflix
backed documentary about the 2011
Egyptian revolution picked up a
nomination for Best Documentary so who's
going to take home all those awards you
can find out when the Oscars air on
March second and finally what are two
things a film adaptation of 1984 needs
romance and Kristen Stewart the new film
is titled equals and whilst are both
Stewart and warm bodies actor nicholas
hoult The Associated Press paraphrases
Stewart as calling it a slightly updated
version of the 1956 film about love in a
world where love really doesn't exist
anymore the good news is that the script
will be written by Nathan Parker who
previously wrote the award-winning
sci-fi drama moon that's it for today's
top stories coming up tomorrow I star in
the romantic remake of Raiders of the
Lost Ark I'm sorry about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
