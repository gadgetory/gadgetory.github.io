new iPad air the air is a complete
redesign of the full-size iPad after
three generations of the iconic iPad 2
design it looks and feels exactly like a
large iPad Mini with the same chamfered
aluminum frame but while this design
might be familiar it's still surprising
in person it weighs just one pound and
it's far narrow than previous large
iPads thanks to its smaller side bezels
all that adds up to an astonishing
reduction in size and weight when you
hold it the hardware feels incredibly
premium but basically fades away as soon
as you use it it's a trick only Apple
has really managed to pull off and the
iPad air is so far ahead of the curve
it's almost like the company's showing
off once you start using the iPad you're
still looking at apples excellent 9.7
inch 2048 by 1536 Retina display which
remains among the best in the industry
other tablets like the Nexus 7 and the
Galaxy Note have pushed the bar slightly
ahead of the iPads 264 pixels per inch
to hit 300 and Beyond but in day-to-day
use they're indistinguishable inside the
air has Apple's new 64-bit a7 chip which
is just ridiculously fast apple claims
the new chip is up to twice as quick as
the old model and things certainly feel
that way apps open almost instantly
games are utterly smooth Safari loads
webpages faster than ever and the whole
thing just feels like it has tons of
power to spare around the back you'll
find the same megapixel camera it's the
previous iPad with support for 1080p
video recording and there's a 1.2
megapixel front shooter that's
marginally better in low light than the
previous model in case you're really
into late-night FaceTime the only thing
you won't find on the air is the new
touch ID fingerprint sensor from the
iPhone 5s but while the hardware of the
iPad air is pretty close to perfect the
software isn't quite as polished the air
runs iOS 7 which is Apple's complete
redesign of its mobile operating system
and there are several places where it
doesn't feel quite finished on the
larger screen of the iPad the app
switcher can get fairly confused if you
switch between landscape and portrait
often safaris video player was a bit
buggy err and crash here in my testing
and it's been in iOS 6 and the iBooks
app still hasn't been updated for iOS 7
so it's full of fake wood textures Iowa
7 is kind of everywhere now and it's
starting to grow on me just a little bit
but using it on the iPad air as a
reminder of just how quickly Apple was
forced to bring it together a few more
updates are definitely in order to
polish it up for the iPad the air is so
powerful and so nice to have around the
I want to use it for more and more
things but I can't for a variety of
reasons I'd love to see more powerful
multitasking for example I'd love to be
able to use a browser and a chat session
at the same time the iPad lives between
a laptop and a phone but sometimes it
feels like the experience is more about
stretching phone ideas up than pulling
laptop ideas down all that said the
overall experience of using an iPad is
unmatched by any other tablet Apple's
lead an app selection and refinement is
so massive that these few iOS 7 glitches
see more like steps sideways and steps
backwards there just aren't games like
Infinity Blade on any other platform and
there's nothing like GarageBand anywhere
else and the complete iLife and iWork
suites are now free
adding to the immediate usability of the
iPad so should you buy an iPad air well
it depends if you have a
fourth-generation iPad I would actually
wait a year the air is definitely faster
but not buy so much that you'll notice
in day-to-day use and next year's air
will probably feature a touch ID sensor
and another performance bump that will
make the out way worth it but if you
have anything older than last year's
iPad it's a no-brainer upgrade you'll
experience a huge jump in performance
and the massive improve in size and
weight is incredible and if you're in
the market for a new tablet and you
absolutely want a larger screen you
should buy an iPad air there's nothing
better
in fact deciding between the air and the
new retina iPad Mini might actually be
the hardest choice of all
