the New York International Auto Show
Apple is demoing carplay it's simplified
version of iOS optimized for use in the
car we got a chance to look at how car
play works in upcoming hyundai volvo and
mercedes-benz vehicles partly relies
heavily on Siri in fact auto
manufacturers can disable manual text
input entirely and provides quick access
to the things you need most while
driving namely music navigation phone
calls and text messages carplay also
provides access to third-party apps that
have been updated to support it there's
only a handful available right now but
you can listen to I Heart Radio Spotify
or podcast or your car stereo most of
the difficult interactions are done
through Siri you dial numbers send any
text messages enter destinations and
call up music with your voice it works
well most of the time and the system
uses the microphones already built into
the car instead of using the iPhones
microphone to pick up your voice carplay
works in different ways depending on a
car specific hardware configuration
Volvo's implementation uses both a
touchscreen and hardware buttons while
Hyundai opted for the all touchscreen
route mercedes-benz chose to forego that
touchscreen entirely and requires
drivers control carplay with a hardware
knob and a handful of buttons like iOS
carplay really lends itself to touch
interactions and it was definitely
easiest to use in the cars with
touchscreens each car manufacturer
integrates carplay into its existing
navigation systems differently as well
Hyundai and mercedes-benz essentially
run car play as an app with it
completely separate from the native
navigation system volvo on the other
hand has built an interface that
integrates car play as a panel along
with the native navigation system
bluetooth phone app and media playback
it's much faster and easier to navigate
on Volvo's system and it doesn't feel
like you're working in two different
worlds as much as the Mercedes and
Hyundai's versions the other thing
that's a bit weird about car play is
that it duplicates many of the things
that car makers have already put into
their cars it's a second navigation
system second phone apps second music
player and second voice recognition
system car makers don't really have much
of a choice here if you don't have an
iPhone you're still gonna want to use
navigation and Bluetooth features in
your car and they have to provide them
still despite duplicating almost
everything your car already does carplay
is nicer to use in virtually any
automakers interface and it integrates
with your text messages and smartphone
apps much better
apple's initial carplay rollout is
rather limited in addition to hyundai
mercedes benz involved
just Ferrari and Honda have committed to
launching cars with it this year 13
other manufacturers have also signed on
board to support car play at some point
in the future will car play be the car
interface of the future only time will
tell but I really wouldn't mind having
it in my car right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
