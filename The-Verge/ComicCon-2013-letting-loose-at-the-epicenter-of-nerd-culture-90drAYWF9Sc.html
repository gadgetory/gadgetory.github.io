comic-con 2013 and one thing you're
gonna see a lot of his lines there's
lines for signing there's lines for
buying there's answers about everything
you can imagine a lot of lies
what do you really think of us at the
gram so what keeps you coming back here
after year you know it's just the
amazing stuff that you can see here you
can get movies you get comics you get
fellow nerds it's a little bit of
everything oh the environment pretty
much everyone else that pretty much have
the same hobbies I do comics
entertainment gaming I love the spirit
of everybody getting together and nerds
convening so many people like yourself
being a child again I see all these
people of all ages all ethnicities and
they're all here for the same thing it's
epic yeah epic school I'm Brian mana I
don't remember man thank you basically
what we're gonna go ahead and do is take
8 photos of you simultaneously from
there we're gonna mesh your face onto a
3d model head that we've already existed
that the predator is going to decapitate
this is awesome if you like help build
this or I work for 3d systems this is
something we do something similar online
at cubify calm but this is the first
time we've done something where we are
taking it to you guys so that you can
experience it live like the rest of us
hundreds of people can get their face
torn off by the predator not necessarily
a dream but kind of it should be a drink
it should be who doesn't what a great
way to go as you know the dream you
don't know you want but you see it like
you know I must live that dream it's a
spot where we could all come hang out
everybody's cool whether you like gaming
cypher steampunk toys movies whatever it
is you know this is a place where we
could all go and just have fun you know
let loose for four days at least you got
to take a look for yourself to be honest
when I came to comic-con I was a little
bit cynical think he was going to be a
place for movie studios and television
networks to push the latest where's but
here on the ground with the people with
these people it's a place to be excited
and passionate about things you love and
to be frank I can't wait for next year</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
