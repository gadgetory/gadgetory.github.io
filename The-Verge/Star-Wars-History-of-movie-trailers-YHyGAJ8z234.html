this scene this exact moment was the
first time we saw anything from star
wars the force awakens and we have
watched rewatched and RiRi watched it
over and over again along with the
dozens of other teasers trailers and TV
spots that have followed fans have
dissected analyzed remixed and reacted
to the clips that last trailer the aired
during Monday Night Football that one
alone was watched over 112 million times
in just 24 hours it suffice to say
people are kind of excited but even
though we've seen a lot we still have
almost no idea about this movies
actually going to be about its hyped by
omission and Star Wars is forging a new
path at a time when most trailers are
serving up sort of a Cliff's Notes
version of a movie that they're selling
the force awakens represents the latest
evolutionary leap in the long history of
the movie trailer
somewhere in space this may all be
happening right now this is the teaser
trailer from the original 1977 version
of Star Wars and that voice let's call
him the voice-over guy so big sprawling
space saga of rebellion and romance when
Hollywood's blockbuster era kicked off
the 1970s voice-over guy explained plot
details introduced characters and just
generally sounded really 500 rescued the
princess destroyed the Death Star but
their story didn't end there but today
it sounds dated a little hokey that's
partly because it was a long-standing
holdout from the earliest days of movie
promotion originally trailers were shown
after movies hence the name trailer and
were just hardcore sales pitches
designed to get people back into theater
in this spot for the 1927 version of the
jazz singer
he's just straight-up telling the camera
about how awesome the movie is now these
few little themes that you have
duckstein
only give you a vague idea of the red
feet that is in store for you when
America's foremost entertainer makes its
appearance fear in the dad finger
voiceover guy was an evolution of that
same thing explaining why a movie was
the most amazing romantic tale of
adventure to ever hit the silver screen
not a little burrito and while there
were occasional exceptions the familiar
voice over guy dominated trailers over
time maybe got a little too familiar in
a world where the Sun burns cold in a
world without gas you know
that's powered by violence in a world
where only a radio was strictly
forbidden in a time in an age in a city
in a land and in a world where both of
our cars were totally underwater we were
in a world with a lot of voiceover
but by the end of the 90s when trailers
for Star Wars The Phantom Menace started
coming out the medium had begun to shift
voice over guy wasn't around as much and
more subtle title cards were in the
style was different to this new breed of
trailer could be impressionistic at
times almost Moody The Phantom Menace
clips were more like mini films in the
old heart cells turning trailers and to
fully realize dramatic experiences you
refer to the prophecy of the one who
will bring balance to the force you
believe it's this boy if old trailers
were promises of a movie to come these
could be enjoyed entirely on their own
and they coincided with the emergence of
the perfect distribution platform the
Internet in 1998 sites crashed under the
demand when a bootleg for the original
Phantom Menace trailer made it online
the next day Lucasfilm put out an
official download and more sites crashed
now you have to remember this was 1998
AOL was still a thing fans had actually
download the video to watch it which
meant they had to click the button and
wait and wait and wait a little bit more
it wasn't pretty but the trailer helped
kickstart the idea of the Internet as a
video platform watching the trailer over
and over again fans could grow even more
excited dissecting what would happen
with those big space battles the new
Jedi and Darth Maul's crazy double
lightsaber then the movie came while it
was successful it's safe to say it
didn't quite live up to fan expectations
where the trailers were sleek and
stylish The Phantom Menace itself was
clunky and awkward and subsequent Star
Wars trailers left the solty behind for
a plot heavy exposition Palooza and like
the movies they were selling they were
pretty good
boy has exceptional skills his abilities
have made him arrogant excuse me I'm in
charge of security here milady
by the time Revenge of the Sith rolled
around you didn't even really need to
see the movie at all with the trailer
giving away nearly every major plot
point in movies you're under arrest
genzler are you threatening me master
Jedi and for the most part that's the
trend we still see today with predators
using up every surprise movie has to get
people into theaters hoping to avoid the
big reveal in Terminator Genisys that
John Connor is a bad guy whoops
with so much info coming at fans and
online culture making it so easy to
share points of view it's given rise to
a creative cottage industry the force
awakens trailer comes in an era of
dissection where fans don't just watch
trailers they break them down analyze
them post reaction videos make remixes
even create shot-for-shot duplicates
using cardboard sets okay seriously the
hyperspace effect is awesome I can't say
can I it's become a perfect match of art
form and medium and Hollywood is paying
attention because today we don't just
get trailers we get TV spots commercials
featurettes social media posts teasing a
trailer for a trailer for a movie that's
a year away there's no stopping it and
it is everywhere which is exactly why
the restraint of the force awakens has
seemed so novel I mean just listen to
some of this dialogue who are you
I'm known for this first time in years
were actually being teased and it's
exciting after being told way too much
for way too long
audiences are desperate for a real
surprise and here's what's cool with
more blockbusters part of these huge
expanded universes there's less reason
than ever for studios to give away plot
or spoil a movie secrets because you
don't really need this in a world when
you have this and this and that one - so
will Star Wars change the way trailers
are made forever possible trailer trends
come and go as tastes and the way we
process visual information change and as
we've already seen where and how
trailers are shown can have a
fundamental impact on the art form
itself but let's not fool ourselves no
matter how wonderful and artistic the
trailer may be it's still just marketing
and the best trailer in the world can't
make a movie great
