been chasing Samsung each move that
Samsung made would invariably be
followed by a less successful move from
LG but this year LG is doing something
different than Samsung that something
different is the new g4 the g4 has
nearly the same level of experience of
Samsung's Galaxy s6 but it offers things
like a removable battery and microSD
card support both of which are missing
from Samsung's phones this year if you
want something different than Samsung or
you're just looking for those specific
features the qi4 is a great option while
Samsung radically changed the design
materials and features in the galaxy s6
LG's g4 mostly stays the course it's
very similar in design and appearance
last year's g3 and it's still made of
plastic as opposed to the glass and
metal in the s6 for the most part the g4
doesn't look or feel any different than
the g3 and it doesn't feel as nice as
the s6 the iPhone 6 or HTC One m9 the
few design differences from the g3 can
be reduced to an exceptionally slight
curve and slightly sharper corners the
curve is not extreme it's not a G flex 2
but it does make the g4 a little more
comfortable to hold than a flatter phone
but none of this is to say the g4 is
just the warmed up g3 there are two
major upgrades here and a couple of
smaller ones that add up to making a
much more compelling smartphone the
first of these major upgrades is the new
screen it's still a 5.5 inch qHD panel
with 2560 by 1440 pixels but it's
brighter more color accurate and more
efficient than the g3 screen LG uses a
whole bunch of marketing mumbo jumbo to
explain this new screen but all that
really matters to us is that it's one of
if not the best smartphone screens to
date it's super bright not oversaturated
amazing in direct sunlight and just a
pleasure to look at the other big
upgrade in the g4 is the camera it's a
new 16 megapixel camera with an ultra
bright F 1.8 aperture lens it still has
that laser assisted autofocus from the
g3 but now has a new secondary sensor
that supposedly makes for better color
and white balance it also has a new
optical image stabilization system the
LG says it's up to twice as good as
other smartphones but marketing claims
aside the g4 is cameras really great
it's great in bright light and low light
has natural color and lots of detail
there's a new camera app lets you
manually control a lot of features like
shutter speed white balance ISO and
focus and it's a lot of fun to shoot
with if you know what you're doing but
not everything is perfect here even with
that laser system the g4 can still
for focus more than other phones and
even occasionally miss focus white
balance isn't as warm as es6 the most
accurate results come when you override
the automatic settings and despite the
bevy of manual controls LG still doesn't
let you adjust sharpness or saturation
and the default sharpening is too
aggressive but if this bothers you as
much as it bothers me you can actually
shoot in RAW and process your images on
a computer for better results the g4s
new six core Snapdragon 808 processor
and three gigabyte of RAM make it plenty
fast for virtually anything you need to
do it doesn't have the stutters or
slowdowns that we saw with the G flex 2
and while it doesn't really feel as
blistering fast as the m9 or the s6
you'd only really notice that when
you're comparing the phone side-by-side
the removable 3000 milliamp hour battery
is big enough to get through a full day
of heavy use - if you're less demanding
than I am but it doesn't have the
built-in wireless charging or the quick
charging features of Samsung's phones
for software the g4 has android 5.1
lollipop
it's got LG's custom interface on top of
that LG says it's toned down the changes
to Android and includes fewer duplicate
absent before but it doesn't really feel
any different if you're looking for a
nexus like experience you won't get it
here and LG software design skills
aren't nearly as good as Google's HD CS
or even Samsung's those complaints are
pretty minor overall and while the g4
isn't as popular as the s6 nor is it as
pretty as the m9 it's still a good
smartphone that gets the important
things right it's got a great display
great camera and all-day battery life if
that's what you're looking for the g4 is
worth your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
