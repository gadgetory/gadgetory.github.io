the delightful Mo Rocca mouths I'm
praying for sure I wouldn't ask you
something
don't even do any finish that don't even
finish telling me how you are your name
mo mo is short for something yeah my um
my father was a diplomat in Africa when
I was born this is true you got your
satanist yep in the late 60s and he was
the ambassador to Mozambique and so it
just mo is just I know I'm making that
up I just want to see how you react to
that know my mother
right you got to admit I did catch that
you were making that right it's the
beauty it but then you lied for like
they knew you really eww well I thought
once I asked and you and then you said
no I would imagine that you were a liar
that you would lie to my face right no
way now I know no and you were actually
really thoughtful about it because I
think you also thought the whole thing
was loaded I've dragged Africa into it
it got very sensitive a little bit but
your day there's no these are shortcuts
no no no no what happened is my mother
was actually she was very sort of
bohemian and kind of a hippie and I was
born it is you know and so I she was she
was living in the Mojave Desert when
okay it's uh you don't want to help it
I'm ashamed moving along so you're an
Emmy and Peabody Award winner oh sure
I mean I'm sort of one knows yes I did
are you having I actually have an FBI
agent front yes I had a statue it's a
set yet I think well no they're
statuettes and a statue oh this has to
be large yes they don't give me like
eight foot tall that's just not just an
approximation of what you're getting
exactly unless you steal the thing
that's in front of the Academy which is
a life-size one which was a cheap right
it's just a prop you have to buy you
have to be equal daddy you have to buy
the MA you actually have to buy it
that's actually very common for a whore
it's apparently we want some some
webbie's and I think that you have to
buy the webbie's as well not there's
anything wrong with that we love the
webbie's continue to award us the prizes
but okay so yeah your daddy
supposedly an Emmy Award winner but you
but you and you've done a lot of stuff
in news comedy and get all of it you're
doing food stuff now
but you did children's shows thank you
did a show called wishbone which I had
never seen but there are several
youngsters here in the room who were
telling me about that how beloved the
show is for kids and it's about a dog
that sort of what is the dog okay it's a
dog Jack Russell terrier who in his
fantasy life becomes the hero of classic
novels in order to familiarize kids
between the ages of 6 and 11 with the
themes of those books so that when they
encounter them later on they'll find
them less daunting right what kind of
book so it could it would be a Don
Quixote I did oh yeah oh yeah yeah no he
was central pawns oh wow it's a great
show anyone under the age of 30
um loves it and knows that not anyone
but most people I mean not those kids if
I'm 26
alright then you're one of the people I
know you have TV yeah they take your TV
away when you cross the Brooklyn you
drop the Williamsburg Bridge as a guy
waiting there that's terrible it hits
you hands you a copy of Catcher in the
Rye exactly you don't have a teeny you
must be a really roll up the cost of
your jeans I what was I saying no sorry
the dog no so he would be such a Ponzo
or he was a in I did Treasure Island and
he was it suddenly became a character in
Treasure on the kid Jim what's his name
who's the kid Oh God in the book yeah
let's say Jim that sounds wrong okay I
know alright I'll totally I think it's
Tony
you went from wishbone to perfect 10 any
porn magazine support is not really
important magazine well that's you
earlier yes Phoebe to poor not know the
perfect time do you guys know do you
guys know perfect 10 is it's a magazine
it was a magazine from I think the 90s
yeah it's the answer the modern answer
to Playboy which is a lot of fake
breasts at the time perfect tenant was a
magazine for connoisseurs it was the
only adult men's magazine that featured
models without breast implants right and
that was their thing yeah they're like
they're attend
naturally exactly and you were the I was
salting editor of perfect ten and I was
um I it was an unusual way that I got
there but the guy who ran it was a
totally fascinating guy named norm Zeta
who made a lot of money
playing international poker poker
tournaments and was kind of like a
mathematical genius he was very nice
very generous highly neurotic and he had
a house in the Hollywood Hills with all
these beautiful women there he didn't
even have sex with all these women that
were in the house he was a very neurotic
guy but liked having all these beautiful
women around him and they were for the
most part the staff of the magazine but
he chose the negative staff by beautiful
women in addition to having to pay and
it was very hard to find models without
breast implants so a lot of the women
came from Eastern Europe I think it's
when the iron curtain fell it took a
while for breast implants to pour and I
guess and so I right right at the start
oh it's interesting the iron curtain
came down there was a lot of beautiful
women of that breast implant so there
was also a clown glut I remember this
because there were a lot of
state-supported circuses and there were
all these clowns that couldn't find work
because this is totally true yes that
has nothing to do with the story but
times were out of work because the state
was no longer this it was no longer like
a guarantee State College yeah exactly
yeah
yeah and so anyway so he had this
magazine and and it wasn't he wasn't he
didn't oppose breast implants for
ideological reasons he just hated the
way they looked and the way they found
aesthetic yes but I was the magazine's
grammarian basically because he was a
real stickler about poor grammar and
there was very little text in the
magazine but he hired me for a hundred
and fifty dollars an hour to pour over
the copy and make sure that there were
no syntax grammar punctuation errors
okay so then so let's fast-forward a
little bit okay let's have a Daily Show
sure tell me about how how did you get
involved in The Daily Show and at what
point did news become a thing that was
important to you well I was always like
a news junkie and so I started going
around the country visiting the homes
and grave sites of obscure presidents I
got very interested in seeing the weird
off-the-beaten-path marginalized
historic sites like all the Presidents
between Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt the
guys with the facial hair a couple of
them were knocked off like you know like
Grover Cleveland he wasn't knocked off
but like our James Garfield or bent
Harrison and I found that when I went to
their sites it wasn't like Hyde Park or
Monticello where when you walk in you're
already in awe but that the people had
to really sell it to you because you
might be there to use the bathroom and I
met like a woman named Wanda we a woman
named Wanda wheat wheeler in
Indianapolis at the Benjamin Harrison
house who volunteered there full-time
for 22 years and by the end of the tour
she gave you she was so committed to him
you wanted to sandblast Mount Rushmore
and replace it with hey you're like this
why this guy getting his due yeah what
number what number president is he he's
23 because he's in part of the Grover
Cleveland sandwich he's Grover
Cleveland's 22 24 non-consecutive terms
and you're I think about that all the
time
Grover Cleveland had non-consecutive
presidential terms anyway so I started
meeting two really interesting
characters there and at the at the
Warren Harding house in Marion Ohio I
met a god that was so obsessed with
Florence Harding the first lady that he
dressed up as her to give tours of the
house in this small Ohio town and it
wasn't like he was I mean I think people
thought it was accepted I'm doing this
solo you were just like I'm gonna go
check out these places I've got some
free time ya know I was I just thought I
thought you know I had this like yen
this itch to do this so I might and I
did that and I collected some great
stories and so then somebody said you
should go on The Daily Show and do these
as pieces yeah so that's how it started
yeah that has morphed though from doing
sort of comedy news you've done real
news as well I mean you you sort of I
would never be interested in going on
the cable net on the news on the three
cable nets and doing punditry I mean I
get I ran out of opinions like that I'm
like I'm done with I feel like whatever
what do you think I go either way by
doing like something you know my main
gig is on CBS Sunday morning and doing
like a seven-minute piece there on and
this was actually felt almost like a
Daily Show piece on right before the the
2012 election I went up to to see the
the Chester Alan Arthur birthplace
because when he was president in the
1880s there was a movement of people
that said he was actually born in Canada
so there were birthers
and this is really back to your roots
this is yeah it is actually history on
both sides of the border you found
Canadians going Chester Alan Arthur was
the first American Canadian president
like and they were and then the people
in both are like owning it the controls
are like this and you know they're like
this is where he's a secret history of
America that has a Canadian President
exactly and then and then the Vermonter
is to hear Vermonters get really upset
about this was just really funny yeah so
what number was he uh he is 21 because
Garfield is 20 and then he gets killed
upset it yeah poor poor Garfield yeah no
not the cat is fine
though he is my cholesterol from the
lasagna lasagna yeah yeah okay so now
now cooking your dinner you have an
interest in food and cooking I don't
know if your an interest in cooking
necessarily you're gonna tell me in a
second don't answer that yeah but you're
doing a show it's called my
grandmother's ravioli explain explain my
grandmother's ravioli okay well so my
grandmother this is another lie I can no
no it's true my my grandmother was was a
very good cook and she made really great
ravioli and and when we were little we
would show up at her apartment and like
you know like ten minutes before it was
time to eat and wolf the food down and
then kind of take off and anyway so this
shows really about guilt abatement
because I never learned how to cook and
I still don't but you don't you don't
really cook no so I thought I want to go
and learn how to cook from grandmothers
and grandfathers across the country I
would I feel like grandparents would be
less concerned with the health factor of
their food then modern parents might be
yeah in the sense that like this is this
recipe requires six sticks of butter
coming that's no problem whatsoever are
there are there I mean in the ravioli I
would imagine that you had must not it
couldn't be for that healthy right her
ravioli was it was okay it had spinach
inside no but like Millie's chicken
salad
had a whole lot of mayonnaise and
marries pierogi had lots of butter or
I'm just trying to think of our
different grandparents and Gaitan Oh
only eats what he shoots and kills I
mean he's a 92 year old who's ever birth
Mark Zuckerberg reacted think he'll only
he'll only eat when he kills me what he
kills
yeah that's Caetano does that - he's 92
years old he took me out shooting and
and and he also said that he had the big
problem and it's it was in this episode
with this guy he's a real badass is that
today's kids are so attached to their
smartphone that if their plane went down
they wouldn't know how to survive if
they're playing crash if the crashes in
the Andes and they and they and they
live yeah just very very he says that
they're probably and I said what if they
have cell phone coverage in the Andes
yeah yeah exactly then they could look
up like forage or something or just call
the police and say can you come yet well
right and he was really bothered by one
of the he didn't like the concept he
didn't like the scenario that I was
painting he insisted that when the plane
goes down in the Andes that your cell
phone breaks it's just there's no way if
you who you live with your cell phone
breaks maybe if it was in the overhead
compartment
and that got destroyed well write it
wait with it's an overhead compartment
it's and you're alive it's likely I'm
not I don't know either I'm confused
about the whole concept of a plane crash
anyway in anybody surviving but but you
know guy tano is that his name I'm gonna
let's go yes yes sure I mean my that's
my my thought was well you'd obviously
eat the people right because they're
there but I think once they're dead
you'd have to hunt them you have but you
have to I don't know it's like eating a
lobster I don't you know you have to
kill them first right
yeah yeah right well anyway yeah and so
on
I can't remember what he said I do know
that he said that this is like a really
good part to eat that thing but I feel
like there's a lot of fat in that right
that part is that good I think so I mean
what savory okay I think that's we
should just stop here on cannibalism
where and when if I want to see this
show the episode about cannibalism and
others my grandmother's ravioli is on
Cooking Channel on Wednesday nights and
it is not the Cooking Channel there bear
there really yeah
is there you know there isn't it's just
called Cooking Channel but I think it's
I always feel like a caveman when I'm
saying where it is because I also I have
a new show on Cooking Channel they like
country actually they can't say the the
they are they don't say that and they're
gonna have they're gonna happen it's
like ending a sentence in a preposition
at one point like you just have to do it
like we have to get over that rule right
has to be thought cooking yeah I agree
so what time on The Cooking Channel I go
to see this what day what time it's on
Wednesday what channel on if I'm a Time
Warner subscriber which I am do you know
a channel The Cooking Channel is on my
it's on Cooking Channel Judah you know
that number it is in New York it's no
don't go to The Cooking Channel because
you'll never find this show right or any
others right I think actually Paula Deen
is now on The Cooking Channel that's the
racist cooking check</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
