verge we are here at Aoife 2012 in
Berlin checking out Sony's so-called
surf slider hybrid the windows 8 Vaio
duo 11 so what you're gonna see here is
we've got is pretty strong in a hinge
it's actually absolutely lifts up a
little bit and go down here comes a
slate push it up it's not a mess like
the easiest task and it becomes your
laptop keys as you expect to be small
also as he would expect a little shallow
to make up for kind of the fitness you
can't have too thick of keys and you're
basically slamming it on together I've
got a little track bald knob right here
Sony is a promoting the stylus right
here but unfortunately I don't see a
slot in fact I think it's actually a
little check it is about as wide as the
entire thing closed down so there is
probably could be no place for this look
at that machine we've got thunder bolt
USB 3.0 presumably HDMI out various
buttons here some volume control for
when it's closed your Carter your VGA
because if you're living in the future
with a surf clutter tablet you still
need that VGA connection every now and
then a card reader and then over the
front you've got your power and you've
got your Ethernet definitely a full
feature computer in terms of ports and
connectivity hard to saying the
performance itself
we got the much much famous our screen
feels pretty good actually surprisingly
light no question on the on the battery
life in this stuff
they are calling it an ultrabook which
means it's got Intel's standard chipset
for that no word necessarily on pricing
at the moment should be an interesting
topic otherwise if you like the keyboard
then I think you're actually might get a
kick out otherwise it's just a pretty
standard tablet the keyboard still takes
a little bit getting used to maybe we
will if we play around that more not the
best we play with but for all one
package it's surprising</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
