here with LG's latest interview fridge
so Samsung did a fridge very similar to
this earlier in the year but LG's gone
one step further this is actually a
translucent panels so you could actually
see the products are in your fridge
behind what's really cool is there's a
touch screen and a tablet on here so you
can add stickers stuff like mysteries
through your family diet plans all that
sort of stuff all the sort stuff you'd
expect from a smart for your triggers
and but the real trick here is if I
swipe from the bomb I get Windows 10
class bar you get the full Start screen
as you'd expect not real we'd really
expect on the fridge and be get like the
weather apps you go back to Microsoft
edge with all type of browser watch
YouTube will sort crazy stuff for you I
don't maybe wanna do this on a fridge
but it's here and at the same time
whenever I'm looking at that content if
I go back the YouTube you can still see
like the beers have seen as fridge
behind me because it's fully translucent
by and it's a 29 inch display on here so
you can pretty much get a lot of apps on
here I don't know if you can
side-by-side with them but pretty big
display you can pull the fridge out and
you can still see all the products
inside and that was a real quick look at
LG's interview fridge and if you want to
look at any more videos from Berlin and
