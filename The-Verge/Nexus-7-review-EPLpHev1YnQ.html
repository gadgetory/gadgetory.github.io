we're taking a look at the Google Nexus
7 tablet it's an Asus made 7-inch $200
device that is being sold exclusively
right now through Google's Play Store
and it's meant to basically be the
content consumption tablet device that
Google helps will lure people away from
things like the Kindle Fire and maybe
even the iPad at least the lower end
iPad 2 it's got a Tegra 3 chipset inside
with a gig of ram 8 or 16 gigabytes
storage options Wi-Fi bluetooth
accelerometer gyroscope GPS it has a 1.2
megapixel camera on the front and it's
also got a pretty decent looking display
it's a 1280 by 800 resolution IPS
display and I have to say the viewing
angles are quite good and the text and
color reproduction is is nice as well
all in all it is a pretty nice device
for 200 bucks the hardware feels really
well-made it's not too plasticky not
that cheap feeling it's got a cool
rubbery soft touch back that is kind of
feels like leather it's almost like a
cross between leather and rubber in your
hands but it's got a good feeling it
doesn't smudge up too badly and it
generally feels like a nice weight and
thickness in your hands and and frankly
I like the 7 inch form factor I feel
like it's a really comfortable size for
a tablet in some ways it's a lot more
comfortable than the iPad especially for
things like reading books or magazines
and even in doing things like watching
movies on a plane the tablet runs
jellybean which is the newest version of
Android that's Android 4.1 it's the
successor to Ice Cream Sandwich and
there aren't a ton of huge new things in
jellybean but they've refined a lot of
what was going on in Ice Cream Sandwich
there are some minor graphic changes
noting that most users will notice from
one version to the other they've done
something that they call project butter
to make scrolling smoother and more
consistent on the device and scrolling
definitely feels smooth and consistent
on on the Nexus 7 though there have been
times when I'm scrolling quickly through
a list and it it kind of snaps back from
my scrolling it's not doing it right now
just did it right there it happens very
rarely I think it's because of the
increased sensitivity
it's not something most users are gonna
notice we bothered by but it is
something that I took note of app drawer
in which a drawer exactly like what we
saw in Ice Cream Sandwich but there have
been significant changes in other places
in particular notifications are way
upgraded they're using a different font
it's they're a little bit clearer a
little bit cleaner and some
notifications can be expanded and you
can actually take action on them for
instance you can share an image right
from your device to Google+ or other
services right from the notification
without having to go into the app it's a
really cool useful new feature of
jellybean but sometimes you want your
notifications to just be collapsed and
you actually need to use a two-finger
swipe to collapse them so it would be
great if there was an option to say keep
all of my notifications collapsed unless
I otherwise specify but they have not
included that here google has also made
a really big change to the way it's
doing search on jellybean and this goes
across all of its devices that will get
jellybean first off its got a almost
Siri like voice search functionality now
that is a lot smarter about finding the
kinds of things that you need to find
let's give it a whirl here sushi
restaurants near me so not only pulls up
a sushi restaurant nearby but it also
gives me directions to that restaurant
and it's actually got this little
countdown timer if you don't take any
action on that item it'll jump you right
into directions and here you can
actually see a taste of the new maps it
has these nice tablet centric overlays
which are really helpful but the new
search service which Google is calling
Google now isn't about just competing
with Siri in fact it does a lot of stuff
that Siri doesn't do and can't do in
some ways it predicts what you're going
to do and will give you notifications
about that stuff so for instance if you
commute every day it will know when your
commute is happening and will tell you
if when you get on your commute there
are problems on the road it'll reroute
you and give you different directions to
get around that issue it will also tell
you if you're waiting for a train for
instance that the
train has been delayed or when the train
is coming it will tell you whether when
you get to a new area and if you're
looking at a flight for instance I
booked a flight I'm leaving tonight on a
red-eye let's take a quick look at that
Virgin America to New York flight 30
Virgin America 30 from San Francisco to
New York is on time and departs in seven
hours 54 minutes Google says the service
learns your habits over time it's
obviously using your search data to
compile some of this information so to
me this is a really kind of a long-term
test you don't get the sense of what its
gonna do in one or two days and for me
especially since I'm not at home and not
going through my standard routine right
now I'm not getting an impression of
what it'll be like to live with so I
think we're gonna have more on Google
now as time goes on but it's a very
intriguing very interesting service and
it's worth noting that the voice
recognition and the voice response in
Google now is really impressive I mean
it sounds better than Siri and it
doesn't match series functionality
one-to-one but it definitely gets close
in a lot of areas and I'm actually
really impressed with it Google
obviously sees the Nexus 7 as a content
consumption device and they've beefed up
some of their play offerings in
accordance with that they've added play
magazines so you can now download
magazine content it works pretty well
although I have to say the selection
isn't quite up to snuff for me
they don't have Us Weekly which I took
as a real problem and you see here that
it actually does some rendering which
when you're flipping through pages
quickly it can sometimes take a little
while to render but the offering is very
similar to what the Nook does and very
similar to what the Fire doesn't in fact
you can go into a mode here where you
could just read the text of an article
or a section as you would maybe an
e-book which makes it a bit easier to
take in some of this content I will say
though in general the performance in the
magazine app feels a lot snappier than
both the fire and the Nook in terms of a
one to one comparison I'd say the Nexus
7 is definitely superior to either of
those options google has also added TV
offerings to its video selection so you
can now download or stream an episode of
a TV show or
an entire season they've got a new
interface for the play app which is a
little bit easier to navigate here's an
episode of falling skies I've been
meaning to watch this show and the HD
playback on the Nexus 7 looks really
good I actually had to download this
episode because I was trying to stream
it over an LTE connection here in the
room and streaming HD did not work out
that well for me
we actually had some issues with
streaming on the queue as well and I
don't know if if Google is having
trouble with streaming HD content which
would be odd since they make YouTube but
we definitely seen a few issues here and
there so I would recommend if you're
planning on taking this thing on the
road and you're planning on tethering
that you download the content you want
at home before you get going so one of
the things that still a persistent issue
for Google tablets though is a little
less pronounced on this device is the
fact that there really aren't a lot of
tablet apps for Android right now and I
mean apps that are truly customized for
a tablet experience you've got some that
actually seem okay something like pocket
for instance feels like it's been
customized for a tablet but I did notice
some weird errors for instance when I
change orientation it is not
reformatting the way you would expect it
to for a tablet experience in general
though it does have a pretty good
experience but then you've got other
apps like Twitter that are clearly still
just for phones what I will say is that
between a 4.7 inch Galaxy Nexus and a
7-inch Nexus 7 the difference is not
that huge
and in fact Twitter is a pretty passable
experience on a 7-inch display however
when you look at it compared to the iPad
Twitter experience there's no
competition the iPad blows it out of the
water that said there are some great
tablet experiences here in particular
Google+ as a tablet experience is
excellent and you can see that that
google has really put a lot of time and
love into making this pleasurable
experience there are also some great
games like shadow gun for instance that
look fantastic and play really well on
the Nexus 7 we've tested it for a bunch
of different devices but I have to say
it looks really great on the Nexus 7 and
because it's been optimized for Tegra
you see a lot of graphic detail that
you're not going to
nann Tegra devices so one of the other
great new aspects of jellybean is that
chrome is now the standard browser it's
out of beta and as you might expect the
experience is really pretty good
scrolling is decent I did notice a
little bit of hiccuping particularly on
the verge though we have quite a heavy
site and general performance is really
fast and snappy and sites loaded pretty
quickly take a look at the New York
Times here everybody's favorite site to
visit and I mean you can see here oh
that's cute a nexus 7 ad but you can see
here that it loads really well scrolling
works well and text renders really
nicely and really quickly Chrome on the
Nexus 7 is really great because it
actually feels even closer to the
desktop experience you get a proper tab
bar and it just works really well it
feels really natural and it's a huge
improvement they've just released Chrome
for iOS and we'll have to see
side-by-side which one is the better
performer but my guess is that you've
got a much more customized experience on
something like the Nexus 7 or the Galaxy
Nexus in all the Nexus 7 is an
incredible tablet for this price point
and in fact it's a pretty incredible
tablet for any price point the hardware
is really nice it feels good in your
hand the screen looks good
apps perform a really snappy way and
jellybean is a really good operating
system I mean Android has truly come
into its own from a design standpoint
and from a usability standpoint I think
it's a really enjoyable experience if I
had to recommend what $200 tablet you
should buy I honestly would say the
Nexus 7 right now I mean this isn't just
a competitor to the fire this is a
full-featured tablet with a great
version of Android on it and I think
huge possibility if developers really
start looking at Google tablets and
saying we want to do something with this
platform but for the price of the
hardware you get this is a fantastic
tablet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
