sitting in the porsche carrera concept
car running unix OS and we're going to
take a look at some of the new features
in it i have but my mobile device here
and i have the head unit in my Porsche
so what I'm going to do is actually
slide the phone under here i have an NFC
tag that has some bluetooth pairing
information in it I'm instantly pairing
so i have my bluetooth para i haven't
had to do any searching or listening or
anything like that i am paired with the
device so I'm gonna use bridge as a
secure link it's a secure links it's my
email it's my calendar I still wanted to
be secure so in this situation i'm going
to select the device and i am going have
to put in a password for the first time
because it's it is personal information
i want to make sure that it is secure
and then obviously we brought in the
feel for the the applications from the
PlayBook in this in this particular
situation we're in parked in a park
situation you can actually view your
email reply to them on all of that type
of stuff but when you're driving you're
not gonna obviously be able to look at
any of this so we're just going to close
it down rather than sending an email to
myself on the CES floor it's going to
take you know an hour for that message
to actually come across I'm just going
to mark this as unread and I'm going to
get a notification that I have a new
email
from Jeff in blue subject that thing
wanted to create and justice work with
text messages and BBM is as well yep
yeah so all of the technologies can you
compose a message by voice or absolutely
possible we have both full speech rack
here on the floor it's not going to
happen so the hardware platform itself
is essentially the PlayBook platform but
we've promoted a lot of things like
power and a lot of the control buttons
the hdmi air the USB things have been
remoted out and moved so that we could
actually connect it into the car system
itself so we actually remove the the
head unit which was is a cubic system as
well and we've connected it to the most
amplifier that's here so that you're
actually getting that rich sound
speaking of which sound I'll go into the
multimedia player so what we've done
here is actually a true multi-node
multimedia player where I can see the
center console as well as the left and
rear seat entertainment systems so right
now what you're doing is controlling the
center console so if you pick a song
we're playing that song so the really
cool thing actually is i can actually
push content and control the rear seat
entertainment systems as well so i'm
going to go to the screen where i can
see the other systems that are running i
can select the left rear seat and
there's a song paws on it and that left
our seats playing that song right now
who's that playing through the headphone
jack and the playbooks in the back no
it's using the speakers on the playbook
but you could use a headphone jack yeah
okay yeah so I'm just going to pause it
it'll stop back there go back to the my
center console pause this another thing
that I can actually do is pull content
so I'm controlling the center console
but maybe I want to pull content from
one of the rear seat entertainment
systems yeah
yeah artist no artists yeah and then
just pick a song afro jail so that's
coming from the playbook behind me I'm
pulling the content from that over and
above what we what we've done in the
head unit is we also pulled out the
analog instrument cluster and the analog
chronometer and put cubic systems in
place so we have a fully digital
instrument cluster fully digital
chronometer as well the really cool
thing is all of the systems are actually
tied into one another so i can actually
see what's going on on the instrument
let's go from the head unit i can
control the cluster through voice i'll
try and do it on the show floor just to
just to get a rough idea i'm gonna have
to lean in front to see if I can pick it
up but cluster demo mode so that's race
mode there where this where we actually
have a picture of a track and it
actually follows the track based on the
speed that you're getting in the gps
location it would you teach me it would
use GPS yeah right here it's not going
to do much but but yeah yep so another
really cool thing at the front of the
car is actually doing super high def
stereo telephony phone calls there in
the sound booth behind us so Phil can
you give us a rundown of the
technologies just the 32nd overview sure
so what you're actually listening to
acted a little bit so if I actually
don't talk you write down in the center
right now so you probably hear any food
of those speakers but if I move over
here you can i'll be very coming out one
side don't remember it might coming out
the left or right over this you're
coming up to the passenger side
passenger side oh yeah i'm going over
here to the driver's side hi so even yes
so now i'm back in the center so you can
imagine if you're talking to a group of
people and there's a lot of
conversations going on you can you can
help to disambiguate the different
talkers
through this particular head unit is
that this interface is GL it's also feel
ya so we've built on the PlayBook the
PlayBook platform and we put an
automotive look and feel as well as the
technologies required by the
manufacturers are using this already or
will be using this so I mean where's
we're one of the single largest shipping
real-time operating systems and the info
made infotainment telematics industry um
all of the major OEMs we talked to I'm
not sure who I can say actually good and
then this is car 1.5 and then there's
another platform so cars you critics car
2 point 0 is our html5 full reference
design this is a pure concept car to
talk about the thing that the art of the
possible I think you do with the phone
multi-node instrument clusters with it
with with UNIX car to its a full html5
with the ability to use GL and all these
other things other types of graphics
technologies to really make a really
rich look and feel just like this but
using html5 as the the application
framework and the ability to scale as
far as applications are concerned well
thank you very much I'm going to drive
off in this I oh I thought you the door
as long as long as I can come with you
I'm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
