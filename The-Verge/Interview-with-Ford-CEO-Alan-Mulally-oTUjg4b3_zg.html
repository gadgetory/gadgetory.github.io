earlier this year we had a chance to
talk to Alan Mulally the CEO of Ford at
CES and afterwards he had a lot of
really fascinating stuff to say that we
didn't get in that short interview so
he's here in New York and we've got
another chance to sit down with him and
talk about where he sees technology
going so check it out Alan thanks so
much for joining us
glad to be then we got you for a second
time which is a magical and I want to
talk about you a little bit before we
talked about the company and what you
guys are doing you you began your career
as an engineer you worked at Boeing and
you worked on cockpits so how does it
how does a guy go from an engineer
Boeing working you know getting in your
hands dirty doing real design work - CEO
of four how does that happen well you're
absolutely right Josh why my dream was
to work for Boeing and design commercial
airplanes and I had a chance to
contribute to all the airplanes 727 to
737 the 747 I love going through these
slowly 75 seven seven six seven I had to
work on that triple seven and I had the
opportunity to serve as the engineer in
charge of triple seven and in the 787
and it was so neat because what I really
found my love was the fact that the
airplanes got people together around the
world and we found you'd find out that
people are more the same than different
and we worked together for good of all
of us so I thought I was going to maybe
had one more airplane that was in
contribute to that would be a
replacement to the 737 and then I got a
call from Bill Ford and bill explained
the situation that Ford he explained
that he needed and wanted help and what
I consider coming and I thought about it
and we discussed it as a family we
decided to come and in the end Joshua I
felt like I was being asked to serve a
second American in global icon and it
was important for manufacturing it was
important for the United States of
America for the economy for energy
independence and security and
sustainability so I decided to come and
to your question people were very
concerned at the first about what didn't
mean you know for an airplane guy to be
coming to the automobile industry and
right
I think you were going to try to put
wings on it well and it was in trouble
and and one of the early press
conferences one of the journalists raise
your hands that mr. Mullaly with all due
respect you know the car business is
very very sophisticated starting with
the products and so what does this mean
you don't know cars and I said well I
sure agree with that cars are very
sophisticated the aerodynamics the
integrated electronics the materials the
systems integration the quality of fuel
efficiency safety very sophisticated and
matter of fact a novel has nearly 10,000
parts I just might point out that the
triple seven has four million parts and
it actually stays in the air and after
that I never got another question
Borya challenge your engineering job
well I think it's odd that someone would
ask I mean a plane is massively complex
I mean you got to get them off the
ground you don't have to worry about
that with cars because cars you want to
keep them on the ground is your goal so
you went from this career being very
involved in the in the minutiae of the
technical minutiae into overseeing this
this business and does that inform how
you approach it I mean the guy scum in
your office with a design and do you
start to say well you know what this
thing should actually turn this way and
maybe we I mean are you hands-on now do
you get into the engineering suffered
you you try to let let them do their
thing
well I would consider myself I think
Joshua as hands-on but I've come at it a
little bit differently than the way you
described it because the similarities
between commercial airplanes and
automobiles are striking you need have a
point of view about the future whether
the customers really want what do they
really value you know how do you bring
those to the market in an effective way
and so maybe the neatest thing that I
got I got a chance to contribute to when
I came to Ford was what is our point of
view about the future of Transportation
what a customers really want what do
they really value and we ended up with
really five main attributes that
worldwide the customers really really
care about one is quality
the second is fuel efficiency in low co2
the third is safety the next one is
smart design like sync and MyFord where
you can be connected
in a wired world and of course the last
one is the very best value
did you put is this an engineer's cap
thinking we've got identified the
problems and just get right down to it I
mean it sounds like you had to take a
look at all these a wide variety of asks
and say well we've got to find a way to
quantify that you got to find a way to
talk about okay now let's talk about
that that's a really good point Joshua
because Ford before I came it was okay
to be just competitive I mean they make
competitive cars they were good but
there's not a brand promise or a
commitment to be best in class and to
your point you can measure everything
versus a competition right and you're
either best in class or you're not and
so we made a commitment as a team that
every vehicle from a fiesta all the way
up to an f-150 every time you want you
got that from 40 it would be best in
class in those four characteristics and
then that data sets you free you know
exactly what the competition is doing
and and now you can count on getting the
best in class from the board so what was
the first thing that you did it forward
that you thought that what was the first
car the first product I rolled off the
line that you thought this is the thing
that we've got to do all the time now
was there you know what's your first
most you know the thing that you were
most sure about well a couple of them
that first one is so was so interesting
because it was the new Taurus as you
know when when we were designing the
triple 7 at Boeing Ford was designing
the torus as I know as of course in the
tourist asset that Taurus was you know
eight years the number one vehicle the
United States we made seven million tour
I right and we made this a referral of a
cure all right and so when I I knew
about it because Don Peterson was the
chairman of Ford but he's on the Boeing
board so when I was leaving the design
after time triple7 he told me about the
Taurus he invited so would you like to
meet him I invited him to see how we
compared the technology the process is
the working what year is this this is
1981 ounces and sack back so I met all
of them and they were fantastic and the
talented people and making a great
product and so when I got the call from
Bill I thought you know I'm just going
home I know all about it
so I arrived I want to see all the
products they line them all up and I'm
walking down reviewing them and there's
no tourists I said you guys where did
the tourists go I mean this is the most
popular cars with what ever had they
said well we made a couple look like a
football I didn't sell very well so we
stopped it I said this was one of the
most fantastic brands in the world I
said so what do you want us to do and I
said well how long does it take to make
a new tourist and I said maybe four
years I said let's make the very best
tauros ever and let's do it in two years
and so the new tourists that you see now
is that design but the most important
thing for the Ford team was that we're
going to have this consistency of
purpose we're going to keep those name
plates and every year we are going to
improve them so the customer knew
exactly what to expect from forth so the
tourist is your that's the star the
first one of your Ford so let's talk a
little about the future we're talking
about the past but I want to talk about
where the present in the future you're
obviously investing in electric this is
the trend now right everybody's making
hybrids or electric vehicles you've got
you get a smattering is electric the is
it the real thing or is it the
in-between thing for us right now
because what we're going to talk about
internal combustion because I know you
have some strong thoughts on that but
electric isn't where we're going to stay
is it that doesn't seem like the place
that we're all moving towards as an
endgame is it what do you think I think
Joshua is going to be both and even more
there is such an opportunity to improve
the internal combustion engine today
whether it's petrol or where there's
diesel and you really believe it you
said that last time we talked and I did
a little I'm going to challenge you just
a tiny bit I did a little research and
on average we were looking at some stats
and passenger cars get about 10 miles
more per gallon now than they did in
1980 today so we've gained on average 10
10 miles per gallon that doesn't seem
like in 30 years like we've gone that
far with internal well let's talk people
just fall asleep for the last you know
25 years I mean I'm curious let's talk
about this a little bit more do you
remember in 1975 we had the oil embargo
and we're all on born yet I'm sorry but
I read about I heard read but that isn't
yes I think it's well documented
something I've heard
yos a real hassle and if the car
companies as people decided that my gosh
you know the most important thing we can
do is increase increase our fuel
efficiency of all our vehicles so we
actually pass laws to have slopes for
improvement of fuel mileage and in since
that time in 1975 we have improved the
fuel mileage of cars by a hundred and
ten percent and by trucks by over
seventy five percent and based on the
enabling technology just you guys are
the industry of the industry as a whole
okay
and Ford right there on the leading edge
of that and back to the internal
combustion engine with just direct fuel
injection and turbo charging we can
prove the fuel mileage by nearly 20% by
reduce the co2 by nearly fifteen percent
so you're going to see a lot of
improvement with a turbo question two
plus that's the most affordable
technology right now to improve right
now to your point we're also making
flexible fuel vehicles whether it's
ethanol or biomass or whether it's
natural gas we'll have those vehicles
also available the reason is that we
know one right now can predict the
endgame on the enabling technology then
after the alternative fuels I think our
electric vehicles okay so you can make
it more affordable
yep can make them more fuel-efficient
you can kind of make the modular in the
way that you make up the quantities that
people want me right because we can move
the production line right so you see if
there's a demand for all hey we need all
electrics in this region or whatever you
sell you can ramp up production on that
it's easier because you've got these
shared pieces exactly okay
so but in a city we're in New York and
we talked about this what we actually
had a dinner and I asked you about this
and I thought your answer was really
interesting we're in it a mega city
right where it's highly congested you
really can't put more cars in the road
we already have too many cars as it is
how does Ford in a world let's say in a
world where we've got a sprawl of cities
like this and that is kind of where
we're moving you look at places like
China and absolutely in other parts of
the world that are starting to really
ramp up this you know I'm more modern
more congested City where does Ford live
there where does Ford fit into that you
know if you can't go by a car well they
can't get a car on the street this is
really important because as you point
out not only the United States but in
the real
high growth countries like in China like
Chongqing we have a tremendous operation
in Chongqing and it's a city of 35
million people yeah and what we believe
is that cities are going to become even
more and more prominent and we need to
be part of rapid transit personal
mobility how do you how do you move
around not necessarily in a separate
vehicle and some of the things that we
found very interesting like in Hong Kong
the business model that they're
developing is that you have one way of
charging you can go from bicycles for
the ferries to the cars to the subways
that the idea is put together a system
where you have your personal mobility
but you can use all the different ways
the ways to move around how Ford plays
in that we're not sure as a business
model yet but we know that we're
absolutely committed to personal
mobility where we start you want to be
there and we want to be there and you
would make you would make mass transit
and that's something that you guys are
working on absolutely and what's really
important is that we we Josh were the
citizens of the world are going to
decide that because you know just like
we have a couple of kids live in New
York City and they love the subway and
they love moving around and to your
point when they want to move outside
then you can time share on cars or you
know lots of ways of moving around so we
really want to help be part of that
solution but the vast majority the world
is it has the freedom to move around on
the highways right well I mean America's
big right not everywhere is like New
York we really could but before coming
to cities and we've seen that they're
kind of starting to gravitate more
towards these you know large cities so
there have to be solutions that go
beyond better sister solutions that
allow us to move our pickup truck that's
obviously absolutely so you talked about
technology roadmap earlier and a
hydrogen so that's what I want to ask
about so if electric is what we're doing
now and you mentioned ethanol I think
and you know some of the biofuels
biofuels which which are there but
they're not the infrastructure isn't
there and it's not like everybody's
decided that's the thing earlier we
talked about hydrogen off-camera we're
talking with hydrogen's tell me what
hydrogen means to you guys as a this is
your business you need to find the
future fuel because look oil is I think
we all agree and they maybe you don't
but it's a finite resource right we
don't
in terms of oil here we got to move to
something else and you think hydrogen's
is that place you think that the only
the long game Josh what it really could
be and remember it wasn't very many
years ago where most of the technical
community believed that hydrogen was
going to be the next answer well you
know clearly you need to generate the
hydrogen clean you need the
infrastructure for the hydrogen you need
a cost-effective batteries to store the
electricity that comes out of a hydrogen
vehicle which also need very cost
effective fuel cells to help generate
the electricity so if you think of the
electric vehicles today what the
hydrogen would add to it is you have a
hydrogen tank on the vehicle you also
have a fuel cell so you take the
hydrogen combine it with platinum water
comes out the tailpipe electricity goes
over the battery you need a very
efficient cost-effective battery so you
need everything you need with
electricity today plus a breakthrough on
the cost and efficiency of that fuel
cell plus the infrastructure now having
said that that combination of the use of
electricity plus if you generate the
hydrogen clean is a very compelling
vision now the cost and economics are
going to determine everything so that's
why we are investing heavily in
cost-effective fuel cells as well as a
cost-effective lighter weight batteries
and then I think the between public and
private partnerships will come what's
needed to develop the hydrogen as a and
the structure is needed so I think it's
very compelling you think we're going to
get there I think it's a real
possibility and what's it would give me
a time frame do you have a vision of it
you guys must be its if you got a
roadmap yep it's further out in like two
ten years twenty at least because what
we really need to do is make the
breakthrough in those components and
that's what we're focused on because
that's what we can contribute to right
all right I got a couple more shouldnít
I know you're very busy schedule my
first question is your view on these are
some big ones so the environment I mean
as an automaker you guys must get more
hell than anybody when it comes to the
environment when it comes to pollution I
mean what is your take on I mean where
do you in in Ford's list of values you
know you've got obviously have to turn a
profit if you want to make cars that
people love and want to go
and by where on the on your you know I'm
sure you've got many other priorities
where on your list of priorities is
helping to preserve or protect our
natural resources the environment I mean
where do you where do you stand on
obviously it's important you're not
going to tell me it's not a priority but
when you're making these decisions how
often is that or is that coming into
play are you always thinking about it
like give me some of the mothers have
behind me well in view you're going to
find this very interesting is that it is
right there at the top of the key
priorities for us as a business I'll
come in a couple different ways remember
when we talked about what's important to
the customers worldwide it quality fuel
efficiency safety and smart design so
right at the top as a reason to buy is
fuel efficiency miles per gallon and low
co2 that's what people care about
remember we've taken a point of view
which I think most people share that we
all are going to pay more for energy
going forward as the whole world grows
so this is really really a high priority
which is why we're investing so much in
this enabling technology roadmap but I
believe in further than that Joshua and
that is the companies that are gonna
that are sustainable they're going to
continue to make products that people
want in value are also going to be the
ones that do it using less resources and
less time so everything about our
operation is continuously improving to
use less water less energy less
materials less changer and we rework so
that we that we make the vehicles that
people want but we use it using less
time and less resources so in a
fundamental way the essence of the
fundamentals of our business is
sustainability I like to even further
than that the one of the things that has
always excited me and I have a passion
for it in automobiles or in cars is that
manufacturing with a big M is part of
the solution to the big issues that you
are describing today economic
development for all of us because if we
don't economically grow we can't provide
the wonderful careers and jobs for
people to grow to is energy independence
and security which we all know is really
important to all of us the third is
environmental sustainability so I would
propose to you that the automobile
industry and Ford in particular
the intersection of those three big
issues are something we are very proud
about because that is the foundation for
us to run a successful business and you
mentioned manufacturing you're talking
about jobs right I mean you're talking
about the way these things are made
nicely I mean talk about the way they're
made both with the materials and the
processes but also the people absolutely
so I mean we've as a technology news
site we've covered a lot of sort of the
outsourcing of the you know the things
that the outsourcing of these jobs to
get the things that we want can we is
manufacturing something that doesn't
happen in America anymore that has
increasingly not happened in America do
you do you think that we can return to
America as a country that's known for
its manufacturing because it seems like
in the last I mean correct me if I'm
wrong but it seems like in the last you
know what 50 25 years at least we're not
known as a place that builds things
we're known as a place that ships jobs
off things built elsewhere you're
absolutely right and to answer your
question I mean that has been the recent
history and answer your question there
is no reason that we can't compete with
the best companies and countries in the
world by designing and making things
that's a decision that we make as a
country and just to give you a little
perspective on Ford the most important
thing again is are you competitive and
remember it wasn't very many years ago
where our cost structure was such where
we couldn't make vehicles in the United
States make them profitably and we were
actually moving them out of the United
States to Mexico to everywhere else well
one of the things that I when the reason
I came to Ford was was to work with all
the stakeholders including the unions
including everybody and what does it
take to create a effective company that
has a cost structure in addition to
great products where we can make them
right here in the United States and what
we have done over the last five years is
I'm just so pleased for all the
stakeholders because we have competitive
wages competitive benefits now because
everybody worked together on it we are
now bringing jobs back in the United
States that the technology roadmap be
described in in Michigan assembly we are
making petrels hybrids plug-in hybrids
and all-electric
United States on smaller vehicles and
making a reasonable return so we we know
we can do that now I'd like to back up
just a little bit on your question to
the other thing is is the United States
competitiveness that means we also have
to have free trade agreements around the
world that makes sense and that's why
you watch this takes such a strong stand
on the South Korea free trade agreement
that we really do open up the markets
around the world cuz we can compete if
we have the markets to serve also that's
why we need to have the the markets
determine the currency and the exchange
rates and not have that set by the
governments and not target different
countries with different products but we
do that and we work our competitiveness
then there's no reason that we can't
compete with the best world and Joshua
or one of the neat things is that when
you look at the research and development
in the United States and around the
world nearly 70 percent of all the
research and development this for the
future for all the products and services
we all want and value are associated
with manufacturing so I think I don't
know of one country ever that's had a
sustained period of prosperity that
didn't have a strong healthy competitive
manufacturing base and you think we can
you think that's going to we can retain
we can we can do it and we are we are
leading by example a show it can be done
we're going to be hiring twelve thousand
new employees or the next couple years
we're bringing work back in the United
States because we're competitive if
we're not competitive the work should go
to somebody else
we are you know we believe in the
marketplace allocating precious
resources but there's no reason that if
we decide to do it and work together
that we can't be competitive but do our
workers that's what I want to know and I
think you're a man in the position to
tell me do our workers have to accept
you know look when you're outsourcing
jobs not you but I mean in general
you're getting cheaper labor you're
getting people who are going to work
harder because they need to desperately
need those jobs and they've never had
them before can do we have to say to
workers in America look this isn't going
to be a picnic you know you're gonna
have to really it's going to be lower
wages it's going to be longer hours is
that the answer no I mean can we create
an addition great American work
environment that I think that you know
that we built this country on and also
compete on the cost of that of that
labor and the cost of
building I thought I think we can have
it we can have it all it doesn't
necessarily mean that we have to have
the lowest wages but we need to be the
most productive and that's where our
school system our ingenuity the enabling
technology everything about it starts
with us with creation right and
innovation and we can and we absolutely
can have a higher wages we can't be way
out of whack we have to be you know
somewhat competitive right but they're
real competitive is are we using our
enabling technology and innovation and
working together to produce products
that people really want and value more
creatively and more effectively than the
competition so what's the biggest
roadblock right now
to you as a as a man in your position
what's the roadblock you look at you
wake up every day and you think if I
just clear this one thing out of the way
we can we can change things well in
Ford's case I think the most important
thing is that we just a laser focus on
the Ford brand promise as we covered
once before remember four had become a
house of brands we had asked Martin and
Jaguar and Land Rover and Volvo and
Mazda and so the consumer didn't know
what Ford stood for well now all those
are gone where the laser focus on that
Ford brand so your roadblock was you
need to define Ford that's into a
consumer execu and you think you've done
that you think you've cleared that robot
oh absolutely we when we started out
five years ago in the United States for
many of our vehicles for the smaller
ones we were a discount brand because we
could make cars affordably right well
now we have closed that gap with
world-class competitors and they now
value the vehicle on the value per
vehicle plus our cost effectiveness as
we're competitive as we've talked about
so again that consistency of purpose and
and that brand promise and the customers
eyes that they know what they can get
from the Ford Motor Company and that
consistency of purpose is the most
important thing that we continue to do
interesting all right final question yes
sir I recently interviewed Neil deGrasse
Tyson who's an astrophysicist and just a
genius basically and we talked about
igniting or reigniting this this kind of
jobs in America
and the idea of innovation in America
and and his thinking is that we need to
we need be back in the days of space
travel and getting out and exploring the
galaxy and thinking about you know and
through the you know we want to go to
Mars when you go beyond Mars we're going
to innovate we're going to create new
technologies and new jobs and it's going
to reignite America's imagination and
what is your what is your take on that
well I have a take on that Joshua so 19
early 1960s I'm in high school well
first of all I agree but I want to tell
you a personal story about why I agree
so much so I'm in high school and
President Kennedy addresses the nation
on TV and he says the nation that we are
going to go to the moon and the reason
is that we're going to learn so much the
technology the innovation that how to do
it the unknown that the new frontiers
but we're going to find so much and
learned so much about ourselves and what
we can do and what we can do by working
together on something that is so big and
so exciting
so I switched from a liberal arts
curriculum to calculus and physics and
in the science classes and I decided
that I I want to be part of that
compelling vision I was so compelling
because it's going to make it was going
to make such a big difference so I
enrolled in the University of Kansas in
aeronautical and astronautical
engineering I joined the United States
Air Force and started flight training to
become an astronaut and everything was
going great and and then some of my
flight tests I found out that there were
shades of grey that I couldn't see and
the first landing on the moon was going
to be a manual landing and you had to be
able to see all the craters and the
shades and so I just didn't have the
right stuff
and at the time you had you had to have
the right stuff to go to the moon and so
they gave me the choice of stayin in the
program and maybe going for a later
flight or I could go you know continue
my studies at the University of Kansas
and of course I was devastated but it's
such a compelling vision and I had lined
my life to support it that I was very
fortunate that my thesis advisor was the
head of aerodynamics of the Boeing
Company and he said Alan eat another
compelling vision associated with really
a big deal things that make a difference
as you could contribute to commercial
airplanes and he was working on some
research work for Boeing he invited me
to join him on the research work he took
me to Seattle and I saw Emerald City
that doors the Boeing factory that 737
and I knew I found my next compelling
vision to help make commercial airplanes
to get people together around the world
and 37 years at Boeing and I had a
chance to contribute everyone and then
Bill Ford calls and another compelling
vision a second American global icon a
person opened up the highways to all
mankind that made life pleasanter you
know more worthwhile meaningful and the
lifestyle we have today so his point is
so important that we all want to make a
difference we all want to want to be
associated with a compelling vision and
use our talents and working together to
do things we can't do by ourselves so I
think he he is making a really really
good point that's incredible I had no
idea we got a basically an astronaut
running for it at this point I mean it's
close but as close as you can get
without actually going right so that's
that's incredible Alan thank you so much
