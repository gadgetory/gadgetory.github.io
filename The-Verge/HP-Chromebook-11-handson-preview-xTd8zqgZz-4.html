and we're here in West Manhattan where
Google has taken over a warehouse and
basically created its own crazy world
where everyone uses Chromebooks and with
that they've announced a new Chromebook
this is the HP Chromebook 11 inch and it
is basically a smaller version of some
of the models you've seen before but
it's designed to be the new accessible
to everybody Chromebook it's 11 inches
the most important thing is it's two
hundred and seventy nine dollars and as
with any 279 dollar laptop there's some
compromises it's made out of plastic
it's still pretty sturdy it's really
light and thin but it's definitely not
as high end is something like the
Chromebook pixel in terms of hardware
it's worth noting that this is a deeply
low-end laptop it has Samsung sexy nose
processor 2 gigs of ram 16 gigs of
storage there's no touchscreen there's
no backlit keyboard this is very much an
entry-level laptop the biggest things
here are the design it comes with its in
white or black and it has these accents
it comes in green blue red and yellow
which are you know the Google colors the
speakers are actually built into this
place around the keyboard here which
looks pretty nice but otherwise it's
just black and white and actually think
the black looks a little better
personally it's a relatively basic
laptop like any Chromebook it's just all
the Chrome OS apps and a browser one
really cool thing is it has a micro USB
charger instead of having a you know
proprietary charger it has just one and
it comes with a long cable that you can
use to charge your phone and your laptop
which is kind of cool otherwise just USB
ports it has these accent colors here on
the bottom it has a full-size keyboard
which they've just barely crammed into
the chassis here and again for the most
part it's really not overly exciting
it's relatively well made but it doesn't
feel as nice as a device like the pixel
which we thought we might see a new
model of today but again this is very
much designed for everyone Google is
talking about how the Samsung Chromebook
is the best selling cheap laptop on
Amazon and has been since the day it
started and this is very much its
successor this is designed to be what's
next it's two hundred and seventy nine
dollars and it's out today there's also
an LTE version coming but HP and Google
haven't announced the pricing for that
for your 279 dollars you also get 100
gigs of google drive storage and the
same free gogo wireless you've always
gotten with Chromebooks it's a pretty
good deal it's all as always not the
best computer you could buy but it's
certainly one of the cheapest and
this is definitely an improvement over
what Samsung made last year</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
