we're in front of the digits ol booth at
CES is showstoppers event and this is
one of the first bluetooth connected in
sold it does a pretty much what you'd
expect which is count your steps count
the calories that you've burned all just
because you're walking on it all day
long and it stinks that to an app that
works on iOS Android and soon windows
they say but the other really
interesting thing is that it can heat
your foot as well and you can set the
temperature in the app you put it up to
whatever temperature you want and once
it reaches that temperature the insoles
battery shuts off and it turns back on
every so often so that it can conserve
battery while maintaining the
appropriate temperatures the better
supposed to last about six to nine hours
with normal use I tried it on its pretty
comfortable it definitely warmed your
foot which is pretty nice when you've
been walking around a convention center
all day long they're also working on a
shoe from a company called blog law
that's going to have this tech baked
into it and it's even going to be able
to warm your foot in additional areas
this only does it along the front but
the shoe is going to be able to do it
along the sides as well the digits olds
can be available starting in February
for two hundred dollars so also working
on a version that doesn't heat your foot
and that's going to be beneath one
hundred dollars maybe around 75 they
said from we're crazy Bluetooth stuff
