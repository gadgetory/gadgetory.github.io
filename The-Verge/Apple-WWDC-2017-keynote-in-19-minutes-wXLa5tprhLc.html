a lot to talk about today and I do mean
a lot we have six important
announcements to share with you this
morning and I'll start with tvol we're
really thrilled to announce that Amazon
is coming to the TV app and Apple and
all Apple TVs later this year with
Amazon Prime video number two let's talk
about Apple watch
so watch os is moving forward really
quickly and I'm very excited to
introduce watch OS for today this is the
new Siri watch bed now it automatically
displays the information that's most
relevant to you I think it also access
Siri just by tapping and the new
complication on the top left and it
automatically displays this information
with the same type of intelligence we've
applied on iOS we're using machine
learning to adapt automatically based on
your routines and the apps that you use
when you use them now sometimes you
might like kind of less information and
more graphics and that's the soul of the
new kaleidoscope face it displays a
beautiful symmetrical pattern it slowly
changes throughout the day and you can
rotate the crown you get this kind of
trippy effect whenever you want now
Mickey and Minnie have been a big hit on
Apple watch and more characters have
been working to find their way in and
I'm really excited to welcome woody and
Jessie and Buzz watching West for
activity notifications are more
personalized to you they'll get closure
rings more often we're also introducing
monthly challenges these challenges are
designed to help you either beat or
repeat something that you accomplished
or came close to doing and they're all
achievable because they're based on your
real history now we've also enhanced the
workout app to be even easier to use and
more powerful starting with the new UI
we're quick starts right up front you
can just tap and go it's much easier
we're enabling for the first time to a
data exchange in real time with gym
equipment now this is being supported by
the largest G manufacturers in the world
we provide about 80% of equipment in
gyms today and Apple watch enabled
equipment we'll be rolling out starting
this fall with the new music app are
going to automatically sync music to you
based on what you love to listen to
so you can easily play your music now
and we support multiple playlists and
music on the watch now there's a lot
more coming and watch us for including
for example and you flashlight in the
control center which you can also use as
a blinking safety light when you're
doing an evening run and we're also now
supporting native core Bluetooth on the
watch
so for example continuous glucose
monitoring directly from Dexcom sensor
to your watch Developer Preview is
available today you can get going and
there's a free upgrade for everyone
across all watches this fall now let's
talk about a product that in many ways
the heart and soul the battles of course
I'm talking about the Mac my privilege
to announce for you today Mac OS hi
Sierra now you know sometimes you go to
read an article and instead of finding
something to read you get this just some
loud audio and video that auto plays and
disrupt your whole reading vibe well now
don't worry about it because we have
auto play blocking and Safari now if you
ever had this experience where you go to
buy something on the web you even
complete the purchase and it seems like
everywhere you go on the web it just
follows you around it kind of feels like
you're being tracked and that's because
you are no longer because Safari has
intelligent tracking prevention search
in mail is now using spotlight to
identify your top hit so the message
you're looking for is almost always
right there at the top and if you're
into using mail and full screen well now
we support split view for your compose
window it's a great way compose mail
photos has some great new organization
and editing tools there's a persistent
sidebar and a new view that has all your
imports in chronological order and
you've also improved faces it recognizes
far more faces automatically using
advanced convolutional neural networks
and when you put effort into
categorizing and naming people well
that's now synchronized automatically
across all your devices now we also have
some great enhancement
editing inside of photos you can see
here on the right-hand side all of your
editing tools are right in there a bunch
of great new ones if you like to do
edits in a pro tool like Pixelmator or
photoshop well now when you punch out to
that other editing tool all of your
edits automatically synchronize right
back to your photo library so I'm
pleased to announce that we're bringing
the Apple file system to Mac OS as our
new default we're really doubling down
on our focus on Pro content creation and
that's increasingly about VR content
creation and so we're bringing metal for
VR to high sierra we're optimizing our
pro apps like Final Cut for doing things
like editing spiracle video right inside
the VR environment also working with
valve they're bringing the scene VR SDK
to the Mac and we work with unity and
unreal bring their engines for VR to the
map now Mac OS hi Sierra is available
for all of you today as the developer
beta and if you sign up at beta Apple
comm we'll also have a public beta
available later at this month
and of course it's shipping to everyone
as a free upgrade this fall on all
systems that support Sierra now the iMac
has been the gold standard of desktops
for many years but we're going to raise
the bar once again so we'll start with
the CPU because the whole line is moving
to Intel 7th generation Core processor
also known as cable 8 so the 21.5 inch
systems can now be configured with up to
32 gigs of memory and the 27-inch can go
all the way up to 64 gigabytes of memory
so we're going to now make our fusion
drive standards on all 27 inch config
and it's also going to be standard on
the high-end 21.5 inch config as well in
addition our SSD options are going to be
up to 50 percent faster and now
available up to 2 terabytes and the IMX
are getting an i/o upgrade as well
because we're giving them two USB C
connectors which support Thunderbolt 3
we're going to bring even more value to
the iMac product line for the first time
ever we're going to have a 4k iMac that
starts at just $12.99
but the updates don't stop with just the
iMac because we're refreshing our
notebooks today as well because we're
moving to KB Lake here as well and we're
bringing faster SSD to our MacBook and
faster standard graphics to the 15-inch
MacBook Pro but just like the iMac we're
going to bring more value here as well
because we're going to have a new
configuration of the 13-inch MacBook Pro
that also starts at just $12.99 so that
is the new iMac Pro now the first thing
you'll notice the features the same
great design as their 27-inch iMac but
it's in the seriously badass face grapes
in it so we're going to offer it with up
to 18 core so the iMac pro is going to
use AMD's Radeon Vega graphics this is
their brand new workstation class
graphics architecture it's going to be
available with up to 16 gigabytes of
vram and over 400 gigabytes per second
of memory bandwidth but we didn't want
to stop there either
so we're going to let you configure it
with up to 128 gigabytes of ECC memory
that's twice what you can do in a
standard 27-inch iMac now the eye micro
is also going to a full complement of
high performance IO including four
Thunderbolt three ports and for the
first time ever in any Mac built in 10
Gigabit Ethernet well this is a starting
configuration of the iMac pro and we're
going to price it at just $49.99 and
it's going to be available in December
hello again let's talk about iOS 11
we're going to start with messages with
your eye messages in iCloud when you
sign in to another new device well all
of your conversations are automatically
synchronized Apple pay for
person-to-person payments now it's super
simple because it's integrated right in
to messages as an iMessage app so next
let's turn to Siri we've used deep
learning now to create a really natural
expressive voice for Syrian I'd like you
to hear it here's the forecast for the
next gen age son
and three different ways to say sunny
very powerful now Siri also has a new
capability just translation so you can
now ask something like how do you say
one of the most popular dishes in your
restaurant in Chinese and Siri can say
even thanking you not here's how
official when you're totally an iOS 11
Siri uses on device learning to
understand more about topics of interest
to us so it can actually suggest topics
we might be interested in learning about
in news and what Siri learns about you
on device is now kept synced across all
of your devices so you're dealing with
one theory but of course this is kept
completely private readable only by you
and your devices with the iPhone 7 plus
we love taking these beautiful portrait
photos and now with iOS 11 we can take
in low-light photographs using optical
image stabilization true tone flash HDR
delivers incredible image quality and
we're taking the depth information that
we can capture with two cameras and
exposing it to developers with a new
depth API which has allowed them to do
incredibly fun and artistic photos like
this using using the depth API so these
are some of the big features in iOS 11
there's one other which is a major
redesign to control center and what
you'll notice this control center is now
a single page packed all the features
into a single page but it provides
greater depth because with 3d touch
three touching on slider like this and
get access to more controls when you
install iOS 11 we're going to use
bluetooth to understand if you're
connected to a car even if you don't
have bluetooth we're going to use Wi-Fi
Doppler effect to measure that you're
moving in a car and when you finish that
first drive we're going to suggest hey
how about we activate do not disturb
while driving and when we do instead of
seeing all those notifications we have
this new user interface for you
you'll now be able to configure your
speakers inside of home kit and access
them via our new airplay to protocol it
builds multi-room audio in throughout
iOS next like to turn to a our and we
have a new core technology called
AR kit to bring it to all of you what we
see here is an iPhone that's look using
its camera but using the computer vision
it's actually able to identify surfaces
such as this table and I can actually
just add an object this is a developer
application a test application that
you'll all be getting code for that
allows you to do these things now this
is a virtual object on this table now
get them some steam in there coming off
the cup now I can add other objects to
the scene and these things can actually
interact let's add a lamp and I want you
to watch when I turn the lamp off on the
dynamic shadows here I'm going to move
the cup and watch how the shadow moves
in relationship to the light here it's
really pretty incredible this the new
iPad pro it's the first iPad pro with a
larger ten and a half inch Retina
display it's the perfect size to allow
us to display a full-size on-screen
keyboard it's also the perfect size to
allow us have a full-size smart keyboard
as well
now iPad pro has always had the best
displays in the industry and both sizes
are going to get really incredible new
displays today they're packed with
incredible features like true tone for
automatic white balance p3 wide color
gamut for the best color ultra low
reflectivity the best in the industry
and they're 50% brighter with 600 nips
and this extra brightness and the p3
wide color gamut means that with iOS 11
you'll be able to display HDR video for
the first time in an iPad for a really
immersive cinematic experience they're
truly awesome displays now typically up
until today mobile displays have
refreshed at 60 Hertz means they update
their content 60 times every second
while on the new iPad pro we've doubled
that maximum refresh rate to an
incredible 120 Hertz now the higher
refresh rate also means that it works
even better with the Apple pencil it's
more responsive and it reduces our
latency to an industry best 20
millisecond inside them they're powered
by the a 10x fusion chip the a 10x has a
six core CPU three high performance
quartz three high efficiency quartz all
automatically managed by the Apple
performance controller it also has a 12
core GPU this is a powerhouse and it
delivers 30% faster CPU performance
overall already industry-leading a9f and
40% faster graphics performance and
what's also cool is despite all this
performs two new iPad pro still delivers
the same all-day 10 hour battery life
their iPad users love the new iPad pro
features the latest camera system from
our hi Phone 7 that means the same high
performance 12 megapixel sensor with
optical image stabilization and the 10
and a half inch with 64 gigs will now be
at 6:49 and it's just $150 more to move
up to the bigger display at $7.99 so
this is the new iPad pro you can order
them today they'll start shipping next
week we are taking iOS to the next level
this is the largest iOS release for iPad
we've ever done now it starts with the
dock and we all know that dock hovering
down there at the bottom of the screen
it is more powerful than ever you can
fill it with apps on the right there's a
predictive area figures out what you're
going to use next including your
continuity apps and now you can summon
the dock from anywhere right from the
bottom of the screen and use it for
switching apps just like that and what's
incredible is how it's used for
multitasking so now if you're in an app
and you swipe up we can pull an app out
just like that into slide over and so
we're so excited to bring drag and drop
to iPad you can drag images you can drag
text you can drag URLs you can
multi-select and multi hand drag it's a
drag fest you can now flick on keys to
access punctuation and numbers all
without switching claims it's super fast
and super easy
now we have a new app to introduce to
you today and it's called files files
brings together all your files on your
iPad it supports everything you'd expect
nested folders spring loading list view
favorites search tags and it has this
beautiful recent view that pulls it all
together across all your sources because
it supports not only iCloud
it also supports third-party storage
providers like box Dropbox onedrive and
Google Drive next I want to talk about
Apple pencil because Apple pencil has
really created a whole new way of
working on iPad now it starts with
markup because you can markup anything
you can quick look now we've also
integrated pencils deeply into notes if
you're working on a note and later
you're at the lock screen you want to
get back just a tap of the pencil the
lock screen and you're right back into
your note and we've made your note
handwritten text searchable so we can
now search handwriting we use deep
learning to recognize what you write and
if you're doing a primarily typed notes
you can now also do inline draw in line
drawings right there now iOS 11 is
available to all of you developers today
if you sign up at Beta Apple comm and
get a beta at the end of the month and
we're making it available as a free
upgrade to everyone in the fall supports
all of these devices we've got one last
thing to talk to you about just like we
did with portable music we want to
reinvent home music it is absolutely
beautiful and we call it home pod the
home pod is just under 7 inches tall
it's covered in a seamless 3d mesh
fabric that has incredible acoustic
properties along the bottom is a 7 array
team formed tweeter pack that's packed
with seven tweeters each with their own
individual driver it has a really big
Walker a 4 inch woofer upward-facing
with a large motor to move a lot of air
and all of this is controlled by an
Apple a8 chip
with an array of six microphones around
the middle so as you talk to it and you
say those magic words
hey theory you see a waveform light up
on top and now can respond to your
commands and help serve up the music you
want to hear and since series built in
there and you can speak to it where the
teams also worked hard to make it a
great and helpful home assistance as
well and because there is a home pod
base the home kid base built into home
pod that means anywhere in the world
once you've set up your first home pod
you control your home kids devices
remotely using the built-in home app on
your iPhone or iPad so we're really
excited to tell you that home pod is
going to be priced for three hundred and
forty nine dollars comes in white and
Space Gray they'll start shipping this
December first in the US UK and
Australia and then next year we'll start
bringing it around the world it's been
an incredible morning I hope everyone
here has a fantastic week thank you
thank you all right
so many great things happening with the
Mac and John I agree that I Mac Pro is
really badass</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
