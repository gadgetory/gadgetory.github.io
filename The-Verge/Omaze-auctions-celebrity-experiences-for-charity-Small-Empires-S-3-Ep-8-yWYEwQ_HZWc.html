two founders walked out of a high-end
charity auction a very rich person had
just paid a tidy sum to nab the night's
top reward the proceeds went to charity
but the founders thought what if we
opened up this auction to everyone not
just a small room of very rich people
how much could we raise that
a maze is basically charity giving meets
Kickstarter they partner with movie
studios or stars and organizations that
they like to give to and offer the
chance for these one-of-a-kind
experiences we've done everything from
have John Legend sing at your wedding to
be in the next Star Wars movie to crush
things in a tank with Arnold
Schwarzenegger but we're we're different
than most companies that do this is then
rather than make these available to one
wealthy person you can donate twenty
five or fifty thousand dollars to have
this experience they make it so that
anybody in the world can donate ten
bucks well Matt and I started this there
wasn't really anything that was taking
talent partners causes and fan bases and
bringing them together as one community
that supports a campaign individual of
giving in the u.s. is a two hundred
forty billion dollar market annually
right now only six percent of that is
online so it's incredibly inefficient we
see that this is a huge opportunity to
really go in there and focus on building
a charitable giving platform and make
fundraising much more fun and easy for a
much larger base of people omae's had a
big idea but they were also having a
hard time convincing investors to back
them traditional charity was well
not-for-profit and that doesn't appeal
to venture capitalists looking to find
the next Facebook we didn't have a model
we really spent two years trading ideas
back and forth to try and come up with
something that could leverage our
passion for storytelling around causes
but have a sustainable revenue stream to
it and could really grow in scale we got
told several times that there would
never be a series a or venture capital
in the charity space that that was
impossible and we were foolish to have
that aspiration what we knew was our
talent with storytelling around caused
content and that if we built a
technology that could ultimately support
that we can pull it together just
through our own hustle the charities
that we've worked with historically the
talent partners that we've worked with
historically and put up these ones on
lifetime experiences we did combat
training with a team of Navy SEALs we
did play a game of risk against
four-star general Anthony Zinni but it
turns out that if you're gonna market
something to the masses when you're
working with a four-star general who
doesn't really have a facebook channel
it becomes difficult they're a
non-traditional startup so getting
awareness I think is you know probably
an issue for them not just amongst their
partners but also amongst
Zoomers one thing that's really really
smart about what they've done is that
the founders have ties the entertainment
community so all of their big moves have
been tied to that we first became aware
of them largely they had a big deal
about Star Wars Episode seven we could
go and be in the movie I think a lot of
people first became aware of them and
what they're doing through that it gives
them a level of visibility that a
regular charity organization on its own
is probably not going to get we did a
Lincoln Park experience and we blasted
that their entire fan base and that made
nearly $100,000 and we're starting to
see that the success was coming then we
did a Breaking Bad experience and that
raised 1.7 million dollars at that point
in time we knew all right there's a
model we can really build off this model
and grow omae's was the first to create
a threeway marketplace for charitable
giving online but so far it has had to
personally engineer almost every
campaign critical to reaching scale is
finding a way to become a software
platform that anyone can tap into for
their own charitable giving no matter
how big or small the opportunity to
democratize these experiences to the
masses has really changed the way that
fundraising is taking place for causes
these last three years we've worked with
over a hundred different charities and
now we're raising anywhere from two to
20 times what they could do through
traditional models our audience is
actually very brought leveraging social
media and cutting-edge technology in the
way that we do obviously appeals very
much to a younger audience but that
notion that like only younger audience
has engaged in social media that's not
the case thing well my mom's a social
media and she like she knows what's
going down people inherently feel more
connected to each other now as a result
they get more it's very impressed with
what they've done I think they've gotten
a lot of people's radars very quickly
with some very very smart strategic
partnerships but long term what's going
to stop somebody else from coming around
offering a better service that can steal
all those partnerships away and have you
know their own version of a maze that
everybody will run to because ultimately
people are coming to a maze for the
experiences not for whatever Oh maze
calm has on their site Oh maze earns
money by taking a percentage of what's
raised in each campaign to defend that
business and avoid being undercut they
need to create a community like
Kickstarter that will thrive from the
network effects of the audience that
gives historically investors have looked
at the philanthropic sector and a much
current way then they looked at the
for-profit sector but those worlds are
merging right now we see this as a huge
opportunity for us to basically be at
the epicenter of that change and provide
tools for anyone out there to raise
money for those causes there's our
self-service platform but we're gonna
make its a school or a charity you can
actually use our experiences to
fundraise for themselves and then
there's other things we can do to
support that marketplace which is build
out high aim high quality merchandise
that is branded with the cause and can
do live events
we're actually mobilizing this community
around giving in and really making an
impact
you know they first started out a lot of
investors didn't think there could be a
non-for-profit related you know stirrup
like this that would actually work or be
worth investing in they did the heavy
lifting of proving that can work and now
it's a question of what is the next
level for them look like and that you
know is still very much unanswered
