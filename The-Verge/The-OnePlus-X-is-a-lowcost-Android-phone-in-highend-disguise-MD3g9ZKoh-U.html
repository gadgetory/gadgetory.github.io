footsteps of Apple Google and Samsung
and really it's a smaller less powerful
version of its flagship smartphone the
oneplus 2 released first in August is
5.5 inches and comes packed to the brim
with the most up to date components the
oneplus X on the other hand is slightly
less powerful but it's supposed to be a
design for a smart phone this is the
oneplus X onyx what really sets it apart
is its design it feels really great in
the hand from the the display to the
glass backplate which is a first for
oneplus all the way just to kind of the
sides and how it feels in your hand is
really great comes with this new slider
on the side where you can go from having
no notifications a mute button to
priority only to having basically all
notifications opening the flood the
oneplus X has a more expensive variation
called the oneplus X ceramic version the
ceramic version they're really touting
as a design first smartphone and they
say they imported zirconia Sam from
Australia to make the ceramic backing
you can tell us a little bit different
than the normal one plus X onyx version
because have a different hue it's a
little bit more reflective and it feels
nicer in the hand it's heavy in material
in a way that only the iPhone 6s really
feels like the oneplus X ceramic version
doesn't offer anything more than the the
Onyx version save for a slightly
different edges the different backplate
but kind of the haft when you hold it
it's really being built as a device that
you'd pay extra for just because it has
a nicer design for the first time the
oneplus X will have expandable storage
it's been a complaint for oneplus
devices in the past and something
they've addressed with this new device
it's a nano SIM slot right here but it
will also take a micro SD card up to 128
gigabytes they're saying you can also
use that extra micro SD slot as another
nano SIM slot meaning if you want to
phone numbers if you're that kind of
person that has two different phone
numbers you can put two different nano
SIM cards in here but most people will
probably want the expandable storage so
that's a good plus if you know you
didn't want to spend a little bit extra
for the 64 gigabyte version of the phone
the oneplus X has a 5-inch
AMOLED display on the component side the
oneplus X comes with a Snapdragon 801
processor and three gigabytes of memory
that puts it slightly lower than the
oneplus 2 which came with a Snapdragon
810 and four gigabytes of RAM but for
most smartphone users it won't matter
that much one big change with the
oneplus X is that the invite system
they're known for it's now going to only
be one month long so after one month
they're going to have certain windows of
time when you can order the phone and
get it immediately
the oneplus x onyx version will be
available in the u.s. starting November
19th for 249 USD the ceramic version is
only going to be available in Europe and
they don't have a release date for that
yet they say before Christmas and it's
going to cost you 379 euros the company
won't yet say whether or not the ceramic
version will be available anywhere else
outside of Europe one of the biggest
questions with oneplus is will it ship
on time the oneplus 2 was delayed for a
few weeks and the invite system has
always been a little wonky it leaves a
lot of consumers angry because they
can't get their hands on the phone and
they wait eagerly for a chance to
preorder it and then they miss that
