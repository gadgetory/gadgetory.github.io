know a lot about oneplus phones you
probably know that they come loaded with
high-end specs and premium build quality
you probably know that they're sold
online for pretty aggressive prices and
you probably also know that they give
the best phones from Samsung Apple and
Google a good run for their money now
what you might not know about is one
pluses newest phone one plus five the
five carries a lot of the same traits as
its predecessor the three key it's got
an all aluminum premium quality build
the fastest processor you can get from
Qualcomm and the most ram you can get
inside a smart phone but it's also got a
couple of new tricks like a new dual
lens camera and it does have a new price
that's a little bit higher than before
let's start with the basics the one plus
five cost four hundred and seventy nine
dollars for the 64 gigabyte model or
five hundred and thirty nine dollars for
the 128 version that's forty to a
hundred dollars more than the three t
and it's priced a lot closer is the
premium flagships from those other
companies that means that the oneplus 5
has to do a little more to stand out it
has the same 5.5 inch 16 by 9
1080p AMOLED display as last year this
way is fine it's bright and sharp and
colorful and you can see it outdoors
which is good but it's not nearly as
impressive as those edge to edge screens
that we see on Samsung's Galaxy s8 or
LG's g6 the design of the 1+5 is more
rounded and curved than the squarish 3t
was and it's going to be instantly
recognizable most people it's basically
a slightly smaller iPhone 7 plus the
dual camera is in the exact same spot as
the iPhones and so are these curved
antenna lines it also has a super-fast
fingerprint scanner right on the front
below the screen but it does have some
unique oneplus touches like this bringer
switch which makes it really easy to
turn the ringer on and off inside the
oneplus 5 has either six-figure bytes or
8 gigabytes of RAM depending on whether
you choose a 64 gigabyte model or the
128 gig version now I've been using the
8 gigabyte model and it's super fast
everything opens really quickly
everything happens very quickly and even
app installs which always seem to take
forever on Android happen really fast on
this phone now I have noticed a little
bit of jelly-like scrolling from time to
time but it's not always apparent and
for most of the time the 1+5 is really
with fast but here's the thing about
being fast it's not always better
the one plus five is faster than the
Galaxy s8 for example because it doesn't
have the s AIDS animations or fluidity
it kind of feels like the one plus five
is running on fast-forward which isn't
always the best experience inside is
also a 3300 milliamp hour battery which
in my experience is enough to last a
full day with medium to heavy use I'm
typically able to get about four hours
of screen time using it which is good
but a little bit better than average not
mind-blowing for software the oneplus 5
runs Android 7.1.1 nougat with one
pluses modifications on top of x1 plus
the software is really light and easy
it's basically like the same thing that
Google ships on the pixel phones and
it's very easy to use and they did add a
couple of things one of them is a new
reading mode which Tunes the screen to a
grayscale and makes it almost look like
you're reading on a Kindle which is
really easy on the eyes if you do a lot
of reading on your phone you're probably
going to appreciate this
so the one plus five is a faster F 1.7
lends a more capable sensor and a new
camera that's right next to it that has
a longer focal distance let's let's you
do a couple of things you can zoom in
closer to your subject or you can do
unique blurring effects like a DSLR
might be able to do but unfortunately
all of that new camera tech doesn't
produce amazing images the 16 megapixel
camera doesn't have optical
stabilization which leads to softer
images in low light and the 20 megapixel
camera with the longer lens has smaller
pixels and not as bright of a lens all
of this adds up to lower quality images
in low light especially compared to what
you can get from an SI a pixel and HTC u
11 or even an iphone to make matters
worse the portrait mode that's supposed
to mimic a DSLR it's more miss than hit
far too often it blurs too aggressively
or doesn't blur all of the areas that a
real camera would most the time it looks
pretty fake then there are other
disappointing things about the oneplus 5
such as its complete lack of water
resistance or if you're in the u.s. the
fact that you still can't use an on
Verizon or Sprint so this is a one plus
five it's faster and better looking than
ever but it's got a failed camera
gimmick and a less attractive price tag
that pricing really makes this calculus
change for just a little bit more you
can get a phone with waterproofing a
better camera and more forward-looking
designs now that isn't to say the 1 plus
5 is a bad phone most people will be
able to look right past its iPhone like
design and mediocre camera and just
enjoy its speed and responsiveness but
it does mean that the 1 plus 5 is a
little less impressive than before
someone really calling me Oh
I'm mid take what's up</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
