the legendary Bill Graham Civic
Auditorium I'd like to get right in and
talk about Apple watch in June just
weeks after launching Apple watch we
previewed our next generation of OS and
it's packed with powerful features we're
adding transit to maps making it easier
to find and use public transportation
with native apps developers can do even
more we've been working with a company
that we greatly admire and that company
is Hermes we're really excited to offer
two new finishes gold and rose gold and
anodized aluminum next up is iPad we
have the biggest news and iPad since the
iPad
this is the iPad pro why twelve point
nine inches okay let me tell you a
little secret about its size if you look
at the width at the iPad pro it is the
same it's the height of the iPad air and
now you have an iPad big enough to run
your full iPad air apps with more room
side-by-side it is faster than 80% of
the portable pcs that show up
shipped in the last 12 months so we're
very excited to tell you about a brand
new accessory just for iPad pro and it's
called the smart Keyboard it's covered
in an apple woven fabric that fabric
creates the cover but also forms the
structure and the feel of those keys but
they look closely there are three new
circles along the side of the iPad pro
this is a brand new connector technology
we call it the smart connector it
carries power and data and connects
magnetically to the smart Keyboard so
when you want to attach to your iPad to
the keyboard you just slide it on it
we're so happy to introduce to you
another brand new accessory specifically
for iPad pro it's called Apple pencil we
full stay tuned
you can press lightly to get a thin
stroke or press harder to get a darker
bolder stroke
the new Apple pencil $99 and the smart
Keyboard 169 we've now moved iPad Mini 2
down to become our entry-level iPad at a
new lower price just 269 above it is the
brand new iPad Mini 4 that we're also
launching today so what's the iPad Mini
4 well simply we've taken the power and
performance of iPad air 2 and built it
into an even smaller mini enclosure I'd
like to talk about an even larger screen
we believe the future of television is
apps today I'm thrilled to show you the
new Apple TV show me something new it
starts with voice and with touch the new
remote has a glass touch surface across
the top that makes it both fluid and
precise to move around you hold down the
Siri button and you ask for something
show me funny TV shows Siri gives you a
list of comedies with Siri it'll search
across multiple content apps and give
you all your viewing options on a single
screen we're introducing a brand new
operating system for your Apple TV
called TV OS it's based on iOS and built
for the living room Apple TV comes in
two models 32 gigabytes of flash storage
4 149 64 gigabytes for 199 and it joins
the existing Apple TV at $69
introducing the iPhone 6s and the iPhone
6s plus these new iPhones are absolutely
beautiful most incredible iPhones we've
ever made this is the brand-new rose
gold aluminum finish the new iPhone 6s
comes in four metal finishes silver gold
Space Gray and the new rose gold 3d
touches a tremendous breakthrough in
interacting with our devices iPhone also
recognizes force enabling new gestures
peek and pop giving you shortcuts to the
things you do frequently let's take a
look now so now I can just apply just a
little bit of pressure like that dive
right in to a message take a quick look
let go I'm right back to where I started
from the phone also spotted that she
sent me a flight number well I can peek
in on that look at that I get details
right on the incoming flight time that's
really convenient Thank You Craig inside
your iPhone it's the fastest chip we've
ever built into a phone the new a9 chip
we've our new hey Siri feature and with
hey Siri whether you're plugged in or
not you can speak to wreckage your
iPhone and ask Siri things like hey Siri
what's it like being you hey Phil hey
Phil hey Phil
we've got a great camera an iPhone 6s
and 6s plus it's a 12 megapixel iSight
camera these were taken in Iceland one
of the things you see as our goal was
fantastic color the skin tones are
really accurate can also take amazing
videos HD videos and now for the first
time in iPhone 4k videos so incredible
to shoot and edit 4k videos directly on
your iPhone along with the iSight camera
we have a new FaceTime camera it's a 5
megapixel FaceTime HD camera so we're
going to use the Retina display to be a
retina flash in fact one that matches
the ambient lighting color and what our
pictures through these magical moments
just frozen in time but what if we could
do something more what if you could
press with 3d touch on your photos and
this happened
it's called live photos so how do you
take a live photo you just take a photo
as you always have
and it's the same beautiful high
resolution now 12 megapixel photo LTE as
LTE advanced so it's twice as fast these
are our most advanced phones ever in
fact the most advanced phones in the
world this look we're very proud to tide
the new iPhone 6's new success plus will
chemin at the exact same places and same
configurations and now this is how our
lineup will look with one other set of
pricing to tell you about for iPhone

carrier it is an unlocked phone it
includes the Apple Care Plus program and
it starts at just $32 a month you can

going to want to run iOS 9 on all of our
devices so I'm very happy to tell you
that it will become available just next
