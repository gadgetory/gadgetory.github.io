companies have had this dream of a
kitchen gadget a thing that you could
use to listen to the radio and talk to
your family and I don't know just play
music with and they've always been kind
of bad but now we've got this thing it's
called the tribute and it does all that
stuff you get hit buttons for the radio
you get hit buttons to call your family
and pop sticks right to your fridge oh
yeah it does one more thing Alexa what's
the weather right now in New York is 67
degrees with mostly sunny skies
tonight's forecast has lots of clouds
with showers with a low of 52 degrees
pretty cool right so this is trimming it
costs $199 and it does all the stuff
that I just said that it did including
talking to Alexa with just your voice
now there's a lot going on with this
thing so let me break it down for you
you set it up with an app on your iPhone
or an Android phone that's how you get
that connected to Wi-Fi and it's how you
set your preset radio stations and your
family so that you can call them and the
app I gotta tell you it's not very good
it's pretty hard to figure out how to
get around and there's just a lot of
poking and guessing and digging for
settings but the nice thing is once you
have the app all set up you kind of
don't need it that much because
everything is right here on this
Bluetooth speaker there's buttons for
radio and you can even set one of the
presets to a Spotify playlist so if I
hit this button it'll just jump into my
Spotify discover weekly similarly I can
hit one of these buttons to call
somebody that's in my family they have
to have the trivia app installed on
their phone to receive a call or make a
call but it works okay now ask for audio
quality when you do either of those
things it's not very good it's certainly
good enough to just have background
music or a quick call or something while
you're cooking but it does not hold a
candle to the audio quality I'll get on
a full Amazon echo or even a Logitech
boom Bluetooth speaker asks for battery
life it's good for eight or ten hours of
listening and it's good about two weeks
of standby unless you leave the Alexa
listening mode on in which case it's
gonna die after just a couple of days so
if you leave this thing stuck to your
fridge you're gonna want to make sure
that you've got some kind of way to plug
it in via this micro USB cable on the
side and speaking of doing echo stuff
this thing can do everything at the
Amazon echo can including telling
incredibly corny jokes Alexa tell me a
joke
what is spider-man's ideal job a web
designer so yeah it works it is a little
bit slower than the echo and the
microphones aren't nearly as good so it
can't hear you from across the room and
I'll also say that if your Wi-Fi isn't
pretty fast and pretty solid this thing
just starts bugging out like crazy
there's one more thing as the Trib you
can do and it is pretty fun if you have
the app on your phone you can use it to
send little messages to the tribbey
and what you do it receives a message on
its e-ink screen and then the beauty
flag pops out it's really cute when you
get the message you can either push the
flag back in and it will send a read
receipt back to the person that sent the
message and you can also use this weird
button on the side to cycle through a
bunch of emoji reactions like frowny
faces and happy faces and whatnot it's
really pretty slow and if you actually
just want to have a conversation with
somebody you should just stick to text
messaging so this is the tribute it does
all the things that the Amazon echo does
and all the things that a Bluetooth
speaker does it just doesn't do any of
those things quite as well as either of
those two devices but if you're willing
to deal with a little bit of hassle here
and there it actually might be worth it
to you if it's not you should definitely
stay tuned because Amazon is letting
anybody put Alexa into their devices so
we're gonna see a lot more stuff just
like this thing really really soon I
definitely cannot do the dance
g√ºlen's I can't do it don't have the
moves not comfortable I'm not
comfortable</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
