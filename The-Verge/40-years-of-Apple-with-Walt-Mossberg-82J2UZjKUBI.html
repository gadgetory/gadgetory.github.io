five
hi I'm Walt Mossberg executive editor of
The Verge and today is the 40th birthday
of what I think is the most influential
technology company of the last 20 years
Apple Inc and let me talk about some of
the Apple products that change not only
Apple but society and the culture the
Apple to the Mac the iPod and the iPhone
so this is one of the many Apple 2
models over that long period that the
Apple 2 was made you'll notice this is
that this was the original Apple logo
which was in six colors people who were
Apple fans just say I believe in six
colors and this is the Apple to see and
to our eyes it looks like it should be a
laptop being kind of a heavy laptop but
a laptop it weighs about seven seven and
a half pounds and it was and it came out
by the way ironically the first year the
same year is the Mac and one of the
things that I think is interesting about
this that I think for tells a lot of
what Apple did was this had no slots but
the Apple we know today where everything
is sealed up I think this might have
been the first indication of it because
there were no slots in this instead they
built in the functions of those cards
and they had ports on the back board and
you know that became common also
particularly in laptops but this member
this is a test up computer for a company
that really pioneered they didn't invent
the computer the personal computer but
they certainly popularized it and the
company that did that their financial
success was I mean they were blown out
of the water by Microsoft in that period
when you think about the computer
product that Apple makes it's the Mac
the Mac was the computer that pioneered
the interface that every computer uses
now which is you know the mouse or
trackpad later and the you know
graphical interface with drop-down menus
and icons of me that nobody thinks twice
about that today but that was so
different when they when they did the
Mac that they was just laughed at I mean
the other computer companies laughed at
it and Microsoft adopted the same
graphical user interface for Windows
about a year and a half after the first
Mac came out but it was more of a more
of a layer on top of what they had
whereas Apple built a whole computer
based around it and I'll tell you what
my favorite Mac is one and it's this
which is much later than 1980 five or
six this is the MacBook Air it's
extremely common lots of people have
them lets people see them every day I
think this is the best laptop ever made
and I think that because not only the
fabulous stickers it has on which are
not standard they're optional but when
Steve Jobs introduced this in 2008 he
got up I was by then a technology
columnist and I was at the event and he
stood up on stage and
took out he carried out one of those
interoffice manila envelopes with the
red string at the top you know and it
didn't look there was nothing didn't
look like was bursting at the seams or
anything strange about it
he just undid the thing and he pulled
your laptop out of the envelope I got a
call or an email from him saying when
are you coming out to the valley next
and I said I think whatever I said a few
weeks or a month he said what do you
think he could come a little sooner I
have something I want to show you and I
said okay and I came a couple weeks
later and and he always put he showed me
a proctor he would always put it under
cloth even though it was only it was
only a few of us in the room and I was
the only one who had never seen it so I
put it under cloth but in fact I used to
tease him about me sage I just like to
do it this way and it was a black cloth
he pulled it off and it was the iPod and
the iPod is what made apple begin to
explode and become the Apple that now on
their 40th anniversary we know as this
highly innovative highly intriguing
hugely influential tech company this did
started that the iPod was a big big deal
culturally and in every other way and
there were people that wanted two things
they wanted a widescreen iPod and they
wanted a phone built into it and Jobs
decided he decided to do both on one
device Maketu it was that he had
engineers who came up with the ten
finger multi-touch thing we have now but
they came up with it in a tablet size so
essentially they started to work briefly
on the iPad before they started work on
the iPhone so I get this phone call from
and he says we're having an event we
haven't announced it yet but we're
having an event I really it would really
be important to me if you came and I
said well when is it and he said he gave
me the Dana said Steve it's in the
middle of CES I've always a point
it's I'll be in Vegas I can't be in San
Francisco you're vetted wall I'm telling
you this is going to be the biggest
thing since the Mac you are going to
want to be there Steve Jobs decided he
was going to introduce the iPhone in the
middle of the Consumer Electronics Show
in January and I remember saying to him
afterward
why did you announce and it blew CES out
of the water the iPhone announcement
blew see yes or no one talked about
anything else in the tech world
everything else it was a NASA CES was
just drowned out and while I certainly
will never forget the many private
conversations I had with him which
included by the way a lot of gossip and
theorizing about things and where things
were going was going on at this company
and why did they do this Apple instead
of this other way and him arguing with
me whatever those were all great but I
but I think you know the irreplaceable
moments are are the ones where he was on
stage doing that stuff this is the
original iPhone that went on sale in
June of 2007 so I did not see this
before it went on stage unlike some
other things but I decided to give these
the three journalists to review and but
they broke was all kinds of restrictions
but you know you were not supposed to be
seen with it and whatever you know so I
was walking from the hotel to the TV
studio and I had this on my ear and I
walked by an 18 t store who knows where
the 18 t stores are in New York or
anywhere else right this was at the
somewhere on the Upper East Side there
was a little 18 t store on the corner
and there was a lordy a line of 50
people because the thing was I think
going on sale that night or something
like that
and as I approached it and I'm talking
my wife people start yelling at me some
of them recognize me and they were
saying Walt come on over here and show
us this thing what do you think of it
can we look at can we hold it you know
and it was like no I just had to cut him
I phone completely changed the mobile
phone industry it completely changed the
carrier industry because Apple had power
before the iPhone the carriers had all
the power if you were a company that
made a phone you had bow to the wishes
of Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T in the United States
or their counterparts in places like
Europe because they would control they
had the bigger brand than you did but
Apple had a bigger brand than the
carrier and Jobs was uncompromising I
would say this about Apple when you take
all this together I think they have been
the most influential company of any kind
of the last 20 years certainly if you
look over their 40-year existence when
you consider that they were the first to
popularize the personal computer and
then they were the first to
commercialize the method by which you
use a personal computer the graphical
user interface and then they went on to
do all these other things they've
probably been the most influential a
company overall although it's especially
the last 20 years the color of it you
look at the back of it I think it's pink
I don't like it but I don't like the
gold gold either I think it's just too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
