that they have an internet of things
wine bottle which sounded like the most
ridiculous thing I had ever heard so now
I have an Internet of Things wine bottle
and five bottles of wine
this is the cuvette it's an
internet-connected wine bottle and one
of the most ridiculous products I have
ever heard of so it's basically this
hollowed-out wine bottle with a
touchscreen on it and you can order wine
for the touchscreen and it comes in
these metal cartridges that can only be
used inside this bottle it's when you
get one you take the cap off and then
you shove it into here and the wine
bottle actually knows what wine you've
put into it
so once the cartridge is in you can just
pour it like normal bottled wine and
then start to drink that making me get
drunk I've only eaten it yogurt today
yeah so that's why as you can scroll
through this and he'll tell you about
the wine this is all pretty excessive
but it's kind of neat I guess you can
also order more wine straight through
here if I hit Add to Cart then I'm
basically rebind exact wine
apparently I have ordered a lot of
German wines and they're gonna cost me
sixty one dollars I can drink like one
glass and then I am done two glasses I
can pretend like I'm good and then
demoing an internet of things wine
bottle on video just no chance this is
like the drunkest I've been in in ever
it works for me would you like someone
so this sounds like a ridiculous product
right now because it's just a wine
bottle that has a screen but there's a
little bit more to it cuvee says that
these bottles will be able to keep your
wine good for up to 30 days at a time
which is a huge deal because one usually
goes bad after like three days or if you
do a lot of work maybe like a week these
more cheeses and the reason they can do
that is because number one this is made
out of metal that's supposed to prevent
oxygen from getting in and spoiling the
wine it's also because of this cap which
doesn't let oxygen either this hit is
basically a labyrinth inside oh there's
just there's like a little that pushes
in that's all the battery died I need to
charge my wine bottle you think I think
I can drink out of it if I push the
thing in there mm-hmm
yeah it works yep over wine on my face
you're not supposed to do that though my
girlfriend's also texted me about
general relativity so it costs a hundred
and seventy nine dollars for the cuvette
bottle the Wi-Fi connected thing but it
comes with four bottles of wine I don't
know how much wine I've had but is too
much I have to say this pairs very
nicely with a cheese it they're working
with twelve vineyards right now they
have a total of 48 wines that you can
buy through this touchscreen they're all
between 15 and 50 dollars with most
being targeted at the 15 to 30 dollar
crowd so this isn't for people who like
super cheap wines it also isn't for
people who like really really expensive
wines which made sense because most
people who like super cheap wines aren't
going to buy a Wi-Fi connection wine
bottle and those people who like really
expensive wines aren't going to want to
be seen drinking out of
if I connected wine cool there was Mosby
another person in this room so I didn't
have to drink to us at once by the way
actually this one is growing on me right
now they're only selling to California
and Massachusetts and they're going to
open up to other states eventually it's
gonna ship in October but it goes on
sale today and they'll open up two more
states once I start shipping and with
that cheers I don't know I probably one
of them is half-empty the others the
others are like maybe a six empty a
sixth empty but we've done that over
four glasses it says four six plus 1/2
which as far as I'm aware this goes down
to two over three plus one over two
I gotta get a common denominator says 2
over 6 it's 3 over 6 so drink like 5/6
of a bottle of wine uh-huh what say you
5/6 of a bottle of wine no no but you
drank one and you drank one so I drank 3
6 which goes down to 1/2 I drank half a
bottle of wine according to these
calculations
done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
