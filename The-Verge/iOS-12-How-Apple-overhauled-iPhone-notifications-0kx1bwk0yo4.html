processor series was about how
notifications than the iPhone are bad
and like I said last week oh my god
I think they might have fixed
notifications in iOS but here's a
question did they now all the caveats at
the top one feeling kind of sick so give
me a little bit of space to have a
terrible raspy voice - this is the
Developer Preview it's not a public beta
it's very very early so we might see
bugs and this is definitely the furthest
thing from a review also last but not
least since this is such an early
preview of iOS 12 it's possible it's
that some things might change between
now and when it comes out in the fall
got all that cool cool cool cool so this
is the big one for me with group
notifications your notifications are you
know grouped and they're grouped
together by default app by app so when
you have a ton of notifications it's
much faster to sort of scroll through
and parse through what is and isn't
important before on iOS 11 your
notifications are just one giant big
unsorted list and honestly it felt like
scrolling through Twitter and if your
operating system feels like Twitter
you're definitely doing something wrong
anyway the reason the group
notifications are interesting is they
don't just group app by app but they can
be grouped within an app so for example
with messages all your different
conversation threads can be different
groups on the lockscreen now this could
be a potential for abuse if I like say a
news app wanted to send you lots of
different groups and you really only
want like the top stories or something
we'll have to see what developers do
with it so this is all incredibly
helpful but I don't know yet if it goes
far enough for me so for example in a
group you can only see the most recent
notification at the top you have to tap
in to see the rest of them and I'd like
to see kind of a summary of everything
that's inside there but whatever you can
swipe a group away all at once and that
is so much better than we had before I'm
just pleased to see that Apple did
something even more important to me is
that now finally when you get a
notification you can jump to edit that
notification settings directly from the
notification itself and this is huge
when you get a notification you can
swipe over and tap the manage button
which
a new panel that Apple calls the quick
tuning UI and there are a few options
here deliver quietly turnoff and
settings basically what these buttons do
is set up a preset group of notification
settings so when you tap deliver quietly
it sets up the following things
it sets the notification to go to your
Notification Center and not the
lockscreen it turns off sound and
vibration and it also turns off banners
if you tap turn off it turns off
notifications but look at that turn off
button you notice that there's a dot dot
on it that's because if you tap it it
brings up another panel and on that
panel there's a button to turn off all
notifications which is probably what you
want to do but some apps will give you
another button that will take you to
that apps in app notification settings
and the reason that's there is like an
app developer is annoying you Apple
wants to give them the option to have
you go into the app and tweak the
settings instead of turning
notifications off altogether here's why
this is a huge upgrade over iOS 11
because before if you got an annoying
notification you had two choices just
swipe it away to get rid of it but then
the next time you send you one you'll be
annoyed again or stop whatever it is
you're doing go into the Settings app
find that app tap into it to change
notification settings or open the app
and see if the app has its own in-app
notification settings it was just a
whole mess that you just never bothered
with and now you finally will we've been
talking about settings a bunch so let's
actually just look at the settings
because they've been completely
redesigned in the last video we talked
about the mystery of the check boxes and
the mystery is still here but it's
slightly less mysterious because they've
got the nice little graphics now that
show you what all these different
buttons means so it's a little bit
easier to figure out now I'm not going
to go through and count them partially
because in the last video I got my math
wrong I don't want you to yell at me in
the comments because I deserved it and
I'm sorry but suffice to say there's
still a ton of options here they're just
easier to understand now one of the more
interesting UI choices and iOS 12 is at
the notification center and the lock
screen are now very different things
notifications could go to one or the
other or even both developers in iOS 12
can now send a notification silently to
the notification center without asking
for your permission which seems
scary but it's actually maybe an
interesting idea because you'll see it
in the notification center there'll be a
button that says I don't want these so
that's pretty easy to get rid of but
it's a better solution Apple thinks for
developers then when you know you first
time you open the app so they're like do
you wanna know vacations you like
notifications we got notifications for
you that's annoying
this seems better but we're gonna to see
it's gonna take some time for me to see
what I think of this new paradigm of
Notification Center lock screen being
completely different because I'm a
little bit worried that Notification
Center is just gonna become a dumping
ground of crap I've ignored and stuff
that people want to send me that I don't
want to bother looking at but it's still
early and we don't know yet alright so
the last big set of features I want to
talk about are all the upgrades to do
not disturb and I really love them and
the best one is that you can now set a
time limit for how long do not disturb
last because I always forget to turn the
dang thing off you could have a golf by
a time you can have it go off by a
location you can even do really clever
things like have it go off by what's in
your Apple calendar here's a neat thing
that happened to me over the weekend
Siri did something good it saw that I
had a movie ticket in my Apple wallet
and then popped up a thing saying hey do
you want to turn on Do Not Disturb
during the length of this movie that's
really smart another thing that's really
neat is the new do not disturb at
bedtime basically you turn it on and it
hides notifications on your lockscreen
which seems like a small thing but then
when you wake up in the morning the
first thing you see is it everything you
missed it's like the weather and that's
nice I like to wake up and just see the
weather that's nice thanks Apple you're
so nice that really seems insincere but
I mean it last but not least there is
this new screen time feature which shows
you how much you use your phone but
there's a lot going on in there and so I
think we're gonna wait until the full
iOS 12 preview to really get into it
I am super happy that Apple is finally
giving us tools to deal with
notifications but I just don't know if
they're the right tools yet or maybe
they're instruments
whatever anyway the point is this is an
early Developer Preview and so it's too
early to review and honestly that's why
I'm not comparing it to Android yet if
you've been waiting for that I want to
wait until these things are a little bit
more developed what I do want to do is
talk about what I think has happened
because I think Apple's philosophy
around notifications has very clearly
changed it's no longer enough to just
try and
it's simple think about all of the
abstract concepts that you have to
understand how to deal with
notifications Notification Center versus
a lock screen and temporary banners
versus persistent banners versus app
badges you need to understand the
difference between the main notification
settings and the in-app notification
settings and I could just keep going
here but what's funny is iOS is supposed
to be simple this doesn't seem very
simple that's the point
notifications are just plain hard and
complicated and that's the way that
they're going to be from now on and
Apple finally had to admit that back at
WWC one of the Apple executives told me
a story about Steve Jobs he said that
Steve used to liken the user interface
to a Pixar movie now Pixar movies appeal
equally to both children and adults and
a good user interface should be simple
enough for novices but complex enough
for pro users and what's new in iOS 12
is we finally have the notification
controls for pro users but notifications
are so crazy right now they're so
prevalent and they're just all
encompassing that you know who the pro
users are honestly I think it's all of
us hey thanks for watching and let me
know in the comments do you think that
Apple did enough to fix notifications in
iOS 12 we'll have a chat there maybe hit
the subscribe button when you've done
all that head over to this other video
where we talk about all the rest of the
features in iOS 12 because really
there's just a ton of them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
