the meadow Sun on my face I look out I
look forth
I want you here
refreshing surprising
Chris smooth bubbly you make me drunk
you make me smile flourish beer sing the
song of beer here here I love you beer
I'm Alexis Ohanian start-up founder and
Y Combinator partner over the last year
I went on a two hundred event book tour
and met people building small empires
all across North America now I'm back
with a new season revisiting some of my
favorite stops for the tour
running a brewery is hard work and at
small scales the margins can be pretty
low but if the beer is good as the size
of the brewery increases efficiencies in
the processes and technologies of play
allow for larger margins and due to
automation a more consistent quality of
product than at a smaller space the
problem is not everybody who's great at
brewing beer is great at running brewery
or even wants to and that keeps great
beer out of your stomach so some
well-equipped breweries like two roads
allow contract Brewers or gypsy Brewers
to program their beer into the system
two roads is kind of like a platform
where you can code beer that way gypsy
Brewers can get their beard out to the
public without having to take on the
capital investment requires to open a
whole brewery Cheers we're here in
Stratford Connecticut not exactly a tech
hub visiting a brewery which might be a
little surprising and so you realize
that to Rhodes Brewing Company is doing
some amazing stuff and not just making
great beer they are but they're also
building a platform so that microbrewers
craft brewers all over the region can I
make amazing professional quality beer
without needing to build all of this
very involving Wow do I get goggles too
safety first all right this is where it
all we're all starts and ends really
this is the control room everything you
see here controls or accesses everything
you see out there so hundreds of
temperature sensors pressure sensors
those switches pumps it's all right here
and we can step through the whole
process from start to finish it's a very
visual system so I should not just
randomly match the keyboard and click on
things I would love it if you didn't
okay all right all right now this is
this is a very interesting brewery
because I mean you all are you're not
brewing your own beer you have other
people's beer that you all brew for them
how does this whole contract brewery
thing work well let me explain first and
foremost we do brew our own beer and
that's that is absolutely our focus here
are two rows of our own brands we
launched our brands and open the brewery
in December of 2012 started with our
brands and then as we got to know the
equipment and got the bugs worked out we
we brought on brewing partners or
contract partners whose be reproduced
for them under license here are two
roads this is my 25th year in craft
brewing
and through a good part of my career OHS
and the other side of that equation
where I was out brewing our beers at
other facilities all right now how much
of this is being controlled by robots
right now this particular process this
whole process is controlled from the
computer yeah then we can trust them to
make our beer here we actually have a
beer in process they do in their beer I
can't even describe it it's like a
whirlpool of beer of hot beer I think
the best way to describe to roaster is
as the next generation of craft brewing
rather than starting off really small
we're starting off fairly big for a
craft beer in the way that we get to do
this is by brewing other people's brands
as well as our own and this gives us the
luxury of starting off really fairly
small and allowing our own brand to grow
organically kind of outwardly from
Connecticut and outward interests and
why don't more breweries use this method
I think most breweries have taken the
the kind of the most obvious path of you
know we're gonna start off small with
equipment that we can afford and then
have a good level of success and then
kind of make the next step to the next
level and then and you know steps as
they go whereas we're kind of the new
guy in craft brewing we can start big
because we know that the demand is there
and will eventually fill that capacity
okay so this is this is where it really
spends most most of its time the work
gets down to this stage we cool it down
to make it the ideal temperature for the
East and fermentation cause East is a
living thing different yeast create
different flavors at different
temperatures and they're all controlled
again through the computer so we can do
specific temperature curves you needed
to make precise adjustments whatever
that's all happening from that main room
we're in just have the computer part of
the job all right South gotta keep
tasting beer yeah folks over two roads
have a pretty awesome brewery and they
brew a pretty awesome beer but we're
here in exotic Williamsburg Brooklyn in
order to meet with an actual gypsy
brewer
his name is yep Bay and he's known for
Brewing beers that were inspired by
things like baby poop and we're gonna
find out what his experience has been
like with two runs I am originally from
Denmark I moved to Brooklyn two and a
half years ago I own evil twin brewing
and I'm the brewer and the in-between
brewing is not a physical brew it's so
called they call it gypsy brewery or
contact early so I rent space from from
other Brewers so what does being a gypsy
Brewer versus a traditional Brewer mean
for the kind of like freedom and
creativity you might have I mean it
means that you know I don't have a big
investment I don't have a lot of money
out for a brewery that I have to make
backs the first year evil swing was
really operating we did about 40
different beers which is a lot but never
start you know I came from a home where
background to it having done a lot of
different beers there was a lot of
things I wanted to test out on a bigger
scale and some of them worked out really
well and we still do the knowledge who
rules at like 300 valve answers but some
of them just didn't work out so we just
never did them again and that's you know
that's definitely a freedom that I like
because again you know I don't have to
make it we'd be able to sell scooter I
don't have to make certain payroll
because it sells good I can do whatever
I want I can make crazy peers you know I
sell one patch and if it sells slow
which is the
given how much craft beer has boomed in
the States in the last couple of decades
and and how there are so many more craft
brewers what does it mean for an upstart
craft brewer to know you know they can
come to two roads they don't have to
build an entire facility they can come
to you all and get that kind of
production that's that's huge and I
think that's why we've got guys beating
a path to our door you know we we
thought that we'd be successful but we
really have exceeded our own
expectations and and that's why we're
growing at the rate that we are at a
sustainable rate but a very fast-paced
growth here I mean we've more than
doubled production every year that I've
been here you know my staff went from
fill our brewmaster and myself to now we
have eight guys and you know we're
looking ahead more so it's it's been a
whirlwind it's been every day's an
adventure in a good way so once the
fermentation is complete we separate the
beer in the separator or the centrifuge
here which literally spins all the
particulate out and this is really
unique in that we have a Hayes reader on
the input and the output so we have the
technology to pretty much dial in the
level
Wow there's like a slider somewhere for
the amount of haze you want you know
so what was it about two roads that made
it so compelling I just realized that
for me to be able to build evil twin as
a brand we had to get bigger and cheaper
production and when I met the tools guys
before we moved we had a meeting with
them even before I moved to the states
and we heard about the setup and what
they were gonna do and we gave them some
recipes and make a bag of fries if you
like holy shit I mean if we can get in a
two rolls and start production here we
can take evil twin to the next level so
that's you know it's pretty simple we
just knew we needed tools and to Rosalee
the people I got they need you know
punch bag fools I wanted to use the
system and it's working out really well
I think we are the biggest customer now
for two ropes and filmer coughs people
to hit the brewmaster is one of my big
heroes you know he wrote the book about
farmhouse ale in the early 2000s and has
been doing a lot of obvious in his early
days that I just you know known for the
best summer best views of amazed you
know I knew they're gonna do good and I
believe in it and we have no back since
I mean it's crazy how fast people now or
how good are you
so the initial thrust was brewing your
own beer and in the back of your head
you
there might be a market for this or when
you first launched two roads was the
thinking gonna be that it also be this
this kind of craft contracting as well
it was from the get-go again to tailor
to roads we knew were gonna do our own
brands and who were gonna do other
brands and what made us different from a
lot of startup craft breweries is that
we wanted to do it once we wanted to
build a big facility that we would never
outgrow and rather grow into it both
with our volumes and our customers
volumes you know although we have a
hundred year old plus facility that
we're housed in our equipment is is
absolutely state-of-the-art what was the
history of this building before you all
moved in
this was the it was called the u.s.
baird corporation it's a company that
existed from the turn of the 19th
century it was a company that made
machinery for bending and forming metals
at its heyday it employed over 500
people around the clock so this thing
this facility has facility it was a big
part of this community it was a big
employer part of the town's identity
walk me through the last few decades of
history here in Stratford all the way up
to the present now with two roads yeah I
mean I'm no history buff but I I know
what I know from growing up here and
it's kind of Strafford as a sleepy
little town lots of potential right on
the water close to major cities and in
the last few years with withdrew roads
now leading the way we've seen a lot of
a lot of growth in town a lot of things
coming back and it really amazes me
every Friday night Saturday night or
even weeknights for that matter in our
tasting room here we get a really really
good crowd could that be an extra
benefit of this craft brewing sort of
revolution now we don't have a Town
Square anymore are these becoming the
new town squares I sure would like to
think so it really is it's a meeting
place for people you know it's we have
our Oktoberfest and we get a couple
thousand people out we
of our race on the Stratford Beach and
it's amazing the turnout that we get for
these events everywhere I go and tons
people are talking about what what two
roads is is doing ahead of time what
what does it mean to you to have this
company based here in Stratford well it
means a lot
three of the four founding partners
there are two roads we're from
Connecticut it's our home state you know
for my childhood I grew up in a town
that was an industrial factory town and
it's no longer what it was when I was
growing up so you know being able to
bring back some of the industrial glory
that you know once was Connecticut still
is Connecticut was was very important to
us so to be back here our home state
brewing beer is is a dream come true for
me so I'm in a very special part of the
to Rhodes brewery right now this is the
vault and I'm surrounded by delicious
limited-run beer which is brewed once a
year just to honor Igor Sikorsky now his
helicopter factory used to be the
economic engine of Stratford Connecticut
and although two roads isn't necessarily
gonna employ as many people as
sikorsky's factory once did what it is
doing aside from creating jobs and a
community hub here is it's providing a
way for Brewers all over the region to
get started without needing to build a
brewery alright so when you were
choosing or when you chose two roads
obviously the price was good and
presumably the beer was good - yeah I
mean that's you know you never know that
before we actually get the final product
but again Phil McAllister has a very
good name the bluing well as I knew that
you know the brewer was good
I knew the system it's a rolling system
which is like the highest in system you
get and we do 14 different styles now
and they're all a scooter stick indeed
you know if they're not good enough it's
my fault that my recipes nothing than
that it definitely doesn't have to do
with the system or the PA now let's say
I want to start my own beer because I do
I'd love to I don't know anything about
brewing should I start with home brewing
should i what's what's the right
approach there's two ways to do is start
with overthrow to brewing school or
whatever ruins class a lot of rural
schools in the States
I never needed it I mean a lot of the
best chefs in the world have never been
to cooking school you know we do stuff
that on paper it's not a good idea like
dumping thousands I want to ensure to
appear as a dry helping kind of thing I
mean they would never teach with out of
the house and donuts we have a be aware
with for every batch we make we put you
know stride hawk with donuts so we put a
thousand dollars it's gonna take like
liquid donor when it comes out and it's
just it's a fun way to do things and no
one I so Matt can do it so you know
that's what I'm doing yeah
what I love is that there is a machine
with sole purpose in life is doing this
specific pattern and it's so perfectly
suited for that job and yeah right there
hypnotic go
I
it's real today the sense of technology
technology and beer
what a great couple very famous Robert
Frost code up there on the wall I think
I know where you got your inspiration
from for the name tell me in your words
how did frost inspire too late for my
point of view as the brewmaster it is
about how we craft our beers we'd like
to take a slight departure from a
typical beer style and put our own spin
on it you know for example dry hoppin a
traditional German Pilsner is something
at German Brewer would never ever do
because it's not traditional to them
however we're are an American brewery
and we're two roads and we do things our
own way to make our products different
so that's how we apply the road less
traveled to our brewing philosophy every
MEP I make I made for myself and again
being a teacher do I have the freedom to
do that if I want to say something like
beer and it's not made I have to make
myself you know and that's just that's
my approach to it and that's why I keep
doing that swai I can't stop I get new
the whole time on my end we need to make
this would this success have been
possible if you needed to like start
your own brewery from scratch it's
difficult to say I mean it we would have
have have had success no matter what I
think but it just made it a lot easier
we didn't have to go God and I love
which a million dollars to build a
brewery means you know they can give us
the capacity and the prices that you
needed so yeah I'll say it definitely
helped a lot so what's the future gonna
hold
domination global domination does not
interest us we want to be we want to be
a regional craft based in Connecticut
first and foremost known in Connecticut
and from that point our wildest
ambitious missions have us you know
selling beer throughout the Northeast
and growing into a true regional beer
and a place that people can visit
the brewery can experience the brewery
will have beers on tap here in our tap
room that you can only get here at the
brewery so so there's always going to be
reason to for people to visit we just
want to make good beer and make people
happy I'm here at tourists which is
Yepes bar in Greenpoint Brooklyn trying
rowdy beer including the evil twin
cowboy if two roads can keep making
great beer and also empower Brewers all
over to be able to make great beer at
scale without having to build a brewery
and let a dude like ya pay continue to
make awesome beer that pushes the
envelope for what brewing can do cheers
to them to Rhodes brewery built a space
that was bigger than they may have
needed at first but they knew it would
allow them to continue growing without
having to stop production to expand when
moving into a new space even just going
beyond your home office thoughts like
room for expansion are really important
to consider when looking for an office
location consider what kind of business
you are and then find a location
convenient for your customers you should
also be able to consider all costs
including insurance and trash picking
finally to keep with customer demand
whether in the office or on the go look
for great mobility services that can
grow with you and your business for more
business advice be sure to visit a TNT's
business circle
just want to take a second to say hi
editors you're doing a great job all
right
