checking out Lenovo's new lineup of fab
phones being announced at tech world
this week the company is announcing
three new models the fab 2 the fab 2
plus and the fab 2 Pro all of which will
be available in the US later the summer
the fab 2 and the fab 2 plus are updates
of last year's fab and feature giant 6.4
inch displays big batteries and aluminum
designs 199 dollar fab 2 has a 720p
display quad-core MediaTek processor
while the $299 fab 2 plus steps up to a
1080p screen and octa-core chip and
throws in a fingerprint sensor and dual
camera array both of those are going to
be available unlocked directly from
Lenovo when they launch but the most
interesting member of the family is the
$499 fab 2 Pro it's the first consumer
device with Google's tango technology
and it has a special camera array
including a main 16 megapixel sensor
wide-angle camera and infrared depth
sensing camera
Lenovo is actually shrunk down the tango
hardware into a phone form factor here
and it's noticeably smaller than the
developer tango tablets we've seen in
the past as far as phone specs go the
fab 2 Pro has a quad HD 6.4 inch screen
Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 2 processor 4
gigabytes of RAM and a 16 megapixel
camera it's without a doubt a large kind
of thick and pretty heavy phone but it's
still smaller than earlier tango devices
the special cameras work together with
the phone's gyroscopes and
accelerometers to map out spaces and it
can actually locate the device within
that space if you walk around a room
with a fab 2 pro it knows exactly where
you are in that room and in relation to
other objects in the space Lin almost
showing off a couple of tango
experiences that will be available on
the fab 2 pro when it launches including
an educational dinosaur app that was
made in partnership with the American
Museum of Natural History a virtual
Domino app that lets you create these
Rube Goldberg like contraptions wherever
you are and a first person shooter lets
you gunned down robots in a virtual
environment the dinosaur app lets you
place a virtual creature in real space
and then look at it from a variety of
angles by moving the phone around the
dinosaur and then tap on specific points
to learn more about it lenovo says that
there will be about 25 apps available
for the tango features in the fab 2 pro
when it launches including games
utilities and location-based experiences
and they're expected to be a hundred
apps by the end of the year all three
phones are expected to be available
later this summer and we'll have more
info to share on them once we spent more
time with them for more on the fab -
lineup and everything else being
announced at tech world be sure to check
