meet you're ready yes that doesn't
matter if I'm ready
a year ago the secretive company Faraday
future promised to impress us with an
electric car that was unlike anything
we'd ever seen instead we got a
completely static concept car that
looked like the Batmobile now the
company has finally released its
production model the FF 91 and as you
can tell from the camouflage wrap and
total lack of interior they only had a
beta car for us to test thank you very
much
hello they buckle up we're probably not
gonna be going this faster okay okay
cars driving itself now looks like
Faraday futures FF 91 just came out a
couple days ago we're here in the back
seat Las Vegas Nevada so you guys have I
think I saw that you have somewhere
along a dozen cameras is that right 13
cameras way we stopped again why'd we
stop we're going back back into this
book we're going to reverse it's backing
up into the spot yeah okay that's kind
of bold I don't know I don't know I
would do that personally know what if I
so the car can park itself and we just
experienced that that's pretty
impressive do you want if you want the
car to come back you pull out the phone
tap summon or and it comes back to this
is going to be something that's going to
be available in the car in the first
production car when it ships in 2018
people will will be able to park and
have the car come to them at will and
now we are going back to the curb the
car has stopped a little difficult to
get out still that's alright
thank you very much the ff9 one is also
an incredibly high performance vehicle
boasting zero to 60 acceleration in 2.3
nine seconds courtesy of its 1,050
horsepower Faraday future had no issue
bragging about how much faster that was
than exotic cars like the Ferrari 488
and Tesla P 100 Dean
I can go very very fast all right I need
you do me a favor though yeah I'm gonna
head straight for this barrier okay and
you need to say now when you want me to
say now when I want you to turn ready
for this okay I'm ready to let me do it
all right okay now I definitely turned a
little bit later than I would have
chosen personally but I don't blame you
for wanting to show off what the car can
do you guys said this car can go zero to
sixty and two point three nine seconds
is that correct I'm alright everybody
thank and I may need you're ready that's
how he does it
what do you think okay okay I left my
stomach back there yep that's it right
there on the track
that was uh that was pretty fast I mean
I didn't I wasn't clocking it myself I
didn't have any sort of meters or
devices to show how fast we were going
and how quickly it happened but it
definitely felt about as fast as I've
ever experienced but here's the thing
with Faraday future the company still
has a lot of serious hurdles to overcome
before people can take them seriously it
needs to finish it's one billion-dollar
factory it needs to pay its suppliers
and it needs to tone down its rhetoric
and gain some humility other electric
cars startups like loosened motors seem
to have their feet more firmly on the
ground building a car is really really
hard in Faraday future needs to tackle
that before it can change the world ok
we are scared that's important I think
it's a long car but it feels like a
sports car right yeah what do you think
can we do donuts ah maybe at a later day
I love Donuts myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
