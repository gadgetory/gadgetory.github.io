this is the Lenovo ThinkPad x1 carbon
it's the company's premium ultra book
and you'll pay for it it starts at
thirteen hundred ninety nine dollars but
it looks and feels like a premium laptop
- it's made of carbon fiber hence the
name and it's really thin and light it
weighs less than three pounds and is one
of the thinnest ultra books we've seen
it's really sleek and good-looking but
it's obviously a thick pad with the same
color scheme that we've seen for years
and years there aren't a ton of ports on
the machine there's a USB 3.0 port and a
USB 2.0 port plus a display port an SD
card slot and a SIM card slot that you
can use for internet access the x1
carbon has a 14 inch display but it's
chassis is basically the same size as a
13-inch MacBook Air the 1600 by 900
display is good but it's not as
impressive as some of the 1080p screens
we've seen from other high-end ultra
books it's a good screen and since its
matte you'll actually be able to use it
and see it outdoors one of the things
the Nova does best is make keyboards and
the x1 carbons is really really good it
has the same curved smile design as some
of the company's other ultrabooks and it
looks weird but it works really well and
it's just a really good keyboard the
trackpad too is something lenovo is
finally starting to get good at the x1
carbon's trackpad is really glassy
really smooth and responsive and
everything from two finger scrolling to
pinch and zoom works pretty well it's
not as good as a MacBook mostly because
gestures lag a little bit but that seems
to be primarily a Windows problem if
you're not into the trackpad the x1
carbon also has
lenovo's classic TrackPoint nub and
mouse buttons I never use them
personally but plenty of people do there
are two stereo speakers on the bottom of
the computer which aren't exactly
world-beating but are perfectly solid
for a laptop they put out decent stereo
sound and are relatively loud the base
model the x1 carbon comes with a Core i5
processor four gigs of ram and intel's
integrated graphics if you pay more you
can get more processing power and more
SSD storage but a lot of the specs stay
the same even up to the eighteen hundred
and forty nine dollar model performance
in general is good more than enough for
things like browsing the web and
watching movies but this definitely
isn't a gaming machine by any stretch
and games are almost unplayable the
computer can boot in a little under 30
seconds and resumes virtually instantly
it's almost like an iPad in its speed
coming back from sleep the biggest
frustration with the computer is its
software it runs Windows 7 but there's a
ton of bloatware on the machine and
lenovo also redesigned a lot of apps and
settings menus that just don't look very
good or work very well and at points it
actually harms the experience of using
the computer
the computer also tends to get really
hot when it's working hard and the fans
aren't very loud even when they're
working hard but you can actually feel
them worrying underneath the computer as
you rest your palms on it which is kind
of an odd effect the excellent carbons
battery life is relatively short for an
ultrabook but it has Lenovo's rapid
charge technology which actually charges
from dead to about 50% in only about 20
minutes and can charge fully in under an
hour
overall the x1 carbon is one of the best
windows ultrabooks yet it's great
looking really light and thanks to good
performance and a great keyboard is a
really good work machine but it's really
really expensive
it's $200 more than a 13-inch MacBook
Air and hundreds of dollars more than a
number of other ultrabooks that we've
tested and because of that will sadly
likely only be for people with deep
pockets through their companies if you
can afford it though and don't mind
keeping a charger handy for a quick top
off every few hours the x1 carbon is a
really good Windows Ultrabook</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
