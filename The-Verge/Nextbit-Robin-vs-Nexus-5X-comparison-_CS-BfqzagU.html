new smartphone it's called the Robin and
it's made by a company called next fits
which does a lot like Nexus but this is
a nexus or more specifically a Nexus 5x
which launched late last year the phones
have a lot of similarities despite the
fact that this one comes from a small
start-up that ran a Kickstarter campaign
and this one comes from Google which is
not a small start-up it's like an owner
of two dozen startups so if you're in
the market for a newer unlocked 300 and
something dollar Android smartphone
which one is right for you they're both
unlocked phones that aren't super
expensive this one costs $399 and this
one costs $349 unlocked both run on
Google Android I have to say that I like
the next bits design it's hard edges
might not be for everybody but at least
it looks different from most smartphones
the Nexus 5x is fine but it's more like
a stock Android phone it's not a fancy
phone this one's made of plastic so is
this one this one has a 5.2 inch full HD
display so does this one
this one charges via USB type-c so does
this one this one runs on a snapdragon
808 processor when do I have an echo
over here so does this one this one also
has a fingerprint sensor that unlocks
the phone right here in the back and
it's super fast this one has a
fingerprint sensor too although it's on
the power button it's not down here this
is actually a speaker the Nexus 5x has a
twelve point three megapixel rear camera
and a five megapixel front camera well
the next bit Robin has a 13 megapixel
rear facing camera and a 5-megapixel
selfie camera but the Nexus 5x this
camera is faster and in my opinion takes
better photos
what about battery life battery life is
about the same on both of these phones
it will reliably get you through a full
day of average juice but don't expect
phablet battery life
okay so what's different about these
phones sin X is 5x runs on the latest
version of Google Android and so does
this one
but next vid has a really interesting
way of managing storage basically when
you start to run out of space phone
comes with 32 gigabytes next bit will
uninstall the apps that you're not using
and compress some of your photos to free
up more space also this one currently
only runs on AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile with
support for more carriers to come the
Nexus 5x works on all the major US
networks so which one is my favorite
well I do like the design of the next
bit it's different when I pulled it in
my bag people would say whoa what phone
is that and I think the way that it
manages storage is pretty cool but if I
had to pick one right now I'd probably
still go with the Nexus 5x not only is
it less expensive but it works on the
wireless network that I happen to be on
right now but maybe there are other
criteria that matter more to you and we
hope this video helped you make your
decision thanks for watching I'm Lauren
good from the verge and remember to
subscribe to our YouTube channel what
she said did you just say that's what
she said</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
