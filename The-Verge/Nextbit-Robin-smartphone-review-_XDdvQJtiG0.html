your phone you know there's typically
three ways to deal with this you could
buy a phone with more storage or one
with expandable storage which most
people don't do you could plug your
phone into your computer offload all the
photos and videos that you've taken to
make more space or worse you could
delete apps and photos and videos and
all the other fun stuff you use for your
phone for to make room for more fun
stuff but what if you didn't have to do
any of that well that's the promise with
the next bit Robin on its surface the
Robin is a pretty typical mid-range
Android phone with a pretty nice design
it's $400 and runs Android 6.0
marshmallow it has a 5.2 inch screen
that's sharp enough but a little bit
washed out a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808
processor and three gigabytes of RAM a
fingerprint sensor a 13 megapixel camera
and 5-megapixel selfie camera
front-facing speakers and a USB C
charging port with fast charging all
that's pretty common stuff for a
mountain smartphone the Robins design is
arguably more interesting than its spec
sheet it's sharp and angular and it's
soft plastic finish stands out among the
sea of aluminum phones without making it
feel cheap it's pastel colors are also
really eye-catching and it's refreshing
to see after staring at so many gray
gold and silver smartphones for so long
but specs and design are just side
stories with a Robin it's real appeal is
that it's never supposed to run out of
storage has a typical 32 gigabytes of
on-board storage but the next big is
each Robin owner 100 gigabytes of cloud
storage - that effectively gives you the
storage space of a phone with a 128
gigabytes of built-in storage for much
lower price this cloud storage isn't
like what you get with Dropbox or Google
Drive either next bit storage is solely
for storing the stuff that doesn't fit
on your phone while still providing easy
access to it the Robin software does
this in a few unique ways it will upload
all of the photos you capture leaving
smaller versions of them on your phone
and it will upload all your apps and
their data to the cloud when you start
to run out of space
those uploaded apps are removed from
your phone storage letting you continue
to shoot photos and download new apps
without worrying about running out of
space uploaded apps and games show up as
grayed out icons in the launcher
they can be restored on demand complete
with all of your settings and progress
that was there when the app was removed
from your phone it's a pretty slick
system but can take a few minutes to
download
a nap when you're out and about you can
pin apps to the phone so they'll never
be removed and you can easily see a list
of all the archived apps saved in the
cloud you can also manage when the Robyn
will do with backups what will be backed
up and clean up space from backed up
apps on demand
the system is cool but it isn't
foolproof aside from a long time it
takes to restore backed up app it
doesn't yet backup video to next Fitz
Cloud which takes up more storage space
on your phone than really anything else
the Robin isn't the fastest or best
performing smartphone you can get and
it's camera isn't as good as an iPhone
galaxy or Nexus phone but it does a base
is just fine and it does last a full day
between charges it's about exactly what
I'd expect from a $400 Android
smartphone at this point so it's real
pitch here is never running out of space
or at least giving you more storage than
you might expect from a phone at this
price and in that respect the Robin
delivers it with style</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
