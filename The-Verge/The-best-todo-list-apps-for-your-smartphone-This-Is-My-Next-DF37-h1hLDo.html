video about productivity than actually
be productive here's the good news
to-do list apps today are powerful and
beautiful enough to actually make us
want to get out of our ruts and start
working at its most basic a to-do list
app couldn't be simpler it's just a
checkbox with some text next to it but
great developers take them much further
letting you organize huge projects
manage recurring tasks and even set
location-based reminders they also
integrate with other services in your
life and help you focus on the things
that you can get done now there are
hundreds of to-do lists cluttering up
the App Store's but which one is the
best
wunderlist is the best to-do list app
for most people it's available on every
major platform it has a beautiful design
and it's powerful without feeling overly
complicated it's also free and while a
paid option will get you a handful more
features like uploading large files and
customizing the look of the app
wunderlist is a powerful solution even
if you never subscribe to the premium
version a big part of staying on top of
your task list is being able to capture
the thought at any moment and Wunderlist
makes great apps for Android iOS Windows
Phone and the web and makes good native
clients for Mac OS and Windows 8 at its
heart it's just a simple list but it
offers a perfect foundation to build on
the mobile apps do a good job of letting
you add tasks quickly and the desktop
and web clients offer a huge canvas or
drilling deeper organizing big projects
and delegating tasks to others many of
wonder list competitors share those
virtues but wonder this is usually more
intuitive with all this key features
never more than a tap or two away you
can add notes via email and Google now
but not Siri at least not for now but
it's easy to set and manage recurring
tasks and while other apps will charge
you $20 or more Wunderlist gives away
nearly everything for free other apps
boast more granular controls or more
specialized features but if you're
looking for a powerful free
cross-platform
app for managing your tasks wonder list
is absolutely the place to start to
duyst is another thoughtfully designed
powerful and intuitive app for managing
your tasks it just costs more 29 bucks a
year for basic features like search
reminder notifications and adding tasks
via email but if you spend a lot of time
manicuring your task list gift to do is
to look you can set up custom labels and
filters for your tasks location-based
reminders and even templates for
recurring projects it's a lot of
firepower but it also encourages you to
spend a lot of time fiddling with your
tasks and while the design is clean it's
just a bit to spare for my tastes still
todoist is an easy recommendation any
dues claim to fame is what it calls the
moment a push notification each morning
telling you to plan your day I find the
push a bit too pushy but lots of people
seem to like it but the app is less
intuitive than it should be and its
feature set isn't as robust as its peers
OmniFocus is sometimes called the Farrar
of to-do list apps it packs an
incredible amount of firepower and
charges a premium for it it's actually
the app I use every day but all that
power makes for a steep learning curve
and most people will prefer a simpler
option three other options to consider
are Remember The Milk clear and to do
they have varying degrees of power but
suffer from dated or confusing
interfaces and are generally less
intuitive than their peers to-do list
apps help you get things done by getting
tasks off your mind and into a place
where they can be organized and managed
more easily none of them will actually
do your tasks for you but they will get
you started
wunderlist offers the best balance
between power and ease-of-use and it's
mostly free so stop watching videos
about productivity and go get something
done</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
