and I'm here with the BMW i8 Spyder
concept a new car that BMW is showing
off here at CES 2016 but we're gonna
look at the inside rather than the
outside this is air touch which is BMWs
vision for the future of autonomous
driving or at least what the driver will
be doing while the car is driving itself
the screen itself is actually pretty far
away from the driver so it's definitely
not a touchscreen but what you can do is
sort of use it like an iPad and wave
your hand in front of the screen you can
just wave your hand in the air and
change between different modes from
navigation to media to calling or future
things like controlling your smart home
there's a button on the steering wheel
that lets you actually make a selection
something BMW said was necessary because
people were accidentally selecting
things when the car hit a bump if you
want something more comfortable
you can use this in the center console
which is where the high drive would
usually be on a normal BMW just wave
your hands above this mysterious BMW
technology and it's just like waving
your hands in front of the cameras above
in past year's CES shows have focused on
the autonomous driving technology itself
but as we get closer to that car
companies are looking forward to see
what the driver will actually do while
the car is driving and that's the
interior of the new BMW i8 Spyder
concept and air touch it's vision for
the future of autonomous driving for
