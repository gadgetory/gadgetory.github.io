visitor from the depths of outer space.
NASA announced last week that a 1300-foot
wide asteroid will zoom close to our planet
on the afternoon of October 31st.
The asteroid — named 2015 TB145 — will
come within 1.3 lunar distances of us.
That's about 300,000 miles away.
It may seem like a haunting encounter, but
the truth is there's nothing to fear.
The asteroid will simply shriek past us at
a whopping 22 miles per second.
The object is something of a mad scientist
too.
It has what is known as an eccentric orbit,
meaning it follows a highly elliptical path
rather than a circular one.
TB145 was first discovered by telescopes in
Hawaii on October 10th, so we've only known
about it for a little while.
The reason for the short warning time is because
this object isn't that big in NASA's eyes.
In its quest to map near Earth objects, the
space agency is primarily concerned with finding
the 1-kilometer asteroids — or those that
are more than 3,200 feet wide.
Asteroids of that size or bigger would wipe
us out if they hit our planet.
NASA says it knows about a little more than
90 percent of these sized asteroids, and none
is slated to hit us any time soon.
So to repeat: this will not hit us.
But since it's Halloween, let's have a little
morbid fun.
What would happen if TB145 actually did head
our way?
The asteroid would still do some scary damage.
It’s not small enough to harmlessly burn
up in our atmosphere, but it’s not as big
as the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs.
An object of this size could wipe out an entire
continent.
An asteroid that measures around 2,000 feet
would be just below the threshold of a global
catastrophe.
But to aggressively repeat: there's no need
to plan for the apocalypse on All Hallow's
Eve.
Instead, the pumpkin asteroid will provide
a great opportunity for NASA astronomers to
test out new radar technology.
During the asteroid's flyby, scientists will
bounce radio waves off the object in order
to get a radar image of its surface.
Meanwhile, I’ll be cheering them on as I
drown myself in Milky Ways.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
