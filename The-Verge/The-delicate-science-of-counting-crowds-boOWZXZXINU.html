inauguration of Donald Trump this was
the largest audience to ever witness an
inauguration period both in person and
around the globe it should be a simple
question but it isn't aerial photos
showed a much smaller crowd than in 2009
or 2013 and while everyone agrees Trump
is exaggerating I looked out the field
was it looked like a million million and
a half people no one seems to be sure
exactly how much the good news is we've
been estimating the size of crowds for a
while and we've gotten pretty good at
the most popular tactic is called the
Jacobs method you take a small section
of the crowd and you use it to calculate
the average square feet per person if
you can reach out your arm without
touching anyone that's about 10 square
feet per person if you're packed in
shoulder-to-shoulder that's closer to
five square feet and if you're in a mosh
pit we're closer to two and a half
square feet per person once you've got
an average density you apply it to the
area the crowd takes up so if you've got
a loosely packed crowd that covers half
the area of the National Mall you end up
with a pretty good idea of how many
people are there of course the experts
do it with a lot of different density
estimates and a lot of different regions
of the crowd but it boils down to the
same tricks you use to guess how many
jellybeans are in a big glass jar you
know how big a jelly bean is so how big
is the jar most experts say Trump's
crowds are around 600,000 people which
is a lot of people but when Obama took
office he drew a crowd close to 1.8
million three times larger of course not
everyone agrees with the math the Trump
camp argues that the white tarp on the
ground caused crowd counters to
underestimate the density and with
political rallies there's always a clear
reason to second-guess the organizers of
the Million Man March in 1995 actually
threatened to sue the National Park
Service over its crowd estimate which
pegged the crowd at 400,000 in response
Congress barred the Park Service from
providing crowd estimates just to spare
them the political outrage so this is an
old tactic but with Trump this kind of
active destruction of information has
really heated up you're saying it's a
falsehood and they're giving Sean Spicer
our press secretary gave alternative
facts to that but the point instead of
mathematical crowd estimates we rely on
less reliable sources like metro
ridership it's not as accurate but
you can't argue with it you see this
dynamic in a lot of places discussions
of climate change voter fraud even
immigration issues that are a lot less
clear-cut than comparing crowd photos
the problem is we've gotten so good at
discrediting facts and erasing truth
that we can't even say one crowd is
bigger than enough I should end on one
crowd is bigger than enough I'm Jerri
