and we're looking at the new Dell XPS 15
which is essentially the bigger version
of the Dell XPS 13 that we saw at CES
early this year first thing you really
notice is display so the bezels are
super thin around the outside just like
the XPS 13 and it's also 4k so you're
going to get a lot of resolution here
what's kind of interesting about this is
that Dells offering a hard drive option
and an SSD option if you go for the SSD
one you're going to get the touch
display that we're looking at here and
if you go for the hard drive one then
you get the full HD non-touch display
but also if you go for the SSD option
and you'll actually get a little perhaps
a little bit more battery life just
because there's a bigger battery inside
you've also got bigger trackpad than the
XPS 13 due to the size and still
precision it seems pretty smooth I don't
know that they've improved it much from
the last XPS 15 on the side is the most
interesting edition in terms of ports so
they've added a USB type-c port and
those opting for a funder bot free
compatibility with this so you can plug
in those sort of devices but you can
also charge the XPS 15 with this if you
really want to and you've also got a
full HDMI port and the regular sort of
USB ports on either side and in terms of
construction you've also got the
carbon-fiber palm rest and it's machined
aluminum all over and it oncee the edge
to edge display and in terms of the way
it's under four pounds if you're opting
for a certain specification it goes all
the way up to like roughly four and a
half pounds so it starts at $999 for the
core I free version which then goes all
the way up to a core i7 and it should
start shipping very shortly so your bids
get one freezing</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
