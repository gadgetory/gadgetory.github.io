the toshiba satellite you 920 T we've
also heard it called the u9 25t so what
this is is another one of the windows 8
tablets at etha that can transform into
a notebook pc so it's got a back hinge
here and it transforms I folding it back
and then sliding it in it's a little
rough and it feels as the other ones
we've tried have been really big as a
tablet it's 12.5 inches and it's also
got a pretty sizable keyboard but the
key placement is a little unusual you've
got your Enter key all the way up here
and then a really tiny shift key over on
this side otherwise it's pretty easy to
type on the only thing that strange is
that the hinges are just still a little
unfinished looking when you bend it out
you can see the bands that connect the
top and bottom section those have then
auto rotate so when you turn it back
into tablet mode it'll give you the
widescreen as a portrait which means
really long web pages so like an
ultrabook this comes with a solid state
drive should be about 128 gigs and we're
not sure how much it's going to sell for
yet but we've been told that the stock
price should be 949 euros and once again
this is coming out with windows 8 on
october 26th
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
