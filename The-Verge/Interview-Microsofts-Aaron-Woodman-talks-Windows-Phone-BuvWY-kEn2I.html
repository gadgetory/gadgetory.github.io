were sitting here with Aaron woman from
Microsoft director your director of
Microsoft you work in the Windows Phone
marketing marketing to ya and we're at
CES again this is a big it once again I
mean how many how many CES is this vid
for what it's a really funny story
because I was here for our first one so
like not that where they'll just showed
up he tears like 15 years ago were you
yeah so this look like you were just
attending them no it's like a technical
product manager at the time so you like
you're like a Benjamin Button I've been
here forever okay by god I've been
waiting for phone wow wow so like it's a
really wonderful book end for me because
yeah like a first last it feels right oh
yeah that's right that's sad yeah but
you're working on your doing we just fun
stuff there's a lot you guys are doing a
bunch of announcements here yeah it's
been here before eighty big agt
partnership you're doing LTE devices the
titan to is one of them and the nokia
phone that every keeps talking about the
Lumia 900 yep and is this must seem like
a really exciting time because you guys
have spent I mean we saw that we first
saw the phones at Mobile World Congress
in 2009 10 what year was a thousand ten
was a 10 yeah so it's been almost two
years now that you guys introduced these
but it's it's starting now to seem like
you're getting a little bit of traction
yeah I think you know what's amazing is
you know we think when we unveiled the
phone initially we surprised a lot of
people you know and i think you know
since that time we've actually had the
chance to actually bring it to market
yeah and actually see it in consumers
hands how do you think you surprise
people i mean i was surprised when I saw
because of the design why design and
actually the change of the approach I
think people kind of expected us to kind
of evolved the product into kind of a
slightly better version of windows
mobile and so the design is part of it
but i also think kind of rethinking how
we deal with our partnerships and
prioritize OEMs and mobile operators and
really think and kind of take
accountability for the consumer all up
right it was a really different approach
and i think that's really starting to
pay off in the last year where people
really been satisfied with the products
yeah so so do you know your market share
is right now I don't know it's not high
yeah
right so what Majnu so the note the note
get announcement is obviously a big deal
yeah it seems to me like the partnership
with Microsoft is pretty tight and you
guys always collected and see it as
we're going to make this flagship you
know here is what the best of what
Windows Phone can be and go out there
and get it so so my first question is
how do you balance that with these other
partnerships you make Samsung I mean you
guys work with Samsung HTC LG the first
thing I would say is like market share
is one of those things that tends to be
a trailing indicator versus a leading
indicator you know it's one of those
things that happens as a successful
product enters the market and a lot of
people fall in love with it and so I
think we feel really good with kind of
the trajectory in the sense that people
are using the product they are falling
in love with it you know people that are
touching the new products or fall in
love with it giving us really positive
reviews right and then I think when you
think about the step approach of how to
actually build into scale there's a lot
of things that go into that and one of
the probably the most important is the
partnerships I mean obviously we don't
make hardware so partnering really
closely with a nokia or a samsung or HTC
really enable us to actually get to just
greater choice and greater selection
some cases like nokia where they really
bet the company's future on Windows
Phone that is a product and I said it is
super loud it's my just a few I was like
this way to see how loud I look at it's
like a soundtrack yeah i guess like it's
like i'm excited yeah no but i think
that partnership is such a critical
piece and you know I think Nokia really
embraces really similar values we're
like this and say but I think that idea
focus on design I think that just feels
really right we can have designed at the
nokia booth they've got things like an
asshole NASA helmet next to or is it the
kind of helmet my laboratory sitting
next to a Lumia 900 the case they are
anokhi as a company's obviously taking
design and kind of paying this later
it's what they're known for you know
when you talk to consumers about the
nokia brand even in the u.s. people the
memory that they haves is just these
really beautifully designed device yes
right that brand it still has that
affinity and it's not because they've
got great marketing it's because that's
kind of their pedigree of their phones
right but but how do you I mean how do
you maintain this relationship with
Nokia which is obviously very close to
keep other partners exams
in LG happy yeah in devices well I think
a lot of that is going to come from what
no key is actually going to provide to
the broader ecosystem I think they're
going to create demand and awareness for
windows phone and I think Samsung and
HTC you're going to benefit that right
you know my guess is if you'd ask other
OEMs whether they would build an iphone
they probably would not because there's
not just a great competitor in there
that's built a great device but there's
opportunity demand right and so these
things are gonna be really positive
nokia ability in your iphone is le
you're saying no I do think they're
building an incredible device that you
know right but is that I suppose in a
way right if the iphone is the halo
device for Apple then the Lumia 900 is
your halo device I think so Lumias 9
hunter is going to be amazing you know
like I've touched you on side with Halon
device well I just think there's gonna
be a lot of different phones for a lot
of different people you know the Titan
to with the 16 megapixel camera yeah
it's going to appeal to people in a very
unique way right now and and and so I
don't you know I don't want to presume
to know what individual people want from
a phone i think that's right don't you
be alright i suppose of your job to dell
what it do a lot of them well but what's
funny about that is when you talk to
consumers what they want varies
immensely right like i actually prefer a
smaller devices i actually put in my
front pocket yeah my wife carries a
purse he doesn't care how big the phone
is right and so a larger phone actually
is more comfortable right hard and you
think show you think she'll be a fan of
the 4.3 inch screen versus you're using
already using a radar i'm using a ratos
3.7 yeah it feels really good it's
rounded doesn't catch on anybody it's a
really nice fights they've executed
really well on it and yeah so I think
you know she's she's kind of had some of
the larger devices in the past and I
think that's something that really
appeals to her it's just really easy to
use you know and it's going to come down
to that kind of personal preference and
it's one of the beautiful parts about
Windows Phone is you're seeing kind of
more and more selection of devices at
individual carriers like HD you know if
i look at HTC and samsung at 18 teen
then you add nokia that's that's
actually a pretty good selection yeah a
really high quality phone it allows
people to choose yeah so so when so
Stephen Elop a couple of times yesterday
on stage said that this is the first
real windows phone I asked him about it
sure I want to ask you being first off
does it do you bristle a little bit when
you hear the first real windows I'm even
Ellen windows phones for like a year I I
mean the thing I admire most is Stephens
passion you know they I mean he's he's
actually really fun to watch on stage
he's probably boy it has a really
diplomatic right well I think he's
really passionate you know and I think
so many great businesses are built
around passionate people getting
involved and caring deeply about their
product and right you know it's some
level like I have the most beautiful
kids on the planet I don't know who this
is a true statement I go fat you're like
as they are the most i can prove it I've
done studies at least my first one for
sure yeah well you gotta have to choose
your other children are you really love
west a few years but i think i was the
dad and but it but i think that idea
that people can get so in love with the
products they want to build and have
that amount of passion yeah that's
really a teeny is appealing for me to
hear this end Stephon but does that
really mean anything yeah I think it
means that people care about the quality
of products supreme the marketplace I
mean so yeah I think it I think it
articulates something that he believes
and i think is true when you touched
their products it doesn't feel like
something that was thrown together was
sorry that was thoughtful and they've
thought through in that includes the
entire lineup even the 710 which is a
much more reasonably priced device i
mean it's going to be available i think
at t-mobile tomorrow yeah i mean it's
really well thought through device yeah
and we did everybody with it not really
i think we liked it you think they're I
care about what your man by did I didn't
interview I can't remember the score was
bad thanks for him in here I don't think
it was like a Lumia level level score
blows I mean it's a different device
four different person right you know um
but again I think they thought through
what they could do within that price
range and bring a really quality advice
to to consumer so like you know I think
I think they really thought through it
so and so now you've got this device is
really beautiful halo device that
everybody's talking about I love that
you're going to use the halo but I mean
I think I think that when you I think
that given what we've heard from
Microsoft and Nokia about the
partnership given the level of hype and
focus has been put on this particular
device yeah then their line of these
Lumia phones I don't think it's unfair
to say in North America the flagship or
the hail I think it's going to be a
great windows device is the Lumia 900
but say so you've got the gray phone
yeah
you've got an OS that I think a lot of
people really do like and I yeah it's
great I think they're I mean I have my
nitpicks but I my name picture
everything but I do think I mean I
looked I played with the 900 today and I
think yeah this is really sexy I could
live with this device yeah and so now
and this is really where the marketing
guy comes in how do you make these
things make an impact I mean you get
intense competition right Apple huge
footprint just it kind of in this
endemic you know footprint yeah there
you've got an android yeah I'm huge
market share people know them people
love them there have not been they don't
have good memories I think of Microsoft
in the mobile space if you use windows
mobile at its tail end and you probably
walked away from it to something else
because saying I want a blackberry or i
won a parent I to repurchase right so
how do you bring people back to this and
how do you bring new people to I mean
what's the strategy yeah I think it's
probably going to come down to three
things the first thing is continue to
build a great product you know I think
we're very very focused that people will
forgive low market share over some
period of time but there's not a lot of
forgiveness for a poor product so you
know job number one is really just
building a great quality product job
number two then comes down to kind of
working through our mobile operator
partner especially here in the US we're
focusing and getting them to get
passionate about the product and helping
you know retail representatives really
talk to consumers in a way that's
credible and humble in terms of our
history but also you know true to the
things that we are great at so that we
can actually kind of qualify customers
at the point of sale an enormous number
of customers that come into a store
haven't actually made up their minds
right terms of which phone and so you
know trying to win the hearts and minds
at the retail stores it's such a big
effort and why 18 TS announcement was
such a big part for us right i mean this
is something that i think that Stephen
Elop talked about on stage yesterday
which is or baby even ralph de la Vega
care about who but there was a
particular point made about getting the
people who are in the store educated
about your phones and saying it is a
huge piece that's actually I mean I
remember hearing when when palm released
it
pre that there was a lot of trouble with
verizon with the people just not knowing
about the device and understanding them
and not being able to tell people about
them and they would direct them to my
phone so for you guys as the as the guy
who's trying to get in there yeah it's
basically your biggest barrier in some
ways is if they don't if you don't ever
point someone to it in a store usually
retail people do an incredibly good job
of trying to listen to the customer you
know so right you know most of those
people aren't in there just hockey phone
stuff the door I they really are trying
to understand the customer and so our
challenge has always been making sure
they understand how to qualify a
customer into a windows phone and and
what a windows phone can do for
customers and educate them on that that
opportunity so they can just find the
right fit it doesn't so much of going
over at the top or anything like that
yeah but it's why announcements like 18t
nouncement are so important to us
because they own that connection with a
customer in a way that's the last mile
and it's where most of the sales are
exiting there have been some reports
that we saw about people being
incentivized 22 pitch windows phones I
mean is that it happens throughout the
industry I think every phone
manufacturer and partner actually do
that and so in some cases the mobile
operator has strategies in momentum
right hunt you do then sir I mean but
you guys will be doing that I mean
you're gonna we're motivated go compete
at retail and like this you won't be
able to tell be able to get the phone
yeah I mean but at the same time I don't
think anyone has a desire to sell a
windows phone to someone that's not
gonna be happy you know like so much of
this you know any increased sales
momentum is going to come from a
satisfied base and so right it's not
worth artificially selling a phone to
someone simply satisfied so that's kind
of great product win a retail really
focused and the third thing I would say
is marketing execution you still have
this huge opportunity in terms of the
windows brand itself in kind of the
direction it's going what it means for
people and making it relevant to the
phone purchase and driving awareness
that there is an opportunity to actually
buy a Windows device when you're making
a phone choice and those are kind of the
three big pieces I mean there's a lot of
other timing by the marketing has to
obviously you guys haven't been you've
been doing some marketing variaty
centric marketing I think we've been
very partner centric in the Marathi you
know we worked really closely with OEMs
and mobile operators don't continue to
look for opportunity are you to start
telling a story about just windows phone
in general
in terms of marketing I think we're
evaluating you know I don't know if
we've made any decisions in terms of how
we're going to go to marketing I think
what's clear to us is we have to
translate the brand awareness of windows
and the Infinity that people have for
windows and make that relevant to our
product inside this category right and
that's an effort and I don't think
anyone feels accountability for that
other than Microsoft right and so that
that doesn't necessarily mean a specific
marketing spend in terms of hey we're
going to give this person money or that
campaigner yeah but it does mean we have
a very specific set of objectives that
are going to lead to I think not too
short term but long-term success ok so I
know you have to get out of here but I
have a Mexican I help I know yeah yeah
it's so warm we've got to do say to the
temperature in the rupee up but I have a
question for you it's a personal
question yeah so we have a forum on the
verge it's called curling club Mike
reserves right it's named after a
douglas coupland book yeah now Microsoft
or a great book cheese under a door
thigh highs a big fan of the book I'm
first read it but we're changing the
name yeah people don't like it because
it suggests it has some negative because
it's basically a de- turb but you know
playful uh suggestions for what to the
internally there's a lot of this
Microsoft D kind of Microsoft Office
website is I personally have a
preference for like Aaron's playground
or something I don't know if that was
playground I don't know if that's going
to kind of sounds like it would be like
a weird it just feels like I think
people would have this instant affinity
that would be really positive Mike would
like women's playground is that big fat
okay so so you're putting in for Aaron
yes Aaron's playground woman's legs
obvious like there's some opportunities
are very selfish talk to my brother very
selfless modest proposal every patient
Aaron thanks so glad they are you
