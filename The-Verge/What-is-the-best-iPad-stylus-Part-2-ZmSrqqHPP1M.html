previously looked at the best I lied for
iPad from the best one for drawing to
sketching to scribbling and the best
all-around stylus which we decided was
the Wacom Bamboo we saw some feedback in
the comments and we got our hands on
another batch of styli that we're going
to check out today first stylus we're
going to look at is the mana price eight
eight four three and the reason has that
codename is because it's sold by mano
price which just sells so many generic
products for 297 it works pretty well
and is just about the cheapest stylus
you're going to find from any reputable
online retailer so the tip is pretty
good its ultra light and kind of feels
like junk but for three dollars you're
not going to find anything better from
any retailers that you're familiar with
next up is the Pogo sketch plus from ten
one we actually mistakenly reviewed the
Pogo sketch last time thinking it was
the plus it was shipped to us as the
plus and for good reason they look
exactly the same except the Pogo sketch
plus has an aerated tip on the end which
is supposed to be more precise than the
pretty dumb conductive foam tip which is
squishy and just not very durable at all
so besides that they're both kind of old
looking retro styli and I don't like
that very much because they're thin they
kind of feel junky and the Pogo sketch
plus isn't particularly precise either
for 1495 the Pogo sketch plus isn't a
particularly great deal and we
definitely recommend the Kuehl which is
about the same price next up is the Pogo
sketch Pro and while some people swear
by this thing we just had a horrible
experience with it it's the older
brother of the Pogo sketch plus and it
has that same tip with the holes in it
right there which just doesn't work that
well for us not only that but whenever
you're holding it you need to be making
contact with the metal at the top of it
in order to register with the screen but
from people who write in a certain way
including some of us it just doesn't
work very well and even if you are
making contact with the metal just
doesn't always register we did find that
it registers better with the screen if
you hold it upright but then that's also
coincidentally the way that you're least
likely to be making contact with the
metal on stylus it also comes with a
replaceable foam tip
which we're not really sure why you'd
want to use because we think it's
inferior in just about every way the
2495 architect is made out of anodized
aluminum and it's matte it's kind of
brushed sprayed on there so it's easy to
hold and you're not going to lose grip
of it interesting thing about this thing
visually is that it has this screw off
top which is kind of more for looks than
for anything else it screws on to the
other side of the architect so you can
protect the tip and then when you're not
using it you screw it on to the back
kind of like on the Adonit jot Pro and
you can also throw a lanyard through
there or something like that if you want
to hang it around your neck and not lose
track of it so the tip on this thing is
okay it's not too long and it's not too
wide it's still pretty accurate but the
thing is it kind of grips the screen it
doesn't glide across it as effortlessly
as some of the other styli it does have
a nice heft to it which is good but we
think there are definitely better bets
in the twenty five dollar range around
one of our styli roundup we thought we
ordered the gist mobile al you pen from
amazon but amazon sent us a knockoff for
the same price from their own warehouse
we got in touch with just mobile found
the original and it's pretty great it's
actually a bit thicker than the old one
it's closer to the studio knee cosmonaut
Le Pen is a great all-around stylist
it's a little too thick for my taste to
use on everyday basis but it's modern
it's a nice kind of hybrid between the
giant cosmonaut and some of the smaller
thinner styli and one of the best parts
about it is actually the tip which is
firm it's not too wide and it actually
is very very conductive with the screen
so you'll get instant responses when
you're using it on your iPad the alyou
pen is a great deal for 24.95 it's
really a quality piece of craftsmanship
next up is the just Mobile AL u pen pro
which is really interesting it's just
like the AL u pen but it's a lot thinner
it's more like a pencil in in waistline
and on one side you have the rubber tip
which is actually not as good as its
younger brother the AL u pen it's not as
rigid and firm so you won't be getting
as much of a response from the screen
but then the other end is actually
twisty and
if you twist it to the left pen comes
out of it you can actually replace the
pen cartridge whenever you need to it
even comes with a replaceable rubber tip
as well it's a pretty good deal for 3995
and it also comes in sleek black and it
even comes with a cool leather case for
you to carry it around it the mag lists
from design firm apply dia is a great
new entry that brings together some of
the best features from other styli into
one product so the first thing you'll
notice is that two sides of it are flat
it's kind of shaped like a carpenter's
pencil and you wonder why originally but
then you think about the name mag las'
and it's magnetic so it sticks like the
Adana jot Pro to the side of your iPad
so that's the first cool feature and
it's flat which means it stays put
unlike the adonijah pro which is
cylindrical the next best feature about
the mag lists is the tip which i think
is the most conductive rigid firm
responsive tip i've tested out of any of
them you don't even really need to press
down on the screen it just kind of it's
like ink flowing out of a pen and part
of that is because the mag 'less is
hefty it's not heavy but it's heavy
enough that you know it makes it makes a
mark on the screen without you having to
push down like some of the other ones
like the Pogo the only thing I don't
like about the mag lists is that
depending on how you hold the pen it
might be pretty uncomfortable for you
given it has those two flat sides but
really it's not so bad even for people
like me you hold their pen weirdly the
mag 'less is 20 euros which as of now
comes out to about $26 which makes it
cheaper than the bamboo by about five
dollars and it's a great deal you're
gonna have to ship it overseas but all
around it's a great product finally we
come to the kragle I pen which is
interesting to say the least it is the
only stylus I've tested that uses a
dongle here to detect where you are on
screen which also means it's using a
little bit of battery but does that mean
that it's more accurate not really we
actually found that it's a lot less
accurate even when you calibrate it
using the few apps that it is compatible
with and you will need to use those apps
there's ghostwriter notes ibis notes and
a few other ones that you can buy we
tested the free ones and none of them
work particularly well so when you go
into the app you're
going to calibrate it by trying to put
down the tip of the stylus at an exact
point on the screen when you hover the
eye pen over the screen in these
specific apps you'll actually see a
little cursor on the screen even if you
hold the eye pen a few inches above the
screen you'll still see the cursor which
is cool because it thinks it knows where
you are but then in practice it's
actually less precise you have to press
down on the screen using the eye pen
which you can feel a little click I'll
be honest with you I think it actually
scratches the screen because it's just a
little a little thin piece of plastic
you're rubbing on your screen and it's
going to cost you ninety dollars so
while some people really like this thing
I had a really bad experience using it
this goes without saying that it uses
batteries you have to carry around the
dongle with you and it only uses a few
specific apps and not only that but the
tip looks like the Death Star's power
reactor which I don't like
and it even cracked right there a little
bit so I think this is a definite skip
out of this batch I think the two best
are the just mobile al you pen and the
mag lists from apply dia so they're both
hefty aluminum style ID with great tips
but I think the mag Lass's tip is just a
bit better not only that but it's
magnetic its heftier and I just like the
way it looks you really can't go wrong
with either of these though the winner
of round one of our styli roundup was
the Wacom Bamboo it's handsome it has a
nice narrow precise tip that's removable
there's a pen clip and it's a little bit
expensive but we're willing to part with
that money cuz it's a great product but
I think the mag less is better
