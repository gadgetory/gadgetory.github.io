Pierce and an alternate timeline I end
up is the king of Vancouver weird right
this is not any seconds on the verge
electric car manufacturer Tesla will
soon be expanding its options with an
all-wheel-drive Model S sedan sources
tell us the new model could launch as
soon as early 2014 all-wheel Drive is
popular among driving enthusiasts but
also has practical consumer
ramifications all the drive makes it
easier to get around in poor weather
conditions and could allow the company
to sell cars in areas that face tough
winters bad weather conditions an
electric car that isn't something to set
up for a horror movie at all amazon will
now let you buy diapers books and fine
art the company is partnered with over a
hundred and fifty galleries and dealers
across the United States for a new
portal called Amazon art it will
showcase more than 4,500 artists Amazons
calling it one of the largest online
storefronts of its kind however this
isn't the first time the company has
ventured into the art world it partnered
with Sotheby's in 2004 a similar idea
but the trial only ran 16 months new
fancy artwork coming to the Washington
Post in 32 and finally researchers
recently unveiled a test tube hamburger
grown entirely in a lab the 5 ounce
patty was made from 20,000 protein
strands grown from cow stem cells the
project cost 325 thousand dollars and
was funded entirely by Google's Sergey
Brin the burger was tasted by two
individuals who said they found it
reasonably authentic but they would have
preferred it animal style and that's it
for today's top stories coming up
tomorrow a handful of things that
haven't happened yet it's a surprise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
