at CES every year but none except for
this one have a name like Ford on them
this scooter is actually made by a
company called Ojo electric and they've
been making these scooters for a little
while now this is their latest model it
goes has up to 50 mile range which is
pretty much unheard of in an electric
vehicle like this it has a top speed of
about 20 miles an hour a couple
different speed modes a LCD screen on
the dash that's also touchscreen all of
these things are not really anything new
when it comes to electric scooters these
are kinds of things that you'll find in
a lot of Odo's competition but really
sets you apart is that they have a
global partnership with Ford now Ford
has partnerships with a bunch of
companies all offering different ways to
get around a modern city it has van
sharing services it has bike services it
has car sharing services it is
partnering with companies to make
self-driving cars what it was missing
was something like this something that's
a little bit in between a bike or an e
bike and a vehicle that we're familiar
driving down the road and what it's
found in Ojo is actually something kind
of special well it looks a lot like some
other electric scooters that we see here
every year this thing is a blast to ride
it is very quick especially in the top
speed mode it is extremely well balanced
it's got a unibody chassis that is heavy
but not too heavy that lets you really
sort of carve around on it in a way that
I've never really done an electric
scooter like this it has a suspension on
both wheels that means going over bumps
is not as much of a challenge as it is
usually on something like this and I
just can't tell you how much fun I've
had riding it usually I get on these
things I'll ride them for a little bit I
don't really ever think about him again
but this is the kind of thing that I
actually would want to ride past today
there are two other things that are
pretty specific to this scooter that I
really like one is that the way it's
shaped you can sit or stand
you know it sounds a little weird but it
actually makes a pretty big difference
it means this is a bit more comfortable
to ride no matter what kind of terrain
you're riding over and the other thing
is it's got a retractable power cord
built right into it this thing takes
about five hours to charge which isn't
quick but you always have that cord with
you you can plug it into any wall outlet
to give yourself just a little bit more
juice if you need it it's also not
really that expensive all things
considered it costs twenty one hundred
fifty dollars which you know isn't cheap
but when you're getting something with
50 miles arrange really good performance
a whole bunch of features like Bluetooth
connectivity it's got wolf speakers on
it so you can listen to your music while
you're driving a basket on the back to
carry stuff it's just like a lot of the
things that we see scattered across
other electric scooters all in one place
and that's usually kind of hard to find
now that doesn't mean if you buy one of
these scooters and something goes wrong
you're gonna be able to bring it to a
Ford dealership and have them tune it up
this is just a licensing deal Ford found
a company that could help represent it
in a new way and this company found her
hand like Ford to get its scooter around
the world which is really sort of the
best of both worlds the four dojo
scooter is available now in a wide
variety of color some of them even
modeled after iconic Ford cars don't be
surprised if you see them soon in a
resort in a city or maybe even in my
driveway if I've had one
the more electric scooters electric cars
self-driving cars everything we've seen
