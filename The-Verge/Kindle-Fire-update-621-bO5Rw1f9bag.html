this is obviously the kindle fire and
today Amazon is releasing an update for
the device and this one doesn't actually
have the update cuz i wanted to show you
the pre update experience here so one of
our biggest complaints from the start
about the fire was the fact that you
can't edit the carousel so if i wanted
to hide from someone that i was reading
this justin bieber book which i'd like
to hide from the world actually you
could hit this delete button but that
would delete it from the device it
wouldn't actually remove it from the
carousel the same thing with websites
here if i tap this i can only add it to
favorites i can't remove it so that's
one of the things the update is supposed
to fix the second thing the update is
supposed to fix is scrolling and you can
see here that in this pre update state
it's just a little bit choppy and not
all that smooth so i'm going to go grab
the update and we'll see what it adds
so I got the new software update here
and the first thing you'll notice and
one of the things I actually noticed it
first is at this carousel it's actually
a little bit slower now and it's easier
to stop on things especially when you're
going really fast but as we showed
before I can now stop on there we go
Justin Bieber and remove him from the
carousel so no one knows that I was
reading that book I can also go into the
browser and get a little bit faster
browsing our scrolling speeds still a
little bit slow here on the verge but
admittedly it's a heavy site with both
text and pictures definitely am seeing
improvement here on the new york times
faster in terms of pinching to zoom and
scrolling probably not as smooth as the
ipad i don't have one to compare it to
side by side just doesn't feel like has
that same snap i am seeing though just
better touch responsiveness as you can
see just basic taps or working something
I've had a problem with in the past also
it seems that page turns in magazines
seem a little bit faster I should
probably remove this from the carousel
to don't want anyone knowing routing
this so a little bit slow with these
sort of graphic heavy pages but I think
it's a little bit better so overall it's
a pretty good update here for the kindle
fire it unfortunately doesn't fix my
biggest issue with the device which is
the power button on the bottom</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
