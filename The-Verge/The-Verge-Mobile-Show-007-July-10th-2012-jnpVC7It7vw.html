car crash you can't not look you can't
not slow down and gawk and see what
happens you know what doesn't happen
when there's a car crash the dude in the
car doesn't get out and get out a
bullhorn and start shouting at traffic
that everything's fine i'm gonna be able
drive away really soon it's gonna be
awesome we pretty much experience that
this past week in the mobile world will
explain why stay tuned for the Virgin
Mobile show I'm dieter bohn i'm chris
sigler i'm david pierce yes this really
appears oh right this is real this is
happening so we were actually we were
just talking about this during rehearsal
the fact that David Pierce is going to
introduce himself and then I was going
to make some disparaging remarks about
him about how we tried to get literally
every other person at the verge to be on
this show and everyone said no and then
finally we got to David Pierce were like
okay well we're out of people we better
ask David and he agreed to come on but
no that's absolutely not true at all he
was our first choice and I'm delighted
to say that that he said yes and then I
asked every other podcast if I could do
that one and then when they all said no
I'm here there's another lie there did
you just say in rehearsal rehearsal yeah
we we didn't matter reverse anything
what what do you call that what do you
call the period before the the show
waiting for chris to get out of the
bathroom so we can start that's accurate
fair okay yeah we can go with that this
is episode 7 for the week of july nine
2012 if you're keeping track and i hope
you are and we ended last week on a down
note and so we're gonna start on that
same down note this week because i'm
tired of having it at the end can we
talk about just how crazy rim and
blackberry is right now like nothing has
changed but like just the the insanity
of
they're their media blitz is blowing my
mind and Chris you listened into the
entire investor meeting today yeah I did
I did and it was basically a repeat of
the earnings call torsten this speech uh
mirrored what we heard what was that
weaker week and a half ago almost word
for word and there really wasn't
anything new revealed we did get a very
brief tidbit as part of the QA that
happened after his speech about video
chat coming to BBM in blackberry 10
which we kind of threw some leaked
screenshots before that crackberry broke
last month I believe but we have that on
the record now and there were a couple
other very minor things here and there
but by and large was basically the same
doom and gloom that we've been hearing
for a while now torsten said that he's
not satisfied with performance of the
company next few quarters are going to
be difficult q1 2013 blackberry 10 now
so on and so forth and I was actually
surprised I mean there were some
somewhat heated questions from
shareholders during the Q&amp;amp;A session but
it was basically uh it did decorum I
that nobody broke decorum let's put it
that way it was it was pretty is pretty
soft spoken all things considered there
were that there was one guy that came up
to the mic and said um you know how did
the the legacy board members let it get
so bad and let it go for so long to the
point where we're at now and one of the
board members I can't remember her name
but one of the board members said excuse
me do you have a question and then he
just went and sat down that was about as
i was about as he does it got still I
that kind of surprised me I thought we
were gonna hear some some really really
tough questions thrown at the at the
executives but there were there were
just some really random questions that
you know you think this might be your
only opportunity in your entire life to
address the CEO of rim one on one as a
shareholder and you go up and ask a
question the very first question was
nortel had some problems with with being
infiltrated by Chinese hackers over the
past few years what can you tell us
about you
her security again what kind of what is
the plan man come on that's that's
that's a ringer that's that somebody put
in the audience to ask that that's a
very good point and can through that but
one thing that that I thought was really
interesting the torsen said in response
to that question I thought the question
was lame but one thing that he said in
response was that rim doesn't make
phones in China over security concerns
which I'd never thought about before cuz
you know rim is pretty well known for
being one the only major phone
manufacturers not to make phones in
China and apparently that's why yeah I
mean I don't know that I think I've
touched on this before like I don't
understand why they are being so public
and have been so public in the lead-up
to this investor meeting I mean so
torsen Heinz gave a really long
interview to al Sacco at CIO and I mean
he said some interesting stuff there
like one thing would that was neat to
hear him say was that rim just didn't
understand that LTE was important and
that nobody in North America cares about
saving bandwidth anymore and like they
just straight up with that they were
focusing on the wrong thing um which you
know totally true right but that's I
think the first time first time I've
heard anybody from rim sort of take a
veiled swipe at Lazarus and his his
engineering focus well if that was all
lazy what I don't get is why don't they
do more of that like why wouldn't hunts
come out and just constantly say like we
blew it we did a lot of things really
poorly for a long time and we got this
thing wrong but we're gonna get the next
thing right and you know they got the
last thing right and then this thing
wrong and then if they get the next
thing right they might be fine but
instead they come out and say you know
things like we believe there's nothing
fundamentally wrong with the company and
aren't on and just like why wouldn't he
come out and take these swipes at the
old guard and say well they screwed up
I'm doing my best to fix it well I'll
tell you one very big recent is the fact
that uh la zurita sits on the board of
the company in fact he was just to be
elected today so that make
making those comments with Leslie is
sitting like 15 feet here to your side
might be a little intimidating
especially considering that Leslie just
looks like the kind of guy that could
get up and come at you like full bore
and nah you will not a douche up yeah
he'd lead with his head to he'd like his
hair just BAM right beard ass yeah
that's though I mean I think that part
of it is like we don't know like what
their stock is the good at bottom out at
if it has I mean it they've lost so much
value and there's a whole lot of smoke
around you know what is gonna happen are
they gonna split the company are they
gonna try and spin off hardware they're
trying to spin off the software are they
gonna do anything you know fundamental a
fundamentally different between now and
when they launched blackberry 10 or are
they you know gonna just try and muscle
through 22 the blackberry 10 launch and
so I think a lot of that is you know
signaling or I think there's like
backroom games or like a lot of the
stuff that we're hearing them saying the
media it's meant for us but it's also
meant for you know investors and you
know the other companies that they're
talking to or trying to hold off right
yeah and Heinz did mention on several
occasions during the meetings day that
discussions with their consulting banks
are ongoing and they're still evaluating
all their options which is you know the
same language they've been using for to
earnings calls now yeah so we'll see
what happens with that it's a kind of
language you use right up until the day
that you announce some gigantic you know
change yeah and even things they're
saying you know they're talking about
how they have no debt and all these
things that don't typically matter in
the sense of I mean really it's about
all of this is becoming financial right
all of these discussions are about like
how are we as a company not what
innovative cool things are we doing just
every time he comes out and talks it
seems more like he's saying here's why
you should buy us and less here's why
we're a cool company making cool
products right right and someone in my
twitter feet I apologize I'm not sure
who it was off the top my head but
somebody mentioned that rim rims closing
stock price today puts them at a lower
market cap then like
the raw value of their cash on hand plus
their their assets so I mean wow we have
enough and they have no debt so at this
point it's almost like it's kind of if
you could if a company could come in and
buy a and by rim for you know book value
and not not pay a premium over the the
market cap then it would just be like
financially sound to do so based on that
alone even if you just came in and shut
down the company but but you know of
course it doesn't work that way they'd
have to pay a premium there there's lots
of overhead involved with that but but
still that's a really striking fat you
know that and and very rare when you
when you take it coming like Facebook
which is the exact opposite of that
where they have well like 100-something
p/e ratio which is completely insane and
absurd uh so yeah I mean they're just
getting pummeled in every sense of the
word right now it's gonna be a stretch I
mean I posited the theory last week that
well that blackberry 10 at least as we
know what today will never see the light
of day it's just not going to happen and
I think that tourists in hinds may
already know that I had was really
really really I know that you this is
your your thing but I just can't believe
that they're not gonna at least put it
on they've come so far they're dropping
a whole bunch of money on developers all
right well what do you mean they've come
so far well it show me one shred of
evidence of that besides blackberry jam
blackberry jam we can get blackberry jam
there was a story that they're dropped
day that are investing I don't know 100
million or something I can't remember
exactly what it was um and you know
they're developing the OS it's probably
close to ready well I got it now because
it's not launching till 2013 now but my
opinion is that the blackberry developer
ecosystem is still small enough so that
they would not hesitate to throw the
entire thing to the dogs if the right
company came along and said we're gonna
snap you up and do whatever with you and
I I strongly believe that I won one
thing that we've talked about at least
on a couple occasions now is the fact
that I think that you know a palm one
palm source type of situation might be
happening here
we're brims software business would
would spin off as that the quote unquote
healthy business and the hardware
business would just kind of wither up
and die on the vine I think that could
happen I don't know I just don't see a
scenario where rim in its current state
can march through the next few quarters
turning in terrible results every
quarter and deliver blackberry 10 in q1
2013 and have it be a successful product
I just don't see that as being a viable
roadmap for them oh and by the way
speaking of their their line on why it's
a good thing they're launching 1 2013
it's like well there's a lot of noise in
the queue for there's always you know
chatter and there's all these you know
companies vying for attention for the
holiday quarter so if we you know wait
and launch in q1 then we'll have
everybody's attention to ourselves and
we'll have a better launch yeah okay
nobody wants to buy phones for Christmas
and nobody ever announces anything at
CES in January now right exactly nobody
yeah well see that's the thing so rim is
lining itself up to maybe be at CES in a
big way maybe they'll try and do
something at CES I mean how weird would
that be that could be an event for them
the weird thing about rim at trade shows
CES included is that they always come
with this huge fancy booth and don't
announce anything yeah that's true with
CES certainly truth mwc where they they
they ran out like almost an entire hall
to themselves and then don't show
anything and the ctia is as well so yeah
maybe maybe that could be their big
coming-out party I don't think you know
I posited before that maybe we see
something big from the fall CGI a show
which is enterprise-focused and they're
keynoting there I think their cio is is
keynoting there but at this point
because of the delay i think that's
probably a little early for them right
um okay well actually you know as long
as we're talking about Chris's
predictions could we talk before we get
into the big fight that we're going to
have about the Galaxy Nexus we talked
about this rumor that the Bloomberg put
out about
I was on developing and an android phone
android based phone want to talk about
the fact that I'm in Oracle is that is
that what you're driving at I I have
been calling this for like a year now
I'm various podcast including twits
forecast we can go in and watch watch
the video which is preserved for all of
posterity to see uh is come on it's
pretty obvious I mean I can't take too
much credit for this right like come out
with an android-based tablet it's it's
not a far stretch to think that you can
come out with android based phone as
well they have the the ecosystem that
they've been working on I mean the way I
know I've talked about this a lot before
but the way they sort of set themselves
up with Amazon Appstore ended up being
really brilliant when they first
announced the apps from like what are
you doing amazon this is stupid nobody's
gonna care about this turns out they
they knew exactly what they were doing
and they really executed well on it and
now why not take full advantage of it I
think Amazon is one of the few companies
in North America that is positioned to
make a meaningful entrance into the
cellular market and that's saying
something because it's probably one of
the most difficult markets in the world
to break into well that's the question
right is how does like if Amazon does
decide to do this and their whole route
so far has been let's do our own thing
and you know screw everybody else we're
just gonna make how we want to make it
and market it through amazon.com but
like the phones don't really sell that
way in the US so right ahead are they
gonna have to show up and beg at
verizon's feet and say carry this phone
even though we have this otherwise kind
of non functioning relationship so I
think I think they have a couple things
going for them one is uh they have the
amazon wireless portal which is pretty
successful and i think they can make a
go at just selling through that as a
channel and of course amazoncom is kind
of important but uh Rick but nobody
spends seven hundred dollars on a cell
phone in the u.s. right but it so you
know they already have these
relationships built up through launching
whispernet right so they they have a
legacy relationship with sprint they
have an active relationship with AT&amp;amp;T oh
dude verizon by sprint or sprint oh my
god amazon by sprint
or tmobile about that think about that
think about it no I I'm hey I'm totally
on board sprint or or tmobile they could
amazon i think could probably relatively
easily swallow either one of those
companies whole Wow and that would well
so I mean the reason I brought it up her
the idea is you know what is Amazon's
metric for success in launching a phone
right you know with the kindle you know
they're gonna make some money on the
hardware at once they hit you know scale
and get there you know supply chain
running smoothly and they're gonna make
money on you know selling their services
on you know the video the music and you
know just buying stuff on the thing from
amazon it's a really good system for
that actually but you know is amazon
hoping to get you know ten percent
market share it's like what is what is
there need to get into the phone
business what what does it get them what
do they what what or why would they be
screwed if they didn't I think that
because of the amount of development
they've already put into the fire the
cost of entry for Amazon is a lot lower
than it would be for a lot of other
companies uh so a you know even if they
just look at it as an experiment IIIi
think that there's there really isn't a
whole lot to lose and I think they can
do some very compelling things around
the kindle branding but yeah i mean like
at the end of the day you're absolutely
right carriers still rule the US market
and amazon is going a very difficult
time getting around that unless they do
by a t-mobile or sprint um and I
wouldn't put it past them I really want
we know that that DT would still like a
regardless of what they say on the
record i'm sure they would still like to
sell t-mobile if the opportunity
presents itself and amazon is one of the
few companies is probably in a position
to make that happen yeah and i think
that the reason i think this is really
interesting is because the whole content
play they made at the kindle fire right
where it's like the it's the razor and
then their content is the blades that
makes them all the money it makes so
much more sense even with a phone than a
tablet because it's the thing you have
with you all the time and we all buy
apps and we all buy content and if they
can have this thing that's in your
pocket on you at all times in your
buying everything through amazon like
that business prop
zishan makes even more sense for them to
sell a phone possibly the loss leader
than a tablet does which is why I think
it it makes a lot of sense yeah I just
think a tablet is so much better for
consuming Amazon's digital content than
a phone I mean yeah maybe not for music
but I mean is music really a big play
for amazon I mean I know they've got the
store but I don't think people are you
know desperate to buy music from
amazon's mp3 store desperate no but if
you have a device it's there yeah and
cloud player is good uh you know they
certainly have the infrastructure in
place to support all this they're you
know they're ends drm free so you know
whatever what are they gonna call it
though that's what I want to know is it
the kindle spark cuz if it's not I'm
gonna be really angry it's gotta be
looking to spark I mean the kindle match
would that be good to shed well gosh
this is spark they might run into some
some trademark problems with Chevy dick
maybe they'll by Chevy maybe no gloss a
phone hey maybe they'll by Chevrolet and
turn it into a phone company that's a
torch oh that's blackberry nevermind
maybe they'll buy rim maybe the way yeah
amazon has been associated with i'm in
rumors for a solid yeah 30 uh so yeah
maybe that's still gonna happen who
knows man um okay I it'll come and I
it's just you know I'm gonna tell
everybody not to buy one because you
could get an android phone that's
running a newer version of the OS that's
fully participating in the ecosystem
like the Galaxy Nexus like Galaxy Nexus
this is gonna get interesting sparks are
gonna hi yeah you plan on defending
Vlad's point of view don't you that's
exactly what I plan on funny but before
we get into that argument we do need to
talk about the the band that was imposed
and then lifted uh yes it is now lifted
in the Galaxy Nexus now available so it
was temporarily unavailable and pulled
from the Google Play website thanks to
Apple winning and injunction against it
for patent
and the patent in question related to
searching on the phone and supposedly
Google is going to be rolling out and
over the air software update to
basically change its functionality and
possibly remove the functionality of
when you search for something on the
phone it also brings up local results
like Gmail and apps and so on and so
forth um I mean I can't speak to the you
know the legal stuff and the validity of
the patent and who's going to win there
but i can say that i have been using
local search on a phone since the visor
phone so there's that yeah i mean many
of the the patents that Apple asserts in
its in its various lawsuits around the
world are a decade or more old right so
this isn't necessarily an iphone patent
it could be a mac OS 9 or a backhoe is a
pad right right like one of the one of
the patents in the apple motorola case
dated back to I think 94 so um it's
something to do with the notification
screen and Android so yeah I mean I
pants is that's an indiscretion there's
actually a great piece on the site right
now which you should read but not until
this show is over because I don't want
to lose your attention but if you go to
the top of our site and look on the side
you'll see a patent piece that is live
that has been contributed to by the
lovely Nilay Patel and Matt makari I
believe who are our they updated it with
new information from the path the time
it was originally published and all the
comments from this is my necks are still
there I actually went through and
cleaned up a bunch of dupes stuff and
came across a comment from Richard
Stallman actually Wow which seems legit
legitimately him up so I mean I don't
know the local search thing i do want to
take the opportunity to complain that
like Google search on Android for
searching Google totally fine i use it
all the time but and there are not a lot
of phones where I find that like use
typing into search locally is convenient
or at all I know a lot of people use it
on the iphone i find it slow and a pain
like windows mobile blackberry and webos
all did a better job and bass did a
better job of like just start jamming on
your keyboard to find stuff on your
phone and I wish that I wish I enjoy to
get there and now who knows how it's
going to work with the software updates
that's supposedly coming right in fact
we just talked about this a couple weeks
ago I think right the the engineer
responsible for just type at palm is now
back at Apple he came from Apple went to
Palma now he's back at Apple so via the
nexus of no pun intended of the
universal search world is it's in
cupertino reina Wow I'm sorry I didn't
mean to do that that was I I'm not
kidding when I say that was
unintentional I kind of I really don't
wanted to use the term next I kind of
agree that like it doesn't really matter
this seems like a feature that nobody
cares about I don't like I see people
everyone I know with an iphone has
basically forgotten the fact that you
can swipe left from the home screen to
get to the local search and everything
it's just like you know I you Siri for
some of that stuff now but not really
but it's just I don't know I feel like
it's faster to do almost anything else
then try to search that for something
you know Anna such a convenient thing
yeah yeah could be done really well I
out how deeply this update will go and
if it's going to affect third-party
applications as well but one thing that
I i noticed when i was testing a jelly
bean galaxy nexus is that when you're
doing the voice search you can you know
you can turn on and off different search
providers and like so for instance
foursquare plugs into it so you can
search for square places with your voice
or with text of course and I don't know
if those are going to be affected as
well but that is is really cool like the
fact that that companies like Yelp and
Foursquare so and so forth can plug into
that that system I need to try that
it's pretty cool or yeah okay uh so the
other thing about the Galaxy Nexus is a
Christian glad put up a very contentious
piece a point-counterpoint pink counter
ping what are we calling it pink a pink
and this happened yeah I just want to
say this happened amazingly quickly you
like you both clearly had this in the
can like ready to go minutes after
somebody suggested you're like oh it's
done here we go here we go I've been
restless my whole life so this is just
glad being a go-getter I I would like to
be able to take credit for this but it
was sunday sunday afternoon and i said
hey you know sometime we should do this
thing about the fact that the Galaxy
Nexus sucks that's not what I said cuz
the galaxy next dose I'm praising um and
and like 15 minutes later Vlad emailed
me an entire argument that I I responded
to and then we ended up turning into a
piece and yeah why not monday so yeah it
was basically 24 hour turnaround time
okay so Chris you get you get one minute
explain why the Galaxy Nexus is not the
best android smartphone so I think I can
best sum this up with my final pull
quote in the piece which is that I
learned to stop worrying and love the
galaxy s3 used to be in the galaxy s2
days or in the HTC Rezound days that
that I looked at skins as a scourge on
the Android ecosystem that needed to be
eliminated all costs and what I've now
realized is that we've entered a very
different phase we talked a little bit
about this last week but we've entered a
very different phase in androids
existence right there is a OSP there's
the open source project which which
maintains the the core ultra plain
vanilla android root not even Nexus
devices are our stock Android if you
want to use AOSP as your basis their
Google Experience devices that are based
on AOSP what I'm saying is that we're
getting to the point where we need to
elevate the the galaxy s3 for instance
to the same parallel as a Nexus device
galaxy s3 is running a samsung
experience that is based on Android just
as a Galaxy Nexus is running a google
experience that is based on Android and
they can both run Android binaries but
Samsung na you know used to be that
samsung will get left out of the part
because they're designers were so bad at
making a skin a UI but it's gotten to
the point with the gs3 where that's no
longer the case is it it's a
good-looking UX and it works very well
and I can no longer conclusively say
that I prefer stock ICS to what I see on
the gs3 of course i'd like to have
jellybeans I mean I'm course I've used
the android 4.1 gal connect your phone
it's still don't get me wrong still
great phone and 4.1 is great but it is
not enough better than four-point-oh for
me to drop back to that lower baseline
of hardware that the Galaxy Nexus
provides just to get it I need LTE I
need 18 TLT I like the better display
and the camera on the galaxy night
camera yeah is the worst camera of any
flagship phone manufactured in the last
two years so there I've said my piece so
okay we need to break out there there's
two arguments here um one argument is
like the Galaxy Nexus software is old
and tired God says it's hardware excuse
me is old and tired which is kind of
hilarious because it's less than a year
hold still but the camera is terrible
and there's only the verizon LTE version
and I mean the sprint LTE version I
suppose but you know melty and sprint
doesn't matter yet and you know I don't
think you're wrong i think the camera is
terrible i'm tired of it and so the
question is can we give those things a
pass if the hardware but you know based
on the quality and software and yeah i
think that jelly bean at least and even
even stock an Ice Cream Sandwich feels
faster and is a better skin so to speak
for Android than what
HTC and Samsung ACC i would agree HTC is
not there yet was sense for gs3 I'm less
convinced a nature UX is very good I
hate the name but but what they've put
together is very good I mean okay so
let's say that there's a new galaxy or a
new Nexus device out tomorrow that is
jelly bean a better screen better camera
LTE basically take a galaxy s3 and have
it running stock jelly bean I mean the
question is does the same argument apply
know if if tomorrow uh Google came out
with a galaxy s3 that was running stock
jelly bean I would absolutely take it
but the difference in quality between
nature UX when Samsung is calling nature
UX and stock Android is now sufficiently
small so that it is possible to overcome
the benefits of owning a Nexus device
with the hardware alone which is what
I'm I'm suggesting with the gs3 versus
the Galaxy Nexus it if you're just
talking about software then yes uh the
Google Experience still wins but it's no
longer a vast canyon of difference like
it used to be in the GS two days I think
the problem is though that for everyone
who's not you know one of the three of
us you buy a phone and you don't buy
another phone until your contracts up
and the problem is like whatever i buy
today is going to be outdated in two
years like that's just how does the
hardware isn't going to be good in two
years when I'm ready to buy a new phone
but if i buy a Galaxy Nexus today the
odds of my phone running the latest
software are just infinitely higher on a
nexus then they would be on the galaxy
s3 and I blame Samsung a hundred percent
for that because if Samsung would come
out and say like we are going to ensure
that you get the updates if not first at
least in a timely manner they'd you know
they'd blow everything out of the water
because that's the only knock at this
point because I agree i think the
software is if not as good really really
close and close enough that it's kind of
a necklet negligible difference um but
it if I have you know four-point-oh now
and then for
one is out and 4.2 might come out in
four point three or five point 0 or
whatever and you're probably still going
to be stuck on four point oh because
that's how it always happened but but so
yes you're absolutely right but but what
I'm saying and and I'm gonna take a lot
of flack for saying this but I at some
point you just need to give up and move
on with reality just that I don't even
think of the gs3 as an Android for
device I think of it running as running
a samsung operating system that's
compatible with Android binaries and the
this the sooner you you forget the
notion that the gs3 is running ICS and
should be running jellybean the the
sooner you can be happy with the gs3 as
a phone and yeah so the thing that I've
been wanting to say on the podcast to
keep myself doing it cuz I was gonna you
know write an editorial but I just
haven't got around to it is we should
stop calling a ice cream sandwich ice
cream sandwich when it's on non-google
devices ice cream sandwiches stock
Android 4.2 le bean is stock Android 4.1
and on those other stuff like the
samsung touchwiz stuff and HTC Sense
that's Android so they're running
Android and you know like Krista they're
compatible to binaries but it's not the
same thing as jelly bean and you just
sort of need to accept that they've
gotten to the point where they're at
least in the same ballpark experience
wise as the stock google experience it's
not you need to stop thinking of these
devices as like you know they took the
stock google experience and then ruined
it with their crap it's that they they
took the stock android base and put
their experience on it and Google does
the same thing they just happen to give
that experience away to other customers
if they want it right mostly not
entirely right like gmail and android
market and and stuff like that i am home
as well like the nexus 7 ships with
chrome i think that that by default if
accompanied grabs they owe SP trunk code
they're not getting chrome they're still
getting the android browser in fact
what's interesting is that jelly bean
does actually have enhancements to the
stock browser even though
the Nexus 7 is in shipping with the
stock browser shipping with chrome in
its place ya know we we totally we wrote
about that that that chrome was not
going to be part of the the android open
source product that's another google app
just like the other google apps and like
they're like chromium is still out there
and you know companies are free to build
their own but if you're not you know
approved for you know the google
experience in google apps and gmail and
everything else on your android phone
that includes chrome like it that
doesn't come for free with android it's
not part of the open source yeah yeah so
it's it's I if you round the Android
ecosystem three or four years and asked
Andy Rubin if he thought that things
were going to go this way I'm pretty
sure he would have said no because it
the way this is ended up playing out is
really weird hey yeah I can't imagine
this was ever Google's intention
particularly with the fire but when you
look at devices like the gs3 where
Samsung has crafted this entire
experience around AOSP and called it its
own they're just a very very small step
away from being able to break free from
the Google Experience entirely which I'm
sure is is is a probably a pain point
for them because they they do need to
get that sign off from ruben and and
they don't have as much freedom as they
would have if they were just going to be
alone so that's it I mean I I find it
very difficult to believe that that was
ever Rubens intention well I think that
Google now is going to be a really
interesting thing to see if all these
other companies that are you know
building their own ecosystems ecosystems
that compete directly with Google's
ecosystems in terms of music stores and
movie stores and even search you know
Samsung's s voice vs google now will
these companies when they move up to
android 4.1 for you know the the buttery
smoothness and all the performance
enhancements will they also be including
Google now and if they don't then I
think that we can say that like there is
the touch with skin the nature UX skin
and there's the jelly bean quote unquote
skin that includes Google stuff the
problem with that though is that in a
design
sense what you're like for third-party
apps they're still developing based on
these new Android guidelines with the
hollow themes and we've got these great
swipe columns now at but it's and that's
all based on for whatever you want to
call it the google experience and so now
what you're getting and this happened to
me and was really jarring with the
galaxy s3 was every app I downloaded
looked kind of unlike the native
experience of the phone because you're
getting things that are designed to look
great on the Galaxy Nexus and to go well
with its fonts and its colors and just
don't work at all with the nature UX and
I think to me that's that's a problem
yeah that that's that's fair and and in
android 4.1 i get the sense that you
know you matias duarte is obviously at a
very heavy hand in shaping the UX of the
platform since he got there but I think
that that's really even more evident in
4.1 than it wasn't for point O which
itself was a big jump and the colors
there's a very methodical approach to
how things are colored in 4.1 it the
colors are very muted and um and you
know frankly pleasing I mean it that the
palette works very well and I would
agree with you that Samsung has not
mastered the art of a pleasing color
palette and and that that's made more
unfortunate by the fact that Samsung has
had has been using amyloids more
extensively and for longer than just
about anybody else and Emma let's have a
tendency to do really weird things with
colors and particularly like oranges and
reds so they tend to really pop and sang
like a lot and but but that was that was
a bigger prominent with the gs2 with the
gs3 I really believe that their
designers are doing the right things I
feel like like Steve Kondik has had an
influence Phil Mickelson from Android
Central tells me that conduct actually
is not working on android at all at
samsung but but I don't know if I find
that very difficult to believe it what
else what do you do the the gs3 sizing
baby
tizen right did the gs3 skin looks so
much like cm7 yeah thought your route
yeah anyway I an amazing I'm back on the
Galaxy Nexus you know since jelly bean
and um I'm really happy with it i miss
LTE and i miss a decent camera and those
might pull me back to galaxy s3 or HTC
One X um but uh you know i just i don't
really like those skins the the galaxy
s3 is better and the fact that it does
you know a proper classic Ice Cream
Sandwich multi-tasking menu I'm happy
with although I really do miss um just
having it be a single button which is
why tell me that I'm crazy to be kind of
interested in the h er atrix HD it looks
pretty good to me my nuts is that okay
no I've spent this whole morning trying
to figure this whole day really trying
to figure out what's wrong with this
phone ah yeah cuz it's it's like why on
earth is at $99 it has it checks all of
the boxes I wanted to check including
what seems to be a really scaled back
skin like my Motorola's skin has always
been really kind of overwrought and
awful but they've scaled it way back and
like i've been using a razr maxx with
ice cream sandwich on it and it's a
giant improvement and they still have
the cool things like smart actions and
you know this comes out with LTE and the
big 720p display and like I I don't know
i'm i'm into this phone yeah i mean if
the processor is terrible and it's slow
and like the skin turns out to be more
over rot and slow than then you know
what we're thinking then sorry about
that then you know that'll suck but like
it's you know a good sized battery it's
right in between the razr and razr maxx
is battery it it's got a great screen
it's got eight megapixel camera like
there's nothing on paper that makes me
go I don't want this like it might be my
next phone so I biggest concern is so
there are there are a couple things
actually this ties back into the Galaxy
Nexus which I'm going to continue a harp
on for many podcasts
but I was surprised at how much the
on-screen buttons bothered me on the
Galaxy Nexus after I've been using the
gs3 for a while which really shocked me
because I'd always assumed that that
this was like you know a big step in the
right direction moving to those soft
buttons but you don't realize how much
screen real estate those buttons
actually take it would be one thing if
the Galaxy Nexus had a longer to split
like an actually physically longer
display then these other devices but it
doesn't just so you just eat up what is
it a hundred pixels or something
permanently devoted to these soft
buttons and motorola's doing that as
well with the razr HD so that's one
thing to think about i guess i don't
know i don't know that i really have
that particular problem i love the
physical buttons on the gs3 like and the
fact that those made it to the US was
the best thing about that phone if you
ask me but yeah but I really I've always
been a fan of the on-screen buttons I
feel like I trained myself just kind of
where to tap no matter what so I don't
really notice and with the capacitive
buttons or whichever it just feels like
it's kind of the same people are saying
it's this giant advantage there were a
couple of comments that were like super
excited about it and I don't really get
that but I don't I think it's I don't
think it's a huge issue well I mean I
just like it because it's a more
intelligent layout right i mean you get
you know the back button turn into a
down button when you got the keyboard up
the menu button appears down there where
it ought to be and it's one tap to
multitasking instead of having to hold
down button if someone were to you know
just give us the Galaxy Nexus is basic
button layout of back home multitasking
and then I don't know hold down back to
get the menu to pop up I'd be perfectly
final physical buttons and getting that
extra screen real estate but I just I
find that it works better to have that
button layout and stock ICS / jellybean
devices are the ones that give me that
button layout actually what I would love
to see and I suspect there's there's
already a rom for the International gs3
that does this and if there isn't there
should be soon because it's really
obvious but what I would like to see is
the menu button fungus
only replaced with multitasking one tap
multitasking and then like reprogram the
ROM so that it it displays the menus in
the action bar like you would expect on
a Galaxy Nexus which can't be that hard
it's got to be just a flag somewhere in
the in the operating system because you
know right now that weird thing about
the gs3 is said that the phone knows not
to show the the the menu buttons in the
action bar at the top and instead
instead reassigns that functionality to
the physical menu button which I've
mixed feelings about I can see why
Samsung did it but I don't know how I
feel about it so they if they just
turned that into a multitasking button
got the operating system display that
the menu button in the action bar is
normal that would be huge I would love
that so uh breaking news apparently the
sprint galaxy s3 got a quote unquote
security update that also happened to
wait for it remove local on device
search results according to android
central haha super fast um and a bummer
but like we said that search sucks
anyway so right yeah like I mean that
could start I mean okay two thoughts one
week should we might start seeing it on
other devices pretty soon and to like
you know if you can push out an update
that quickly really that changes the
core functionality the phone how about
how about some jelly bean action how
about not waiting se wait making its way
to year and a half for that well it just
goes to show you like it proves it you
know it proves what I think everybody
kind of knew already which is that the
what really takes a long time with some
of these rom updates is not the fact
that it actually takes that long but the
fact that there's no there's no
financial incentive for either the OEM
or the carrier to rush that update when
they have newer phones that they'd
rather be selling right that whereas
this update is on a brand new phone that
is at injunctive risk presumably right
so the you know that that's what that's
what got them moving but you know rest
assured you're not going to see jelly
bean updates for the gs3 a month from
now it's going to be six months if we're
lucky so what we
it is like Congress to come out and say
if you haven't updated your phone in
four months you can't sell in America
anymore and then all of a sudden
everybody would update I'm running for
Congress guys that's at yeah I i support
your platform one hundred percent David
I I think this is a good idea I mean I
mean okay we saw I mean you know the
Android for pointing out for the the
eighteen t Galaxy Note um today yeah
actually yeah really out today and I
mean we saw that leave three months ago
and it basically is unchanged since that
leaked three months ago so I mean it's
not just that you know there's not
financial incentive but it's also you
know it's it scarier stuff but I think
Chris you got it exactly right like the
fact that this was at risk for an
injunction as totally what's going on
here yeah but but so so tell us about
your experience with the the Galaxy Note
refresh because you tested it did you
not am I crazy yeah I 10 no no I tested
it we've got got a video up of it and
it's fast and the multitasking works
fine and you know they added a whole
bunch of stuff s note which you know
which is what most of what they're
pushing on this update is so you can
search bowl from alpha and drop draw
shapes and during math equations and you
know it's cute but I still feel like
there's not a strong enough app
ecosystem to support the S Pen for me to
be able to justify owning a giant phone
um but you know all that said I still
have a soft spot for the note I mean I
use it as my main phone for a few days
um and you know as long as you're not
holding up to your head it's fine you've
almost bought that thing like five times
now I know it's just I don't feel one or
two things is going to happen dieter
either you're going to eventually cave
and buy it or I think more likely the
second the note 2 comes out you're going
to own it well isn't the rumor that it's
gonna have an even bigger screen yeah
5.5 inches right Oh 5.5 is just the
beginning just wait till you get into
the sixes that's true the note the note
9 will just be like a table right well
actually you know I'll just I should
just start using the nexus 7 as a phone
yeah
there was a period where if you google
did a Google image search for tablet
phone I was the number one result
holding the original Galaxy Tab 7-inch
up to my head now of course it's you
know there's a million of these things
that have come out but there's there's a
picture of me out there going like hey
with a with a tablet I remember that
picture I've seen a picture that's um
yeah that original oh yeah was a seven
inch device it's easy right like it it's
easy to kind of like consider the 10.1
is the first galaxy tab but no there was
that 2.3 a galaxy tab from a couple
years back and I like the thing about
that and we were talked about this
before typing on that was great typing
out on the the Nexus 7 is great that
it's just really nice it's like a
landscape keyboard on a phone but in a
portrait orientation on a tablet I
really like it and and David correct me
if i'm wrong i think there is a video
floating around of you talking on an
ipad no no it's give me a pad phone I
can neither confirm nor deny no children
that somehow like it was one of those it
was made into a gift just that one scene
of me and just holding up the tablet to
my head and I friends of mine who don't
read The Verge don't know what the
PadFone is have never heard of
technology are sending me this gift to
this day being look look at this three
or so on the internet and that will be
my my legend forever will be that gif of
me being hulu but you know by the time
David by the time you die they're gonna
have the technology to put like a
animated gifs on on tombstones and so
that will actually be on your tombstone
that's um I'm living until that happens
yeah just a matter of time they could do
one of those um I don't know what they
call those those like parallax effect
things were like when you know when you
look back and forth like it it moves I
guess they could turn that made Jeff
into one of those and and that would be
a very low-tech way I can walk across my
tombstone it would be me holding it up
that'd be pretty good so I of course I'm
more of like an e-ink to mr. that's true
i have a question related to this this
software patch and the the ban
one of our commenters asked on the post
we just wrote from the android central
report and said does this affect stuff
like voice actions such as call John or
navigate to Joshua Topolsky house which
I do constantly um does it I actually
don't know cuz that's I mean that's a
really it's the same thing basically
right it's searching your contacts and
the web and your phone book and all this
stuff but it's just not text does it
affect that I don't know until I can
actually test this out on a Sprint
Galaxy Nexus myself directly only one
way to find out it's true it's just to
try to navigate to Joshua Topolsky house
and see what I by later are our chat is
filled with amazing Jeff's right now i
will i will bet you i will bet you one
dollar that samsung has submitted this
patch to all for receiving all five
however many US carriers are carrying
the gs3 right now we're in the next
couple weeks and it's just a question of
how quickly they they approve the
patches sprint was first but uh i
guarantee you so it's good to be a
verizon customer right now is what
you're saying cuz you'll ever see the
patch or a chef yeah uh ya know this
will actually be a very interesting test
let's let's wait and see how long it
takes eighteen t and verizon who are
notoriously the slowest for for
approving these firmware updates let's
see how long it takes them to push these
out i'm really curious hmm yeah well
speaking of carriers dragging their feet
if you haven't read neil eyes editorial
five years after the iphone carriers are
the biggest threat to innovation you
absolutely must yeah but that's all i
have to say i mean it's it's it's full
of truth and goodness and like we've got
examples just from this week about it
like so they rise and lock the
bootloader on the galaxy s3 why I mean
you know that they're protecting you
know their customer service reps from
dealing with Android hackers I guess is
the reasoning but nobody else is
bothering to do it it's just verizon and
it's you know it
it's a hurdle that everybody can get
over but it's still like wah wah why are
you bothering well yeah you yeah and the
droid incredible 4G LTE is an awesome
example of that too because it's like it
hcc made a bunch of really good phones
and you said this in your view DHEC made
a bunch of really good phones and then
it seems like Verizon Colin was like
well we want that but not as good
because we have these other phones we
want to sell so just make us kind of a
crappier version yeah and so the thing
that drives me crazy about the droid
incredible 2 he did we talk about it on
the podcast last week like it could be a
good phone it it's really close to being
a really good phone I'm like you know
the form factor would be really nice for
some people but like sense and then some
of the extra stuff on top of that just
Shh try as we create and so if the
question is does it make well one of my
questions is does it make an appropriate
resound successor and I'm not sure it
does because the Razon is 720p and this
is qhd right right it makes an
appropriate droid incredible successor
right right which you know it's called
droid incredible so there you go yeah um
yeah I mean I mean obviously you guys
read knee-highs piece have you got any
additional insight or stuff you want to
say about it either I know it was talked
about quite a bit on the verge cast so
we're kind of getting repetitious here
but yeah yeah it's just it it it really
hit home uh and and it's it's spot on
and and I think that you know I wish
that I had a very succinct follow-on to
how we can go about fixing this and
Neela and I have been talking about this
past few days you know how can we how
can we move the industry and the
discussion in the right direction in a
positive direction that doesn't make
everyone want to cry yeah iiiii don't
have the answer yet but um you know
there are so many extremely powerful
political forces at play here that
prevent this industry in the u.s. from
being competitive in a way that is truly
to the consumers benefit that it's very
it's just kind of depressing
and there's don't get me wrong there's
some great people in in in high places
that are fighting for the consumer
people like a free press and public
knowledge are are in Washington and
they're there they're doing an excellent
job what I'm on all their PR blast and
they're doing a really good job of
calling out the the questionable choices
that are being made by the SEC in the
DOJ in the end the lobbying forces that
are trying to work to get the wrong
piece of legislation push through but as
an uphill battle and and there are many
you know the the failure of the AT&amp;amp;T
t-mobile deal was a very powerful
pro-consumer message but actually this
is a segue that it didn't intend to get
to but we kind of stumbled into it do it
it looks like the FCC is now going to
approve Verizon's purchase of AWS
spectrum from a consortium of cable
companies spectrum co which we've been
writing about pretty extensively for the
past six months and the reason why this
is such there are several reasons this
is such a controversial deal one is that
there are other carriers that are better
suited to get this spectrum including
t-mobile they were a very very loud
opponent of this deal as a result until
a deal was struck in the past couple
weeks that would end up like it's a
multi-part deal it's kind of like an NBA
trade deal there there are seven there
are seven different things that need to
fall into place in order for this this
tragic transaction to conclude but
basically t-mobile would end up getting
a pretty significant chunk of that AWS
spectrum if Verizon were allowed to
complete the spectrum code deal but the
other really controversial part of it is
that tied into the spectrum acquisition
there are deals that would have verizon
cross-marketing its services in comcast
and time warner locations and vice versa
and the concern there is that it dis
incentivizes verizon from building out
fios in locations that are currently
served by Comcast or Time Warner Cable
and the then result is they end up with
less competition for really important
vital services like a landline broadband
and so this is you know it that there
are two different organizations that are
looking at this yielders the FCC that is
looking at the spectrum side then
there's the DOJ that's looking at the
competition implications the DOJ looks
less poised to sign off on this deal
then the FCC does right now and I think
that kind of mirrors public sentiment
this is the spectrum side of it isn't
quite as controversial as the the copy
the the cross marketing deals are so and
DOJ is expected rule in August it's it's
a mess as is every spectrum policy thing
in Washington but we're kind of keeping
an eye on it right now we'll let you
know how it goes bottom line is that
it's a very scary time to be in this
business like every single deal that
happens in Washington has literally a
hundred different implications some
which are short-term some which are very
very long term and I always try to find
ways to get people engaged in these
policy stories when I write about about
them on the site can be very difficult
because it's hard to express why this
stuff matters you know five or ten years
down the road but you know we have some
big spectrum auctions coming up I think
there are some later this year i'm not
mistaken and and we we just need to stay
engaged on this stuff because it the the
spectrum crunch over the past couple
years i think is really sort of put this
in the spotlight but people still
haven't made the connection between i
can't get data on my iphone and all
these weird deals that are happening in
Washington every single day and yeah the
carriers have all the power innovation
is being stifled I totally agree with
everything Neil I said in that piece and
it's all tied into these weird policy
things that are happening constantly so
it's yeah it's it's not just like I
can't get data on my iPhone I've got no
jeebies it's you know I'm paying 25
cents a pop for text messages yeah I
can't do I don't
interoperable video chat it's I can't
take my phone from tmobile and use it on
sprint like oh well you know that's
because they've got incompatible
spectrum and you know they're using
different radio technologies opposed
exactly and those are those are problems
that aren't unfixable those are like
that you don't have to accept that
baseline if a problem like you know
phones having different incompatible
radio technologies is like oh well that
explains that well but there's still
something that made that happen it's um
I've heard it's like words they played I
when I was when I was teaching English
like you know that I try and like
explain why some you know short story
matter you know why is he on the bridge
and like well the author chose to put
him there those words didn't just
magically appear on the page against the
authors will link the author chose to
make that happen and these incompatible
radio things like when they were setting
up that stuff sure there's there's a few
things that are like unintended
consequences but by and large the
company's verizon and AT&amp;amp;T especially
they're sitting with pretty much where
they want to be they want to get more
spectrum they want to you know change
some stuff around but the sort of
technical hassles that you experience
and the pricing that you're experiencing
on AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon especially like they
set it up that way and they want it that
way it's not like you know that's just
oh that happened I guess we had no
control of that that's a sick world that
we live in the world that we live in is
a world that they helped set up and we
could set up a different world if we
wanted to AT&amp;amp;T has been fighting very
hard in Washington over the past two
years to prevent 700 megahertz
interoperability from becoming law and
it wasn't until earlier this year that
the FCC agreed to even look into the
issue so that's that's a perfect example
right that that we could have we
absolutely could have radios that can
support all these 70 megahertz bands the
technology exists but because 18teen
verizon are such powerful lobbying
forces and are pretty much able to get
what they want that issue has been that
can has been kicked down the road
repeatedly and it's not the type that
there are no technical issues but the
impetus to solve those technical issues
has been significantly impeded by the
fact that 18 teen verizon see no need to
solve them and and actually we wrote
about this a few weeks ago ceasefire
which is a really small carrier in the
southeast filed a pretty damning lawsuit
with some wild claims that AT&amp;amp;T and
Qualcomm and I think Motorola and they
named a bunch of company as as as
colluding on preventing 700 megahertz
interoperability from from coming to be
and it's really interesting reader it
reads like high drama and I think it is
and I I truly believe that summer all
this stuff is is is happening behind the
scenes that's what I thought was the
most interesting just go kill her yeah
right that was what I thought was so
interesting that knee lights piece was
uh that he had spoke to a verizon
spokesperson and this is after he's
talking about how if companies like HTC
and Samsung were able to compete at the
consumer level the carriers to turn into
dumb pipes and then they'd have to
compete and that would be you know good
for all of us and terrible for them and
then the response is not oh there are
technical challenges the response is
from a verizon spokesperson there's a
business model that needs to be cared
for uh and so it's like that's that's
the most I don't know it's about a
damning a thing as you could say I think
where you get to this point where it's
like that's all the matters like we make
a ton of money from making your life a
lot harder and there's no reason for us
to keep or for us to stop making a ton
of money so why would we right yeah yeah
I think the most striking thing that
Neil I pointed out in that piece and
this is something that we all need to
remember is that these companies don't
own this spectrum they are licensing it
from the federal government and in turn
it is property of the American people so
it is on us as US citizens to demand
that these these companies be good
stewards of the of this of the spectrum
which is a national resource and a
precious resource that can twist Chris
Chris I'm sorry I want to pay attention
what you're saying but I think I see
some American Idol news and so I need to
go some American Idol news
I just say I'd like the problem with
this this whole issue is it's really
hard to connect the effects on the
consumer with the really boring dry
spectrum discussion and like you know we
rant about it on the on the show we
write about it on the site but you know
unless we get to like a sope internet
shut down kind of moment with this stuff
I mean one we need a unified policy to
promote and to like there needs to be
like a real visceral connection between
the pain that you know we're feeling and
like what's causing it and there's you
know three or four steps between those
things that where it's really easy to
rationalize you know rationalize it away
and right it's just you know easier to
you know pay attention to the next top
new phone that's that's coming out and
not think about the crazy Mecca nations
that limit it and keep it on one carrier
and so on I feel like the answer is we
need to just tell everybody to go to
Europe for like 20 minutes ah because
they seem to have nailed it um and this
occurs to me every time I'm editing a
review from one of the guys in the UK
and they never really mentioned the
price and they never mention like a
particular carrier and I'm always like
oh you forgot those parts and it's like
no they didn't if it's just you just buy
the phone and then you use it wherever
you want to and it's not you just it's
just not a thing that they're terribly
separated from each other you're David
the stock response that someone from the
CEA or ctia or any other American
organization or carrier in the cellular
business will tell you the stock
response is that's all well and good but
in recent years the US has innovated far
faster than Europe or even Asia in the
wireless space and the rebuttal to that
is yes but it has evolved and innovated
in a very bizarre and consumer hostile
way and we're starting to send a bottle
to that is your mom yes the rebuttal to
that and all other arguments is your mom
no I mean there are a couple dieter
infects your
point earlier about how do you get this
in consumers faces make the connection
between spectrum and real-world problems
I think that we're starting to see some
some very some very real-world effects
that any consumer can relate to you
right one is in in the city of Chicago
as in many other places around the
country New York City certainly you
cannot you literally cannot between the
hours of 8am and 6 p.m. on a weekday get
HSPA data in downtown Chicago it's not
just slow it doesn't work I mean it
literally doesn't work and I this has
been going on for at least year now and
that's why I can't go back from an LTE
phone so that's one effect right where
you get where consumer can say why cant
i send this email on my iphone oh let me
tell you why it's because our entire
system is is hosed and you need to think
so that's what I'm the other is you know
to say t-mobile being unable to get the
iphone or US cellular being being unable
to carry almost any competitive device
outside the gs3 which congrats to them
by the way because that's pretty big one
for them but yeah I think that there are
finally some very consumer-facing ways
that you can relate wide spectrum
matters and why it's important and I
just should have podcasts down with that
no I mean you know we're gonna we're
gonna wrote about this again in three
weeks and we're still not going to have
a revolution that's fine well we'll have
these small steps and hopefully we'll
get them moving in the right direction
at least a couple of times ok oh and
actually I want to talk about good news
we're gonna end up good news this week I
swear that is the goal and the first
piece of good news David is the optimus
4x HD from LG the first piece of cake is
it LG learned how to make cell phones so
you're saying basically yeah yeah it's
it's like it's that bad right no it's
it's actually it's great on like I did
it was it's been really fun because I've
reviewed a bunch of different LG phones
over the last you know six months and
they always had
one thing just horribly wrong like the
the LG nitro remember when I wrote the
review like the first comment said so
basically this phone with cyanogenmod
would be the best thing ever because the
software was just awful and then I
reviewed the spectrum which was super
fast and had a really great display and
just you just touched it and wanted to
stop touching it forever and then
they've had a couple of other phones
that were underpowered or had outdated
software or both or whatever and then
finally you read the spec sheet of the
optimus 4x HD and it's like oh my gosh
it has all of the things that I want it
to have it has new software it has a new
processor it has good build quality it's
big and has a nice display all this
stuff and I writing this review was was
almost bizarre because I got to the end
of it was like wait I didn't really hate
anything and I just I kind of expected
to having reviewed a bunch of these
phones and I got to the end and it was
like they did all of the things that
they're supposed to do uh they their
software has gotten a lot better again
it's the same trend we're seeing with
HTC not as much but Samsung and a couple
of other companies kind of pulling their
skins back and saying like androids
doing a really good job we think we can
augment it in certain places and
sometimes they're right and sometimes
they're wrong but it's a much better
approach and the hardware has gotten
almost universally with high-end phones
it's just so fast at this point that the
Android has kind of become the limiting
factor in the performance of a cell
phone so as long as you have kind of the
recent high-end specs you're going to be
fine there but I really enjoyed using
this phone and there are a number of
cool nifty things about it I really like
the way it does NFC on some of the
software and i'm just i'm a fan and i
don't know when the phones coming to the
US it hasn't been announced here it's
just in Europe and I believe Asia right
now but if it does like it's it's a real
competitor for the first time and
they've had big splashy launches for
phones that I don't think we're very
good and this one could actually be
awesome well this time LG had a big
phone in the US I mean like a real like
oh wow LG in the US Wow g2x I think with
less yeah ok Jenny died while on it
sling
I mean when when the g2x was announced
everyone was like who this is going to
be like the hot like you know it because
at that time like dual core was still
like a really novel concept and uh it
appeared to run something close to stock
froyo and so that that was a really big
deal and it ended up just being a
complete dud of a phone I owned one for
a while and it just it brings back
nightmares but LG is weird because
they've always been you know a half step
behind the the big names in android
right like they're half step behind
Samsung they're half step behind HTC but
not really I mean they were the first to
the table with a dual-core device
they're right there in the in the quad
core race they've been doing 720p as
long as anybody to you right so they
just need to get their act together and
produce a a holistically good device and
maybe this is a this is the turning
point for them and they need a hit I
mean LG I mean to your point eater I
mean they haven't had a meaningful
hidden in ages yeah and and I are you
sad that you're not going to be able to
say that about the LG vue coming to the
US the this letter that's that was a
cheap shot yeah yeah the yeah for by 3i
love that um no I i'm actually i'm
intersted in trying the 4x HD i would i
would be pleased especially now that you
know i'm apparently with the galaxy
nexus happy being on HSPA again i'm
really not but i got Wi-Fi most places
one last thing i wanted to bring up the
windows phone 7.5 refresh the tango
update is coming to lumia 900 which is
fine that's great on ATT but as mad as
some people might be about lumia not
getting windows phone 8 and as unhappy
as I maybe with some of the core apps
that i need the fact that nokia is
coming out with pink version before an
orange version like I just give up or
dead I don't care pink is on you niggas
new white row these are also not going
to be on sale ever because i'm going to
buy all of them
every single you're buying out Nokia's
entire stock of pink of me yes no
question no mines gonna be next right
they're not gonna they're not gonna give
you my orange phone they're gonna come
out with a zune brown version oh you
know what's gonna happen no but but
here's the thing about the zune brown is
that it was a double shot brown
underneath green acrylic like a clear
acrylic right so it had kind of like a
cool look to it I guess did it though
did it cool and air quotes okay here we
go I I don't know no I would totally use
a pink Lumia and and feel very good
about it I truly believe that pink is
the new white I agree with you dieter if
they came out with like a bright orange
I would be very happy with that as well
but I could see going with the pink I
Amy I could but I mean I'll just I'll
just wish it was orange the whole time
so yeah I never yellow yellow would be
amazing too yep would be cool actually
wasn't there there was supposed to be a
yellow lumia 800 ya did it disappear I
think it did it may have disappeared so
i think i think the yellow was one of
the colors that was supposed to be
glossy instead of matt and it fell off
the face of the earth and never came out
maybe or maybe I'm making up this entire
story but I seem to recall there was
something about it taking a while for it
to come out it was gonna be in a second
batch I can't remember yeah ya do ya I
think Nokia makes these Lumias in
batches of like a couple weeks each and
they switch between colors and I don't
know what happened said the yellow
doesn't it yeah I don't think they ever
got around to the yellow which is a
bummer because that was that would've
been awesome yeah you won't i pulled out
this week that i love all over again and
want to use full time is the n9 there
are two reasons for that and neither of
them have anything to do with me go one
is the size which yeah is actually it's
it's like the perfect size for that
style phone the 900 that
the more I used Lumia 900 the more I
realized that it is actually a bit big
for that style of device and the the
integrated glass it is missing from the
909 and 800 both have that too is that
the cyan that they use on the n9 is
little darker than it is on the 900 and
in my opinion actually looks a little
bit better so physically i think that
the n9 is actually the purest and best
implementation of that design language
um again neither of these have anything
to do with me go whatsoever but but i
just want to point out that it's a it's
a physically gorgeous device you sound
like josh Josh just bought I believe on
ebay a palm pixi and has definitely
decided that he's going to use it as his
phone forever and I feel like equally
bad for both of you that you like oh he
gave up on it I think already did he
already has already done with it hasn't
even come yet and he's over it yeah no I
think he lasts about 12 hours and had
six those hours he was asleep I mean
they're so cheap the Pixies are so cheap
you can get unlocked GSM Pixies on
amazon for like fifty bucks sixty bucks
so I mean like what why wouldn't you own
one of these in fact I'm gonna buy one
right now since this this show is over I
that is the first thing I'm doing is
buying a pixie I like it ah question
though related to me go should I care
about this nokia staff leaving to build
me go phones thing the java thing yeah
uh though i think this is probably going
to have about as much success as the
Phoenix project or whatever that webos
thing is but but Java has one thing
going for it which is that I think this
is gonna be another one of my crazy
theories I loved about these crazy
theories on the show I believe that
Jolla is actually a nokia skunk works
well it like it's a shell opening that
and it's it's it's like they're they're
go bag like if everything goes to hell
in a handbasket at nokia jolla is there
a jection seat i and III think that that
they are starting the staff up jalwa in
the event that they need to throw all
caution to the wind and and bail out at
all does yeah this is it was totally
like a
clear and present danger situation like
like Elop he he's got plausible
deniability on it he sort of you know
those guys are gone then someone brought
about thing and he said you know I I'm
gonna prove this thing in very vague
language and I don't want to hear
anything more about it and now there's a
whole bunch of you know lower you know
old school nokia people that are totally
running it I totally see it I'm with you
yep that's that's I'm telling you man
it's gonna be a I think it could be a
beautiful mission for it is gonna
introduce it it's gonna be amazing if no
key did some really amazing things with
the user experience in the in the in the
end nine that have been completely lost
and and when we when we first talked to
nokia execs about how they're going to
move some of the their UX innovations
from from harmison to Windows Phone they
gave some wishy-washy answer is on like
oh well you know we have we have a lot
of say in the future of Windows Phone
and how that's going to develop and you
know it's we want to see some of those
innovations come to a nose phone and in
Windows Phone a don't really see any
influence from me go whatsoever and and
that's a shame because they did some
really cool things so maybe they're now
saving those directions for jello but
again this is all in that little note
i'm wrapping up because we've got stuff
to go to tonight i believe so thank you
very much David for joining us on
podcast Vlad's absence and if people
want to follow you on twitter i'm gonna
get it wrong it's Pierce David Wright
