I am here at CES 2012 with one of the
most exciting products of the show this
is the OLPC XO tablet it is the
successor to the original oil pc laptop
and just like the original laptop this
is a rugged tablet it's an 8-inch tablet
going to take a look at the hardware now
with some help from our LPC's CTO ed
McNerney sure we've got you know fairly
standard port configuration but with
some options that are designed really
for the the audience's that we're trying
to serve so you have a standard USB
full-size USB port for thumb drive
sneaker that's really important where we
go we've got a headphone and microphone
jacks has the same stereo input and
output that we have our laptops the
microphone jack is also designed to be a
DC sensor jack so you can hook up
thermometers or other kinds of data
collection tools a USB on-the-go port
which you can use for connecting
peripherals it's a micro USB so it's
also available as a charging port
charges to charge it through a regular 5
volt port the problem is even though
there's a lot of tablets that use that
as their only charging option it's
really limited it's great if you've got
a wall wart adapter and a wall to plug
it into right we go places where there
are no walls so we have a dedicated
charging port as well that like our
laptops is designed to take anything
from 10 to 25 volts you can throw any
kind of router options a lot of power
options here you have a hand crank I've
always got a grating we've always got a
crank we've had this crank forever yeah
everybody remembers our hand cranks the
problem with the hand crank actually has
not been a hand crank but it's been the
laptop because the laptop takes too much
power okay so by now going to an ARM
processor and crab form factor sure
weekend you're gonna hold that good for
I'll hold it like right so how am I
going to know it's going to see you
ready to keep going little faster keep
going keep going to tonys doing
alright night okay so now there's a
little light on inside here that's hard
to see now I see it okay it's orange and
it yes and that means it's charging I
don't you are charging the battery and
so how many times for charging well it's
about we've finally gotten up to where
we think we can get about a 10 to 1
ratio so you do this for six minutes you
get an hour of usage it's not really a
primary power source but it's a good way
of demonstrating that any kind of
irregular erratic dirty messy power that
you can generate is really suitable for
the for the tablet all right and so
you've also got a different lid also got
a cover that works like a solar panel
and that is a solar panel so solar panel
with a thin pack battery behind it so
while you're using the tablet you can
set this out in the Sun and then this is
a 4 watt solar panel so if you've got to
watts or less on the tablet means that
this can get a two-to-one ratio you
leave this outside for an hour you can
get two hours of runtime here once you
get this all charged up you can snap it
on the back of the of the tablet that
one's not working right now how about
that one roof this one's not working
right now but when you have it it will
have these little it has a couple little
connectors because these screws here are
the screws that you use to take the
tablet apart because like our laptops is
designed to be easily disassembled and
repair but there are also electrical
connections so you can put this into a
cover and then make electrical
connections here and here and actually
run off the battery as they have that's
really are as well okay so 8 inch screen
you're going to have an option for a LCD
I mean for a pixel Qi routes are
readable this is a regular LCD right now
1024 x 600 resolution 768 support a free
ratio okay great so let's talk a little
bit about the software i know you're
you'd like to demo it because it's a
little bit early well what we do you
know again we give people a lot of
options on our software so you know
we're showing here is the linux based
software that we've used on our existing
laptops this is called sugar the desktop
is called sugar how people could use a
ground desktop or can use a regular
environment as well but it gives people
the choice to use a lot of the
educational activities that we've used
in the past
like the measure activity for collecting
data you might want to look at we have a
couple of what we call Wikipedia slices
so these are a subset of Wikipedia in
english and in spanish and these provide
you with complete offline functionality
so you have a substantial reference
library on your own right here so you
can look at an article you know any of
these articles learn about stars this is
safe to the internal storage it's on the
internal storage there there's four
gigabytes of internal storage and this
all takes us about one gigabyte and so
you have an option to add your own data
add your own book sir or whatever so I'm
noticing with the software it's sort of
optimized for desktop use right now are
you guys doing some things to make it
more finger friendly like when we like
this we are eating here you can do
things like to take these applications
some of these applications are existing
unmodified 11 of things we're trying to
do is say you can all you can run the
stuff you already have and you can do
new applications that take advantage of
the pan okay and this is the browser we
don't have any Wi-Fi right now we do
have a browser built in just like we do
with our laptop so you have you have
complete access and the same networking
technologies that we have this is the
wiki long cool well that is a really
nice first look thank you so much well
thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
