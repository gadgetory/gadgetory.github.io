and this is sensory percussion my name
is Caleb Martha I'm the co-founder of
Sun house along with my brother at
launch and we started this company based
on this this product senses percussion
how does it work can you kind of explain
the hardware to software yes so this is
our prototype sensor it's a highly
specialized sensor to listen
specifically to the vibrations on a drum
so it works good on stage in the
presence of loud sounds and it feeds our
software an audio stream that it can
analyze and figure out what you're doing
on the drum and from there so if you
didn't catch that what's happening here
is that the actual sound of the drums is
being picked up by those clamped on
microphones and being translated
instantly into a digital signal which
then is right now being fed into a MIDI
processor when you enter the studio you
can you don't have any limits you can
put whatever sounds you want on your
record but then when you try to go play
it live you're limited by acoustic drums
and the number of limbs you have and so
I was putting triggers on things and
having pads everywhere and I in the end
it was just very frustrating because
it's not drumming in the end it's kind
of like just like driving a car a very
complicated piece of machinery right
when I learned more about signal
processing and machine learning I
realized that there was a way to kind of
were more intimately bridge the worlds
between acoustic individual and so
that's really what we fed into this
project
can't do that with a trigger right and
you can you can also make it so that it
will control an effect on the whole drum
set so I'll have two drums here but
it'll be interesting to see this on a
full kit too when you can have every
drum interacting with each other and
actually see how flexible it is when
there's four different sensors going at
once if everything goes according to
plan with the kick starter the unit
should ship in January of next year</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
