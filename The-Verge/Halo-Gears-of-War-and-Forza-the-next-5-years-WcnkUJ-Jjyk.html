Microsoft's hits help the company sell
over 80 million Xbox 360 but then the
Xbox one had a pretty terrible launch so
Microsoft is betting its future on the
biggest hits of its past let's see how
they're doing so how do you get people
to embrace Gears of War you hire someone
who has been with the game from the
beginning and knows and loves the
franchise more than anyone else just set
the standards we give fans what they
want this is it like this is the apex of
my career I'm totally fine with that
because Gears of War has been amazing to
me and I love that franchise but I get
to work on my favorite franchises not
only my favorite franchise to build but
my favorite franchise to play so you
know that's why I wouldn't got the
tattoo I'm just like I'm okay being
Gears Viking you know and if that's what
I'm known for for the rest of my life
and then when I die they go back there's
some notion about all that's on my you
know thing is they you know helped
create years of war I'm totally happy
with that in 2014 Microsoft acquired the
Gears of War franchise rights and tapped
a small studio previously built to
create new properties for Microsoft the
company rebranded as the coalition and
now is focused entirely on Gears I
always talk about managing soar the
betrayal of expectations right because
if you don't betray their expectations
at all and you give them everything they
think they want then they go like I've
seen this before I already have this
game why do I want to play the new one
it's exactly the same thing if you
betray their expectations too far you
create a completely different experience
people kind of reject it and go like
it's so different it's not even Gears
anymore and I don't want it that's not
the game I want in this fall the
Coalition released a remastered version
of the original Gears of War but it's
big drop comes next year when the team
will ship its first new Gears of War
game this one were assured won't just be
fanservice so part of what you have to
do is as you plan through sort of the
next evolution of your game is you have
to look at managing that betrayal of
expectations ago okay I'm going to
betray them here and I'm gonna betray
them there and what you hope as those
betrayals actually become delight and
surprise over it turn 10 designers have
been releasing reports of games since
2005 making it
oldest most established of the three
studios and it shows we want to change
gaming culture we want to change car
culture and move those into the future
of the last the next 10 years over the
last 10 years we've seen cars go from
something we licensed to being something
where we can be there at the debut of
the most important car that Ford is
gonna debut in the next 20 years and we
were there at its debut that wouldn't
have happened 10 years ago and it's not
because of us it's not because of Xbox
not Microsoft's not for say it's because
of gamers it's because gamers have
become more important turn 10 embraces
iteration believing in regular updates
additions and revisions benefit the fans
the stability allows its leaders to
think not just about the next games but
bar down the line that's what are we
changing in car culture and pop culture
how do we want to ignite car passion in
a younger generation that don't look at
cars the same way that we do my kids
most kids are growing up with screens
not one iPad a laptop a phone I mean
just lots and lots of screens and games
are part of their everyday life that's
the power of gaming I think the car
industry has a leg down the car industry
is selling cars that's really hard to
get a 12 year old engaged with a car
unless it's in a game in one's turn 10
he gets that 12 year old van hooked it
works to meet her expectations
time and again we do this for our fans I
mean if if they weren't here we wouldn't
be here right you know so we definitely
listen to them we survey them we
research with them we bring them in and
play test with them we never stop we
don't burn out but we never stop and so
there's car production always going
there's game design always going there
is work always going on here
where'sa is at its best when it's
closest to reality but in a fictitious
game like halo success can be more
subjective gamers I think even more than
movie fans are fussy and they want
exactly what they want but one of the
first things to emerge from the launch
of Halo 2 was halo 2 sucks calm where
they were just
complaining about all the things that we
destroyed and ruined and meanwhile you
know millions of people were loving it
and inhaling twos sort of fondly thought
of and widely beloved more than I think
most Halo games and so when you make
these little changes and maybe it may be
small to me but it can be super
meaningful to a lot of people halo is
Microsoft's most iconic franchise to a
fault
more than any xbox game Halo fans have
ideas about what makes halo great let's
say you went to see you know you two in
concert right you you definitely want to
hear a couple of big hits you just I
mean that's what you paid for right you
want to hear the new album because
that's what they're promoting but you
also need to be satisfied that you get
there the original hits and I think
that's fine but there's nothing wrong
with that like if you go to your
favorite restaurant it's probably
because there's a few dishes in there
that you absolutely love and there's
nothing wrong with criticizing either
that kind of criticism makes us think
about well what is the value of the tank
what could we do to make it better and
so as long as it's thoughtful criticism
and basically any criticism is valid
it's amazing to have such a passionate
community it's really intense and I
think for us what we focus on is how do
we sort of distilled down to the things
that are important for halo from a
gameplay from a story from a sort of
brand perspective and stay true to those
things knowing that we're going to
experiment and we're going to try some
different things in order to appeal to a
broad fan base 343 industries is
expanding the Halo universe with
everything from spin-off television
programs to companion books to
experimenting with other sometimes
stranger ideas I look at the universe is
our most important character and and so
I think when you look at the books you
don't like tell us so much story in an
FPS and so when you look at the books
the comic books the live-action it
basically just enables us to really
broaden the canvas and how do we make
the universe richer so that when we want
to we can pick up different stories
Microsoft has invested millions of
dollars in these three big franchises
hoping they will attract gamers to Xbox
one but what if they don't
Microsoft has a back-up plan spin-offs
and remakes are expanding into the world
of Windows 10 halo has its own mobile
games the new Gears of War Ultimate
Edition is coming to PC and Windows 10
owners can stream ports in the rest of
their Xbox one to their home computer
for the past decade Microsoft biggest
franchises were the reason to buy into
Xbox for the next decade don't be
surprised if Marcus Fenix and Master
Chief are the best reason to run Windows
