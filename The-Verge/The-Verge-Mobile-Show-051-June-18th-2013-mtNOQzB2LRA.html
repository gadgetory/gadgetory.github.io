51 for the week of jun 18 2013 i'm dan
seifert I'm flats mo and i'm chris
sigler and as you guys know if you can
count that you didn't have to count to
four because unfortunately deters not
with us this week he is taking the week
off to I don't know do better things
what he wasn't he doesn't have let's be
very clear he doesn't have a good excuse
he was just like I'm just not gonna show
up I mean that was am I am I wrong with
that was the visit the email right he's
just like I mean I don't like to talk
about our internal communications you
know on a public forum but yeah that's
pretty much what he said yeah so
listeners if you're not happy with this
decision you go ahead and tweet it ed
theatre and tell them that you're not
happy tweet again i have to say i'm
already dissatisfied with proceedings
because then blew the date this is the
week of the 17th platoon ah so I mean
this is what happens you don't have user
data and we're out of the bone zone let
me for those of you who don't do
podcasts or broadcasting very often we
call it the cold open when you're just
told to go and you're on a live show and
you got to start talking and at least
for most of us it's one of the hardest
things to get right and I constantly
screwed up I don't think I've gotten it
right yet I really had to ruin it I work
better with the hot open personally I'm
like I'm like Bill Hader on SNL when he
does his stuff on character did his
stuff on character because he would
crack up every single time he could
knock it through it without failing and
that's that's that's me on a much less
funny level with uh well I i just want
to point out one thing that is very near
and dear to my heart about today's
episode what makes it so very special
this is episode 51 like dan mentioned my
favorite van Halen album is 5150 which
which I know is a controversial choice
there's that's very very controversial
yeah I mean a lot of you are not Sammy
Hagar people I get it I get it that's
not even van Halen Mets fan Hagar and I
mean I don't want to get into it
evolve quickly I will I will I will
destroy you haha but I mean from
beginning to end I celebrate that entire
album don't get me wrong I don't have a
prom with David Lee Roth but 5150 I do
think is the peak of Van Halen's career
and just point out chris is basically
using today's podcast is a way to
stimulate Twitter conversations nothing
like that I like a little Twitter debate
i can't i can't wait for the day David
Lee Roth fanboys to just attack you on
Twitter right now bring it out David Lee
Roth fanboys exist on Twitter like is
there a generation of people that are on
Twitter that are like hardcore David Lee
Roth fanboys that oh I think that he has
fanboys and fangirls in every segment of
the population I think that they're out
there I think they exist I do I firmly
believe that well all I can say is that
I've never seen Sammy Hagar do a high
kick like David Lee Roth well I I've
never seen David Lee Roth know how to
sing so you know six of one half dozen
the other and now mobile technology on
the verge mojo yes let's uh yeah we
could talk about phones so why don't we
jump right into today's news there was
actually some faux news today huawei
announced the Ascend p6 in london had a
big event this is apparently the
company's new flagship device um it's
really thin it's yet another phone that
claims to be the world's thinnest phone
I feel like we hear this every month or
so from a variety of companies claiming
to be the world's thinnest or whatever
um but you know in any case it's thin
it's thinner than the iphone 5 or the
galaxy s4 so that's always got that
going for it um but it doesn't matter
like i think dan I think I was airing
this know as having this conversation
with tom warren this morning about the
fact that like this phone could have
been two millimeters thick and like it
wouldn't have any effect on the global
distribution of the device i mean i
understand that it's going to launch in
europe is going to launch in asia but no
forgiving two millimeters would
method you're right hey yo you're right
that night that might be a bit of an
exaggeration I'm just like a display
like a paper like like a display
membrane is the entire phone yeah but it
would be that as it may I mean we've
heard since the p1 which correct me if
I'm wrong was announced at CES 2012
we've been hearing Huawei say that they
are going to start to be a really big
deal in North America and it hasn't
happened yet so we'll see well this is a
couple of things to be said here now the
first is that although you push it too
far with two millimeters I absolutely
agree that the measurement of this p6
it's called the p6 right uh yeah looks
like it which is a really subtle way of
evoking the fact that a six millimeters
thick this is aaron from my london team
he got ahold of it he's written up his
hands on impressions on the verge calm
which is on my website you can go and
read and find out about it it's a words
like legit yeah yeah and that joke is
about two and a half years old came from
josh Topolsky and i'll be rehashing it
assists but here's the thing aaron has
the perfect photo way he's got the p6
lined up with the iphone 5 they're
basically sandwich together and you see
them in it's like yes the iphone 5 is
thicker but does it make any tangible
difference whatsoever not at all and
this weather is six millimeters or nine
or ten millimeters doesn't really matter
and the funny thing about the p6 is
because it's so freaking linear on the
side he doesn't have the curvatures or
something like the windows phone 8x from
HTC it actually doesn't seem like is
that thin so Chloe has the numerical
measurement in terms of thinness but
thick of thongs feel thinner in the hand
I think but how many thicker phones have
beauty shot there you go I mean that's
really well it's really the money shot
with the p6 is the beauty shop owned yes
that's right i mean i have to say Aaron
did look a lot more beautiful when he
when he turned two beauties no more red
let's let's not let's not discredit
Aaron he's a good-looking guy yes but
you know you
make up that that beauty shot mode and
like boom you are at UH your monitor
you're at David Beckham level and like
right I mean you're ready for the runway
you're ready to show off John Varvatos
is fall winter 2013 collection is nicing
Chrysler miss chrysler 200 that's Aaron
is is in route to the runway as we speak
no it's I mean look that this phone is
is I think that this phone suffers from
the exact same problem as the Xperia Z
which by the way is a statement and Sony
so needs mobile situation right now
which we'll talk about in a little bit
yes but the problem that they're
suffering from is that if visa I don't
think these companies have fully
embraced the fact that it the spec
pissing contest is quickly becoming
irrelevant we've we've surpassed the
point where even a mid-range phone is
more than sufficient for any any
platform and anything you possibly want
to do on the phone so you know it six
millimeters doesn't matter and there's
nothing else that really makes this
phone stand out in a meaningful way in a
way that's going to bring people and
caused him to button to choose this
phone over say an HTC One or a galaxy s
work the only thing that it could have
going for it and you know we'll know
this when it eventually is on shells is
its cost while we could bring this at a
much more attractive cost especially in
the market said it plans to sell it in
then say the higher end phones is
essentially because underneath that six
millimeter frame it's a nexus 4 right
it's got a quad-core 1.5 gigahertz
processor 720p display 2 gigs of RAM so
it's it's it's last year's best specs
but in 2013 so uh you know if we're
always able to bring that cost now and
then then I think that's really the only
play that it can make here and that's a
really good point in and I think that
might be what ultimately continues to
keep them out of the US market with
their flagship devices is the fact that
you know it's not difficult on promotion
even even when a device like the HTC one
or the galaxy s4 is first launched it's
not difficult to find a promotion or you
know trade
deal or something where it's it's
possible to get that device agency is
selling the the galaxy s4 and the one
and i think the z10 are all like 99
bucks now exactly exactly and if you
trade in a phone brought you can
probably get it within within spitting
distance of free it's my guess so how do
you like how do you sell any and because
these are still subsidized on contract
situations here on these carriers
tmobile accepted how do you how do you
promote a device that is anything less
than that at that point like that the
subsidy concept completely takes
everyone outside of the game and
obviously is a very very different story
in in Europe and the rest of the world
where they use a much more sane pricing
model much more consumer-friendly under
subject on the subject I think who are
we announce something like 19 mobile
partners across Europe or on the show
with the region's blur for the launch
but there's a much easier reason for why
this why we 7 p-6 isn't going to make an
a splash in the US and ice doesn't have
LT right that's that's the one massive
sacrifice in going for that six
millimeter apparently I might have heard
this song or saw this somewhere that LTE
an LTE version is planned right like
right but I mean I mean that's the point
though isn't it mean we're gonna get
around to talking about the Xperia Z but
the this phone then you just said it has
some specs of yesteryear and the LTE
compatible version which for a lot of
people is the dealmaker deal-breaker
particularly for you guys in the US well
for any carrier in the US any carrier
that you know has a name in the u.s. is
a deal-breaker if it doesn't have all to
either not gonna carry it I think even I
don't know if t-mobile's formally come
out and said that yet but it really
feels like if if a phone doesn't support
t-mobile's LTE network especially on the
high end it's just not even always time
with it right yeah and then even in in
the UK it's about to become a deal
breaker right flat I mean uh within the
next few months LT is gonna start to go
live with carriers that aren't EE am I
right or is that off baby yeah no no
you're right right
and I'm just kind of looking off to the
side because i myself a forgotten about
that is it's kind of like the summer
this year in the UK you realize it's the
middle of June and you're like what this
should have been here already it's
summer or LTE this stuff should be
happening yeah and there's just no noise
being made it's just really quiet and
really slow I mean but by next year we
should have the other networks in the
game competing with EE and it they
should be using better bands so the
better building penetration and you'll
be more reliable to you be something
like the sort of thing that you guys get
in New York where I know from our fellow
colleagues you basically a better
internet on your phones that I have at
home I suppose you tell me where you are
sure yeah yeah if you're in midtown
Manhattan you are still getting crappy
uh data speeds on your mobile device so
right although I had to say I'm going to
do this on Twitter earlier today 18t did
something in chicago in the past few
weeks that like completely fix their
network issues here is the first time
that I can remember in history where
I've had nothing to complain about with
the AT&amp;amp;T network in Chicago like it I
have no data issues at any time of day
or night I have no voice issues I don't
know if they've just finally caught up
with demand or what the story is there
were some room there's some rumors going
around that they added AWS that they
originally said 700 only in in Chicago
as in most markets and and I think they
deployed AWS recently so that might have
something to do with it I believe they
they finished rollout of the Z power
project which was the goal was to get
get Chris to stop complaining about
eighteen t in Chicago Oh actually
actually guys I want to bring us back to
the pricing thing because AT&amp;amp;T just
recently announced the launch of
something in a bundled something is a
Samson yeah the galaxy tab eight-point
you can get it for 199 if you
in a bundle with a phone contract like
the two-year thing um which to me is
like a snooze fest because it's just
another galaxy tab which isn't much used
to people but but it's still interesting
to me that companies haven't figured out
a pricing model particularly for android
tablets is like now that bundling it
with things and a Canary's thing is in
the UK samsung is doing a similar thing
where if you get the galaxy s4 mini i
think you get a free galaxy tab 2 or
something like that so they're just kind
of tossing these galaxy tabs out of
people I mean that if you don't get the
bundle I think with H&amp;amp;E the pricing it's
like 399 for the tab 8 which is a
competitive because if you compare that
to say the ipad mini the ipad mini with
LTE I think it's 430 now so or 460
excuse me so uh you know you are
undercutting your competition a little
bit there but the problem is that it's
only available on TTT right I mean it
just I don't know it's like we've had
android tablets for at least a good
three years by this point right uh when
did the original tab come out was that
doesn't work yeah i'm playing i'm
thinking honeycomb like let's give
Google break with the devices or
honeycomb honeycomb was 2011 right um
just kind of crazed me yeah I mean I I
don't think I I think that that Google
is a long way off from friend maybe I'm
completely off base on this because I'll
be honest I'm not a heavy tablet user at
this point it's weird actually I I want
to talk about this something happened in
my life that I haven't been able to
identify but something has happened that
has caused me to not care about tablets
and I used to use my iPad all the time
and then I I have a nexus 7 for a while
and use that all the time and then
something happened that caused me to
just completely cease caring about
tablets whatsoever and I don't know if
it's
the way I use my phone or if it's the
fact that I switch to an iphone 5 or
what it is but something happened where
I they're just not a part of my life
anymore well clearly it was the extra
half-inch of screen space on your iPhone
5 it made all be different totally
stepped all over the you know need of a
tablet it's its powers personally uh you
know I love I carry phones all the time
obviously and I have I / I have a nexus
7 right now but as far as tablets are
concerned I think that if you if someone
would have gun to my head and said you
can't use this piece of technology
anymore the first thing I'd give up is
my tablet and like I use it here and
there to do some reading and I use as an
alarm clock and when I'm on a plane I
use it to watch movies ah but anything
else I can do I it overlaps completely
with everything my smartphone does and
send smartphones and screens that are
four and a half to five inches now uh
you know I'm perfectly comfortable
reading something on on my smartphone or
watching a video on my smartphone as
well so I am scrambling to think of
something less useful than a tablet in
terms of technology yeah if somebody
gives you the same challenge as you then
but you know you were being facetious
about the idea that the iphone 5 with a
bigger screen is kind of making the
tablet superfluous but I'm kind of the
same way as Chris it's weird because the
one big usage scenario we tablets is
actually the underrated period of
lounging weather on a couch or in a bed
or something like that and I'm finding
the same thing I guess is Chris which is
that in those situations I'll just pick
it up the iphone 5 and I'm comfortable
with it I'll content with that I don't
need it to be a massive screen and
particularly 10-inch tablets like the
original iPad just who ungainly now and
that was like if I'm going to use a
tablet it would have to be an iPad Mini
or something of that form factor and
let's not overlook the fact you talk
about using it in bed and the bed usage
scenario that the the full-size iPad is
a health hazard because you're going to
drop it on your face we've all done it
there's no shame we've all done it I and
and I can tell you from personal
experience I've
mention this before the iPad Mini is
considerably less painful to drop on
your face than a full-size iPad and the
iPhone 5 is like you know you drop it on
my face all I want doesn't really matter
if it really weighs anything so from the
face dropping perspective I'll take a
phone / tablet Wow I mean that is real
consumer advisory I don't want to
totally disparage tablets and say like
they should be like taken off the market
because there are people who that is
what he's saying then but yeah it is
what I'm saying you know I'm not saying
I'm just saying but you know there are
people who really love their tablets as
their mobile productive thing they've
got one of those keyboard cases that
they snap on their iPad and like that's
their mobile computer but for me and I
know for all of us you know we have a
laptop that we use for all of our like
heavy mobile computing needs uh and I
don't at least for me a tablet doesn't
cut it doesn't replace that even with a
key yeah i mean that's actually really
good point because at the airport just
yesterday i saw somebody doing exactly
that using the 10 inch ipad with
keyboard attachment and i was thinking
well dad has its benefits because you
can tuck it into a lot more compact bags
than a regular laptop and there's also
the extensive better life you know
usually usually your laptop wouldn't be
able to stretch as long as an ipad
particularly for that sort of form
factor but then Apple just introduced
the new macbook airs and Neil I reviewed
the 13-inch and he's like yeah I don't
have enough things to do with so many
hours of battery life right so a blue is
kind of eating its own tablet market via
both the laptop side and the phone side
I guess well but lately I don't know
that the ipad falls in a nice price
point yeah yeah no I'm with the Medicare
I mean just just working with what i
just said myself the fact that matter is
i think we're kind of a not the regular
customer because when you when you look
at the actual sales the biggest driver
for revenues right now for i push
through the ipad right biggest growth
sectors to the ipad so people buying
these things up and still using them in
some sort of fashion it's just kind of a
mystery to us
just to clarify my point earlier but the
galaxy s4 mini that's up for pre-order
on phones for you in the UK and that's
where you get the galaxy tab 2 for free
it is impossible for me to express how
little I care about the galaxy s4 mini
the galaxy s4 mini is ultimate trol to
all of us journalists who have been
complaining for years about big size
phones and wanting a small phone will
give you a small phone here you go but
they did the same thing with s3 so we
kind of knew this was coming and we felt
good okay but you know what I am
100-percent onboard you guys totally
agree but I can't even get angry about
it because there's a galaxy s4 zoom
which is another total trove it's it's
like the companies taking all of these
good ideas and just completely
butchering them and destroying the whole
premise of why those things are good
ideas but here's the thing that the
difference with the zoom though is that
I think that's a case that's classic
Samsung being Samsung where they were
like you know what we can do this so why
not whereas with with the mini it's it's
like they could make a good small phone
but they didn't the zoom is like a pure
like Yolo type of product you know like
it sure you know maybe nobody can or
should already see me maybe nobody
should buy it or will buy it but ok I
mean it's it's Samsung like once you get
above middle management no one even
knows this product was being made no
they're just making so many products but
with the mini it's like I feel like it
philosophically it's a slightly
different situation do you think that's
actually the case I kind of and wanting
to believe that like there are Samsung
execs is so high up they might just walk
into a store and be like oh we do this I
do I believe i 100% believe especially
when you start to talk about like
special versions of galaxies that are
made for like prepaid carriers in the US
oh yeah like they just announced one
this morning what was it called dan you
probably know oh yeah that's like is
like the galaxy
II to exit the ring there's a game
really that's what it was get us a ring
yet and it's like yeah just it's like
the epitome of cranking them out off of
the conveyor belt type of of Samsung
device yeah but you have to make galaxy
tube is a pretty good name for a phone
like it or they stole galaxy mega from
you so yeah it now watch galaxy two is
gonna be next they're gonna do like a
video / like you know streaming
television focused phone and this can be
called galaxy tube mark my words it's
gonna happen it's ok Samsung keep
stealing my ideas that's fine so with
the galaxy zoom I just pictured this
like some high-up executive had a
fascinating revelation like at 11pm at
night and you know he was like we should
put a really great camera on a
smartphone with like a zoom lens and he
fired off an email from his like note 8
and sent it down and then like some poor
product manager was tasked with making
this happen and like that was the last
oversight and it just like went into
production from there yeah sounds about
right all i can think of right now is
that 11pm notification that the poor
engineer received 11pm you trying to
kick back relax with some Korean TVs you
see what's happening with Sian is
Gangnam style still thing and all of a
sudden your phone starts whistling at
you it's like no I love how you say
whistling too because it's exactly what
a samsung phone does it whistles at you
yeah I really again I have to reiterate
the thing I said last week I don't hate
Samsung at all but it's just that
particular notification is so freaking
annoying for it to become just this
widespread popular default notification
is one of the atrocities of our industry
dieter loves and you need to be stopped
dieter will defend it to to his dying
breath Peter loves that notification it
has an orange iphone I don't think he's
qualified to judge the truth comes out
why does not like a deters orange I I
don't like every dealer is not here to
defend his port orange iphone no reason
so while we're on samsung i get
came out this week that the s4 active is
coming to ATT which I find super
interesting because it's like kind of
maybe a better built galaxy s4 that's
also water resistant b2b I mean j-just
just by virtue of making a water
resistant as you say you should gain in
terms of durability for the fully entire
phone to that point Samsung is holding
some sort of pseudo mysterious jun 24
then we're at least us Londoners should
be able to get ahold of yes for active
and then we can report to you guys and
tell you how Samsung should have made
that the galaxy s4 and stop fiddling
about with all these varieties and isn't
isn't the rumor for this London event
some crazy interchangeable lens camera
that's powered by Android nothing crazy
about it understands the rumor is a
galaxy NX but the thing is Samsung's NX
series is well established the
mirrorless camera range they're doing
their own lenses which is really the
thing that's holding them back cycler
yeah I'm going to rely on something to
build out a range of super excellent
lenses and then invest myself in them
and by like five of them you're just not
going to happen no it's like maybe Sony
with the next series canonical an
obvious ones but Samsung do its own
lenses it's all its own everything with
the NEX series it's just kind of a dicey
proposition and they have a proof I mean
they do the biggest synthesizes they do
aps-c cameras exercises just like Sony
with the NEX series for mirrorless
cameras which is totally a good thing is
the best thing about these cameras and
now they're gonna presumably combine it
with Android at least a software
hopefully this one doesn't come with a
freaking earpiece on it come on please
but it's really just going to be an NX
camera with Android slapped on it and
it's going to plug into that ecosystem
which I consider a weak one I don't
really see it growing into a legitimate
one before we come up with whole new
camera form factors acknowledges etc
I mean yeah the shoes exciting but
doesn't feel like it the zoom has not
been announced for any US carriers right
I don't believe so so mark my words
Samsung will release a version of the
zoom without an earpiece for verizon
and/or AT&amp;amp;T yeah that's very likely I if
it comes to us I was how it's going
that's how it's going to come to us but
remember so i had heard this is about a
month ago a good source of mine a good
samsung source of mine told me very
mysteriously without elaborating that he
said for this June twentieth event
galaxy is not just about phones and
tablets and and when I pressed him on it
he kind of insinuated that it would not
be a SmartWatch so that leaves I mean
cameras is one of the very few
categories that he could be referring to
I'm sure it's not PMPs um so yeah it
makes total sense that this would be
some crazy new camera that is not the
zoom I guess since that was already
noticed yeah yeah the other thing is for
that event is the Samsung promised some
from their teeth brand which is their
windows / windows phone range and the
presumption is it's kind of early when
you windows devices well early I don't
know but it seems like Microsoft to go
to make a big push a build which is like
a week away so and that's where Samsung
might want to introduce new windows
laptops tablets whatever so it kind of
seems like we might get a new windows
phone out of Samson coming up on this
plane give it given the windows phones
we've seen from Samsung color me not
very excited again it should be exciting
like I think this galaxy NX camera is
should be exciting but it just you look
at it and you think it's not going to
turn into something that people are
going to love and get years and years of
service Adam it's just going to be
commodity product again it's part of
Samsung's throw everything in the wall
see what sticks approach which is how we
got the galaxy note so yes there's some
success there as faces against you know
was a product a lot of focus group
research but then I presume that the Kin
was a lot of focus group research as
well you know well actually let's let's
talk let's teach or to the kin really
quickly because I feel like mens rea
this has been in my twitter feed for the
past week because there was this website
last week that was selling the
refurbished kin one for like twenty five
dollars so so much everyone bought them
up uh and and you know people have been
getting them in and they've been playing
with him and they're like I don't
remember the kin being like I remember
the King being much worse than this or I
don't remember the kid being this good
of a phone and and I think the point is
that the kin was never a bad phone on
its own it was just priced out of
oblivion it was it was marketed towards
a younger kid who you know his parents
have to pour his or her parents have to
pay the phone bill uh but verizon
insisted that it be Pat paired with a
thirty dollar a month day to play at the
time and like that just instantly nerfed
it but otherwise you know it's a cool
little phone right am I crazy i I've
wanted nothing gauges being nostalgic so
the kin one form factor is the bomb.com
and I there's no disputing that but the
kin to never excited me but the kid one
form factor is awesome also wasn't the
kin like basically the only phone to
launch with tegra take her one that is
take everyone Wow and too far back me to
a cool damn it Dan you want to be a one
well I'm gonna blow up tom warren spot
because this is actually Tom Warren skin
that he had me buy for him because he
was in the UK uh-uh but yeah I mean look
how cool this form factor was it it's
like it's not I i have i also own a
pixie or i mean a beer and yeah you know
it's it's the same ideas of ear but it's
not so microscopically small that it's
it's unusable like this keyboard is
actually a decent sized for your thumb
if you have yeah I mean I mean what I'm
seeing right now is literal rerun of
Dita hold up is very good news
nice so purple shade thin things I Tom
because this is not mine um I haven't
even power design I'm letting I'm
letting Tom Tom enjoy that I think the
the market for pebble shade cute little
phones like there is just just severely
answer we obviously in love with him we
need somebody to come back and actually
deliver something on this form factor no
one obviously when I was saying online
before is that if I don't care about the
cdma kin but i would buy a gsm can in a
heartbeat and the promise that they were
never released at their very hard to
come by yeah I mean well they were they
were a few of them showed up on ebay
right for like ungodly sums of money
right well there was a but you know what
I was thinking is with that kind of a
form factor you could squeeze in a
really chunky camera sensor just because
it's supposed to be pebble shaped you
know so if you if you decide as far as
your design is concerned you don't care
about thickness you go for a nice pillow
shape to use my key terminology then you
can squeeze it a massive camera sensor a
day and I mean imagine that imagine some
sort of a mix between the kin the veer
and nokia's pureview camera technology
oh I smaller transition I smell so
evident in that every sleazy mana where
you can tell is happening but we're not
talking about it because it would
embarrass about so the flat did you know
that that Nokia hadn't announcement this
past week that it's going to have a nice
revenge in New York City is a lie and it
annoys us to zoom in yeah well I looked
up freaking flight prices and it's like
you know you could put down a deposit
for a house for how much it would cost
for me to come out for that event I
really enjoyed our cave any of those
guys that you try really hard you know
it it's like they're fun they're fun of
it so why so
so yeah let's at least say what this
event is we got an invite this past week
from nokia for an event in july that in
the only thing it says is like come
watch us reinvent zoom but you know the
writing between the words say that this
is very likely going to be the fabled
Windows Phone device that has an actual
proper PureView camera like the original
808 PureView it code name is cos we've
heard about it a bunch Tom Warren has
written a ton about it its leader sighs
we've seen it uh you know and and and
Nokia's PR team on twitter has not been
shy in or not been aggressive and
denying that this is going to be the the
PureView Windows Phone in fact it's
they've been pretty uh pretty almost
open about that this is what this is for
this event so and you know what you know
that that's actually annoying because
when I did when I lost interview see
your new york i was like give us a hint
for this thing here's just like no we're
not talking about it we're talking about
edit and then things you start leaking
now and then even the PR people kind of
making jokes about it themselves because
it's I mean let's face it the jo harlow
i think it was the previous IAM that we
see not this year in fact we're saying
we're going to bring p of you yeah but
he says it previous year's MWC way back
in February we're gonna bring the PV
technologies to Windows Phone then there
was the let down with the Lumia 920
because it was like yeah you're calling
it pew of you but it isn't the same
technology at all and now finally you
know second i'm a long time and i don't
really know why second in this long
because it's just software either the
tweaking way when you look at this a
two-way p of you running Windows Phone
which essentially talking about it looks
to have more or less the same factor its
kind of slimmer so you kind of presume
technology cajon shrunken down a bit but
other than that is really just software
that seems to have held this thing back
but still it's exciting it's I am
probably going to put this in my
or pro my phone my mouth here but this
has been been rumored to come to 280 and
if AT&amp;amp;T does in fact announce this and
release this and put it at a competitive
price I might have to buy it like I
wanted an actual phone that I could use
as a smartphone with a PureView camera
since I touched a pier view year and a
half ago like in the quality i know
chris is shaking his head right now and
like like the quality of the camera is
like so insane but like when you had the
808 PureView it was carrying a proper
smartphone and then carrying the
PureView because like the PureView was
right a point shoot camera I mean listen
be too you know osun be too full of
praise for windows phone but the fact of
the matter is that platform lets you
check your email it lets you find when I
how you are on the matters unless you
have flown in their browser yeah yes you
can actually post an image to facebook
yes I these are all just really
fantastic thoroughly modern capabilities
this is not damning with faint praise at
all this is very this is genuinely
impressive look I mean is a true that
the 41 make here oh god where do I start
the camera is yes it's good uh but I'm
sure it will be good but like who cares
like I don't know any simpler way to say
that like at the end of the day you're
still and and I think that people have
pointed out that it appears to be as
then or possibly even thinner than the
920 which is cool but it's that would be
insane if it actually happens like that
means and when you look at how big the
808 is because of how much room was
needed for the lens if they're able to
bring that down in size to something
that's even as thin as the 920 right
that's pretty incredible but but the
fact is you no one is buying a phone to
be like a cam they're not going into the
store saying I need a camera and it'd be
cool for made calls to like no one is
thinking of it that way and so when you
when you walk into this store a device
like the one or the GS for the iphone 5
takes great pics
cheers and the the difference in quality
between an iphone 5 or a gs4 and and I'm
sayin curse you was it and a trooper say
you going to say to the difference is
small it's not it's really not it's like
not even close especially unlike the
video front no no no the point I'm
trying to make though is that the
difference between those two is not what
selling phones no yeah so I I don't
think I mean it's it's cool that they're
getting this point they said they would
in its and I think that it's a really
important thing we're no cuter do
because it is a core differentiator for
them but I don't I I just don't want
anyone to be under the impression that
this device is a savior in any way
because it's not no no no I mean I
wouldn't definitely not go that far I
mean okies financial situation is far
too severe for one successful phone to
turn it all around but you know it's
about freaking time the Nokia did have
one successful phone talk about price
well I mean we say this all the time and
you know we might as well just say right
here right now we have the Lumia 925
review go up this past week as well and
it's like Nokia makes great Hardware in
great phones but that's not what's
holding these phones back right it's you
know it's unfortunate to say but it's
still the Windows Phone platform that
has not changed not evolved since it was
introduced in October of last year um
and it still has the same complaints in
the same situations that we were
complaining about in October which we
were also complaining about a year
earlier with Windows Phone 7.5 uh it's
still the same thing that's that's
preventing these phones from taking off
as as much as they should and uh you
know Chris and I have said this before
and and Tom agrees with us as well I
think in his review that the hardware on
the 925 is fantastic its head and it's
slim it's good to look at it feels great
to use the screen is really nice and
bright and sharp and everything that you
could ask for but it's unfortunate that
Windows Phone is is the one that's
holding it back and that's not something
Nokia's really at least at to this point
we haven't seen nokia able to change
that see I actually would the 925 for
for whatever reason excites me way more
than uh than this PureView device I
don't know why may I maybe it's just
that I really like the design of it when
I felt it but yeah I mean if I'm if I'm
going to buy Windows Phone device in
this next round of hardware it's going
to be this one I think well just to
counter that point Chris I think if if
Nokia delivers exactly what we expect
and hope from it which is a slimmer a
two-way p of you running Windows Phone
and you know has all the other good
aspects about you know good battery life
strong people quality etc etc kind of
the automatic things you expect to knock
its take care of the physical details
that gives nokia device that is pretty
much unique and it's deal with industry
cliche of having a unique selling point
everybody wants one everybody has on its
list of strategies which are actually
kind of more wish lists is like let's
have a USP let's say five USP so we I
think then that's how Samsung approaches
things like when I have five different
made-up nonsensical gimmicks AKA usps
we're not gonna sell this thing but we
will knock it with this device it would
be a unique device here we would have a
unique selling point and and then it
will be the case that if somebody asked
me okay I want the best camera on a
phone what should I get and then it's
really easy you know because windows
phone as we were saying it has its ups
and downs plus and minuses but it is a
modern operating system and you know you
can trust it to serve the basic needs of
somebody so you can't say to people
automatically get the 808 PureView lumia
windows phone whatever is called and and
that is the thing that should be able to
drive more sales for nokia the 925 the
trouble with it is that it's it's good
but it competes with everybody else in
in in the mainstream you know
whereas I think Nokia kicking out of the
mainstream doing its own unique device
it was going to be more positive camera
I I think I think just to add on Vlad's
point like the prior windows phone
devices the 9 29 28 etc people weren't
looking at those and being like man I
really want on a Windows Phone device
but you know this hardware is not pretty
enough for this hardware is not thin
enough uh you know and now that the 925
is out it's it's great Hardware it looks
great but it's also up against the
iphone 5 which is great hardware the HTC
One which is great hardware both of
which are paired with great ecosystems
and great platforms where the 925 is
still doing the same thing at least with
the the PureView model when that comes
out at least has its own special thing
that separates it from the prior windows
phone devices and separates it from the
other phones that are on the market
right that's exactly that's it at the
point is the 925 is just an incremental
upgrade on the same experience that
people weren't buying already whereas
this camera based phone can give them
something new and different and special
and it will probably allow them to take
some amazing self portraits I just
imagine a 13 megapixel self-portrait
dinnerwire use selfies in its PR today I
think I think while we actually use the
word selfies in its POS edge and
elegance that is well ways tagline for
this new phone it's it's just like let's
randomly pluck words out of the
dictionary and let's let it move away
from the e just you know ok I'm on de
comment below to this through the rest
of the pages as an elegant steger
alliteration boom we're done and I don't
know what to say yeah well I can tell
you that Sony went all the way to the
end of the alphabet for the name of its
Xperia Z which is finally coming to
t-mobile and now that was it that was a
dieta class terrible dragon this is one
of the Ford where worst forced segways
every but yeah t-mobile finally
announced today that its t-mobile us i
should say finally announced that it's
going to be carrying
the Sony Xperia Z in the coming weeks we
don't know the exact date we don't know
the price yet um but we know it's
officially coming and III know I've been
tweeting it I've been tweeting about
this today and I don't think a lot of
people understood what I was saying when
I might when I was tweeting so I'll say
here sony showed off the xperia z at CES
this year which was in january the
beginning of january and then it
launched it internationally in February
we had a review up by early March so it
was it was it's been a long time since
we saw the Xperia Z introduced and now
we're fine it's finally coming to a US
carrier uh in the US market and it just
feels so past its point of relevance um
and you know it's just like I can't I
can't picture sony selling even a
handful of these Chris do you have any
thoughts on this hold on i'm digging up
an image that i need to send to dan to
visually Express when I'm feeling about
this phone right now I've been working
as I was hoping it would be ready by the
time you guys were done talking but it
isn't it so are you talking about it so
so back so had said Sony gotten together
with t-mobile and launched this back in
February and even if Sony was only able
to score deal with t-mobile and forget
about 80 and forget about sprint and all
the other ones uh it if at launch in
February it would have been on the shelf
with the galaxy s 3 and the Galaxy Note
2 and I something else on tmobile but it
would not have been against the iphone 5
it would not have been against the HTC
One and when not a bet against the
galaxy s4 which is what it's all facing
now ah now that it's launching here mid
summer or whatever it end abduct hitting
shells all of which are more compelling
devices so I mean sony completely for
whatever reason whether it was supply
issues or just couldn't work out the
carrier deal it's like it was like
totally shot in the foot yeah yes yeah
that's good I was just gonna say that
the gal it had it not been for the
galaxy s4 active would have been a much
more compelling device yeah I mean it
has the walls for future but but I mean
you you being a bit too forgiving what
can say thinking back to that
buri time period i mentioned it's a case
of when the HC one was announced with
smaller screen but the same 1080p
resolution it was like one of the huge
selling point because let's not forget
CES was the the time with the experience
he had the advantage and everybody at
least in terms of being an announced
product but 1080 display it's the only
phone that I could think of that was
actually announced to see yes so yeah a
phone news that was the phone news from
CES and in the trouble is that by mwc in
the last half of februari everybody was
catching up you had the upper 55 there
was the city something something I mean
there's just basically that's the way I
feel about every ZTE product by the way
it's a ZTE something something yeah I
mean by by mwz we're talking about a
class a group of five inch 1080p phones
it was becoming mainstream is becoming
commonplace which is kind of crazy to me
because you know we see only five months
for me from that point in time which to
most people who come to that again most
people not most of our listeners or
viewers you come to think about
therefore when upgrading it maybe once
or twice a year it seems like a really
fast period of time but yeah you know
that doesn't doesn't think what else is
when you do come to look at it you look
at the very latest you don't look at who
had the advanced you don't look at who
came to market first I think like what
was saying like window key did it's a
snarky PR about Apple and iOS 7 and say
well we feel I was probably was really
Oh finally finally catches on that nokia
music yeah that was facing tells thing
who the hell cares if i go to the shop
tomorrow that nokia music was out in
2011 and apple was just introducing it
it doesn't matter the better one moose
out today right and Sony had waterproof
1080p phone with really cutting-edge
design like I don't think the economics
on that phone anything great
don't recommend it to most people but in
terms of just good frickin looks it's
one of the prettiest phones around and
I've written three thousand words about
I wrote the review for us so if anybody
cares to learn more about it go ahead
and read that free muffled review whose
age pretty much tells you all you need
to know about sony strategy which is so
freaking frustrating because i love that
company I love the ps4 actually like I'm
really excited to buy that new console
but you know this is a hilarious thing
when they announced the ps4 one of the
leading press images with a ps4 right
next to PS vita extra tablet Z and
Xperia Z and I thought why are you doing
this here so the ps4 I she has a chance
to succeed why associated with these
failures man seriously I'm loading up
your xperia z review because if i
remember correctly you had one of the
best lines i've ever read in any piece
ever in there i'm trying to find it it's
a pro quo it's in big orange text like I
know exactly exactly what line your
friend confirmation from the Maffei
trucking book yeah be rocking black yeah
absolutely brilliant absolutely
brilliant Bravo you had a good speaker
on it yeah I I born I mean that that may
be true but I would doubt that this was
before you got your hands on the on the
one right yeah I don't think the HD one
has a good speaker and I think it has a
what are you high instructive one every
case an overpowered one and look man I'm
a man of subtlety where's easy one is
like the woods big is like the best
speaker I've ever heard on a mobile
device like that's hands down without a
question like you know you could talk
about how great the screen is in the
build quality and stuff but like the
speaker is like above and beyond or
speakers I should sakes it's tonight
yeah you know you could replace like a
jam box with an HTC One totally you know
I can I have it next to my my macbook
air at times and like if
I was playing the same content through
them the one could most cases i think
overpower the air speakers which is like
a lot a much larger laptop versus a
mobile device yeah yeah just peek or in
the air isn't that big I mean I'm just
thinking it it's like it's does the
other thing tell me something how the
hell is Apple over to improve in a
macbook air design when you think about
I can tell you how it can get rid of
this freaking three-quarters of an inch
bezel around my screen by either putting
a bigger screen in it or making the
holes things footprints more wow you so
demanding I thought about this but well
because I thought about it too and I the
only thing I thought is like it's built
like a freaking tank it's as thin as a
paper pad you can't really make it any
thinner and do include computer
components in it uh Apple I don't think
apples got a photo redesigning this form
factor ever well I mean obviously apple
doesn't find much wrong with it because
it's it's held the same design for three
years now so yeah yeah but I mean think
of how long it it had the pre unibody
macbook pro design I mean that it
carried that design on for a long long
time and I mean I think that will
continue to see this design until week
down like one year at will have a
completely different macbook air and
we'll just deal with it you know but
really I want I want a thinner bezel
like that that's my my one gripe with
the airs design otherwise you know it's
chris what's going to happen Apple is
going to come out with a plastic macbook
air and they're gonna be like you know
we have this revolutionary new like you
know polycarbonate dominance and and
it's like you know it's thirty percent
lighter than aluminum and it's twice as
strong and it's scratch resistant and we
just blew your mind that's exactly
what's gonna happen if Apple does that
Odin again fanboys I'm gonna be like it
says incredible it's incredible and then
Tim Cook is gonna say incredible like
500 times if you guys haven't if you
guys didn't catch for last week's on the
verge opposite we we had a super
of all of the superlatives that Apple
use during its keynote at WWDC and like
Tim Cook says incredible no joke like
four dozen times it's great you should
find it on well there's a lot of
incredible stuff during WWDC let's be on
credible incredibly incredible and then
it will all be sort of capped off by a
really touching video featuring Johnny
I've where he's going like this yes yeah
exactly where he's against a white
background and he's wearing a black v
neck he's dressed like Dom Toretto and
he's like yes he's dresses they will did
she hear he's actually going to be he's
going to be the the next member of the
the heist true in fast eight so would be
good be I look forward to hearing about
this on the next fast cast yeah hey
while we're talking about Apple I think
we will talk about one more topic today
there's this rumor from Reuters this
past week that Apple is considering
quote a 5.7 inch iphone and then the
regurgitation of the rumor of a cheaper
iPhone in several colors so we've kind
of been hearing all year so this is
completely not the news to me wait so
Reuters a rumor a 5.7 inch iPhone and
Apple is actually go to call it an
iphone this is what the rumor said
they're considering it now the thing
with considering is like a lot of people
take that as like you know they're
making it you know Apple considers
things all the time right like they
consider doing this and they consider
trying that and every company does this
a they it's a called rd and they test
the tons of things the fact I mean this
doesn't mean that it's ever going to
come production but right yeah that's
exactly right I mean it we've heard
countless stories over the past ten
years of Apple trying things out
internally and shelving them in fact iOS
started as a tablet OS right and then
they ended up making the phone first and
then revisiting the tablet several years
later I this means nothing until there's
a product on on shelves or at least next
as far as I'm concerned right
especially now I'm to import it just
seems like a really weird that's
basically Samsung made by taking this
thing was knock out the same song would
be like oh yeah they're gonna do it like
this is gonna be a real product it's got
a house in a week and what underscores
the fact I mean look there there are two
things that that happen right one is
that Apple wants information to get out
so they leak it to somebody to is that
there's information that may or may not
be correct that's just a pure rumor and
I think this falls into the latter
khattak reuters has a track record of
leaking information fed to them by Apple
so but roids is has a track record of
accuracy I mean it's not perfect writers
has a track record of being Reuters yeah
well yeah we yeah we don't want to go
too far down that rabbit hole but the
point is I i think that i would put much
more weight into this if it had come
from The Wall Street Journal I would set
you The Wall Street Journal women
Bloomberg because I haven't seen
Bloomberg room or something well have
never really half of this rumor of the
the lower cost model the iphone the wall
street journal's talked about a bunch of
times and I you know this is just yet
another big source that's saying that
you know we're going to see a lower-cost
iPhone modes I I still don't see that
making any sense whatsoever because like
I don't see the 5.7 inch of ice making
any sense that I don't see the cheaper
device make an innocent so I disagree
the only place that the cheaper device
makes sense to me and that's in emerging
markets like obviously they're not going
to release a cheaper device in the US or
the UK or establish markets where
they're selling the iphone four for free
on contract or yeah well make some time
prepaid to write because even an iphone
4 if you get it from like Virgin Mobile
I think God's like 400 bucks or
something right its aim price so and in
emerging markets where that are much
more price sensitive they don't have you
know this exact same thing that we were
saying with Huawei earlier you know in
the areas where you know they don't do
contracts all the time and people are
having to pay up front hundreds of euros
or hundreds
dollars for a phone um you know the cost
of the iphone 4 is still very high okay
okay i mean i can see that like I can't
dismiss that it's a it's a good premise
but what I was going to say is that
Apple is a company that's shown itself
comfortable to have major gaps between
these products major differentiation
between its products so you know filling
in the gap between the ipad mini and the
iphone with a 5.7 inch device doesn't
make sense filling in the gap between
the ipod touch which is essentially i
mean people said it before I'm not the
first one to say it say it the ipod
touch is essentially apples entry-level
iphone a cheaper iPhone is the same
thing at the moment it has a much better
form factor and it feels so much nicer
in the hand it just doesn't have the set
of capabilities but then the camera's
not as good but you know right put it
there and now there's the camera free
version 2 to get into the cheaper
version to cheaper market which actually
appeals to me I like the idea of how the
device without a camera instead of
having a crap camera but you know your
promise the sound because people in
these developing markets would see a lot
more attraction like they can't afford
to buy the proper iphone but you can see
a lot more attraction to an ipod touch
with seller capabilities and with them
you don't need to have LTE right so you
can you can do it relatively cheaply and
then overcharge them which is or less
what I point everybody else does anyway
so that makes sense section make sense
but the thing about the wall street
journal I haven't been able to pick up a
physical copy of that paper without
finding a typo on his front page for the
past four or five times it's pretty
disappointing I had to had to get it out
it is disappointing but I don't want to
be the one to throw rocks at a glass
house no glad there's some wine and also
physical paper so but we don't realize
is that color is actually spelled co lor
there is no you
and an aluminum doesn't have a
mysterious extra i see i was wondering
right because there's all these reports
about you know afghanistan its
neighboring countries and i think one of
these guys will learn yeah there's a you
in there yes they're they're hiring
these two big copy editors you don't
understand the Queen's English so uh you
guys want to talk about sprint dish
Clearwire's oh I had one more point I
have to go ahead what I have to offer up
a counter argument with the iphone stuff
and this is purely theoretical but if
Apple does a 5.7 inch device of any kind
I think the primary reason would be the
day managed to nail down and get
exclusive access on some really sexy
high res display like that would be my
theory if Apple does a particular weird
form factor like that even because in a
old high res display and it can pitch
people on a Retina Display of some sort
and again have the tech lead on others
that's just thing that comes to mind
maybe I don't know I don't want to carry
a 5.7 I don't know yeah I don't know ik
my uh upstream supply chain sources
aren't what they used to be let's guys
go go move downstream yeah I think
that's a wrap unless you guys want to
talk about sprint ditions near wiring
the neverending story never ending so
proper that is between those that I like
I'm dying to know when it is that 2.6
gigahertz became like pure gold to every
company in the world it's like I I don't
understand why clearwire is suddenly the
holy grail in the wireless industry
that's not it's it's it's sprint in dish
right like right yeah haizen doesn't
care right it's a good sir yeah it's a
strategic pawn for these companies and I
I think the dish is sorely mistaken if
it if it thinks that it seriously wants
to get into the wireless business
spectrum co tried and exited for for you
know the same like all the right reasons
the fact that they you know they bottled
the spectrum they're like oh wait
starting the wireless companies actually
insanely difficult and it's a
bureaucratic nightmare and this was a
huge mistake a source cannot load all
our spectrum so so we're gonna stick
with our another beer cut nightmare of
cable TV service like this blows your
mind that that was an easier route
proposition right so I I i think that uh
if if dish you know I just don't know if
dish really understands what it's trying
to get itself into here especially at
the prices that they are I'm going to be
forced to pay to get into it because it
you know the price for clear where I
keeps getting driven out by these two
but the one thing I know for sure is
that all three of us will be retired and
possibly dead by the time this soap
operas resolve so we don't don't really
have to worry about it too much it's for
for our sons and daughters and and
grandsons and granddaughters to worry
about which is a really great segue to
the fact that dance ah spring was
protesting this entire topic he could
you guys hear her yes like no no get out
my new blamer damn dent your your
generations legacy is going to be this
clearwire mess and she's gonna have to
clean it up yeah that sounds about right
absolutely that your father of the year
that's right all right I'm not note I
think that's a wrap this has been
