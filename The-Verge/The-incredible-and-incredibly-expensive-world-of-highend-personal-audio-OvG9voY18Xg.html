the street listening for ordinary
streaming services on ordinary
headphones well recently with the launch
of title the dream of high quality
streaming audio is here and got me
wondering what else can you do to
improve your personal audio experience
turns out quite a lot the challenge with
high quality personal audio so you have
an entire pipeline that you have to deal
with and you have to fix every part
along that pipeline to make sure that
the highest quality sound is getting
from the source material to your ears
and that's where a service like title
comes into play title offers
uncompressed audio they give you a giant
file that's many times larger than a
file that Spotify audio would give you
but the trade-off is that you get
maximum clarity it's an uncompressed
lossless file it is more expensive and
then her face isn't as good as something
like Spotify or RDO in fact it's
downright bad in places but if you want
a high quality streaming library with
something the size of Spotify title is a
no-brainer the next step in the pipeline
is you need to find a way to turn that
digital file into an analogue signal
that the headphone can understand and
that's where a digital to analog
converter or DAC DAC is is sometimes
known and an amplifier come into play
now your laptop your desktop PC even
your phone have these built in but as
you can imagine they're not the highest
quality components
that's where external units come into
play you can spend literally thousands
upon thousands of dollars on these
the sky is truly the limit this
particular set that I have here only
costs a couple hundred dollars but truly
you can spend ten twenty thirty thousand
dollars or more on these most of the
money will go into the amp now I'm sure
you've seen units with these glowing
vacuum tubes on the outside some are
enormous and yes these are all things
you can buy this one isn't very big does
have a tube in it believe it or not but
you can buy very very large ones and
it's very subjective this is probably
one of the most influential parts in the
entire pipeline in how your music will
actually sound
now the final part of the pipeline
before the sound actually enters your
ears is of course the headphones now the
phones that I'm wearing here are Odyssey
LCD X's that retail for about $1,700 now
I I know your heart is stopping right
now you don't need to spend this much to
get a really good set of headphones and
of course just like the amplifier it's a
very subjective thing but you can spend
just as much money as you want to and
that's pretty much it as long as you
address those individual pieces of the
pipeline I guarantee you you're gonna
get better quality sound I've done some
blind tests here in the office everyone
can tell the difference it's a real
thing and we're seeing this up take an
interest in high quality audio right now
we have devices like Neil Young's pono
coming out in the first quarter of 2015
and this year Sony player that just
recently came out they're both focused
on high quality audio you're on a fit
spend a few thousand dollars to make any
of this happen of course you can if you
want to that's what audio files do
there's an entire universe of
ridiculously expensive hardware to buy
if you have that kind of money but for
instance instead of spending seventeen
hundred dollars on these headphones you
can spend $300 on these sony so you can
buy $100 of Phyo headphone amp either
way
trust me your ears are going to thank
you
