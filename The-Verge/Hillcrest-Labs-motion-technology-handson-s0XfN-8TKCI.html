we're here at Hillcrest labs booth at
mobile focus at ctia looking at some of
what they have to offer and hillcrest
labs is all about motion sensing and
helping you do things with motions so
we've seen their technology in LG's two
remotes for their CVS and the Roku
remote that lets you play Angry Birds
but what they're showing now which is
pretty cool is the same technology built
into smartphones and tablets so
basically what it does is it takes the
information for all your different
sensors the gyroscope and the compass
and the accelerometer and it turns it
into really really accurate data about
where your device is positioned in space
so you can use it for much more accurate
kind of panning around if you're just
looking through like a virtual reality
game you can see much more accurately
like if I move a tiny bit left it'll
actually move a tiny bit left as opposed
to kind of wobbling all over the place
and it'll remove magnetic interference
and it just makes it much more accurate
so you can do a lot of cool things they
showed us a phone that when you put it
down on the table it actually knows it's
on a table then you pick it up and it
knows you're picking it up or you can
twist it to change the song and all
kinds of cool stuff so there's a ton of
possibilities for it and they're working
with one major smartphone manufacturer
now they wouldn't tell us do but some
really cool potential for all the stuff
you can do with this great motion
technology so that's what hillcrest labs
is up to at CT
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
