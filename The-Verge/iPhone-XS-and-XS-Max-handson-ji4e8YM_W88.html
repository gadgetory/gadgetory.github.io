10s and the all new iPhone 10s Macs
they've just got announced today at
Apple in Cupertino and they look exactly
like the iPhone 10 except this one has a
new gold color and of course the 10s max
is a little bit bigger but honestly if
you weren't seeing them side-by-side it
doesn't look that huge it's not a huge
giant surfboard like the old iPhone
pluses were so the big features to know
about this one here the regular iPhone
10 S has a 5.8 inch screen but the 10 s
max has a 6.5 inch screen they are of
course OLED they're super Retina
displays and they are you know they feel
great they don't slip out of the hand
they look really good the screens are
really fast there you have a 120 Hertz
refresh rate so everything can move
around really fast they have better
sound so they're louder wider stereo
speakers on the top and the bottom so
when you're watching a movie they sound
better
they also fully support HDR so if we can
going here see if it got any videos here
and look as a video you can see of
course it looks pretty good it does of
course have the notch because it
supports face ID face ID is improved on
this device it's a little bit faster the
secure Enclave that supports face ID is
a little bit faster of course I'm not
prepared to this thing so I don't have
that but you can't show you that but I
can of course show you an emoji that
guy's not me will
an emoji of course works so that exists
but the other thing to know about these
is they have better water and dust
resistant they're full ip68 but the big
news here are the cameras as it always
does with yes models so on the back
you've got dual 12 megapixel cameras but
apples done some of the machine learning
work that Google's already Don the pixel
to make them faster and better so if I
open up the camera app here you can see
of course we can go into portrait mode
here and we'll take a picture it's
detecting his face here we'll just take
a portrait mode or we just do it myself
portrait mode but what's interesting is
when you go to edit the photo you are
able to change the f-stop here so that
you can customize how much bokeh you
want and so you can see it's really
blurring the background there
and it sharpens the way up when you open
up all the way through so that's that's
pretty impressive
discard those changes though save that
photo for somebody else
the chip isn't a 12 Bionic and that
means it's fast of course and so if we
were to open up one of these games
here's one of the games are damn it on
the stage called blades and it's going
to take a second to load but once it
comes the graphics are you know very
smooth and the lighting effects here are
very impressive too so we can
got a look around there
turns out I don't know how to play this
game
oh you just have fun the dude let's go
kill the zombie
kill the zombie right other internals
worth noting you can get up to 512 gigs
of storage on this thing which is about
just a ton of storage it also has a dual
SIM system so there's a single sim card
here but it also has a nice in which
means that you can have two carriers
active at once which is not something
that most other phones can do you know I
know that Google pixel two has an ECM
and a regular sim but it can't have both
active at the same time so that's really
nice and I guess the last thing to
mention about internals it does have
faster LTE which is kind of a big deal
and apples saying battery light is a
little bit better about a half an hour
longer on the 10 and more on the max but
it's not a revolutionarily long battery
life these phones are gonna cost $9.99
for the small one and this one starts at
1099 for the bigger one and they come
out on
the 21st except reordering on the 14th
hey everybody thanks so much for
watching this has been a crazy packed
hands-on event we're gonna have way more
coverage of all of the iPhone news and
all the Apple watch news so keep it
locked to the Virg</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
