one and we expected more from the
company here than normal we expected new
ipods new iPads maybe new macbooks a new
look at Mavericks the OS 10 operating
system but really what we got was two
things well first we got a good look at
iOS 7 the company's new mobile operating
system which the company has a long way
to go before it's really explain to
users and especially old users why it's
great but we saw some of the new apps
some of new services and it's coming
next week whether you like it or not the
two new things we saw were phones first
the iphone 5c the new cheaper I say
cheaper because it's not really cheap
it's ninety-nine dollars on contract but
it looks just like the iphone five in a
new shell it comes in five colors blue
red yellow green and white and it's a
plastic back it feels a lot better than
some of the plastic phones we've seen
but it still feels a lot more like a toy
than the cold metallic iphone 5 from the
camera to the processor to everything
else it's just like the iphone 5 with a
new case on it and there are even new
cases for the iphone 5c which also
looked really cool but again you're just
basically putting plastic on plastic at
that point the other phone Apple's new
flagship device is the iphone 5s it's
199 dollars on contract is replacing the
iphone 5 and like most of the S updates
we've seen it's not a huge aesthetic
change most of what's new is under the
hood there's a new processor the a7 plus
the new m7 a motion processor which
allows it to do a number of new things
but the biggest changes are in the home
button of all places it's a little
shallower it's still quickie but what it
has now is a fingerprint sensor embedded
so you can open your phone you can buy
things all just by tapping your finger
on the sensor it's super secure because
it's your fingerprint but it gives you a
whole range of options that you wouldn't
have had otherwise this is what we
expect from s updates it looks the same
it's just as thin it's just as light it
comes in new colors silver and gold and
Space Gray whatever that means but the
big changes here are things you
hopefully won't see except iOS 7 which
you'll most definitely see it's 199
dollars it's coming out on carriers and
countries around the world and it's very
much Apple's new flagship phone iOS 7 is
a much bigger change than anything else
that's
for it but the iPhone 5s is really more
or less what we expected and that's
really the story here we basically knew
all of this going in everything had been
leaked to death apple says it's doubling
down on secrecy but then all of this was
out there before the event ever started
Elvis Costello was surprised that was
something at this point we're really
looking towards October there's still a
lot left for Apple to do this fall we're
still looking to see the new software on
more devices we got a quick look at iOS
7 on an iPad but 17 much we're still
waiting for Mavericks for waiting for
new MacBook Pros and we're waiting for
lost more we're still waiting for that
mac pro 2 so really at this point we're
waiting for October</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
