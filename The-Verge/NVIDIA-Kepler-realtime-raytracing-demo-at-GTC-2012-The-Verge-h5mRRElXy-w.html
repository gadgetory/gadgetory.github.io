the pullet is actually reflecting and
refracting through the watts
isn't that amazing completely amazing
Wow that's um that's a lot of angry
anger he's heating up all night he's now
up on them let's give him another round
of applause oh well that's something
let's let's kick it up a notch is we're
finally able with Kepler's GPU the real
trip dude race racing in real time and
so notice that blue lumens yes there's
one person who really appreciates me I
know there's there's a whole bunch of us
so let's set this and go wow that's
really hard look at that and so you can
see the clock our logo of course you can
see very clearly you could see it
reflected on the cylinder but not the
silly but the sphere you can also see
our claw reflecting off the sphere but
you can also see the sphere reflecting
off the clock off the sphere okay notice
that the glass case the class box is not
just a piece of plastic is actually not
just a patient
translucent polygon is actually the
modeling of a piece of glass and notice
that it's reflecting and notice the
edges of the boxes
waitress there's actually real geometry
there this will bus it looks like real
glass well that's all very cool but
let's kick it up a notch shall we
we know that rate racing is hard we know
that fluid simulation is incredibly hard
or did we did great racing and fluid
simulation at the same time and raytrace
the fluids
let's go completely crazy shall we all
right Jim let's see it whoa the
reflection and the refraction and the
Pernell effect of the water is just
beautiful you can sit here and watch
this all day just the stress just flows
right out of my fingertips that's going
to be a good day I'm going to do a good
job okay that's fantastic let's give
these guys a round of applause as you
can see as you can see GTC is not only
about science GTC is not stopping kepler
is just the beginning of it you can see
that in several years computer graphics
will look nothing like the chalk chalky
computer shaded easy easily shaded lots
that we see in game console and video
games today this is the way that next
generation of computer graphics will
look computer graphics the first element
of Kepler's influences now of course we
understand that computer graphics is
vital to the work that we do together
here it's vital even to GP computing and
the reason for that is because the
computer graphics industry is so large
the video game industry is so large
they're 100
millions of gamers around the world the
video game industry is tens of billions
of dollars large as a result is able to
fund enormous advances if we can harness
that basic architecture and leverage it
for general-purpose computing it is
unbelievable how much Rd we could great
America we can also of course make this
technology highly pervasive so that
everyone here in the audience any of the
scientists around the world and easily
reach out and grab a supercomputer in
their hands Hitler is a big deal for
computer graphics a Kepler is a bigger
deal for high-performance computer today
I like to announce the other persona of
Kepler Kepler is going to meet the most
energy efficient and the highest
performance HPC accelerator
