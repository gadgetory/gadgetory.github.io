to Earth today after spending nearly a
year aboard the International Space
Station
Kelly's extended stay on the orbital lab
was for NASA's year-long mission as an
experiment to see how long-term
spaceflight affects the human body the
idea behind the mission is to help NASA
better prepare for trips in a deep space
a crewed mission to Mars for instance is
going to take upwards of several months
NASA wants to know how astronauts will
fare during these missions they also
want to figure out how to lessen any
negative health effects when the
astronauts get to their final
destination Kelly collected several body
samples prior to and during his flight
to document how his body has been
changing NASA also had a unique
opportunity with Kelly since he has an
identical twin Mark Kelly who is a
former astronaut himself mark is serving
as a control subject in this experiment
by remaining on earth since the twins
are genetically identical samples from
the brothers can be compared to show
just how much Scott's body has adapted
to living in microgravity for so long
researchers can then try to tease out if
there is a genetic basis for some of the
health changes people experience in
space
NASA is a pretty good idea of what
changes they'll see based on the
experiences of other astronauts many
people who live in space experience
problems with their cardiovascular
system microgravity causes bodily fluids
like blood to float up into the torso a
region so veins in the legs weaken and
can't contract blood as easily
astronauts also have a hard time with
their spatial orientation and balance so
they don't have the same cues in space
to tell them which way is up and people
also report vision changes potentially
due to fluid building up in the brain
behind the eyes it's something that's
affected Kelly during his time in space
you know I have a little bit of I think
you know effect on my vision that was
very consistent with what I experienced
last time there are a whole host of
other physical changes that Scott may
experience - including changes in his
gut microbiome and how his RNA is
expressed his muscles and bones are
likely a lot week or two on Earth we
work out these systems just by standing
and walking around as gravity pulls us
down but without gravity astronauts have
to compensate as much as possible by
specific exercises once Kelly is back on
solid ground NASA will try to figure out
how space has really affected him first
Kelly will do a field test as soon as he
gets back to see how well he adjusts to
a gravity environment again he'll then
undergo months of sampling and medical
tests the results of which probably
won't be released until at least 2017
but Kelly will still get to enjoy the
comforts of Earth as the experiment
continues when I get back to Houston
I'll go to the astronaut crew quarters
at the Johnson Space Center for several
hours of medical tests that end at about
3:00 in the morning and then I'm going
to go home and jump in my pool</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
