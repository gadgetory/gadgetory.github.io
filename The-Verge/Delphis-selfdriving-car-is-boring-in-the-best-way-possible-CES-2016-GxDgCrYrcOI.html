day two at CES and we're here at delft
eyes car park tint I know Delphi is
known for its evolution and self-driving
cars every year there's something a
little bit new to show so we're gonna be
here check that out and of course that
means we're just gonna go hop in an Audi
and let it drive us around Vegas for a
little bit last year Delphi off had an
Audi SUV with cetana mastectomy Sisco to
new york this year the company is
showing off what it's calling v2e
or vehicle to everything basically it's
a combination of hardware and software
that lets the car talk directly with
vehicles special traffic lights and even
with pedestrians
assuming they have the right chips and
their smartphones at least all that data
is augmented by a series of cameras and
radars and other sensors and things that
create more situational awareness which
is really the goal of all self-driving
technology and the end result is
actually it's rather boring
now that isn't necessarily a bad thing
our demo drive around Vegas roads went
rather smoothly with the car
self-steering self accelerating and self
braking as appalled to float traffic and
maintain a safe distance in fact the
most exciting moment happened when our
video crew chase car just happen to cut
in front of us with one of our camera
guys hanging out the side of the car if
he falls out of it if he falls other
than what was car notice top does not
have a p2x enable phone so yeah it can
be a bit dull in practice but when the
end result is not hitting things dole is
probably good Delphi as vehicle to
vehicle system will be first integrated
into the 2017 Cadillac CTS for Mormon
Delta for more on self-driving cars for
more on any kind of consumer electronics
