with movie theaters to fill vacant seats
by offering discounted ticket prices
it's a business model that has worked
for other industries but what sets the
company apart is they're back to basic
strategy for making partnerships can
their grassroots tactics actually
compete though so we went to this unsexy
conference and we start pitching all the
people from 500 startups everyone else
is making a million in revenue or
whatever it is and then here's our
little thing and I remember one person
just says guys your company has no
traction whatsoever like you guys suck
on your knee gum like a really nice well
known investor in the Silicon Valley
area he mentions this comment how do you
think you're gonna sell theaters anyways
so I just went crazy on him and then I
started to saying you don't know who I
am this is what I used to do I set the
price to decide to do that and my
co-founder Kevin living in the van right
now man how dare you speak to me my
co-founder is living in a van when a
company is bootstrapped its starting
without the help of outside funding so
becoming profitable fast is crucial so
when you look at a bootstrap startup
your first thought might be these people
are at a huge disadvantage compared to a
startup that was backed by millions in
venture capital and you'd be right that
forces them to come up with a business
model that works in a hurry Shawn came
to me one days I had this great idea
like you think about like Hotwire Python
but for movie deals I'm like no I didn't
but just give it a shot so it's where
I'm here first you have this idea and
you just think you're gonna make a
billion dollars that's kind of step 1
with an entrepreneurs mind about 88% of
movie theater seats were empty and at
the same time over 40 billion dollars
are spent every year just on movie
ticket to popcorn and soda and you're
just thinking this can be easy let's do
this it takes more than just a good idea
to be successful in order to compete you
either have to grow quickly enough or do
something competitors aren't doing those
are we call those in Dark Ages right
early days constant rejects from
theaters constant falling apart with the
team constant frustrations with the
website with everything just nothing
works Kevin comes to me and he said I
have an idea
and he says you know the first 6070
theaters that we've signed up all
required some face time cold calls of
not working emails is not working
and so what I want to do is I want to
trade in my Acura for a minivan and I
want to drive across the country and hit
up all these theaters and that was just
the first of many man van trips most of
the startups that I write about do not
have a van based growth model being
bootstrapped enforces a discipline that
is often very helpful to a start-up
because from the day one they've got a
ticking clock they've got to get to
profitability much faster than one of
those venture-backed startups the first
three weeks it's like oh my god this is
like camping with my buddies like urban
camping this is so cool I get to see all
these cities that I've always wanted to
visit it's kind of like that for the
first few weeks in the next three weeks
it's like yeah I'm just sky that lives
in a band this is kind of cool but you
know there's all these extra things you
need to think about when you're coming
from a man been to a meeting that you
normally wouldn't need to think about
for example tomorrow when I have a
meeting I just go to the meeting because
I already know that I brush my teeth in
the morning I know that I took a shower
in the morning I know that I'm wearing
appropriate shirt and I'm wearing boxers
because it's the daytime you know each
time you wake up you're just kind of
like you know is this is this really
worth it I mean the quality of life is
so fricking poor just looking for you
know the next gym to shower and looking
for food and you're just like oh my god
this is rough so that's that that's that
was the toughest part for me but I'm
glad we did it because just you know
looking at where we're at now it
definitely paid off it's kind of old
school meets new school it's Silicon
Valley saying hey we're not just going
to type behind a computer screen or call
you we're actually going to show up and
try to make a deal and a lot of the
theaters too they respect it a lot
because they realize how did you find me
here you know I'm in a Seaside Oregon
which is just way out there and you're
here
I remember that meeting because he's
like none of our other vendors ever come
here and you actually came here we ended
up getting them to commit to sign for
that thing yeah after that we're like
we're in Seaside Oregon let's go to the
beach yeah you have to admire their
tenacity if you're a movie theater owner
and you have some guy from Silicon
Valley calling you trying to sell you on
their business and promising you that
you're gonna drive more butts of the
seats you're thinking yeah right but if
someone actually shows up to your feet
or your theater or face to face
and kind of makes you an offer that you
can't refuse I think the face-to-face
interaction probably helps them in some
way there's been numerous startups that
have been very similar to deal flicks I
mean chin flicks movies now my movie
deals movie Mongoose I mean there's been
so many of them they just weren't able
to close deals and they're an exact
replica of what we do I think the only
reason why we're able to be where we're
currently at is because the drive and
the focus is just maniacal I mean who
thinks about living in a van for two
years and going on the country yeah
we're just hustlers you know we're boots
on the ground make it happen type of
people Paul Graham who founded Y
Combinator the startup incubator here
likes to say that at the beginning you
should do things that don't scale in
other words do things that software
can't do because if you're doing that
chances are you're doing something hard
and if you're doing something hard then
chances are that somebody isn't gonna
come in right behind you and try to do
the same thing from there we learned a
little bit about fundraising we got some
cool investors in we've raised them a
little under three million about 2.9
million now the deal flicks is off the
ground not only do they need to scale up
but they also need to face the
challenges of a changing market going
out and meeting people in your van is
great but what deal flix needs is for
people to come to them ultimately they
have to find value for their customers
beyond saving two or three dollars for a
movie ticket I think the question is how
many people are willing to go through
the rigmarole
of going on to a website that you know
maybe they're just becoming familiar
with in order to save 2 or 3 bucks
so we're currently in about 600 theaters
across the country we definitely want to
go international we want to solidify you
know bigger partnerships with a few of
the bigger chains better deals improve
deals we also want to try you know I
guess different products and services
possibly something like deal flicks now
where you can watch movies on our
website we really envision a full
dynamically priced marketplace where
just like Priceline or Hotwire or
whatever it is the prices are just
constantly in flux depending on supply
and demand that's how we think it should
be with movie theaters in the long run
and that's one of our big long-term
goals there's less incentive to really
go to movie theaters in fact if you look
at numbers from summer
2013 to the summer of 2014 box office
revenues were certainly down and this is
a business that is really dependent on
how well the movie theater business is
doing in general they've picked
something where sure there may be a lot
of excess inventory but people aren't
going to the theaters that's not good
for deal flicks here's what I would say
I think up into a certain point it's a
great idea to drive around the country
and live in your van and make these
deals face-to-face well ultimately the
word-of-mouth that you're getting from
your existing customers has to be good
enough that you can stop driving around
in your van right if the business works
you should be able to just rent an
apartment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
