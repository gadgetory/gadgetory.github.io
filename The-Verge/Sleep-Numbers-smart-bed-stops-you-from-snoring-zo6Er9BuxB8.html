verge we are here at CES and I am
demoing this massive smart bed Sleep
Number 360 smart bed has foot warmers at
the bottom an air chamber inside that
will adjust as you sleep a snore
detection that will elevate your head
when you're snoring so that you stop
snoring and then on top of all of that
it will give you a score on how well you
slept at night this bed can do a lot and
I'm going to take it for a ride so we
really need to know about this bed is
that there's multiple layers to it and
that's the key so at the bottom you of
the mechanics that's really what makes
the bed move up and down on top of that
you have something called an air chamber
which is literally just a pocket of air
with a pressure sensor in it that is
able to detect some movements when
you're snoring vibrations things like
that and on top of that you have the
comfort layer obviously that's what
makes the bed feel good what's really
nifty about this bed though is that
there's dual air chambers which means
that both people in the bed can have
custom settings whatever position you
like to sleep in it will adjust to you
so if one person snores a lot you don't
really have to worry because the bed is
going to pick up on that on their side
it's going to leave you sleeping but
it's going to raise their head so that
you don't have to elbow them or whatever
to make them just wake up but there's
also a manual mode which is through an
app from a Sleep Number so yes it is a
Bluetooth bed I know the app is really
important to this whole operation
because the app is where you're going to
be able to review data so as you're
sleeping the bed is going to send data
that it's picking up on whether you
snored how much you toss the turn so
send that data back to the app and all
that will be configured through an
algorithm and they'll figure out how
well you slept that night unfortunately
here at CES I can't demo the app but
with that said I am very much demoing
the foot warmers right now I'm sitting
on top of them and they feel very good
the 360 will be out later this year and
the king-sized starts at 4,000
dollars now that price is going to vary
depending on the comfort level you
choose right now I'm on the i-10 which
is the most comfortable and it feels
pretty good
alright so the Sleep Number 360 bed is
super expensive and I definitely cannot
afford it I wish I could take it for
right here and take a full-blown nap but
unfortunately Sleep Number doesn't make
noise cancelling pillows we've heard to
start moving things so weird</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
