Joshua Topolsky and you're about to
spend 90 crazysexycool seconds on the
verge it's apparently earnings day so
bear with me as I tell you a bunch of
numbers that neither one of us really
understands first up is Google the
company says that net income is at about
2.8 billion dollars with over 12 billion
dollars in revenue they say paid clicks
are up the motorola did report a 233
million dollar loss but Motorola is not
really a company so what does it matter
Microsoft ended its fiscal year on a bit
of a sour note the company posted its
first quarterly loss ever at about 492
million dollars much of that is due to
an over six billion dollar write down a
six billion right it's six billion okay
a six billion dollar write down of its
failed a cuanto vac juez ition revenue
is otherwise off at over 18 billion
dollars and Windows 8 is just around the
corner of course it could be worse Nokia
posted at second quarter earnings today
with a 1 billion dollar operating loss
though the company has sold about 4
million lumia handsets worldwide they've
only sold 600,000 here in the US CEO
Stephen Elop said Nokia's aim is to
become the quote where company just as
Google redefined the what with search
and Facebook the who with social feel
free to take bets on which companies are
the when how and why NASA has hired a
cent scientist to recreate the smell of
space according to the Atlantic
astronauts have described the scent as
both seared steak and sulphurous which
is exactly how the passenger seat of my
car smells that's it for today tune in
tomorrow and we're gonna explore chasing
waterfalls is it worth the trouble</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
