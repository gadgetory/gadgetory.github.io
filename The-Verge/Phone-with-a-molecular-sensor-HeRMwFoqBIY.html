folks from Cheng Hong it's called h2 and
it's got this sensor from Co that scans
molecules it's basically infrared sees
how molecules are moving around and then
it can basically determine what's going
on so like you can check your viagra to
see if it's fake you can check your
drink to see if there's alcohol in it
you can check your strawberries to see
which one's sweeter it's kind of crazy
and then it's literally inside of a
mobile phone so there's a lot of ways to
use this sia sensor you can measure a
lot of different things but one of them
is kind of like a sugar content of
something so you need to pick which
fruit you're going to scan so I'm going
to skin an apple I'll just put the
sensor right on it scan I want you to
guess at home which of these is going to
be sweeter now that's a pretty good
pretty good Apple above good let's look
at this red one
that one's a bit over good I think this
one's supposed to be sweeter I'm not a
picky eater but I think I have a very
discerning palate so I'm going to see
what I think it's a very sweet apple
they both rated pretty sweet oh yeah
let's look the way through them this
app's a lot different we're going to
measure viagra pills to see which one's
real which one's fake
so f can also measure meats for water
injected meat or for alcohol content and
drinks we're going for pills put this
over here
BAM got it again okay what one more
thing
we're going to scan my body fat to be
really embarrassing
who knows maybe I'm great maybe I'm just
the best at body fat so I'm just at the
skin my bicep was the direction right
here so let's put this right here please
be good please be a good one whoa 27%
average I've done this four other times
it was always above average but this
time when we got it on tape
I'm completely average and very healthy
individual
thank you sigh oh what a great molecular
sensor I think</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
