standing outside of alice tully hall
here in lincoln center in new york where
Samsung just announced a new galaxy
note5 in the galaxy s6 edge+ these are
Samsung's big phones this year earlier
this year denounced the galaxy s6 and s6
edge which are a little bit smaller but
these ones have big screens and big
features the note 5 has a 5.7 inch
display it's got Sims like s-pen for
productivity bunch of new set of bells
and whistles it's made out of metal and
glass now smaller little easier to hold
but still has that big screen then the
s6 edge+ is pretty much like a bigger s6
edge it's got a 5.7 inch display instead
of 5.1 but the sides are curved just
like before on both sides really
designed as an entertainment device both
of these devices are going to be
available on all four US carriers really
really soon you can actually pre-order
it starting this afternoon and then
you'll be able to get it in stores on
august twenty-first that's a bit of a
different move in Samsung's done with a
note in the past it's getting them out
ahead of apple's event in September as a
way to try and get it in people's minds
and hopefully in people's hands before
they can buy a new iphone but not to
leave us totally hanging samsung also
teased a new gear s2 SmartWatch which is
going to be announcing officially at
Aoife in Berlin in a few weeks not too
much to say about it it's round it's
been rumored for a long time but we're
looking to find out more soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
