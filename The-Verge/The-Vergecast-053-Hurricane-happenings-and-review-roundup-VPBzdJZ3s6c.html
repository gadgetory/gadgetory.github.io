the week of October 29 2012 I'm Josh
Topolsky I'm Nilay Patel I'm David
Pierce I maybe ross miller and and and
we were all together here sort of on the
first birthday of the verge we're not
all together I mean we're for virtually
together physically we couldn't be
further apart it's the power of texts
are awesome David who are physically
very close together uh-uh and anyhow
this is our it's our first birthday
anniversary or birthday anniversary is
that a thing that happens I don't think
that's actually reverser II birth
bursaries and um and it's also a big
week of news yeah so we talked about and
I got a hard stop because I got things
to do very important things that I know
that our readers we disappointed if I
don't finish you're a really big
businessman we get this done big bidness
business just to let people know why
we're all separated the hurricane in New
York is over but New York is still
recovering yeah and we can't Josh life
cannot physically get to the studio from
Brooklyn Josh you try buddy we we can't
I mean we can but like the level of
difficulty and confusion and chaos that
it is like requires is a little bit more
than I think I mean basically like you
know we got Michael and I got picked up
by a car here and they were like when we
called for a car they're like okay
you've got to people that's fine then
when we got picked up there like we need
to find the third person to go into the
city because you need to have a quota of
people to take cars into the city right
and then when we turned the corner off
of my street there is like a children of
men situation where where there's like
no I'm not even kidding there's like
cops like there's a lines there's I'd
live near two gas stations and there's
lines like of cars trying to get into
the gas
right cops like patrolling like the gas
station lot so that people don't steal
gas or like get into a gunfight or
something and and I looked over the the
I looked at towards the bridge where you
go to get into Queens to get to to get
to the tunnel or to the bridge and it's
it's like it was eluding say I mean this
is I I think I don't know if people who
aren't in New York or New Jersey or
along the east coast that got really hit
by the hurricane or aware of this but it
actually is pretty bad I mean things
think real things happen like horrible
and hurricane things happen here I
nobody's like you know was another were
like a lot of jokes like Oh New Yorkers
are blowing this out of proportion and
it's actually like people died like
houses were destroyed like cars were
like blown into buildings like it's
really it's pretty crazed you guys get
so eyes that would you guys have power
the entire time like anybody our power
somehow stayed on and I don't know why
or how because there's flooding like a
block from here and like the whole lower
portion actually northern portion of the
portion of where I live is flood was
flooded I don't know about Neela you
were evacuated so yeah I'm extremely
irritated about being haha didn't you
get taken to no power from having power
so uh we were evacuated I live right on
the East River and we were evacuated for
Irene and we literally we evacuated to a
friend's house that was like two blocks
away so we just went somewhere else and
then this time they said they were going
to preemptively shut off power so we
left and we went to some place for the
power and the water went out and they
actually didn't shut off power in my
building so the building next door they
locked everybody in so it was like to
dramatically different strategies when I
get out not say wow yeah in the building
next door uh was somebody in a studio
looks like the next door and she said
they just locked everybody hit which i
think is that's insane I like like the
idea of locking people in during a
horrible event like that right that
seems that I came back so you know the
riverfront here is like it is broken you
noticed i took some pictures of the city
and when I came back I realized that I
couldn't see what I was exposing like in
a river and there was just like debris
like floating in the river like pieces
of the pier there's a construction site
next door
it is a lake again so yeah it's clearly
things are bad it's not it's not great
but so anyhow a long story short our
problems aren't nearly as bad as the
kinds of problems that other people are
having and and by the way we put a I
believe it went up or it's going up a
post on the site about how you can
donate right we have a we're gonna put
the website Brittany can we put the link
on here too it's a I think the door be
baffling Auriga on the verge to
information about how you can you can
donate if you want to help out and you
know look it's there are worse there
have been worse hurricanes in worse
situations but I don't think like I
wouldn't downplay that you know a lot of
people got hit really badly and they
need help and I mean it is truly like
all over the city you know things are
not normal no I oh the last week I heard
I think we all just got phone calls who
live in the East Village Sandy's of the
Kona is not expecting power until
saturday at eleven o'clock at night like
pretty much saw straight on the temple
on in lower Manhattan is what won't have
power until Saturday yeah I mean you
know to just so people who don't live in
New York may not realize this but like
the subways are out and when the subways
are out in many of the subways on all of
them but a lot of them because they're
flooded or damaged and took a ferry to
then I had to take a ferry though and
when subways go out in New York people
don't drive here you know all the other
cities like people drive they're like oh
you're gonna take a detour but there are
no detours when the subways aren't
running it's like you just can't get
there so you either take another right
like or you walk it literally feels like
my neighborhood at least feels like that
early part of like GTA 3 weird like
running around you don't know what to do
you're very low on supplies we're
spending for like the thing to light up
it's a subways unlock you can access
different parts of the city is like my
neighbor is out of stuff well anyone
either store yesterday I was like
there's there's just nothing there it's
the trucks are coming in slowly but uh
you know yeah knows it's a hurricane
actually so there's a couple like really
interesting kind of hurricane stories
out of New York they're more kind of
more directly technology related but I
think are really interesting so
we ran a report yesterday I want to say
it's yesterday there's a lot of startups
to New York and they all for whatever
reason there's a lot of startup data
centers in New York and right now
they're all they're literally calling
diesel fuel up 17 flights of stairs to
power their generator to keep things
like Squarespace going to keep a Trello
going to mean there's a whole host of
them that are like but all that are
literally running on diesel fuel right
now stack exchange Gawker is totally out
there still out there deviating times
out they've been using tumblr which is
funny cuz tumblers in New York based
startup but their servers are elsewhere
yeah live stream is having trouble like
all kinds of stuff right it's really bad
already had we're being told we're
running our gzel fuel right now Wow yeah
I think Joshua Topolsky is is is done
yeah I think I think he's out josh Josh
ran out of diesel fuel uh no it's it's
been insane like I know for the last few
days actually I got I got electricity
for the first time last night we're
staying at a friend's house before that
I was trying to stay in my apartment
kind of like the East Village area and
you have to you see these crowds of
people just walking up like they're just
making a trek to twenty seventh street
to get power at whatever outlet they can
find yeah i saw though i saw there's one
picture i don't remember if it was from
you or who else but it was the like the
one spot in the east village where there
was cell service yes it's that's at
ninth and see it's crazy I'd like to
hear me we can hear you I can hear you
yeah it's like yeah so like you have to
like walk up to 27 to get cell service
guys 39th 40th you get you know you
start seeing powerless ever open yeah
things are kind of coming on buses right
now only go down I think 23rd they like
cancel efforts like weather conditions
they may be back now I don't want to
spread misinformation yeah I mean it was
like that picture like the Neil I has
this great picture if you haven't seen
it we have this great photo essay of
stuff from sandy but just this one
picture that Neil I took where it's like
the bottom half of Manhattan it just
cuts off and then you can literally see
like here's where Manhattan still exists
and you are you are seeing these people
make these kind of treks yeah up and
down north and south istry is just a
just a fine power lines
get super crowded I think I was telling
you the day it took me to a 63rd street
to find open power outlet at a Duane
Reade crazy charge my phone and I'm sure
it's like all-out war to get I'm always
like you know a power strip like you're
sure you are the project they all get
together type of websites to go to that
will have updates nice it's a very
interesting sense of community around
you like little ATM enclosures that have
power outlets that's crazy uh it's very
interesting way they're doing up some
trees have power let's nearby because
there's the you know they the Christmas
lights moving around they just outside
rights and they just plug in their
phones and just sit on the curb and talk
crazy it's very interesting hello oh we
switched sides oh that happened so I'm
like about co Jenner using LTE cuz i
don't i don't know what's going on with
time warner but uh mean this is the same
as tau it's time order it's not good
right now oh yeah so anyway we're doing
really at all yeah we can hear you can
you hear us yeah no really i can barely
make you guys out mm-hmm you sound okay
but you're breaking up a bit for me this
is apparently a nightmare hell ride that
you're speaking like you're a
translation right now the way the mouth
you should begin a large cast not ears
we missed that post it's not good just
lame yeah we're kind of RT there like a
few minutes yeah sorry man look there
you guys are gone all right yeah well i
just turned off mine i just went off my
video for the time being okay so we'll
just imagine your beautiful thing cuz
it's the giant floating head shocking
well it's funny it's funny i have an LTE
device sitting here that is hahaha oh
wait he's badgering nope and might who
hi nice this is yeah guys um yah y la
what's up oh I'm enormous hey still
large man uh do we need to figure out
how we look complete to the to the
stream in the world well obviously we're
having some technical difficulties we
can we need turn them off for a minute
to me turn
a live audience figure out what we're
doing with Josh and come back to them
yeah that's on guys we'll we'll be right
back after these brief messages of
nothingness yeah I'm sorry everyone
right back on us is the Josh Topolsky
zweite hand hey if you're just joining
us so are we let's just start over yeah
all right okay we're just okay wait I
just want to say I just want to just
talk about what just happened are we
back on the air we're back on the I want
to tell the world I want to tell the
world about what just happened okay long
story short when I reviewed the iphone 5
I got a new sim for my account on 18 tea
with I got a micro sim and obviously
they you know maybe account compatible
with LTE because it's an LTE phone then
when I was going with the review I took
the sim out and I put in an adapter and
I switched back to my galaxy nexus
recently I've been reviewing another
phone which is also an HSPA device and
anyhow my connection here at my house
has been very bad at since the hurricane
the time warner connect it's normally
very bad but it's especially bad
post-hurricane and i have a gs3 here in
AT&amp;amp;T gs3 on LTE which is getting
ridiculous speeds down a separate phone
that I've using that I'm testing with uh
I'm testing the data on and so I was
like here's what I'm gonna do my
networking is terrible but that but the
account that that phone has that's a
review phone it is not set up for the s3
now I'm talking about is not set up for
tethering okay I was like I'm going to
tether my computer to a phone on LT
because I'm getting very good speeds
right now so I was like well I'll just
take my sim out since its provisioned
for LTE and for tethering I'll take it
out of the phone that I'm testing right
now i'll put it into the gs3 that i have
sitting here and i'll use that to tether
with LTE okay were you with me so far no
I put the sim in as 18t recently told us
you could do I put my sim into an LTE
phone on AT&amp;amp;T and I try to register it
on the network and it would get no data
okay you with me because the phone I
clearly had not been provisioned yeah
for me so I had to take that to mount
and put it in the iphone 5 and now i'm
tethering over LTE on the iphone 5 long
story short iPhone 5se
the day 18 he lied about whether you can
put a sim another LTE device and have it
work and it's very it's getting it's
becoming increasingly likely the next
phone that I purchase is going to be the
iphone 5 I mean didn't we enter
increasingly didn't we forget me that LT
is just like the worst thing in general
I just don't know no I mean it's great
artists your own else I'll be the best
thing engine but the way the way it's
managed in the way that carriers deal
with it like it's crazy that you can't
take a sim card and put it into your
phone and do things with it that he
recently appointed man pure appointed
your appointed all right anyhow and
saying so so so let's let's get back to
the to the matter at hand which is
whatever we were talking about on this
hurricane ruining everyone's like the
hurricane Rooney we're talking with the
Herkimer in everybody's life and now you
just ruined our it's we spend a half an
hour of trying to figure out how I could
get online yeah happy birth emerge cast
happy person happy birthday verge yeah
we got you this nerve shattering how
ride as a present um anyhow are what
else is what else we need to talk about
of the Lumia Lumia review better than up
that go up sit up let's just pretend
that we're saying all this like two
minutes from right now I was gonna go
really yeah well we cooked out due to
get people ready is it actually
happening it's it's it's happening as we
speak right now right now on twitter
people are that they heard they heard
that and they're freaking out let me
another one of you everybody's perked up
and goes Lumia just be ready in just a
sec I'm used to meteor guys there are
guys right now somewhere who be just
began sharpening a knife there in our
rooms of employees Microsoft has to be
in our common system are there in a room
angrily queuing up their sangre sangre
sangre is it up now it's not up we
that's well let's come back to pit let's
talk about yeah so we did if we can set
up the lumiere review we cannot so we
also earlier this week reviewed windows
phone 8 and reviewed the HTC windows
phone 8x right now which is kind of like
the like hardware manifestation of
Windows Phone 8 I mean it's
all the windows phone 8 it's my
yourselves for an exit the end ordained
flagship phone right we did with the HTC
yes yep I like I really like that device
a lot what do you think I've spent
almost more time with it for a windows
phone I have been it's downstairs I
would bring it up and I don't it's I'm
not gonna I'm not if you don't you will
easily actually don't get it ever please
no I can't risk I can't risk any any
waves through the air um I uh I uh I any
I like it I think it's a really nice
device my problem with Windows Phone and
I'm sure that this will be talked about
my problems windows phone is is at this
point is is it feels like it's like
version one again and and I actually
think they fixed a lot of the the things
like a lot of the things that I was kind
of frustrated by in in with the Lumia
review when I was doing that like I
think have been fixed in the latest in
the Windows Phone 8 but I still think
it's like I have trouble understanding
in what circumstance I would tell a
consumer to go get the Windows Phone
device over the over the you know best
android device or best you know well the
iphone 5 you know like it's hard for me
to do there are I think there are people
who it's great for I just think those
people are not the vast majority of
consumers right this moment what about
your office people that was one of the
things we said about the surface i think
i can think of you're a hardcore office
user and i think that if you're like
completely immersed in the world of
office and windows and you want a phone
that will do that will work seamlessly
with all of that stuff i think it's a
good choice the reviews I by the way so
everybody should go when I what the
reviews out does you in it or at least
wait our Lumia 920 reviews up what y'all
gonna go tweet I'm looking at it on yeah
the verge not kinda mazey so sure my so
I think I think um but i think that uh
you know when I talk to people and they
say um you know this is here's what I
need in my smartphone x y&amp;amp;z you know
they want to Instagram and they want you
know and like it may get there but I
don't know and that's the thing about it
being like feeling like version one is
like we still don't know
what if it's getting there yeah right um
well you know I think it's improved I
think it's improved i think it's i think
it's um I think it's competitive with uh
the iphone and the latest iPhone and
then the latest Android devices uh it's
just like it's hard for me to recommend
it it's hard for in it's hard for me to
imagine part of what using it part of
what kills I know instead of one of
those devices yeah part of what kills me
is that like it Microsoft's trying to
create their own kind of cordon off
ecosystem like Apple and Google are but
they're so far behind at this point like
SkyDrive is great like if you don't use
anything SkyDrive is great and it's a
perfectly viable it really is but like I
bet you already use Dropbox and if you
use Dropbox windows phone is is not a
good system for that um and so it's like
if you like just came on to the earth
today there's like a lot of stuff to
like in Microsoft's ecosystem but it's
impossible to get into unless you're
already in it and most people probably
aren't in it because they're so far
behind with all this stuff right I just
think yeah I mean I and again like and
this is a this is a thing that I've
complained about I complained about with
the surface I'm gonna talk about it here
i I just I am perplexed at Microsoft's
failure to show me some killer like some
killer like games for instance you know
the hey like hey look like there are
things there are games that they have
their franchises that are you know
either either exclusive to the xbox or
they are first run Xbox titles and they
come to other platforms if they had a
handful of those you know literally like
five to ten it could be the difference
between me kind of really wanting one of
these devices and not wanting you know
and I think that um I don't play games
that often but it's a very enticing idea
I know they're starting to get the xbox
the metal music thing is now you know
kind of finally really a part of it
smartglasses feels like it's a part of
this ecosystem feels like it's alive um
it's like it's been sparked to life but
it hasn't you know gone out and
terrorize the village yet that's a sign
yeah i guess i reverence just looking at
a looking at our two reviews of the 8x
and the 920 it definitely seems like the
8x is the way to go yeah why do them
very close scores uh just because the
Lumia has this really great camera with
the 8x it seems like a better phone I
like that I'd like this i'm frankly like
the smaller I mean that the hardware one
thing I'll say about the Lumia the
hardware is really huge it's like the
biggest Yogi's phone i've used in awhile
it can see specifically what I mean yeah
yeah and and and and the other thing
I'll say about the Lumia it's got a very
its low-light camera performance is
insane and its stability is insane but
it actually takes like rather dull
photos and it's something that we went
back and forth on you know tom warren
vlad savov dieter bohn dieter bohn wrote
the majority of this but we all worked
on the review we all kind of traded
ideas and and stuff about the phones
back and forth because we all had an
opportunity to use the device and um you
know I think we all were like the camera
is really really good in some situations
and then the other situations where it's
like weirdly not well you know I will
say this to think you know low light is
the most important feature of a camera I
think what's the most different I always
look at my shirt what the rest of
frenching feature but you know even on
my iPhone I I look at those pictures
again when i get home on a computer
screen i'm like oh these are these are
all terrible my real camera takes much
better fighters in this and that is you
know one of the best you know probably
within the top five best cameras in the
market for phones i mean uh in the
reason it's because there's a tremendous
amount of blur and everything because it
has to keep the shutter island just to
get light it I mean we we had a
conversation we had a conversation about
this and there was a lot of dispute over
the camera it it's like we were
comparing photos of like the iPhone you
know I think we did a comparison of
photos like the iphone to the Lumia to
the to the gs3 to whatever the flagship
devices are and and you know people are
gonna go crazy for me saying it but like
the iPhone had nicer looking photos yeah
you know they were better-looking photos
I don't know what kind of Voodoo they're
using the Lumia is a really good camera
but
um the iphone nine times out of ten
takes nicer looking photos yeah I mean
you could argue like we I was talking
about this with dieter earlier like you
could argue that the ones from the 920
are actually better photos like their if
you take photos on a cloudy day they're
muted because they should be because
it's muted and dull and it's a cloudy
day right but uh they don't look as good
like the iphones processing just kind of
makes these colors pop and like if
you're a pro and know what to do and can
go and process or fix them like jordan
oplinger is gonna take unbelievable
photos with the 920 all right but right
if you just want what you want you want
to be able to take it what you want from
a phone is to be able to get good
results without right tweet right we
don't want you want to be able to like
quickly take photos that are good like
that's the whole point the key to the
whole idea is like you're not carrying a
camera with you you're carrying well I
mean it is a camera but you're carrying
a camera that is quicker and simpler and
uh and produces better results than if
you were to just hang on to a point you
take it around with you you know yes
like you're trading off a few things but
like what you don't want I mean don't
get me wrong it takes really really good
photos um I just think I think that it
has some very very good qualities then I
think it has some negatives and I don't
think you can you can have one without
the other and I think that nokia has
done this has done this evangelizing
about the camera that it's really you
know at least in our in our readers um
uh has taken root that this is the best
camera ever in the history of okay no so
i took a picture of the skyline in
manhattan and i got emails from people
telling me it would have been a better
picture had i taken it with a 920 it's
like wow i took 3 16 megapixel raw
frames on a tripod uh and put them
together with HDR I don't I mean I I
know that you loved a 920 I just don't
think it would have taken a better
picture than when I put together here
like you're crazy and that is everywhere
every picture that I take I somebody
tells me that the 920 would have done it
I mean it's been it's like the only
reason they think that is because that's
what Nokia is constantly been telling
right right they have it is writing
nobody else no I mean it's definitely
like if there's definitely a seems to be
some kind of you know campaign happening
um
when I say goes a little bit of an issue
with the review there's definitely some
campaign happy with no again like you
know god bless them they did make a
phone with a nice camera but it's not
like your your your brain will explode
when you see the quality of these photos
you know they're very good the low-light
performance is crazy i will say that it
took pictures in like almost darkness
for me that we're like the room was
completely lit and I don't and I don't
fully a fully understand the Voodoo that
they're doing there and so like for that
purpose like I think in like dark
settings like there's you're not gonna
get better performance out of a camera
but it's like overall there are to me it
feels bluish it's like bluish and washed
out um compared to photos from other
cameras that look richer that have
better color reproduction and and I
actually had some focusing issues with
it I was actually surprised that it took
a few photos for me where it was like
autofocusing worth it like did not focus
correctly and the photos were completely
blurry so you need to have like a little
bit of I mean I do think the hardware I
mean part of the problem is Windows
Phone now has this mode where it's at
you tap and it focuses and takes the
picture at the same time or you use the
hardware button to focus but the harbor
button requires an incredibly hard
pressed to actually snap the photo so by
the time you've by the time you focused
in the first step of the two-step
focusing and shooting when you start to
shoot it actually shakes your hand a lot
more than than necessary by the way I
have one here I guess I should I should
tell people yeah I'm like definitely
unable to take good pictures with the
hardware button because I end up just
like moving the camera violence is the
austere that's a here in Colorado no I
have to say like this hardware is really
nice I mean it's just huge haha it is
gonna kill a minute let me in 920 no
question let's do a comparison here's
the Galaxy Nexus okay uh I don't know if
that's a good a little bit move it
directly in front of your face other way
there is the Galaxy Nexus you know boy
um here's the it's actually about the
size of the of the e like I just I'm
pulling out can you see this this is the
life of josh tuples yeah can you see
that bras move your head up do it
the show don't worry about me you're
good what do you mean your head is in
the shot I can tell you're looking
around camera don't worry though i see
ok so good yes technology that's okay
and then um others the can I do this
this is that at Nexus 4 ok yeah you can
idea of the size here you can get an
idea of the thickness but they're close
but this guy feels a little bit bulkier
in the hand I mean it's really heavy
tonight like really heavy it's heavy but
but I I mean I will say this but that's
where I think the 8x is is is a little
bit better of i think will be better for
a broader consumer is because it's
actually a really felt skinny like it
feels small in your hand and I think
that'll appeal to look it's a 4.3 inch
screen you know I think it will appeal
to people who don't want the giant
screen I think the 8x is again I have
one downstairs i'm not going to get it
though uh is kind of the perfect size
but um look there's no there's no
there's no denying that no matter what
is going to happen what we say today
about the lumia the comments on this
review will be will be the worst a set
of comments that we've ever had on a
post in the history of the verge and it
couldn't come on on a better day gonna
be hard to beat the surface i think yeah
let's take a sampling no I think you can
beat the surface let's take a sampling
of some comments here also josh i will
say everybody seems to be a lot more
excited in in chat on the verge cast
everybody's more excited about the nexus
for everybody just kind of forgot about
the 920 and it's now like all they want
to know that is the end for catch I
something about the nexus 4 I think I
don't know if we're allowed to I don't
know what the Google's been a little bit
like the rules of because we have we're
reviewing it under embargo i guess i can
say that i'm saying that now i don't
really know what's going on this point
right somebody massage it's fine yeah
right i mean but you know Phil Dickinson
had a thing up earlier he was kind of
taking questions on and other people
have tweeted photos and talked about it
you know obviously we have to you know
they were going to have an event I mean
the thing that happened which is weird
that i don't--all I feel realize is that
we went and did we had these a couple of
features that we worked on we went to
Google and we got to get the Inside
Story and had some exclusives with them
but then we had
that coverage was supposed to be you
know coincide with when they had their
event and everybody would have had a
chance to do hands-on and video and
suffering because the hurricane hit we
ended up being having all this extra
coverage like by accident it was not a
planned thing obviously everybody would
have had a bunch of access to these
phones at they held the event but uh uh
sandy how so an apple fanboy sandy is an
apple or microsoft fanboy because
microsoft that's true yeah that day
without any interruptions any I don't
know where I was going with this I
cracked the back of my nexus 4 that's
what I wanted best transition I drunk I
drop it I'll have a picture of it I
dropped it off off the I dropped it off
my dining table and yeah I don't know if
you'll go back if you watch my video
with Matthias I say aren't you worried
about it breaking and he tells me about
how the chamfered edge and all this
stuff but how it's protecting it right
it doesn't protect it from a 30 inch
drop from a dining room table on a
hardwood floor in case you're wondering
it's a small crack cuz really bothered
me that much um so I have one too and I
I do this thing where I I tossed my
phone onto my couch as I'm walking by
and the day and I was missed my couch
yesterday I was tossed it onto the floor
it was fine just completely fine picked
it up oh I really know your ear
everybody's experience may know I know I
all said whatever is going on with your
house Josh cuz you've you've destroyed a
number of iphone 4s but dining room no
no yes there was apartment or 11 feet
tall Lauren I have both we both broken
um but my brother broke the back of his
iphone 4 I mean I know a ton of people
who had the back broken on their iPhone
4 yeah I think there's a reason they
have a metal back yeah all right um I'm
just checking out the comments on the
loom how do I already hit a few how bad
are they right now I will tell you the
one I just hid involved in fall of
calling dieter a wimp for saying the
phone was big when Jessica Alba has one
I was just really nice una so i deleted
that one cuz that distal sense you know
jessica i was paid to carry the phone
well I what I just wanna say is what
wait what are you very attractive to
it's what I just want
say is what I just want to say is um
everybody is so sure it's the best fun
ever who's never touched it or used it
right and and that seems unusual to me
and you know Tom seemed to Tom seemed
seems to believe that there's actual
astroturfing going on and I know I'm not
accuse anybody but there are definitely
comments on these Leumi yeah posts that
seemed out of out of the ordinary for
the types of comments we get uh so well
you know microsoft's been paying me to
go into the comment section as well yeah
which is to raise al well his apple and
so does google it's great yeah three
paychecks dude uh so let's talk about
some other reviews i mean we've we've
talked about windows and microsoft right
in these products at length you know the
thing with the Lumia for me is that it's
there so it's kind of fun on my way I'm
sorry can I kind now you say something I
actually wanna respond to something cuz
people are talking about in the comments
I'm sorry I did it just came out how
much you don't think that we're scoring
that our ecosystem scores only about
apps the ecosystem scores it is not
about apps it's it is predominantly a
play a big part in the ecosystem score
but it's also about services and there
are some good services in fact the
ecosystem score would be lower if
Microsoft didn't have the services yes
right um it because it's because the app
ecosystem is is not that good on these
devices but it's also about uh other
products you know cases or docks or um
what types of products it's compatible
with it you know external hardware and
so the ecosystem there's like a bunch of
things that go into it apps are a big
part of it but I think the people are
under this impression that somehow we're
like if it doesn't have 500,000 apps
then it gets a low ecosystem score and
apps do play a big part and when you
talk to consumers and when you hear from
consumers when you hear from people
about the stuff they're always like what
can I get this app can I get that
applicants the stuff they actually care
about well and especially like with with
the device like I got a lot of questions
about the the surface because
everybody's like oh well it can connect
to my printer and I was like well that's
cool but I bet most people are not you
know super interested in plugging on a
surface into that sector I mean that is
a that is it I mean
be perfectly honest with you the idea
that you can plug in a mouse or a USB
stick or you know or or a printer is is
really a like a very very small part of
these devices that mean the surface you
know that was one of the things that's
like the surge you can plug in a printer
it's like well I just don't think that's
in that important to that many people
right yeah and honor by the way they're
a wireless printing solutions at momo's
and almost every printer ships now with
with Wi-Fi um so it's it's like so what
you know you can plug in a mouse like
that's the worst thing I've ever heard
in my entire life you can plug in a
board like whatever I mean you know
that's what bluetooth is for you know
we've just where does that's just like
that that is not important to mean it's
not important to most consumers at this
point right yeah and that's all i can i
plug in my mouth and that's why we rated
the fact that there aren't any apps on
RT like and yeah that's why really was a
highly because there what's funny what's
funny what's funny about the the surface
review is that i had it been completely
compatible with windows which everybody
says i hate i would have probably given
it i would have given it a higher score
yeah they've done everything is excited
about yeah right pro I'm actually I'm
actually very interesting pro had it
done everything that it does plus been
able to run like a full suite of Windows
apps I probably would've been like this
actually is the thing that is gonna let
you do both things rolling yeah and also
tomorrow is gonna be alright uh no se
the proud that this is the pros can be
more expansions give me the price of a
laptop and then you get into a whole
category of like are you is it I might
in my buying a laptop or what am i
buying you know I plenty of Windows
laptops are coming out with touchscreens
uh so and i have to say hard to say I've
been like playing with a ton of these as
they start to come out and I I will
never willingly buy a laptop without a
touch screen again really so much better
to reach others not anyway you're
selling me your timing you're going that
you're going to get a windows laptop for
your next class I wrote I wrote this is
my next windows 8 and I believe that and
as soon as I find good Hardware I can't
wait to get rid of this thing and get
Windows 8
I can't wait so you're honest I just
wanna say you're going to sell your
macbook as I make sure I may throw it
out the window is what I'm gonna do the
battery really all I do i do want to
catch it cuz this good resale value yeah
that's their uh no but like there I have
yet to see the perfect hardware but uh
but I think like in of in a you know as
it is the operating systems all right i
love using a touchscreen where's the
review so far i have a the best of you
so far is I'm working right now actually
it's the lenovo yoga uh it's really good
and it's mostly a laptop but it like
does these it you know it flips back to
County uses tablet or you can prop it up
but and it's like it's mostly a laptop
which I like but it has it 69 do all
kinds of other stuff yeah it's 69 yeah
ferrite sun by the way I just realize is
getting really dark in here yeah I need
to draw in my office since it was
daylight when we started ah like so long
so here's the thing i wanted to say
about apps in the ecosystem it's raw app
count is like that's the wrong if you're
going to criticize an ecosystem or for
being about apps you need to understand
what apps actually are to it a mobile
device right there not stand like people
think about apps it's like oh i'm going
to download a thing and like play a game
that's all it is for most people it's
how their device interfaces with the
world around it right right so a dropbox
out isn't just a nap right it's how
literally i move files from one place to
another because that is connected into a
larger ecosystem of dropbox right and
there are hundreds of thousands of these
apps for every we do our expenses in
Expensify right you know what's really
great is when i go out i take a cab to a
meeting i just take a picture of the
receipt when i'm done with Expensify and
my expenses are done that's not just an
app for me right that's a connection
into a deeper ecosystem of the service
and those apps are available for some
platforms are not available for others
and that mean that set of connections
through apps into other broader products
and services is critically important so
it's not just here's a number of apps
when we're ranking it it's how useful is
this device and how much more useful is
it made to be by these apps that can
that right that everybody's I don't
there's a there's a point I wanted to
ask about this and I think you guys
probably enjoy better so Microsoft is
making initiative like exclusive
features right the Pandora stuff to
facebook stuff that's not going to get
updated though then like that's not
going to follow one to one with any like
Facebook updates adoration there's a
risk of that when they're trying to make
exclusive features for their apps right
I will say I will say that it is it is I
think you're you're a hundred percent
right at that point Neil I about you
know it's not just about the count but
it's it's the quality and it's what they
do and it's how they interact with the
rest of the ecosystem and and you know I
like in some way like I give Android
more points in that department the
interaction and oh yeah no I think
absolutely right where where you get
where you get you know look for me it's
so easy to say something to pocket the
way you the way Android allows
developers to plug into their sharing
and so I think that's like a big
advantage and you know and I think also
you know I think we had this problem for
a long time with Android where we were
saying like God the quality of apps is
like yeah you've got apps but they're
garbage right and there's still a lot of
garbage but it's gotten a way way better
over the past like I'd say two years uh
and you know windows phone still
definitely suffers from having let's say
you've got I don't know what the number
is now but a lot of those apps are
they're very bad they're not good ya
feel like they feel they feel amateur
they feel like my first app developer
and particularly weird is that Microsoft
doesn't do any policing in the store so
if you need you search for a legitimate
app you will find a lot of results are
there a basic counterfeit right there
are other developers noticing a demand
for a popular app another platform and
saying here's my weird counterfeit
version and yes we are stealing a dollar
from people and that's like microsoft
needs to get on right mean that's the
you can test tell the world over and
over and over again that this isn't
about apps it's not about add count it's
about live tiles it's about you know
seamless sharing all this stuff but when
people want to go extend the use of
their device they go in the app store
and it's basically full of thieves but
you've got a problem janna and I and I
think there's also this thing you know
just not related but somewhat related
which is the you know microsoft's i mean
the reason the reason i have trouble
saying like you'll get a Lumia go get an
a tax
right now is because Microsoft has this
you know the premise is like what what
would make you get this phone over an
iphone or an android phone and they kind
of have this thing where it's like the
live tiles are better and they're kind
of designed for you know your life and
they'll help you do things faster and
our people thing you know our people app
is integrated and you've got you know it
merges your contact you've got this
integrated chat with your SMS messages
like that something's all really truly
they do have some good really thoughtful
ways of dealing with with data but none
of it is the kind of stuff and I always
said this about webos it was like what's
webos what's the webos um message to
consumers that it's going to be better
for you you know I actually feel like
right now but rim has a similar problem
but they're going to be able to say like
look we're blackberry we're being it's
the most secure it's built for business
blah blah blah like they actually have
some a little bit of a story the
Microsoft story is just not it's not so
compelling on points where people are
enraged right like I'm not enraged about
a lack of live tiles on iOS 6 like I
think iOS 6 is desperately in need of
some innovation I think it needs some
widgets or something like a live tile
there I think it needs to be able to
show people more information more
quickly and in an easier way and frankly
in a nicer looking way but I'm not like
how dare they how can't live like this
you know and I don't think most
consumers feel that way either thing
most consumers are like yeah that's a
nice to have but I'm okay with it right
now and I think you have to give them a
compelling you know I can tell you there
are compelling reasons why you would
choose Android over iOS I mean the
pocket one is a great example it's like
yeah it's easier to get things done that
you need to get done if you're a gmail
user I can say if you use gmail this is
a better experience right it's tough for
me I mean even when if you're an Outlook
user I don't believe that the experience
in in mail on a Windows Phone device is
dramatically different or better than an
experience on iOS like in terms of mail
right so so it's not like they're saying
like we've got this incredible mail
experience that's second to none for
Outlook users they've got a good male
experience but you know Apple has a
pretty good mail experience and Android
has a pretty good mail experience so
it's like they've got to find a way to
say to consumers and that's where I'm
talking where I'm talking about stuff
like halo and they started do with
I will say the integration with music
and stuff but it's like you got to you
got to convince people this platform
will offer them something and and down
the road will offer them something that
they're not getting somewhere else right
now like you can't say unfortunately and
this is true if consumers say you say we
can't get instagram on it there are a
lot of people there are a lot of young
new buyers of phones that will say well
i don't want that i want Instagram you
know and that's that's like the harsh
reality so so it's tough it's like on
the one hand you don't have like the
really compelling element I mean and
then you've got a lack of other elements
so it becomes a tough recommendation at
least from me so let's move on we
actually had two other big reviews
happen this week Josh interviewed the
ipad the ipad mini yes the ipad min and
I i we just published my review of the
retina macbook pro 13-inch today can I
kindest blaze through talking about the
ipad mini cuz ya been discussing then
we'll talk about the retina cuz i
haven't actually i haven't even read
your review um all the way through
thanks i skimmed i skim did and and then
i read the conclusion i left a comment
uh you saw my resin know i read the
number score understand a little more um
I feel and that was it yeah where's the
videos what I wish okay um um just
really quickly the ipad mini i think
it's it's a in this class it's theirs
it's second to none you know I've been a
nexus 7 user and I really really have
liked it and it's almost like with like
a little bit of sadness that when i
started using the ipad mini it like
occurred to me that i would kind of
don't have a compelling reason to pick
up the nexus 7 now uh you know in terms
of reading I'm reading on kindle just
kindle app it works the same if not
better on the ipad mini obviously app
selection is just astronomically better
on the ipad mini it's compatible with my
apple TV like there's no there's no TV
element for for the nexus 7 something
that's really bothered me we're like I'm
sitting front of the TV and I want to I
want to either control something you
know they control like I can control my
apple TV and find stuff to watch or I
can send stuff over using airplay which
I do a lot and surprise surprise in the
mount
and uh so I was kind of sad sad that
like I realized that the iPad Mini has
obviated the need for the nexus 7 for me
uh you're saying that agnostic as a
price tag though like that's doesn't
know I mean I and I say my review like I
don't think these things are in the same
I don't think that I don't think they're
in the same price group at all I mean I
think there's two hundred dollars and
329 is a big difference on the other
hand if I were going if I needed a
7-inch tablet if I felt like that was
the tablet the size i wanted i would
strongly consider trying to save up the
extra hundred and thirty bucks because
it's the difference between a really
really great well established well fed
tablet ecosystem and one that is
extremely lacking i think still yeah i
mean i'll say there was seven inch on
the 7-inch you can get away you can get
away with some apps that are that are
made for phones and they're okay you go
up any higher than that and it's not
good and there's also just like a kind
of a just not a lot of apps that are
taking advantage of that of that form
factor right the other hand the ipad is
has incredible apps I mean to me it's
like then we're watching the clip from
the review right now and it just showed
GarageBand and like using GarageBand on
a tablet like every time I do it still
just blows my mind on the ipod and it's
great on the other it's a crazy it's
really and there's nothing like it's a
really yeah and I and I and I and I
asked the Android guys about it you know
about why they didn't have a compelling
app like that or there's a lot of
compelling apps they get out they don't
have yeah that would be a great example
I was using an Android tablet um you
know it's it's it's a larger android
tablet i downloaded an app it's the game
another world you know the game another
world yeah the old amiga game think was
originally for the amiga uh anyhow I oh
this would be cool to play on a tablet
this is great because it's not like
super high action but it's like sort of
you know it would be a good any I loaded
it up on this tablet and it is literally
like a box on the screen I'm not even
kidding and and and it's like it's like
not you know formatted for I mean it's
just like that's all
for Android still to get you not even
that you don't have apps that are made
for the tablet you don't have apps that
will scale up properly in some places um
and you know that's that's their
Achilles heel and tablets right now
right so talk about yeah the screen on
the mini cuz that's I have one coming
tomorrow I bet yeah yeah the screen the
screen is this is this is what I'll say
if you've seen retina display as you're
going to look at and say this
disappoints me if you have been using a
nexus 7 or a kindle fire HD you're going
to say yeah there's a noticeable
difference I've been reading with it
every night since I started reviewing it
and it it really doesn't bother me I
mean it's it's it's clearly a lower
resolution display well now that's a
trade-off you make and it's one of its
one of very few trade-offs you make and
I don't think that it's I mean at the
end of the day it is what it is you know
I mean it's a low resolution display and
if I thought that that the only deciding
factor was high how high resolution a
display is I would tell you the nook HD
is the best 7-inch tablet on the market
yeah I think we know and I think we know
that isn't true yep yeah Oh ask you so
so yeah your age it's noticeable yeah I
got uh kindle paperwhite or ipad mini I
really right for me four million type ad
for me at ipad mini because uh I
actually prefer the uniformity the
complete uniformity of an LCD display
for reading my eyes have now for
whatever reason seemed to have adjusted
to that and I prefer it when I read and
additionally you get it's an iPad I mean
this is like you don't need the 10 inch
iPad like that's what's so compelling
about this to me it's like I have a
13-inch macbook air I have a Galaxy
Nexus as the phone i've been using and i
have an ipad right but the ipad feels
big and bulky and I don't try I don't
like traveling we think is it so huge
and that's why I've actually been really
enjoying the Nexus 7 is that it's the
right it feels like the right in between
it's the right in between size right
right and what's so interesting to me
and what's so exciting to me is that now
that in between size is occupied not buy
a tablet that I wish at x y&amp;amp;z but a
tattle that has all of the things that I
want to tablet to have like the one
thing that's missing is a guy
I had native gmail and native chrome
give the gmail app it's pretty good it's
okay it's it's actually quite terrible
it's not okay I've no no no it's bad guy
let me let me know ha sorry I'm gonna go
on record the gmail app for iOS is gar
it is garbage cochin anybody who thinks
it's good i actually said it's okay but
I take that back as it isn't okay it's
garden I'd rather use the the native
mail you are crazy no that's no I'm
really disagree I completely wash no
it's garbage you guys are you guys are
high and drunk I mean you're living in
an age it's better it's better than
using that better than it's better than
what then nothing is way better than the
Iowa I guess if I I guess if I were
starving if I were a starving man and
you came and you said well here's a
rotten piece of fruit he did I would eat
it because I would be better than not
the dying of starvation but I certainly
wouldn't enjoy it no it's better now you
are crazy I don't know whether it's done
it's not better than males like a dude
that's the only thing is you board the
keyboard pops up and it's all like it's
all rickety and weird when you start
typing I disagree i actually think it's
a really big it's got like some it's
like trying to like html5 up my contacts
seriously I think you're you're you're
you're tripping Josh to geology keyboard
is rickety did you the keyboard is just
that it's like it's like shhh yeah
that's that thing it doesn't think where
you're typing it stops and it good and
it like put your I'm sorry see you you
know the true can search your hearts
haha no no way you know what I think I
think the nails are short is and I penny
is like the best combination in the
world because I just got this and then
there's no news is my anything else this
is this is what this is what I'm saying
to you listen to me this is what I'm
saying it now is the perfect it's like
it's like I'm not gonna get an ipod
touch and I want to have an iPad okay uh
I won't have a tablet I mean I'm not
gonna get iPod option i wanna have a
tablet i want the tablet do everything i
want a tablet to do i don't want a big
bulky tablet I don't want to have
basically another computer with me and
uh so now it's like you don't need an
ipod touch or an iphone if you've got
the ipad mini that's my feeling it's
like if you have an android phone get an
ipad mini and then it's like you want to
have all those
Wes has boom you have access to them
because the vast majority the one you're
gonna use or fri pad NE a-- and then uh
and then you've got your computer this
is me at least and your end the phone
the phone of choice that is good for you
know for me like getting getting work
done and i think it's a perfect
combination because i don't want to work
necessarily on my this is not by the way
this is not for people who are like I'm
replacing my computer with my tablet
okay yeah I don't think it's that kind
of tablet I think this is a tablet you
have in addition to a computer I don't
think it's a tablet you have as your
only computing device I don't think any
tablet is that um no I mean some people
get the ipad the 3rd gen or the 4th gen
it's got a super high res display it
fast it like can do all the basic things
you need to do email uh you know web
browsing you can you know manage photos
on at blah blah blah or whatever people
do with their computers e chat with
people on it or so I'm told you Twitter
you know that's something that kids are
doing but I mean I think so that I think
this is actually the most interesting
piece of where Apple's ended up with
tablets is they are now they're all over
that they were all over the laptop
replacement game right which is what
Microsoft is trying to do yeah right and
that but what's different is Microsoft
is saying is we're going to reinvent
laptops and the surface is very much a
particular surface pro a reinvented
laptop right and yeah it's a windows a
pc that happens to have a weird form
factor and then the RT thing has to grow
into this there's a breed of its own it
is its infant it has to get there google
has basically been putting at these like
consumption devices these reading
devices i think that's very much for the
Nexus 7 is to me and has this great
potential to do more to take over some
of those laptop roles but really what
it's good for is like reading a bunch of
stuff and apples that move the iPad into
that game as well so they're now covered
thee do you want a new pc could you get
an ipad I you know instead which I think
a lot of people are actually still
interested in or do you want to tablet
in addition your pc and you want
something inexpensive that can do a
bunch of cool stuff and they're
definitely like moving into that game
and that's like that's that's playing
both sides this coin of what tablets are
going to be now I'm very like
disappointed it doesn't have a higher
resolution display
eh but I just don't know if people are
going to care I said I mean I got to me
usable just point to I i think that i
think the super high res display is not
um I mean it would be awesome if it had
it and no one's denying I it's not a
knock I mean it's not not enough because
it is a knock like I knock it you know
like I knock the display for not happy
it say knock again it's the I it's
knocked it got not there's no question
um but uh but it's also like you have to
balance that you know with the price
with the size with the way it's built
with all the other stuff it does with
you know how good the speakers sound and
how good is it running all those apps
and how good it is it you know connect
into your Apple TV or for that matter
lots of other things that it can connect
to rob and so heres in this goes right
into now the laptop yes i have had this
13-inch retina display laptop and I'm
back to my 15 inch pro which has that
the higher resolution screen and I don't
miss it at all like i don't i don't
think man i wish i was looking a red and
display whereas when i go and look at
like an older iphone or / ipad we an
ipad to you here I'm like this is bad I
don't know I think and I think think
there's a I think it's because you're
dealing with an economy of space and you
need clarity in that space I mean I
think with an iphone in particular with
phones I think that we really hit a
place honestly I don't have a problem
with current resolution of devices if
this were the next two or three
generations of 1280 displays or whatever
they are the iphone has 11 36 x 96
whatever the 640 whatever the hell the
thing is um i would be fine i'm fine
with that because i think it's read we
reach a threshold where like I really
can't perceive pixels I have to really
work hard and like it to me it's like
showing enough content enough data at
once like on a screen of that size I
think the ipad i actually thought that I
mean I think the retina display looks
amazing but do I think it needs it to be
operational to function the way I wanted
to function i think the 1366 x 768 nexus
7 looks really good too it's lower pixel
density than the the retina display this
is i think any lower than what the iPad
Mini is doing at that screen size I
think that screen that resolution at the
ipad 2 screens eyes now seems
like really bad to me right like it
seems Wow like this is a really kind of
noticeable difference I think with a
look you save a little bit in pixel
density when you go smaller um it helps
I think you know the next generations
obviously going to be higher res if it's
not it'll just seem silly rah but I
don't think for most consumers and not
for me I mean look I'm a guy who has to
review this stuff for a living who
really cares and using it day in day out
yes it was noticeable um but it was also
like man this thing's awesome I that was
my feel know in all honesty with it was
like it's so it's like the right size it
just felt really portable I found myself
wanting doubt have it around like I
would keep it next to my computer or I
through it you know I'd take it
downstairs when I went down or a figure
I was going out I would grab and throw
in my bag and it felt like this thing
that was like a companion it was a
companion device like my phone does but
a different kind of companion device
it's like oh I need to go a little bit I
need to get into a larger environment I
need to do something to look a little
bit more hands-on here or I want to do
something it's like a little more of a
Leanback experience it was it you know
it's great like i was playing
letterpress on it with Laura and and
playing like punch quest which is a game
that I because I haven't been using iOS
devices that often lately I didn't even
know it exists it oh my oh man punch
quest yeah I'm all over this thing and
then I found out that it's not making
any money and I feel very depressed well
in app purchases then but in a dollar
I'm something I had no idea had an app
purchases that's news to me yeah that's
right wow that goes right so this all
goes into the laptop because I think
it's very clear that these the smaller
devices they benefit greatly from the
higher resolution screens and it's very
interesting to hear you say the using
one that doesn't have one is you know
there's a balance to portability and
kind of the feel to it that you know
makes up for the screen because what I
felt from the laptop which is you know
very nice laptop but tremendously
expensive seventeen hundred dollars for
this laptop with retina is that it's
slow and the overall utility I get from
that screen is not there because
you know I'm used to working on a laptop
and so working on a display that only
gives you a usable effective resolution
of 1280 by 800 is not useful when you're
used to again but they'd line just to
write yeah 15 ish on top of a high high
res display yeah but you know MacBook
Airs have 1440 x 900 like Josh would you
settle for less space than your air no
higher resolution no no I don't think I
don't think most people want to make
that trade-off I'm gonna change mine at
1280 by 800 right now and we're gonna
see how it sits teeny tiny um and what's
very strange to me is that the processor
in the pro doesn't do as good a job of
driving that display as the processor in
what little time we've seen with the
nexus 10 I which has the same resolution
display as the processor in the ipad
which has you know a slightly lower
resolution display but still very high
and it's it's curious to me that the
Intel side of the you know the x86 side
of the game can't do what arm is doing
to drive these insanely high resolution
displays I mean you're never going to
win in a laptop review or any device
review if you ship us device and I open
Chrome and I try to scroll the verge and
it did starters oh yeah that's well I
think that's the end of that's the many
downloads are I mean I I personally
think um I guess I don't know I mean for
a laptop I just don't sense I don't get
a sense when I look at my laptop display
that I need more pixels to show things
smoother but I actually what I actually
want is more room for things yeah you
know an apple has gone at the retina
display with our first job is to make
things look smoother and then our second
job is if you want it and I think it
puts a real strain on the cpu to do it
is to show is it actually utilize more
pixels yeah full encanta on it he can't
run it at 121 so you can't run it i
think 2560 by 1600 because my invitin my
impression is and this is actually my
impression of and i think there's some
technical data to back this up that one
of the reasons that the ipad went to
double or you know quadruple the pixels
is that it is that for a
is that it is a less processor-intensive
scale scale up to go to like to and not
to like to do a a double yeah you know
to double it as instead of like doing
like it's a third bigger or whatever you
know like I think that requires more
computational power then I think that on
on the on the laptop you're getting the
and by the way I'm not an expert but
that's my understanding having read a
few articles on it and the laptop i
think is just trying to push a lot more
pixels if you go to that mode which is
the mode that i want where it's like I
can see more stuff on screen like I want
to see more lines of email I want to see
an extra row of icons I want to see
extra row of apps look is that a genetic
we got for you here check this out I got
an idea why don't you get me a
notification does it pop up over my back
bud like that good add you know what ya
lookin to uh some the other big news
that happen this week oh yeah I got it
look I got it I got a review to finish
we gotta wrap this up okay I mean not
right now what's the other news you
might talk about we could briefly go
through then like in like 15 minutes
alright 15 minutes we went to boss Scott
Forstall invested all right yes all
right Neal I know if you I'll have to
say about this if you're just catching
up Scott Forstall the iOS head is gone
oh yeah it's like he was forced out orla
it's not gone Oh use aside one year
advisory leave with 40 million dollars
and no one was to hear what he says you
make it sound like he just like
disappeared on the left why did so
there's been a lot of reporting out
about this now from New York Times Wall
Street Journal and then we have you know
we've done a little bit as well and
we've you know we obviously we hear
about what's happening it really sounds
like the reason that he left was not
maps alone and the reason that Scott
four Sol's means leave was that he
refused to sign the letter that Apple
was made to put out apologizing for how
bad naps and I was six work and he
demanded or he refused basically the
sybaris Lee refused to sign this letter
and said made demand the Tim Cook do it
and I think that was that was the
opening for him to leave but there was a
lot of you know that they're you as a
divisive figure you know I think he was
there were they found a way a reason to
pull the trigger and sort of yes a
catalyst not I causes it yeah I think
that was a thing that was a kind of well
is that a well-known or well rumored
fact that he had that he was he could be
a poll you know I think he was an
acolyte of jobs I think that you guys
can hear me okay right yep and I think
that he may be copied some of his
management style but you know it takes a
really specific special kind of person
to take jobs as management's Island make
it work and I think that it can rub you
know as I've tried to many many times at
the verge I cried when I would couldn't
get my way I've screamed at people for
being and then the next day
complement them on me and geniuses and
it has not gone that well it's not gone
that well you guys takes a very specific
kind of guy and I think if you if you're
not that guy it's going to be it's it's
a tough kind of a tough gig what I what
I want to talk about though is this this
Johnny I've thing which is they had a
bunch of they had a bunch of shuffles
but the most interesting one is that
they said they were putting Johnny I've
in charge of the human interface design
and to me and I don't know if this is
just a I don't know if it's a role
that's just like he is a name and he's
gonna have a bunch of other engineers
they're gonna work under him or what the
what the how this is going to work but
what I will say is I think that Jony ive
has a very different design sensibility
than scott forstall hat Ryan Recker talk
minimalism versus ski morphic design
John yeah I man and i think i and i
think that the idea and I think when you
see what some designers have done some
developers have done in iOS with some of
them really minimal beautiful design you
can do when you've got a screen like
that and a platform like that you can
kind of do whatever you want like the it
kind of excites me to think of Johnny
I've looking at the software and going
like what can we how can we fix this or
how can we alter this how can we improve
this because I mean no matter uh no
matter what you think about Apple I mean
I don't know I don't care who you are
where you came from what your name is or
what color your hair is or if you like
to wear flip-flops or if you wear
sneakers
you can't deny that Jony Ive's hardware
design his design sensibility about
hardware is incredible its unmatched i
would say in the industry and so that
tells me that he that he has some pretty
good ideas about how to make things
beautiful and make them function well at
least for hard ah dustrial design I mean
that doesn't it but that's I feel like
there's this this idea that like oh
that's just hard we're trying and
somehow that wouldn't apply there'd be
no there's been there be no application
of that and software and i think
like--look you either know if something
looks like rapper or it doesn't right i
think he'd at least be able to say if
like for all we know scott forstall
every time Johnny I've got in the room
and try to make a comment about a knob
or something you know or like a leather
stitch Scott Forstall was like get get
out of here this is my domain you have
no right to be you know I mean we don't
know we really don't know right but and
so like and it so it's very possible
Jonny I may be like yeah this is what
I've always wanted to do is you know
let's take it let's get rid of this
brushed this brushed metal slider and
turned it into like a flat minimal
design design you looking so I don't
know I'm just saying I'm excited about
the possibility but question is when do
we start seeing that like is it going to
be me dealers version next version of
iOS will probably completely revamped
6.1 will probably look about in the
depression you know yes amazing helmet
how amazing would it be a six point 0 0
1 0 1 a did it this is a completely
different it's actually just Android
that's great well I was gonna say like I
wouldn't be so I wouldn't be surprised
if we see some Android engineers and
designers get poached here um yeah cuz i
don't know i look at andrew and i think
like this is where Apple should be on
some of this stuff I actually look the
windows phone and think this is where
Apple should be on some of this stuff
you know where it's like it's
high-minded design but it's also
functional um you know I think that the
gesture stuff that that I mean you guys
haven't seen it yet but the but the
stuff in the camera in the new version
of Android is like yeah how could it
have possibly taken this long for
somebody to come up with this concept I
know the menus wherever you put your
thumb and you can access it all with a
thumb and you don't have to tap tap and
close a bunch of like settings windows
you saw the hint of that when the ipad
originally
you put your finger down you get a small
menu system and they never went anywhere
with it an android kind of realized it
with that's right they had the
contextual menus I remember talking
about it we were like this is a step in
the right direction it never happened
nothing ever materialized from it beyond
that um ya know well that was before
Android had any unified like vision you
know that was that was pre that was pre
Android actually looking good yeah and
desirable like a year and a half ago
yeah so no I know he's right though the
Gala's the galaxy galaxy nexus is it was
a turning point I actually said that my
feature right it was a turning point for
them there's when Matthias I things were
matias duarte like actually stepped in
there and said we need to do better
software design I mean he's obviously
got I mean he has a lot to do with
hardware and but I think that his
influence has been big on the overall
look and feel um and uh and so I think
that uh anyhow but no you're right it is
a year and a half I'm een is it was a
year ago really when did ICS come out
and this is by the way the most
frustrating thing about android he's
like ICS he's a really beautiful elegant
operating system jelly being improved
upon it and the newer version is gonna
you know improve upon that and like no
devices happened yep no two users will
ever experience it you know laura has an
HTC phone she's been using I keep like
telling her about the things in ICS are
in jellybean that like she would like
better than what she has to deal with
and what does it matter you can't get
and i think android i think by the way
there's LTE thing not to go back to
android but this thing with LTE and not
being able to get a device on the on the
fastest networks in America that is
competitive our device its competitive
with the iphone or the Lumia or the HTC
the 8x I think says something very very
uh worrisome and troubling about Android
and I think that you can have the most
look you know I made a joke about virgin
america becoming the Betamax of airlines
because like it's like they do a really
good but nobody flies them um but I
think that Android is is is in danger of
being the Betamax in the way that webos
was at one point and it was the beta of
of smartphone OS is like you got great
gestures and really good design but
you couldn't pull it off for one reason
or another now I androids like who cares
when you have TouchWiz on your device
who cares how good your stuff is its
operating system versus platforming the
underlying Android is going to be
they're going to be everywhere and they
can try to influence with these flagship
design elements but they're always the
right meriden oh I mean that's what
that's what that's what that's what's
kind of annoying is that we talked to
Andy Rubin we talked to Matthias and
they were like we're setting you know
we're setting the table here for our
partners right we're showing what can be
done and it's like you're showing what
can be done if your partner's give a
crap but they don't they really don't
they would prefer to get rid of your
stuff all together and just have you
know like a samsung world well and I
think that's actually really important
we are now at an inflection point I
think particularly for HTC where it may
be not profitable for them to try and
compete with Samsung to be the Android
vendor and to spend the money on drew
Bamford and skinning Android in the
sense and it might be better for them to
make windows phones and to take the
money for Microsoft that you know is
clearly coming their way and try to
build that ecosystem instead because
i'll have more ownership and more
control and more kind of direct support
from their software vendor right i think
i think it's it's that way for a lot of
companies now because of how dominant
samsung is but i think it's particularly
HTC which has been losing money you know
over and over and over again every
quarter trying to compete with Samsung
and just they can't find a formula to be
successful I mean does it is I guess it
just proves at the end of the day that
people don't really care that much about
operating systems right now I mean
people are buying phones because like
they think that the somebody's had a
really well thought out way to do
something in an OS you're buying phones
cuz they because they want to Instagram
and you the Samsung point super
interesting because i remember i think
it's the Windows Phone of it like
they're playing at theta X are playing
at Lumia 920 Samsung was there without
being there like right they didn't even
show a picture the achieve bomber says
it's you know we don't have it but you
know it sobs gonna be a big deal Samsung
is hard enough that we can be at
Microsoft and like be bigger than
Microsoft at their own game like they're
launching on what are you talking about
in it and yet the chicken
two big brands right no key an HTC there
the halo devices the flagship devices
Microsoft enforced these colors on them
right they all have to be bright yellow
and blue and purple or whatever I think
they look great the achieve is like
here's a piece of Samsung junk and it's
great plastic uh you know and it's it's
very much like here's like what say and
i only say that because the focus was
such a bad phone right it feels like the
samsung is doing the same thing to
microsoft again where it's like we are
capable of producing this uh and here
you go your here's here's what your
platform gets and i know even working
with HTC in nokia on these colorful
polycarbonate shells and making a
hardware stand out uh but here's the
achieve s and it's grey plastic it's
like that's what that's what Samsung has
become I think they are they're bigger
than Android in a very important way and
they're they're definitely bigger than
Windows Phone and Microsoft in a way
that I think opens the door for nokia in
HTC and you can't you know you we always
ask why nokia didn't pick android and
put android on the amazing hardware
disabled abuse I think that's why I
think I don't think they saw a world in
which they wanted to go head-to-head
against Samsung and Samsung's ability to
in you know willingness to produce
things to carry your spec right I didn't
know if you wanted to produce its own
products i think that's this is like the
inflection point i think for android and
for windows from a new windows phone
ecosystem to say here's a nexus 4 we
can't get it on carriers here's what our
partners have to do here's the biggest
brands in the world have to do they have
to put a verizon logo on the home button
for the galaxy note 2 because that's
what verizon what's the Samsung is
willing to do it and all these other
vendors have to decide what kind of
company they want to be in it it's it's
it's a major inflection so then does
does android just become Samsung's
platform and then everybody else goes
and competes on Windows Phone 8 because
it seems like to me it's it's going to
be really hard to compete on Windows
Phone 8 because all you can do is
differentiate hardware right like the
software down same well I mean I don't
think we know I don't think we know
because no one's buying the phones
they're right you know I don't think we
don't know I don't think we know what
competition looks like because you have
to have a base of people that are going
out and having to choose when with
what's happening is like instead of
choosing
one of those windows phone devices
they're choosing Android or iOS most
that time but I we know exactly what
Microsoft wants it to look like they
wanted to look like the pc market look
for years and years yeah they've been at
the software the vendors buy it they add
some crap where they ship the devices
well but but actually that may be other
soft money hand over fist and they all
need the martyr they did but the
difference is that unlike on PCs they're
not reskinning or customizing or adding
weird menus and stuff like this is like
they're adding software you can open it
or not you can also uninstall one of the
things that's amazing about the Lumia
then I was just when I first got it out
of the box is yeah there's a bunch of
crap on here for the day team he put on
I'm just gonna uninstall it it's gone
you know um and that you can't do that
on the on the samsung phone on the
android device yeah not that i don't
think users care you know they don't
really care they care about you know
their k they care about ass they care
about um whether it has LTE those are
the things that are born I people not
really I mean I I think it's sad it's
like it's like it's like all what where
is all of this great design and Android
going what do you ask when you were
there did you ask about motorola do they
even want to talk about it um they
didn't really want to talk about i mean
i made jokes about motorola but it was
all very like like I was like well you
got motorola than everybody would laugh
and then they would say you know it was
this anything about the queue every time
I try to bring up the you it was like um
uncomfortable like an uncomfortable few
seconds and then we they somebody would
change the topic yeah so yeah I mean
what are they gonna do with Motorola I
don't know um verizon isn't gonna let
them do what they want with Motorola
that's clear they just released a bunch
of new Motorola phones with horrible
blow where it grows graphics and
disgusting screens it's also clear that
Google itself can't get enough leverage
in this relationship either which is
bizarre to me yeah i mean verizon I
don't understand Verizon's driving
everything like Verizon Verizon jam song
good not appareled any less about I mean
windows phone I mean the idea really
steered you the ideal situation would be
I think the ideal situation is this um
18t has had this head start with with
with
apple and the iphone and i think they
continue to lean on that for their
dominance in the market you know verizon
had you know really verizon really hit
success with smart modern smartphones
when it started doing droids yep and
they've leaned into that for success and
now they have droids and iphones so
that's great you know what we need is
better competition what we need is
another I mean t-mobile actually has the
right idea they're releasing their
selling the nexus 4 it's an unlocked
device on their higher speed well
presumably higher speed HSPA network but
they don't have that they're not
competing here on on LT I mean if I
thought if I thought t-mobile was it was
a viable alternative to an LT to an LTE
device on 18 to your verizon I would
absolutely go get one but my my t-mobile
download speeds in my house are slower
than HSPA on AT&amp;amp;T so yeah that doesn't
help me it doesn't help a lot of people
we need we need that we need a third
open LTE network that covers all of
America sprint that will about it in
them to get on that world on that
capitalist know you love open things I
mean what we actually need is for
