Jersey it's a large warehouse that holds
decade's worth of material and it kind
of seems there's one guy who is the
archivist but other than that it's it
seems really like kind of a storage
facility I am George Kupchak I'm the
manager of the 18 t archives and History
Center at its Warren New Jersey location
we have a repository that has over
10,000 artifacts probably over 10,000
films and videos close to a million or
probably over a million photos that
trace the history of AT&amp;amp;T over the years
I thought of this place name as being
the 18t Information Center and what does
that come out attic I kind of thought of
that as just kind of a fun way of
representing what we have here it's
amazing what I have I'm constantly
surprised over here
we have this vacuum tube which i think
is fascinating this was part of the
first television demonstration and it
was from New York to Washington you can
tell me what it's about I have no idea
here Lord we can look at this what it
says that simulates some functions of a
living nerve cell this innovation led to
having visual communications cool UNIX
is the underlying language that the
Internet is based on this was the
beginning I mean this was probably a few
years later but the internet was
developed because of UNIX there is a
romantic notion in that this is the
nascent beginnings of communications and
other cultural things that we take for
granted
I was a dancer at one point I also did
theater join the company about 24 years
ago and I started off as a paralegal
through several promotions and whatever
I wound up here in the archives and the
more I work I come oh my gosh we did
that here too oh my gosh and that's kind
of get you more excited because then
there's something new every day
favorite artifacts well the telephone
wire is one find that exciting I also
have a Vitaphone I have the actual lab
notebook of rattan the actual patent
that Bell received from the Patent
Office on March 7th 1876 it's considered
the most valuable patent ever issued
this is where he actually recorded the
first telephone conversation on March 10
1876 and I will warn you right now I
didn't put the scotch tape that you're
gonna see right where my thumb is my
right thumb it says March 10 1876 mr.
Watson come here I want to history is
history there's good history there's bad
history don't want to let that go
because they'll remind you whether it's
a good thing or a bad thing of what that
represents and hopefully if it's a bad
thing you don't repeat it everything had
to be have a beginning whether it was
something from a hundred years ago and
by step by step by step it became this
huge invention or innovation that we
have now if it wasn't for that first
step you're not going to get any
how many people have the opportunity to
do something that is fun and enjoyable
yeah it has its moments where you know
you're busy and you're trying to get
everything done but for the most part
it's a nice gig</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
