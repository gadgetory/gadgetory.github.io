childhood and there's still a big part
of my life rarely did a game of risk or
monopoly end without a brother or an
uncle vowing revenge against their own
blood these games provided real
competition real excitement and most
importantly a table surrounded by real
people I love a good console game but
nothing compares to laying down a
lightning bolt in front of a colleague
and seeing a cringe man I love games but
where do these games stand in today's
world of digital gaming of virtual
reality do people still care about
family game night
it's impossible to talk about board
games stop talking about Hasbro the
company founded in 1923 has created some
of the most iconic games of all time
life candy land battleship Ouija Trivial
Pursuit Scrabble I mean the list doesn't
stop all the games you played as a kid
and while hansbrough may not have
created all of those games in-house it
now owns the companies that did as of
1984 Milton Bradley is one of Hasbro's
brands and what about Parker Brothers
the longtime rival of Hasbro hasbro
bought it in 1991 but these games have
been around for decades how does a 91
year old companies stay relevant today I
mean monopoly was created during the
Great Depression yet people around the
world still build Park Place hotels and
bankrupt their families how does it
games day timeless
do you have any idea on like the number
of families that monopoly and risk have
destroyed over the years have you ever
had any like divorces are weird we are
pretty competitive family so we've had a
lot of battles over monopoly and my wife
will not trade with me so we have a
trading rule at our family where we can
trade properties my kids will trade with
lead by wipe my wife now refuses to so I
understand the competitiveness of
Monopoly and risk but you know it's it's
a monopoly in particular is an amazing
brand right over ninety percent brand
awareness globally so you've got this
amazing appeal around the world and
what's great is our fans love to
participate in the creation of the game
so through our things like our token
vote and our house rules campaign we
found that fans want to contribute and
participate which I think gets the blood
boiling that much more is once you have
even more of a stake in it that you've
ever had before you're helping create
the game you are that much more
passionate about the brand what is it
about monopoly in other board games you
think keeps people coming sure well it's
funny because when i first started at
this company everybody's aware of what
monopoly is and almost everybody has one
in their house it's almost like a part
of the housewarming experiences that
somebody's going to get you a Monopoly
board and it's going to be one of those
things that you can always go to but I
think it's that it's that it's that
tactile feel and it's that it's that a
connection that you make to people
actually being face-to-face so this is
my man up so what we've done is out of
the box you have your classic game that
everybody's familiar with and it'll come
with these these little squares and on
these squares you can print out stickers
using the website or the app and you can
put them into all the different spaces
within your monopoly game so as you go
through here you see that each picture
sort of has a customized piece
underneath that's a silly sunglasses or
Santa's Little Helper and you can move
these around all around the board to
make any salad game that you want but
then a game like I was talking about you
have a website that you can access and
you have a mobile app both of them are
connect
to each other so the user goes in they
can't even log in with their Facebook or
they could create an account they go
inside they can upload photos from
social from social networks or they can
grab photos from their mobile device or
from their computer they put it into the
account and then they can start to
customize those photos so they can crop
in they can add text and we're going to
start to add more features as we start
to see more people getting engaged with
the product and product engagement
really is what drives game development
it has bro remember Simon the electronic
memory game today it's become Simon
swipe kids today are more familiar with
touchscreens and Hasbro looked at that
when developing the updated version this
is Simon swipe this is your newest one
how did you come up with the idea for
this so really I mean what it really is
is taking the great classic gameplay of
Simon which involves lights colours
memory all of that and making a relevant
to a whole new generation of kids with
the technology here we have it's a
actually a tap technology so it's touch
just like traditionalsignin start with
one light and builds that's where the
new Simon's white comes into play so
press press and then hit the swipe up
folks so we cast a really wide net and
we came up with lots and lots of
different concepts and there was through
a process of elimination with marketing
with upper management to drive down to
one concept and that could be from what
is the easiest get to what's the most
exciting new product to something that's
we can really advertise and that we can
drum up a lot of business around why did
you make a new physical assignment
instead of a a nap or a digital game
while there is this sort of you know
great influx of you know digital media
and apps and all that there's still sort
of a basic human need for the for the
physical and
you know when we test stuff with kids
you really really see that when you get
something physical that they hold it's
just it's there's something there I feel
that there's always going to be a place
for the for the physical as well why are
board games still know it I think the
primary reason is people still want
social connection and what games would
what our gaming brands bring is the
ability to bring people together and
connect socially for Laughs excitement
fun you can't always get that from
digital gaming do you think that for
games the physical games would be the
heart of Hasbro forever I mean is that
something that's never going to go away
and you're in your mind are you going to
start making more video games or digital
components or are you going to try to
stick with with what's trying to true I
think gaming is going to be with Hasbro
gaming is a kind of a cornerstone of
what Hasbro's about and we focus on the
brand first and then figure out the best
way to bring that to consumers so
physical gameplay is definitely a core
mainstay for Hasbro digital gameplay is
a core mainstay for hasbro i think
whatever wherever the consumer goes
we're going to be there Hasbro's moves
are precise calculated and focused like
a game of chess each design and
development move has a clear focus and
what the end goal will be but newer
younger companies are taking a different
approach in early 2011 indie game cards
against humanity raised over fifteen
thousand dollars on Kickstarter its
original goal was only four thousand and
it's currently now the number one
selling game on Amazon a title it's held
for three years since then Kickstarter
has become one of the most popular spots
for indie games to receive funding one
of those is the yet-to-be-released game
of phones created by Luke Stern and Sam
wander the game acts as a perfect middle
ground between physical and digital
gaming on the one hand it's a card game
you have a deck piece around a table
with a group of friends if you're me you
have some beers in a pizza but on the
other hand every player is clutching
their phone at all times your photos or
tweets your knowledge of google images
these are your tools to win the game
this isn't Bradley Cooper from American
hustle this is Luke's turn from game of
phones so what does game of phones game
of phones is a deck of cards i play with
you and your friends the idea came out
of the kind of anti-social use of
smartphones with in social settings so
essentially how it works is one person
is the judge they pick a card from the
top of the deck and it says something
like find an ugly baby and then
everybody else solves it with their
smart phone however they see fit it
could be nothing baby from anywhere it
could be an ugly your ugly baby it could
be your own ugly baby if you feel that
it's ugly enough to challenge everybody
else is ugly baby so then I as the judge
if I pick the card decide who has the
ugliest baby and award that card and the
first person to 10 cards wins sounds
like you can make a lot of enemies in
this game or a lot of friends most the
development for this game happened in a
few bars so we have about four different
types of cards there's kind of the find
cards so for example find the weirdest
thing that comes up when you google
image search yourself then they're ones
that kind of deal with the content
that's already on your phone rather than
searching on the internet so like show
the last video you took so that's
already there you're not going to create
anything then there's also more physical
things so like most crack screen wins
and then there there's one other type
that's kind of like sits in the
background while you're playing next to
get a facebook notification wins so
that's a card that just sits with the
judge until the plague keeps going and
then someone gets a notification so it's
also like apples to apples and cards
against umass oh yeah similar to those
two games in a sense that I mean maybe
more towards cards against humanity in
the sense that like you're definitely
playing towards the judge and trying to
kind of win them over so it may even
help if you know them sometimes because
you may be able to play something
funnier towards them and you guys put
this on Kickstarter and how long did it
take you to get funded and recognized so
we did a two week campaign and we got
funded I think within the first week
people keep telling us to make an app
for the game and that's like definitely
not where we wanted to start with it
maybe it is a good idea down the line
but that if we really wanted to pull it
out and kind of have something that you
can touch and trade and therefore have a
physical interaction with someone rather
than just using your cell phone
Kickstarter is great for getting
concepts like game of phones made
quickly without a corporate machine but
sometimes these concepts need a little
more time to bake well not everything
about the game always works it does nail
the social aspect of gaming and in the
end that's what's most important I've
been playing board games and video games
like since I was really little and sure
mario kart and monopoly have their
differences but they shine most for the
same reasons they bring people together
I'll never forget the time I first sat
down with my friends in the Nintendo 64
first came out I was excited about the
cooling of graphics but I really must
say enjoyed being with Miley but
the same is true for risk or monopoly or
any other game with real human
interaction that's why at the end of the
day this tiny game for the fire TV
called fitted was everyone's favorite it
may not have had any physical component
like a deck or board but that didn't
matter there's just no substitute for
trash talking the people you love in
person</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
