humans that are watching this welcome to
another awesome Google+ hangout where we
talk about small empires and we're
joined with or joined by Alexis Ohanian
who is the co-founder of Reddit and the
host of the show small empires along
with Steven Greenwood and Kirk Larson
who I've introduced many times they are
the people that make the show happen six
times
only six only six sorry but this is
season two so yeah anyway so this week
for those that have seen the episode
small Empire went to August which makes
a smartlock
which was also designed by behar who is
a super awesome well-known designer guys
if you want to talk about the episode or
you know sort of say what say how it
went that kind of thing because we are
not we don't have anyone from the
company today unfortunately but we do
have the people that made the effort yes
we'll be fielding questions with
hashtags bonfires on Twitter to get ads
so now I'm in New York in a Burton
Verge's office and they are out
somewhere in the discrete locations if
anybody can figure it out
where was that bonus points so talk
about talk about August smartlock after
you showed that grilled cheese into your
face so so basically you know we kind of
had some trepidation about doing an
episode about certainly I didn't want to
do it it was too obviously for us right
we thought that the season is about
showcasing communities that aren't
commonly maybe known by a lot of people
for startups and so we we were hesitant
to go to San Francisco but at the same
time we really wanted to do a company
that
in a space that we had income and
hardware was one of those things that a
lot of people have been asking us and
we'd be talking about doing for a long
time so we found a great hardware
company bargain august smart law and
there was like two years old now less
than that yeah I think around here and
change there at August itself had really
what employees do they have tiny in
downtown San Francisco right next to be
soft I actually showed screenshots of
those Assassin's Creed glitches to the
windows of hoop you saw what was really
cool is and we discovered August they
have a unique story because a guy who
has started a couple companies and kind
of been through the wringer on a
software side had some success at some
other ones that maybe weren't as
successful decided that he wanted to get
into hardware to solve a problem
personally that's a loud car horn sorry
and basically he went out and take it up
with yves behar as a co-founder to come
together and both share the equity of
his company that they would set out to
launch together and that was about that
how that happened cuz you know you've
got to be sort of someone to walk up to
a designer of that caliber and say hey
designed my product for me but Jason
actually he was the CEO of a couple of
really successful companies okay you
come with the money from what if it's
like one of the sales would have two
companies to start a thing called
founders row oh I didn't see that
tonight oh yeah kind of like just like a
place for founders of like startups to
hang out and so he pitched the idea for
August inside a founders row and a bunch
of people were like hey that's cool and
he was like yeah let's do it together
so even was part of founders row party
founders row but he's sort of he got the
momentum from the founders row thing and
he and he had really hit it off at a
previous conference and so they just got
talking when Jason was like Jason basic
and Eva was like I want to fix keys in
somehow and he was like all right let's
do it
Aysen already had the backing or at
least the support of the other quote the
founder throw what's uh Rhonda Ryan
Manning edited part of this episode do
you guys know the story that I'm about
to tell Stephen have you heard what he
said so right before he sits down to
edit he has all the footage ready to go
and he says he gets a call from his
girlfriend that she was locked out of
their apartment home letter in the
apartment comes back to the office
starts editing the video
what the hell is this yeah incidental
really really crazy that that happened
so but I think the the problems that
they're trying to solve a pretty
interesting because they a lot of what
they were talking about is that you know
people might need to let other people
into their home for a certain window of
time right so maybe have a dive lock or
you have a house cleaner or a friend
just needs to come and stop and get
something you can schedule that in
certain windows with certain people and
create accounts they have access to your
place so what happens if your phone is
dead that's the first question that came
to mind I'm sure they've addressed it
but I don't know the answer but their
answer is basically have user use your
key I mean honestly what they said was
like you could go to you could either
walk through an extra neighbor and have
them download August's and you can put
your access code in or find a charge
somewhere or keep your key because you
can still it doesn't change the lock on
the front of the door so you can that
thing opens that like metal case opens
oh that metal case is on the inside of
the house and the friend just looks like
a normal log so people people walk down
the street don't know that you haven't
expensive piece of technology I see I
see but it's like if you're gonna make
the you know transition to go keyless
then you don't want to carry your keys
right yeah I know but they I mean
frankly the answer is news sorry I used
which is I like I can't imagine what
another answer would be you know like
yeah sorry oops notice our box there's a
battery on the thing and you can pop a
charge from it but that would be minutes
though or if you could get like an
external NFC sticker to put on your
thumb it didn't require power yeah yeah
that would be like a fail-safe so we you
guys mentioned this New York Times
article that recently came out I mean
we're talking about the company as a
whole talking about that article I mean
their article is basically this is
really cool this is a really cool
product but it it's just like the first
version of this product and so like kind
of like what the episode was all about
hardware is really hard and I think it's
like the first iPhone kind of stuck you
know anything like it was cool and it's
the cool step but it's not quite right
and they actually spent a lot of time
kind of going back from scratch after
they initially started designing the
block because they realized that it
needed to be universally used to be able
to fit over every type of door lock
that's out there and originally they
were just gonna I think there are their
approach was that they were going to
have something that you install instead
of your existing right you realize that
that was too there was too much friction
there and too many people that wouldn't
be able to install that in their door so
it had to be something that goes on top
so like that was that was one of the big
problems that they solved in their first
run-through and I think they did a
pretty good job of that and obviously
found a lot of good partners to
manufacture in the actual hardware in
what was he saying about the motor
oh yeah the motor is always like it's
gonna match it's like resize this
medical device it's for like cutting
through bone you know well yeah yeah to
be both precise and powerful but in the
case the August lock it's turning about
yeah but and there's like a 100-room
yeah it has right cuz
well that was an interesting it's an
engineering problem because every door
is different right right depending on
words it is depending on the temperature
the last block the last time you adjust
any doors can be adjusted yeah who knew
so so it's like it's superficially I
think the kind of idea that
easy like the New York Times article is
pretty snarky you almost certainly don't
need that unless you run a boarding
house or bordello you almost certainly
don't need a digital smart lock to your
front door nor do you find God yeah it's
like he's reportable they're durable
they're cheap to replace and everyone
understands how to use them
Yankees yeah it was there are certain
points that are true like personally
like the amount of times that I have
someone coming in and announced is twice
a year so like I have like right and I
run a youth hostel out of my apartment
takes equity stakes and exchange
founders this plan eight idea I I think
it'll be really interesting to see five
years from now if this I think it's the
kind of product that either really
really succeeds or really really doesn't
I think I personally think that as like
batteries and Bluetooth get better this
should it feels like more different like
this should be out yeah if I feels like
yeah it's just like my battery on my
phone dies in four hours so I would
never I could do it right up and are
there more competitors like there are
other people that are doing this smart
thing right there August is sort of the
most beautiful and it seems like the
most design said that usually they're
definitely going to nest a lot about the
nastic said that you know II had you
talked I mean I think I think that the
device is really cool it feels really
nice yeah it looks like just a thick
nest yeah yeah basically so yeah we're
at that point with smart home where I
think a lot of people are still trying
to figure out what is going to catch
what is just unnecessary yeah point
where like we can start putting chips
into everything right we can make
everything connected right yeah right
but it's interesting that you mention
NFC before because the new
iPhones and plenty of Android phones
have NFC in it already so you know what
right so does this company make money
are they selling units what's the deal
they've sold a good group units I mean
we obviously they're privately owned
took right there it seems like they're
in Apple stores no gentleman was to get
featured in welcome to online and retail
stores now yeah and I know that they're
they're definitely working hard to keep
up sounds like okay I don't think I mean
hardware is hard right that's like the
whole fun yeah that was the pun to
manage expectations for your consumers
that would be the biggest one and we see
you know one of the seminal huge
hardware for your campaigns went through
ICS pebble and though they did end up
shipping it was the biggest chick
starter to date at that point though
they did end up shipping lane I think by
and large they're you know customers
were we're very happy with the product
we're now entering a weird space where
like you know me saw that you've got
you've got things like the Smart Watch
which require a ton of good software in
a good hardware then you also see things
like what was that cooler called
which is the new most popular
Kickstarter the coolest cooler it's a
cooler with like a Bluetooth
speaker and a blender yes okay and this
cooler campaign a year ago failed
miserably didn't hit its goal came up
with a much better video Luke and blow
away started 13 million dollars and they
asked for 50 grand
yeah actually the idea of having a good
video influence your company
is being then will arise later in the
season but so so I think we're a really
cheating point we're like we'll see
companies like pebble very early-stage
very ambitious founders who want to
 invent the SmartWatch and create
it and you're able to create a new
market then you see others like no
offense to the cooler company for like I
mean they want to make these are all
solved problems yes they're just putting
them all together right what people love
it I don't regret them for their success
so you know we're seeing this whole
range and and August is somewhere in the
middle here and for anyone aspiring to
do this kind of a hardware of making
this company it's beautifully it's a
really seductive time right you can make
an amazing video raise hundreds of
thousands if not millions of dollars but
still need to deliver on it
right and then they have nothing to show
if you don't deliver a product bottom is
not Kickstarter is easy money for you
yeah land like and I think we're gonna
see over the next couple years we're
gonna stew the haul out of some
campaigns doing extremely well and
satisfying and some failing miserably
and I don't think I you know again of
the day it is buyer beware
it's often not much taken on just the
world it is how things go it's just now
the hype cycle is built and it's great
but it's built ahead of time before
you'd necessarily demonstrated you can
build it right and I'm invested in
hardware companies that failed miserably
I invested in a precursor to the jawbone
called wake mate which was really
ambitious really cool but failed
miserably because they didn't get the
hardware right and they didn't spend
enough time doing the diligence overseas
and they were just recent college kids
who can can do it it's just a lot easier
when you're only dealing with software
because your failure points are a sight
crashing right there not being catching
on fire or someone getting injured or so
that yeah I mean it's it was a little
responsibility right yeah even just
money-wise they cost a lot of money just
to make this job well like this you're
that company you're just talking about
didn't have a cool Kickstarter video
north of where they on Kickstarter where
they know it was before
Kickstarter oh wow oh that's super
ambitious then they did a traditional I
mean they were ahead of the game
it's just you know timing is a lot of
stuff but the good news is as more
companies are doing it they're gonna
create blueprints for other companies
more people that do this the more
examples and yeah yeah like Eric midget
cops key for instance the founder of
pebble he's he's on the rolodex for
anyone who has successful like hard
Hardware campaign that they run because
they're you know third they'll do
anything to get twenty minutes just to
pick a spray so we can tell them don't
use this vendor use this vendor don't do
this don't do that and that knowledge is
being spread now so that's that you know
everyone stands on the shoulders of
giants so that is gonna help but you
really you know hard what hardware is
hard and I think that it's hard oval
punch no I guess it's just that as Jonah
grommet yeah I but it is hard right hard
it's hard you can't really say it
software soft because that's not true at
all yeah yeah it's a Alexis all right
you guys want to dude this is not a plan
this is literally a hangout everyone
watching right now and I seen will be a
quiz 1 throwback
yeah yeah they've got a business right
there printed X yeah into money okay so
how did you find out subscribe to the
person YouTube people ass the verge this
is terrible
did you know who alexis was before the
show what like what we have what we're
gonna do we're about to find out damn
what should we want to see what so this
got leaked out a couple days ago a bunch
is gonna really hurt okay
bunch of high schoolers have a facebook
called high school hackers they're all
their developers they all you know they
go to hack together maybe it was college
I don't know regardless a bunch of
students posted up the internship offers
they were getting from oh yes I would be
monthly internships from all the tech
companies you could think over the
Facebook the Google is everything I
believe how much you could pay it for a
month a lot yeah seventy five to eight
thousand thirty five hundred eight
thousand dollars plus I was yes as if
you tap as an interest so like I can't
stress
I can't stress this enough learn to code
yeah the co-founder is telling you to
learn to code yeah
Korra's 8250 pincher 7,500 Dropbox 8.5
Google is only coming in at 7 but they
do include a house stipend to provide
moving please yeah you know my
internship not literally zero dollars
not even one dollar that I think yeah so
again learn to code okay buddy he's
there I know we're actually doing this
hangout talking about a hardware company
and why it's even harder than affiliate
when you walk up to your door yeah
pretty dope but I really yeah so I'm
gonna state I didn't drop out I was too
cowardly both Steve Steve
both better degrees before starting yeah
 almost to the day you sold
reddit I ready
wait what you you sold you sold reddit
like right after you graduated college
like within the first year is like a
hundred days or something year and a
half later a whole year only a year and
a half it's good so stay in school build
something awesome while you're in school
and then sell it and under yeah yeah or
just run it for the rest of your life
just hang out and enjoy working on a
cool team sure that's the best part
honestly I think the the fact that you
get to choose who you work with is so
rare and I had enough jobs growing up
working for people and with people who
like didn't respect keep it real I'm
sorry no ya know who you are
like that's that's the biggest gift that
I feel like right I think that's why
reddit sort of grewed but it was right
because like you and Steve effectively
our reddit like it is a product is your
child and that just you know you guys
are good you guys are good people and
the product is humongous
that's for sure you guys should do you
guys should do make him spit ballin out
the verge should do a series this might
be two other weeks you might hate this
but like of like profiling all these
engineers in tech because all of the
CEOs get all the face time but all the
engineers are the ones I know it's like
who is actually building the product the
CEO is just like 15 dudes in this really
dark little zone yeah but uh ya know I
really hope it inspires folks to do cool
 so you gotta go do it now and then
or season season 7 season seven ish yeah
no I mean can't we just tell give it
away for the for the people that are
watching this or do you guys not want to
do that alright people watching it's
gonna be our biggest company that we
covered the Seas
their value is four point seven billion
dollars and inquired and they let you do
some creepy when your neighbor's
house their Zilla
and I just so load this restaurant dad
and the realistic look how much anyhow
spots they recently acquire Trulia right
but yeah
so that'll be episode nine weeks yeah
we're not going to tell you oh man if
you follow me on instagram though you
already know an episode eight building
hike it's good we got some interviews to
do thanks for joining everyone we'll see
you next week the next show go offline
pyre subscribe to the verge on YouTube
all that good stuff peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
