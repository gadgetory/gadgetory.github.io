Nokia's re-released matrix phone they
have updated the classic phone from the
90s the slider the banana phone for 2018
and now has LTE has a larger screen but
otherwise it's very much the same form
factor this shape is pretty ridiculous
in 2018 but it works there is a ton of
nostalgia here and having wanted one
ever since I saw the matrix I love the
fact that hmd global which now makes
Nokia phones is bringing it back I think
they're entirely relying on that
nostalgia for this thing to sell but I
absolutely don't care I buy into it in
this case the pricing to sell for under
$100 and basically HMV says that there
is still over a billion people who are
using feature phones and they think that
through some combination of you know
nostalgia Nokia's recognizable brand
name and just being one of the few
people still making decent future phones
it can actually get some people to buy
this thing so obviously the big deal
here is the design it has this curved
shape on the outside which is part of
what gives it the bananaphone nickname
also it comes in yellow as well as a
black color there is a headphone jack on
top charges over microUSB there's a 2
megapixel camera on back I've already
taken a photo with it and I can tell you
it is terrible the slider is not exactly
great but it's not about whether it's
good or bad it's about the fact that it
was in the matrix 20 years ago and you
know what that is probably enough you
have to use a directional pad to
navigate the interface you have to use
t9 to type and everything going back
after a decade on smartphones is a real
wake up call as to how not great that
experience was it's kind of usable if
you're just navigating the menus but the
buttons are really tiny and hard to use
it's hard to quickly get around the
face you can actually get into a web
browser here and navigate things you'll
control a cursor with the d-pad so even
though you can't get Android apps there
is still an app store and Nokia has
partnered with a bunch of companies to
fill it with some popular apps so
there's gonna be Twitter there's gonna
be Facebook there's even gonna be a
whole suite of Google apps including the
Google assistant we're not really sure
what that experience is going to be like
but the intention really seems to be
bridging the gap between a future phone
a smart phone by offering at least some
of the functionality there is a two
megapixel camera on the back of this
thing I have to tell you it is really
not good it is exactly like the last
time you use a feature phone everything
is just big blocky chunky pixelated mess
I guess it's there because it has to be
but don't take pictures for this and
expect much and of course this is a
Nokia phone
and so there's snake I have to tell you
I've accidentally launched snake five
times while filming this video it takes
a lot of work to quit snake this one
also has LTE and while that might seem
kinda useless on a feature phone it can
also be used as a hotspot which I guess
will be a little bit more handy that's
also gonna allow it to work on more cell
networks around the world and this one
is actually destined for Europe you're
gonna be able to buy it in May for 79
euros there's also going to be a dual
SIM model which will probably cost a
little bit thanks for watching for more
