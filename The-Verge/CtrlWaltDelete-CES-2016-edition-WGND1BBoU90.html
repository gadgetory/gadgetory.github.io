real thing ok does that happen
hello and welcome to control alt delete
a podcast that I no longer am able to
say is new because it is a totally
different year it is we began it is and
we are starting out the year 2016 at CES
I'm joined here by walt mossberg my
friend and the executive editor of The
Verge how's it going well yeah you know
it's it's it's gone CES it's gone see
yes I have to say that so if you're
listening the show we you should know
that we are at CS in the in the verge
lounge sponsored by Ford I think I just
collected three dollars with an audience
front of us it's super cool to have
everybody here Ivan at CES for 500 years
and Walt got here yesterday yeah today
is the first official day of the show
right we just walked through the LG
booth and Samsung booth right I was
mesmerised by everything and what was
like why do you need this in the
refrigerator but I want to talk about CS
was the top level like what is the Walt
Mossberg experience at CES well it's
mote it has evolved over the years this
is my 24th year oh my god upcoming to
either see yes or its predecessor Comdex
which some of the older attendees might
remember which was which was at one time
where the computer industry when it did
not go to CES and CS was much smaller
and Comdex was about this size maybe not
quite as big but almost and then it the
computer guys started going over here
and Comdex kind of collapsed but it's my
24th year going to vegas for a gigantic
massive trade show
and so my experience has changed
somewhat over the years it now it's I
find the highest value to be private
meetings where I'm seeing things that
are not on the show floor or talking
about them at least and because there's
two CSS or at least there's maybe five
Cs two different ones and but the two
that I'm thinking of our the show floor
experience and then kind of well here's
really what we're working on here's
what's yeah what's the good stuff here
and I prefer to go to the you know I get
more value out of this to be honest yeah
but here they're still all this stuff
here yeah yeah yeah I one of the most
persistent criticism the show is that
nothing gets announced here is like
valuable or it's all nonsense or it's
all just like toaster fridges gluing two
things together but when I walk around I
see all these attempts to build new cons
of is that is that just a new perception
of CES that it's all kind of silly or is
that been sort of always your critical
of it and you have the proof of that
which I guess you're going to read a
little love but it's not critical
because it's quotes ill I don't think
it's silly I just think it's a kind of
follower kind of kind of event there are
for sure
innovations here that will take root and
become important particularly in the
areas which are the roots of this event
which are consumer electronics so TVs
for instance but if you think my only
point is it first of all the five most
important tech companies in the world
you have virtually no presence here and
secondly wait named 25 Google and Apple
Microsoft Facebook and Amazon right
those are the those are the big five
companies with platforms and products
that I'm pretty out you ask the people
here I mean you all use something from
these companies every day and you rely
on it in your who has a windows from
your personal life well I mentioned my
Christine you can't get a windows found
in a virtue this is not here helots
that's good so that's number one number
two if you look at the breakthrough
game-changing products of the last 15 20
years from any of those companies and
some others none of them were introduced
here with the only exception is HD TV
because this has always been a TV show
and it took my estimate was it five CES
is before it sort of took off yeah
that's the other thing about it it's a
slow cooker kind of a show it's not like
you know Steve Jobs has walked out on
the stage
three weeks after the launch of X
they've sold X million of them right
that's not quite the way this one works
yeah i mean but i don't think it's silly
I i I've never said that and I don't
believe it well I think it's interesting
call it a TV show because fundamentally
that has been the heart of this show for
so many years please here's sony HD
range of tvs they're going to take a
bunch of best executives out to dinner
and convince them to stock the TV right
and I've never actually understood that
dynamic because bet they need the TV's
like why do you gotta cubensis I'll best
because best buy has a lot of power over
all the stuff including like even
laptops right I mean they'll tell the
laptop makers we think if you had this
feature you change this color or you
move this thing over here would do
better on the show and that's kind of
like what really happens here right the
company's show off a bunch of new stuff
the vendors the dealers the partner
should show up they look at it that's
why nothing ships until june or july out
of CES traditional right and i think
that is what kinda gets lost or the ship
but let's get into what actually
happened here have you been paying
attention to the user but we watch the
crazy samsung LG sony press conferences
i have I don't go to the press
conferences any what's another change
well Jim I CEOs go to wall well no no
well it isn't that it's at one time I I
never missed a Bill Gates press
conference for instance and stuff like
that but
I think there's a lot of fantasy at the
press conferences that door doesn't
relate to the real world and there's
just more valuable uses of your time at
all and we have a big staff and we have
a lot of terrific reporters who are
going to do a great job on those press
conferences so I'm kind of superfluous
yeah but to the actual products that
come out so for example when you see a
coming exam some say this is the year
for HDR 4k TVs and an LG says it 10
minutes later and it's only says the
five minutes later does that strike you
is okay finally this is happening or is
that just silliness to you it's it's
absolutely not silliness and I'm not
buying into that turn why do you think
these guys have that's the most vicious
encryption you know you know quantum
dots was something I actually SAT
through one our briefing about two years
ago because I thought well maybe this is
important you know I don't know its back
then we just walked through as you said
a couple of booths and we saw science
has talked about quantum dots i'm still
not i don't think i remember exactly
what they are but I know they're
important and and I know that different
companies have different names for them
and if anyone here has a good name that
nobody else is using let me know so you
know having HDR that might that might be
what they need to sell more 4k TVs you
know I just don't know
they they tried that they succeeded with
HGTV although as I said it took years
they now have a problem because the
replacement cycle of TVs and you know
this is we know this from talking about
how the replacement cycle of laptops
asst has has you know moved from every
few years to have five six whatever I
don't think people really know tablets
the same thing we don't know if
something has a 78 year replacement
cycle which I think big TVs typically do
it's hard to move to the next thing get
people who just shelled out a bunch of
money for an HDTV to buy the next thing
and I think that's why 3d fails mm-hmm I
mean there may be other reasons but that
was one of the big reasons people
weren't ready to it's easier I'm you
know do you I put off the wall right
you're an iphone or a galaxy you might
be inclined to replace at least every
other model or something like that but a
TV you know you have to have spousal
negotiations about it and that's that
fit in the room and there's a lot of a
lot of I think three failed because just
didn't offer any compelling reason that
you're going to wear glasses in your
home I agree but it's also not something
that lends itself to an impulse buy like
a smaller like even a laptop right
theoretically but I look at 4k HDR and I
think there's a lot of people out there
with first and second-generation TVs in
their living room and they have had no
reason to upgrade them
right and now you can go in the store
and see something that's ridiculously
thin that has streaming content that
actually works in 4k HDR it's slowly
starting to come out although I will say
something just randomly at the end of
their press conference announced we have
another new 4k streaming service and
like they didn't mention that they have
an old one fish like shut so but you see
it happening with Netflix you see it
happening with other streaming services
there they're investing in content so I
think that upgrade cycle in my
estimation anyway is about to house at
recoup you could well be right and and
it's the third or fourth C yes for 4k
yeah which is about you said HTTP and
525 you know it's probably about to
start and it will hit some stride in the
next couple of years in part where some
of it depends on the macro economy which
and you know penned the people's wage
levels it's possible income and stuff
we're not qualified to discuss yeah so
while you wrote this piece I think like
the day after we have launched a few
years ago it's called CES is not what
you think it is I only imagine you wrote
this under extreme duress of starting a
new company I very little sleep yeah and
so it sits as long thing and it
basically sums up what we've been
talking about here which is that there's
like five CES is happening right
somewhere here there's like I just
moderated a panel at the cyber security
forum at the Venetian right I asked the
people on a panel if they were ever
coming here and they were like no we
were never going to show for why would
we go there right there's like random
chip vendors here talking about talking
to platform vendors about putting new
chips in I mean there's like 500 kinds
of shows here and then there's like TV
companies trying to get TVs in the best
buy but I'm just going to read this
paragraph which I think sums up what
most consumers think about CS which is
the ipod WTS know about Windows 95 no
Google search facebook the iPad the
first android phone
you've there's five notes here nope no
filter Microsoft's historic first Apple
Computer the surface and up again
although what's it historic looking back
on it now was just joy because was the
first computer they made there you go
and you've got this is a list of notes
and I think that's what there's so much
out there about what isn't here what do
you think is here some people I'm you
know I this is not the first year that
you could say this but I think it's its
way up this year and it's in its kind of
presence and that has to do with the the
car becoming a platform for software for
digital hardware and the kind of battle
that I think is shaping up some cases
they'll be partnerships but I think a
bit overall as kind of a battle between
the two big rival Valley Giants google
and apple on the one hand and the car
industry and it takes several forms i
mean one of it is we all know that
Google's been working on making
driverless cars they've had years there
I think they're ahead of everybody we
also believe strongly that Apple is
working on building a car and if it's
driverless or what it is but whenever
the head of one of the major car
companies said to me yesterday
his executive team has been told to just
absolutely assume Apple is building a
car huh nah not based on any information
but that just for their own that's just
the environment planning they better
assume it and they all anybody and when
he said was and we had better assume
it'll have a fabulous ui/ux and we'd
better well but that's what they're
working against you say in your car you
go to turn on the radio Apple music
shows up so but the point is that's one
thing yeah but the other thing that is
maybe smaller scale but it represents
the clash is control of the dashboard
you know wait before we get to
driverless cars and all the regulation
and all the things hurdles it has to go
through it's it's a month the near term
thing that you're going to see is
control of the dashboard yeah and the
car companies don't want to give it up
and Apple and Google have Android auto
and car play which is Apple's where I
don't know how many people sitting here
have tried it I don't think this is a
representation of that actual us or
global population but um if you just can
I explain really quickly so if you go
into a car that supports it and there
aren't beginning to be a reasonable
number of them and you plug in an iPhone
or an Android phone you get a subset of
the apps on your phone in with big icons
most these cars have touchscreens but it
also works from voice you don't have to
use so you don't have to use the the
software that car makers put on you can
basically have right on the screen of
your car those apps which are deemed to
be safe to use and which
you can control by voice you get to use
Siri or google voice both of which in my
experience are way better than the ones
the car makers built in and you just get
to take your experience from the real
world cut down a little for safety but
very familiar into the car right and
there's been big announcements here
right so yeah fiat-chrysler said all
their cars are going to do it Ford said
their cars are going to do well Ford
sort of split it right i mean ford
announced its own platform or the
expansion of its own right there Toyota
now and Toyota is going to use it but at
the same time Ford is there 2017 models
are going to have carplay and android
auto most GM cars already have it honda
accord has it hyundai sonata but i think
this thing you're saying it's funny you
see the industry saying we're going to
do what we're going to do it and then
toyota says we're licensing the ford
platform which now has the capability
but we are not going to do car point i
try out as a hole down there are some
others that are holdouts and but my
position as a reviewer as a tech
journalist for a long time is it's much
better i think it's even better for
safety for you to have a familiar thing
that you used to whether it's Google
Maps or God forgive me Apple maps which
to be honest hasn't has improved a lot
it's probably not going to drive you
into a lake like it would have a few
years ago but it's not as good as Google
if you if you're you know if you love
Spotify and you have it on your phone
it's just there yeah and even even
Bluetooth phone calls are actually
easier yeah with this it's so what's the
current so I say I have said to car
company folks both here and before this
why actually had a public discussion
about it with the head of GM Mary Barra
at biko our coat conference last spring
why don't you just say you know what
we're really good at the engine we're
really good at the at the at the
transmission we're really good at you
know that that bending of the metal to
make the car we're not so great at this
why don't we just let the and every
consumer either has an android or an iOS
phone just put that in and let them do
it and not only that why don't we have
apps we can build them ourselves or if
somebody else build them that controls
the sea and controls the HVAC and it's
all going to look like Android or all
going to look like iOS to me that would
be the best thing didn't want to do that
no I'll never do it they don't want to
do that they don't that they're very
reluctantly putting these things in
because it helps them selves cars they
think but they don't ever want to give
up the whole thing and they actually
claim that the that that I had somebody
claimed to be just yesterday that the
controlling of the position of the seed
and the HVAC are things that play into
their regulatory approvals and they
can't give that to google and apple I
don't know maybe it did yeah I mean I I
it's funny cuz it's just I just imagined
him cook getting and did whatever
extraordinarily expensive car he has and
like fiddling with the defroster and
being like how this sucks and genuine
let me do it so he's just gonna build
the whole car right like it's like that
level of you can just see the me like
whatever always gotta build Paul Carter
yeah but so there's that I think if
there's like I think that's a big deal
let's see that's the first big deal
that's the incremental the next one is
you know this company called faraday
future announced like we're building a
car platform and basically the cars are
going to electric in autonomous we
partnered with the Chinese entertainment
company and they're going to play
entertainment the cars while they drive
you around and that's like some really
futuristic stuff volvo announced a
dashboard that flips open to into a
screen everyone thinks you're gonna be
watching things in the cars will i drive
themselves and it's like there's just a
little gap there of the technology is
like it's like you can't they don't
drive themselves yet yeah and your bill
but there's just the gap is like
regulatory because the cars are really
close to being able to drive what I have
to say there's a lot of things where if
I was a government regulator yeah I
would do things differently but this is
not one of them I was a government
regulator I would not say it's okay to
have the cars driving selves unless I
was like six hundred percent sure that
the cars really could do this safely and
we're not there yet you know I do
believe that by the end of the decade
we'll probably have some thoroughly
mapped out you know geofence limited
areas of certain cities where you'll be
able to use these kind of cars at least
not fully self driving you'll still have
that feature where you can grab the
wheel if you had to which California
where most of this is going on actually
that their proposed regs which Google is
very upset about actually call for that
but to get a completely self driving car
where you'd be comfortable sitting
watching a movie in the front seat
there's so much of that here I mean but
we have been talking about as a staff it
that it's like the companies like you
know what this regulatory stuff is too
hard what if we just build a bunch of
screens in the car so BW yesterday
showed a new electric microbus called
the buddy yeah yeah and if you just look
at the interior that car they basically
taken out all the windows replacement
screens so that you could finish like
watch movies presumably projects other
fantastic we're drug dealing
it is fantastic well Walter yeah
kidnapping if you were a government
regulator there's a lot of things you
would do differently right and letting
why don't they just call it the
kidnapper no one commits swimmers you
know but it's just funny to see how much
of that you know this shows about tv's
what the car companies are doing is like
what if we make the kol horo TV yeah and
i think thats related if we get two cars
that are bulletproof and in their
ability to drive themselves and that
talk to the roads I mean I look I'm not
a deep expert on this but my
understanding is to get to where we want
to go the roads have to be smarter but
but Congress won't even pass the money
to fix the bridges that are falling down
nevermind big build roads of the future
but if we get it let's say we have a few
roads and I don't know you know and
Sanford in the bay area a few roads and
somewhere in Florida a few roads
somewhere around DC because they want to
impress the regulators whatever it is
that would be fascinating it's not
happening at this CES though so they're
a little ahead of themselves right all
right what I think is interesting is
there's a bunch of smart city stuff
happening here and you see companies
like the ATT did something panasonic is
like we're going to build you a smart
city unclear Panasonic's with by the way
one of the craziest views they built a
stadium and a house to demonstrate their
smart home stuff is literally built a
house than the OCS but anyway so ATT
tude smart city panasonic company and
you can see it's like the net it's the
thing that has to sit next to the car I
you have to improve no I agree i think
self-driving cars if and when they come
and they will come but most people say
what 20 20 yeah and i think one company
is VW no not 2020 they say later than
that right
I don't know 20 20 has been a target
date for the past few but there's a
number of stages which I would really
bore people to go into all of them but
there's there's I think they're going to
want to get to stage 2 it anyway or is
that what it is well I think the first
stage is they're going to the
intelligence of the car will mostly let
you draw like there will be a traffic
mode right where you're in heavy traffic
so we already have that way but it's
coming so that's like the first one yeah
and then it they just they're going to
do more and more and more stuff for you
until they take the steering wheel yeah
that's that's basically the map right
but but the it getting from the from the
last possible stage of automation which
still requires you or allows you to grab
the steering wheel and a pedal to the
one where they don't they're not even in
the car yeah that's gonna be the big gap
to get through for regulators I can't
wait for that by the way and by the way
not only to thank you up federal
regulators you can imagine even if they
somehow got it through the federal
regulators as 50 states as I gotten out
of so many cities perfectly yeah I mean
I don't know what the law is on this but
i can't imagine that some states won't
take it upon themselves to say well you
can do that in Illinois but you can't do
it in Indiana yes sir although you know
my personal theory is the states with
big mass transit systems will be more
resistant than where i'm from the
midwest where drunk driving is a massive
problem I think the states with that
problem we're going to they're going to
want it a lot faster yeah that's
fascinating but it still implies the
differentiation oh yeah of course it's
just funny because you know uber and
Google have their kind of fighting now
but you know Google was an investor in
goober to eventually to ride sharing and
eventually do self-driving cars and at
this show GM invested half a billion
dollars and lift to do self-driving
rideshare cars and you can just see that
that is a particular vision of the
future where no one owns a car you push
a button and the robot shows up and
drives you I agree with you and I think
that one is very exciting for this show
to suddenly be a place where we
incrementally get closer to that vision
has very interesting to me it is very
saddening a TV show it does fit the
pattern though of not being the first
play the first place Google talked about
totally self-driving no touch the
steering wheel cars and showed a video
of it was our the conference I've run
the code which does not compete with
this it's not a trade show it only has
six hundred people not know 165,000
people but it's typical of you know they
that size a band separate from this is
where these companies tend to or their
own events yeah way these companies tend
to make make these things person no love
it so we are sadly out of time we are
yeah what's been its been that it's been
about time this is the first time we've
done it together though it is is it the
first time we've done this face-to-face
so what you haven't seen me do is just
read my computer yeah I haven't just
been checking the website what we talk
no but this is great it's great to have
you here it's great to have wallets yes
we're gonna make a bunch more stuff with
wall I think you have a whole date with
a video team tomorrow we're gonna do a
wall explore see I don't have a whole
day with the video dear for a full deck
but there's something it'll be very
exciting what do you guys we are
together yeah we're physically present
in same room I god I'm afraid of this
yeah I have a have a friend of mine one
of my finally paying you good blood
money that you've extracted from me
finally paying his bitch thank you thank
you for the applause yeah how much when
do I get the get off my stage mossberg
all right
alright well that was it that was
strongly thank you guys all so much for
being here in the audience thank you for
listening at home we have a ton of stuff
from CES coming literally right after
this I'll be taping the verge cast
joanna stern and sam sheffer on the
verge cast today david pierce is on
tomorrow we have such three more for
more of our chats coming tons and tons
of videos please hit our youtube page
we're going crazy on youtube uploading
videos all over the place there Sam
sheffer just wandered into or he's
logging I don't know what's happening
Sam god you have abandoned me Sam I
don't know what so anyway this is the
