and we're looking at Nokia's Lumia 2520
which is basically the first Nokia
tablet as you can see it's really thin
it feels kind of kind of nice in the
hand it's a template 1 inch display here
and you've got 1920 by 1080 s just 1080
1080 p display on it as for apps you've
got Windows RT 8.1 running on here so
you'll get all the sort of built-in apps
that you would expect from this and that
Nokia's also got a camera I don't know
why they want people to take pictures on
a camper on a tablet but you know
they've got this here and it's very
similar to the Windows Phone version and
you can snap and all those pictures were
saved to SkyDrive look at the ports
you've got a an attachment down the
bottom here that looks like it's to go
into the dock around the side you've got
a headphone jack here and the power and
then at the top we've got the there's
actually this is the power button up top
here and the volume rocker here and then
we got is that micro USB just like micro
USB on the side here and I think that's
it for ports Nokia also has a keyboard
cover here which has power and a couple
of USB ports on the back right here I
should show you those basically it's
magnetic
and it was slide into place just like
that so then it wraps around it's almost
like a book you've got to keep the USBs
at the back here and in the battery the
battery part is actually right at the
back here there's a little bit of a hump
but other than that yes it's really like
a book and if you compare it to the
surface 2 and you've got the surface to
you here obviously it's a little bit
thicker because it's got a book wrapped
around it if we take a look at one that
has a little bit we wrapped around it
now you can see it's very similar even
though the surface too is a ten point
six inch display this ten point in a
10.1 inch display and it's very similar
in terms of size but because of the
roundness of this device it does feel a
lot better in the hands than the surface
state in terms of thickness there you
can clearly see that you know the
surface too is a little bit thicker and
that was quick look at Nokia's Lumia
2520</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
