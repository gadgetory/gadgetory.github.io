cycrin and come at me bad luck this is
90 seconds on the verge oculus rift the
Kickstarter for now I'm building a
virtual reality headset just raise 75
million dollars in additional funding
that money will go towards mass
producing a consumer version of the head
gear which will have a higher resolution
lower latency and effectively eliminate
the motion blur seen in the developers
kit it's a momentous time for oculus
just last month gaming legend John
Carmack left its software the company
founded to work with oculus full-time
there's one interaction Twitter can't
mute backlash hours after the company
made changes to its blocking
functionality twitter has reverted back
to its old ways the changes turned the
ability to block trolls into a glorified
mute switch given the block user far
more access many users became angry over
the change calling it a step backwards
and privacy twitter says the move was to
curb retaliation from users who
discovered they were blocked and finally
we've had the brat pack on a fantastic 4
but now the Sinister Six will be coming
to the big screen Sony Pictures has
announced three new films in the
spider-man franchise the amazing
spider-man 3 a venom movie and a film
featuring supervillain group the
Sinister Six it's a move that clearly
mirrors Marvel Cinematic Universe Sony
even hired longtime ja sweet and
collaborator Drew Goddard who will write
and possibly direct the sinister six and
that's it for today's top stories coming
up tomorrow I released my own secret
album it's called nathan sykes fun time
damn furry see fianc√©e found that
