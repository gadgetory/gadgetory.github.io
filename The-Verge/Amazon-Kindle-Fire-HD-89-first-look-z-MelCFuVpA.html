amazon announced a bunch of things today
but one of the things they made the
biggest deal about is the new 8.9 inch
Kindle Fire HD it's an 8.9 inch tablet
and unfortunately they're only like
three of them around right now they're
still in limited production they won't
be out till November but we got to take
a look at them with one of the VPS of
the Kindle so the biggest new feature of
the kindle fire HD and the one that
really separates the 8.9 inch from the
7-inch is the 1920 x 1200 display
display looks fantastic it's really has
really deep blacks and really nice
colors really good viewing angles it's
just a really great display it's a 16 x
10 aspect ratio so it's a little wider
when you hold it in portrait which is a
nice touch for us there's also a bunch
of new hardware inside there's a TI omap
4470 processor which means the fire HD
8.9 inch just runs faster and more
smoothly than ever before there's also a
lot of new software in the device
whispersync and x-ray were two of the
things they talked a lot about there's
x-ray for movies now which is pretty
cool you can just pause the movie and
it'll show you the characters in that
movie and then you can scroll through
and see other things they've been in or
add other movies to your watch list or
just find out information about them
there's also a new immersive reading
feature which is one of the coolest
things we've seen it lets you sync an
audio book to text and you can read or
listen and just really easily switch
back and forth there's also a new
favorites menu on the screen it's this
is a pretty minor change but it helps
you can press a star in the bottom right
corner and it brings up a bunch of apps
or books or websites that you might want
to read there's also new audio with
Dolby Digital Plus which should be
really good the 8.9 inch Kindle Fire is
going to be out at the end of november
it's going to start at two hundred
ninety nine dollars for 16 gigs of
storage or you can get 32 gigs for 369
dollars there's also an option to get
amazon's LTE package which is provided
by AT&amp;amp;T for 499 or five hundred ninety
nine dollars respective
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
