sound bar and it's also a brand new
smart speaker it's going to cost $399
and it's going to be available on July
17th so we came to sew noses
headquarters in Santa Barbara to find
out what this thing is all about because
it does a lot of stuff with just one
input so the Sonos beam sound bar exists
it's relatively small it's smaller than
the play bar or the play base it's also
an intelligent speaker which means that
this isn't just up against other random
sound bars it's also up against other
smart speakers like an echo like the
home pod and like the Google home Mac's
there are four full range woofers bang
bang bang and bang and there's a center
tweeter and then there's three passive
radiators for more sound to come out of
there and out of all of those speakers
they create a array of three channels
the center left and right but what's
really interesting to me is that the
inputs on this are not what you'd expect
there's power of course there's a sync
button for you know getting everything
working together there's an Ethernet
port because Sonos always puts an
Ethernet port on stuff and then the only
singular input on this is HDMI the way
the sauce wants us to work is you plug
HDMI in here you plug HDMI into your TV
and then the standard called HDMI Arc
tells the TV hey you've got a sound bar
Naro and all sound gets routed to it so
if you don't want to give up an HDMI
port you can also use optical audio out
this thing is going to ship with an
adapter that allows you to use your
optical out on your TV to the HDMI input
on this thing obviously we listen to the
Sonos beam in this controlled
environment in so Knossos office where
we are right now and so I don't want to
give you a full review of how I think it
sounds but I do have a few thoughts
after listening to it today the first is
that Sonos isn't like crazy opinionated
about how your music should sound it's
trying to be accurate and it's trying to
be very clear so there's bass about as
much as you would expect from something
this size maybe even a little bit more
but not so much that it's muddy and it
blows things out they have incredibly
good stereo separation so unlike the
home pod they're not trying to do
magical things with auto-tuning and blah
blah blah through all the channels
they're just trying to get to the sound
right left right center
we can sculpt the sound and maximize the
performance of the amplifier of the
transducers and basically sculpt the
entire sound profile with software and
in the case of this project we really
wanted to have that lean back experience
in the living room and be able to
control your TV your music and with
voice all the standard Amazon Alexa
stuff works the same way as it does on
other Alexa products or on other Sonos
products but because this is a sound bar
and it's connected to my TV I can do
lots of interesting things with that too
specifically if you have an Amazon fire
TV you can do stuff like Alexa play
stranger things and what it does is it
turns my television on and it's just
ready to start stranger things now it
didn't actually start playing it because
the fire TV LexA integration is not
super great yet but if I want to change
the volume I can go Alexa volume up and
it's a little bit louder now Alexa pause
fire TV and it pause the fire TV again
it takes another second or two than you
want it to but it still works really
well it also works with your TV remote
control so if I turn the volume up or
down here it will turn the volume up or
down on the Sonos not on the television
and the reason that works is that the
thing I talked about earlier it's HDMI
and it's specifically HDMI arc and the
TV recognizes that there's a sound bar
attached and that it should be able to
adjust that sound bars volume instead of
the TV's volume the other last super
interesting thing you get by connecting
over HDMI instead of just a standard
optical audio cable is that the sound
bar is able to turn the TV off which is
it's like the holy grail of smart
assistants nothing seems to work to turn
TV offs with hdmi cec but this thing
doesn't Alexa turn off the TV and the
heavens open it's amazing for Sonos it's
really important that they be this
Switzerland of sound I guess I don't
know if that's my phrase not theirs but
they want to work with everybody at the
same time and they don't
anybody any preferences that said this
thing works with Alexa now and it
probably is gonna work best with Alexa
at least for the time being because
they've had time to customize Alexa
software why is it so important to Sonos
to work with Alexa and then maybe later
the Google assistant or definitely later
and the you know maybe some other stuff
will come along why do you want to be so
agnostic across all of these different
voices systems that are just partnering
with Amazon and calling it a day so home
sound system for us means shares we
believe many different people would want
to use it and you don't want to dominate
what the right control paradigm for
people is nor the right assistants we
already been here before with folks so
you know the yeah sharing your home
sound system maybe one person has an
Android phone the other one has an iOS
phone we never said okay you know we're
only going to support iOS and the whole
household please go iOS or we only gonna
support absent Android the whole house
I've got Android we just don't believe
that it's very consumer friendly here's
the weird thing about so Knossos
position in the past it got to create
this beautiful garden of perfect music
experiences they had a remote they have
their own router that had all their own
stuff but now they can't do that anymore
they have to exist in these other super
complicated ecosystems they're connected
up to your TV which has an insane tangle
of wires behind it and if something
fails there they're gonna be part of
that and you might blame Sonos even if
it's not their fault and that especially
applies to digital assistants if Alexa
or eventually Google assistant doesn't
work it's gonna be your so no speaker
that you feel like doesn't work and that
could be a problem for them sometimes
you don't want to talk sometimes you
want to talk she don't want to go
through the on screen display and get T
yeah right so there's these things where
you go like okay where does it make
sense to use voice where do we actually
want to tone it down a little bit a lot
of the early integrations have been
focused on making the utterances a
simple and intuitive as possible
so rather saying Alexa tell so knows
to play the Beatles from Spotify in the
living room we wanted it to be Alexa
diabeetus sono sees a really huge
opportunity in the living room they've
got the play bar but it's super
expensive and so this thing it only four
hundred bucks is way more accessible and
if you're so knows you want lots of
people buying their very first sono
speaker because they know in fact they
told me today that as many as thirty
eight percent of their customers once
they have one so no speaker buy another
one but that is a lot of upsell and
having an accessible home speaker in the
living room is a good way to get those
people into the ecosystem if Sonos can
convince enough people to upgrade to
this thing they could radically expand
their customer base and that makes this
a lot more ambitious than it appears at
first glance and if you're Sonos
expanding your customer base that sounds
pretty good thank you for watching this
Sonos video if you liked it subscribe
