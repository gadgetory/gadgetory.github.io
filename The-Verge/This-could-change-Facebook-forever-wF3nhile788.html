that for the past three years,
Facebook had been deleting the messages
of Mark Zuckerberg and
some other executives
and in the controversy that followed,
the company promised that it would then
allow all of us to do
exactly the same thing.
Imagine my surprise this week,
when Mark Zuckerberg
announced that he was going
to lean hard into privacy.
It's a lot of talk.
It was 3,200 words in a blog
post that Zuckerberg wrote.
To understand what it all means,
we're going to have to
look at the big picture.
So what did Mark Zuckerberg
actually say in his blog post?
He said he wanted to bring
end to end encryption
to all of Facebook's messaging products.
That means Facebook Messenger,
WhatsApp and Instagram Direct.
One of the things that
he says in his blog post
is that encryption
limits services like ours
from seeing the content
flowing through them
and makes it much harder for anyone else
to access your information.
And once your messages
are end to end encrypted,
that means that no one from
Facebook or the government
will ever be able to
understand the contents
of your messages.
The second major thing
that was in the blog post
was the idea that your messages
should no longer be permanent.
Zuckerberg speculated that in the future,
your messages on Facebook
would disappear by default,
after a certain period of time.
You could choose to keep
them if you wanted to
but just like on Snapchat,
how messages disappear when you read them,
if you wanted your
Facebook to feel like that,
all of a sudden, it could.
So with those two ideas out there,
Facebook says it is going
to rally around privacy
in a way that it never has before.
If you've read a story about
Facebook in the past year,
chances are it was
about a privacy scandal,
whether it was Cambridge
Analytica last spring
or the biggest data breach
in company history last fall.
So when Zuckerberg says
that privacy is now
the most important thing to Facebook,
a lot of people are skeptical.
But let's say that you believe Zuckerberg,
what would that mean for
Facebook and the rest of us?
Well, one of the things that he says is
in the future, we're going to want
the world to feel less like a town square
and more like a living room,
so less yelling in pubic,
more talking to your friends.
If that's true, it has a lot of
big implications for Facebook.
Number one, the news feed
is no longer the most
important part of the site.
Think about what a big deal that is.
The news feed is synonymous with Facebook.
It's by far the biggest money
making product at the company.
If we're no longer looking
at the news feed every day,
Facebook is a much different business
than it ever has been before.
Today, Facebook makes
it's money by effectively
renting it's users
attention to advertisers.
In an encrypted messaging app,
an advertiser can't see who you are
or what you might be interested in,
nearly as well as they used to be.
Instead, Facebook wants to give businesses
an opportunity to let
us buy and sell things
from within a Messenger or a WhatsApp.
There's still a lot of details
that need to be worked out.
So, in a world where apps are encrypted,
not only can advertisers
not see into your messages,
governments can't as well.
If governments can't access
the content of user's messages,
they're going to have
a lot to say about it.
We've already seen countries
like Vietnam and Russia
pass laws requiring
companies like Facebook
to store any data that
Facebook is collecting
about their citizens locally,
presumably so that they can
more easily access that data.
Facebook is now saying hey,
our apps are gonna be encrypted,
there's just not gonna be
a lot for you to look into.
And Zuckerberg speculates
that Facebook is actually
going to be banned in these countries.
And then there's China.
One of Mark Zuckerberg's
biggest dreams over the years
is that Facebook would
become one of the few
American companies to really
be able to thrive in China.
But now that the company is going to
enable encrypted messaging,
that seems impossible.
So encryption has benefits.
Advertisers can't target you,
governments can't read what you're saying,
there are some real
drawbacks to conversation
moving from the town
square to the living room.
It's going to be harder
to know what people
are saying about the politics
inside their own country.
We've already seen this
in Brazil and India,
two countries where
WhatsApp is very popular.
Misinformation has spread rapidly there,
inside these closed groups and researchers
have had a hard time
keeping track of exactly
what's being said.
So one result of this encryption might be
less visibility into
the public discussion.
It's trade-offs, all the way down.
This all may come to nothing,
but if it really happens,
all of a sudden, Facebook
is a very different company.
When I say Facebook, you
probably think news feed.
In the future when I say Facebook,
you might think a group text,
you might think a small
group that you're in
and you might never visit
the news feed at all.
So how do we feel about the newer,
more privacy friendly Facebook?
Well, privacy has a lot of benefits.
There are many of us out
there who just wanna talk
with our friends and our
family and our co-workers,
without worrying that
whatever we're saying
is going to come back to haunt us.
The fact that Facebook is
enabling a new way of doing that,
is pretty exciting.
At the same time, Mark
Zuckerberg has a history
of making grand pronouncements
that never come true.
Four years ago, he told us the news feed
was gonna transform into video.
Two years ago, he published a manifesto
saying Facebook was going to
build social infrastructure,
whatever that means, and whether this new,
private Facebook comes
into being against some
very long odds, is still anyone's guess.
So what do you think, you all?
Are you gonna be more
likely to use Facebook
once it's end to end encrypted anywhere?
Let us know in the comments,
and if you want to know
way more about Facebook,
did you know I write a daily newsletter
about social networks and democracy?
