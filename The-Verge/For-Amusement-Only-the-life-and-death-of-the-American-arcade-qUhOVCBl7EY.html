and corners at school and in summers I
was working in the arcades and so I
really understood the economics of the
coin-operated game business and pong
wasn't very good as someone player Keith
and so we were unable Douai system that
simple and so I said I know this thing
will make money let's give it a go and
we'll do it ourselves the unit was
making so much more money than any other
coin op machine that I knew that it was
gonna have it be a huge hit I just know
if you're looking for teenagers in Mount
Prospect Illinois you're likely to find
them at mothers pinball arcade are part
of a growing grew
video a bit ridiculous to mate Americans
spent up to eight billion dollars on
video game
200
1981 Americans popped in between five
and nine billion dollars worth of
quarters and tokens into the slots of
arcade video games that's more money
than the total combined budgets the
cities of Chicago Boston Washington
Dallas and Cincinnati last year these
around the country are passing laws
banning the video game from their time
some areas have even passed laws
restricting the use of the games but
will this popularity last is the
question
well the makers of video games are
gambling that it will my name my name is
Lonnie Sobel and I'm the the manager
here at Chinatown fair I've been in a
half a dozen different businesses mostly
related to the to the game industry you
know almost all arcades 95% of them have
gone out of business over the years this
arcade closed up two years ago and and
we reopened it because you know we've
made a lot of changes it's very hard
just to do what I'm doing which is just
have a dedicated arcade with nothing
really to go with it no food no drinks
it's really just pure pinball and arcade
machines so I'm kind of in a dilemma
because I have a regular full-time job
this is done as kind of a side job for
me and it doesn't make any money really
to be able to support my myself and my
family as a occupation there were only
so many video games out there that
people you know want to play in the
arcade and show off their skills and the
industry has basically kind of changed
in the sense that it's moved towards
more games where they can win prizes so
inside that very closed it was very much
a fighting game arcade and then when
trying to our agree opened as a new
arcade it very much adopted the more the
Family Fun Center type of Arc
and it's not relying on party name for
dance games it's relying on Redemption
games
Dave and Buster's type of games and that
seems to be the only type of arcade that
is making money right now
kids have been conditioned over the last
10 15 maybe even 20 years to expect that
out of an arcade when they come in here
and they don't see these machines
spitting out tickets a lot of kids don't
understand that because that's all
they've ever seen the Machine do that I
pickles I am Benjamin over I am the I
guess Purchasing Manager here at coin-op
warehouse I primarily go out and find
the stuff buy the stuff do a lot of the
deliveries pickups and some of the
repairs on a lot of the machines we sell
antique arcade equipment tube boxes and
take signs anything I find cool the
business itself is not very strong so
it's actually a great time for me to buy
because a lot of people are in the
business are tired I have an equipment
sitting in the warehouse was so it's
actually the best it's ever been for me
for buying and yet there's still plenty
of demand for people who want this stuff
in their homes majority of the stuff we
actually sell the collectors and other
dealers that they've been looking for
Mortal Kombat for years and they've used
to play it as a kid or you know they
played Miss pac-man in the local bar so
they want one if a guy walks in that's
my age he wants pac-man or Galaga
somebody walks in that's 25 or 30 they
want NBA Jam or Simpsons or Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles which to me are not
that interesting but it's interesting
that people buy what they remember
there's actually been a pretty big
revival lately of putting the older
classic games back in bars and
restaurants and Barcade has been a real
good customer for us that there
doing their basing their bar around the
classic games our kind of core audience
is like early 30s mid 30s people who at
least remember the games and maybe they
were too young to play them but maybe
they played them at home the games are
all priced at their original price which
is 25 cents and our drinks are six seven
eight nine twelve dollars so the money
we're making is definitely coming from
the bar the economic model for it is
tough because you can't charge too much
because your audience that you're it's
going to be playing for the most part or
adults that remember paying a certain
amount of money a couple of things have
happened the arcade business got very
expensive you know you go into an arcade
now it's not a quarter it's 50 Cent's
it's a buck for three minutes that's
really really expensive play and that's
the problem
my goal for opening this business was
just to make it sustain itself basically
people play a lot more at home than they
than they do in the in New York in the
arcades my kids will you know have
already on the iPad spent thirty forty
dollars buying almost every game that
has come out I mean they can play
pac-man and Donkey Kong on their
PlayStation air or Xbox but it's nice to
play it in in a an authentic cabinet and
get the experience like they remember
having when they were playing it back in
the early 80s
arkaid I love to go into timeout in
Springfield Mall every Sunday and I'd
spend 20 bucks putting that into
asteroids and the early black and white
games what were what they were when I
was a kid but I don't see it coming back
for with the current type of machines
that they have I think it's pretty much
over well I think I think the arcade is
never gonna be what it was I don't think
the arcade will ever be completely dead
it's just going to keep changing I've
been to things where there's a whole
amphitheatre full of people watching
other people play video games you know
some of the Starcraft conventions and
things like that these are people where
all of a sudden it's like a professional
sporting event I think that there will
be much more of that in the future you
know kids need a place to go and hang
out something where they can do
something you know constructive or
entertaining and I think that the
culture has lost something by
by using these what I'd called loosely
formed clubhouses I think that there's a
very big opportunity in creating a new
kind of arcade new kind of experience
it's maybe not your definition of an
arcade but it will give the arcade kind
of experience to players in the future
