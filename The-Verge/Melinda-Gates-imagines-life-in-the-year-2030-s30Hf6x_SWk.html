developing world they will be eating
more nutritious meals having a more
balanced meal not just having corn off
their farm but having fruits and
vegetables and all the things they need
whether it's a child or an adult they'll
be getting the caloric intake they need
they'll be participating in markets not
just selling it their farm but going
into market to sell their goods they'll
know the price back in the rural area on
their phone of what the crop price is at
markets so they know whether it's worth
going into the market they'll have more
income I think as well they'll be able
to have more of their children in school
not just their sons but their daughters
as well not just in primary school but
in secondary school and I think you'll
see if fewer women carrying water in the
developing world in 15 years and I think
you'll see more people with a toilet in
their home and that's incredibly
transformative because then there's less
disease in their home and in their
community gender inequality is deeply
important in the world and I think we
need to make sure that girls have the
chance to have a healthy life
participate in decision-making and
ultimately an economic opportunity and
one way to do that is to invest in
education because if you invest in
education not only does the girls if she
stays in school she gets married later
she has fewer children her child is
twice as likely to make it to their
fifth birthday and she'll send her
daughter to school that has a
transformative effect not just for that
girl but for her entire family for how
she raises the next generation we see it
time and again
so getting girls in and through quality
secondary education is totally important
in the world
