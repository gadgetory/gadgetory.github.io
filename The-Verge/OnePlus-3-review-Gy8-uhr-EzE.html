phones that promise me just as good as
high-priced five chips but so many of
them miss the mark but this no tab from
oneplus might be the one that actually
gives Samsung LG and HTC a run for their
money
this is the one plus three and we've
heard this from oneplus before this
plucky upstart has made a name for
itself with its aggressively priced
smartphones questionable marketing
tactics and a strange invite system to
buy those phones it's often felt like
that the marketing buzz around one-plus
overshadowed its actual products which
were good but often compromised to hit
those low prices but the one press three
feels like a phone from a company that's
learned a thing or two over the past
couple of years
it is a bonafide Android flagship it has
Qualcomm fastest processor gobs of RAM a
beautiful AMOLED display thin and light
aluminum design fingerprint scanner
high-resolution camera if you name it
the oneplus three probably hasn't and as
all of this for under $400 it's
available today and there's no invite
system or wait list to deal with the
oneplus three's design is good but
there's nothing particularly original
about it it kind of looks like a love
child of an HEC and a huawei the phone's
all aluminum chassis is it's thin and
polished and it's really comfortable to
hold I'm like last year's oneplus 2
which was kind of rough around the edges
and felt like a brick in your hand and
one plus three is remarkably refined the
fingerprint scanner is really fast and
accurate and I love the fact that has a
physical switch for silencing alerts and
ringtones the phone screen is a 5.5 inch
1080p AMOLED display and it's really
sharp and bright with great viewing
angles it's not a 2k screen like you get
on the galaxy s7 or HTC ten but unless
you use your phone for virtual reality
you'd be hard-pressed to notice the
difference oneplus added a night mode to
the phone software that makes it easier
to view the screen at nighttime you can
think of it like Apple's night shift
mode on the iPhone but unfortunately it
doesn't turn on and off automatically
but there are lots of other really
clever ideas throughout the software
many of them borrowed from other devices
you can double tap the home button or
the power button to launch a camera or
you can wave your hand over the display
to see notifications in the clock you
can double tap the screen to wake it up
or set it so that the screen just comes
on automatically when you pull the phone
out of your pocket now companies like
Motorola had these features for years
but there are really great additions and
make the overall experience on a 1 plus
to eat that much better now overall
the more plus 3s Android marshmallow
software it's really close
Google's Nexus software there isn't
really any bloatware extra apps aside
from some basic gallery music and file
management apps every high-end Android
phone this year has had Paul calm
snapdragon 820 processor and of course
the one plus three is no exception but
the oneplus one pairs it with six
gigabytes of RAM that's more than you'll
get from LG Samsung or HTC and it just
flies to anything I throw at it whether
it's games or messaging or multitasking
it's also really efficient as a 3000
milliamp hour battery that's strong
enough to get through a full day of
heavy use and it comes with a quick
charger in the box that lets you get up
to 60% battery in just 30 minutes of
charging and yes this time it has NFC so
you can use Android pay or whatever else
you need to use NFC for one unique
feature is the 1 plus 3s dual SIM card
slots and you can choose which SIM you
want to use for calls data messaging and
so forth that's a great feature if you
travel but be aware that it only works
on t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T and their related
companies here in the US so you can't
use it with Verizon or Sprint now at
this price you might expect to get a
mediocre camera but the oneplus 3 16
megapixel camera has an F 2.0 optically
stabilized lens and it takes actually
really good photos it's fast to launch
fast to capture and it comes with a
manual mode for even more control now
it's not as good as a galaxy s7 in
low-light but it's still very
respectable it's kind of like the best
camera from last year's Android
flagships which is still pretty high
praise there's really only a few things
that are missing from the oneplus 3 it
doesn't have any water resistance you
can't upgrade the 64 gigabytes of
storage and it's screen really isn't
great for VR but other than that it's a
really great phone and it easily goes
toe-to-toe with the best Android phones
you can buy right now for a price that's
way less this time around you can ignore
the hype and just buy the phone because
the oneplus 3 actually delivers thanks
for watching for more on the oneplus 3
in all the other Android phones I buy
