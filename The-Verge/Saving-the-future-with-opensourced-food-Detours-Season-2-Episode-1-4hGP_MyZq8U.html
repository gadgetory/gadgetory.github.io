sustainable for much longer the farming
which supports our bad habits is
inherently flawed an estimated one
hundred sixty five billion dollars are
lost to wasted food every year and the
scarcity of water threatens to wipe out
production in parts of the country also
threatening the balance of global food
systems but could technology be the
answer an MIT scientist is giving
farming a facelift by building a
platform for the next generation of food
an operating system for the farm in the
future
about four years ago during Japan's
tsunami a group from the Media Lab went
to Minami Sanriku we were looking at all
different kinds of things I was looking
at food the headlines that day said
Japan farming has no youth no water no
future and so from that point I started
thinking about contaminated areas and
how could we put it back into production
you know the strategy right now is these
countries that are having food security
issues go to another country and they
buy their land and they make a farm
the problem with colonizing another
place for food is often that place also
doesn't have much food you know it's not
a far stretch that when supply lines get
stressed more when our natural resources
get stressed more you will see you know
a potential war over food you'd have to
protect it and militarize it and all
these things which i think is an awful
way for the world to go but if those
countries start investing in their
cities which is where everybody's going
to live anyway you know that's the
biggest change that I see happening for
the relationship between you know this
kind of Agriculture and conventional
agriculture I'm Caleb Harper I'm a
research scientist I'm also the founder
of the city farm project which is just
looking at you know how do we feed our
cities of the future how do we move
production closer to the point of
consumption city farm is a plant
research facility based in MIT Media Lab
using state-of-the-art equipment they
explore and build innovative and
high-performance indoor agriculture
systems the research and development of
hydroponic or aquatic production the lab
uses an array of network sensors and
computerized automation to deliver the
most efficient means of growing plants
without the need for soil
when I look in at my lab what do I see I
see a 1960s mainframe
I see vacuum tubes and plugs all over
the place in one crazy maniacal man that
goes back and forth filling holes in the
dam I mean that's what I feel like and
that's what I see and that is to me the
most accurate representation of the
technology we're at the beginning we are
not the first by far but right now we're
at the special moment where everybody
cares because people are now asking for
a level of transparency but they haven't
asked for before so that's why I'm
making my work completely transparent to
say look come check it out I'm gonna try
to get one in your city I'm gonna try to
get one around your kids for them to
play with it and see what everybody
thinks and so they can kind of educate
through doing and then decide what they
think of the food because we have to
educate people we have to bring people
into this new method of growing we have
to create innovators it's no longer the
case that you know grow it there and eat
it here let's grow it here eat it here
as you enter the space you'll encounter
what we think of as like a
decontamination area that's where we
keep our server and our tools then you
go into the next big volume and what
you'll have is all the different kinds
of equipment that we have in there so
there's aeroponic systems and then
there's shallow water culture shallow
water culture is just like two inches of
water the plant stood and then there's
deep water culture for bigger plants
aeroponics is just where there's no
longer standing water
we're just misting it we're misting at
about 50 microns a size so a little
heavier than fog so it's just water and
how we're using water and are we using
it the most effectively for the plants
this is called a shallow water culture
so three inches of water these nice
bright white roots that come out so what
we're doing with this is continually
recirculating this water around in the
system what you're seeing growing here
is a variety of things so in the lab we
do a poly cropped environment which just
means we try to grow a lot of different
kinds of things rather than a mono
we have 12 points of sensing so things
like pH in the water makes a big
difference
electrical conductivity so the amount of
salts in the water co2 content
temperature humidity we control the
photosynthetically active radiation
levels so that's just is a big fancy
word for the part of light that grows
plants which is about 10% of light it
falls between like red and blue so we
monitor and adjust that for both
spectral balance and intensity so I mean
there's a lot of control and
understanding going on in there and so
when we have a problem you know for a
specific plant we can kind of go back to
the data we've collected and change the
environment what I'm working on and what
a lot of people are working on needs to
be thought of in concert with
agriculture rather than us versus them
this is not a replacement what's really
going to happen is it's going to be
implemented in strategic ways you know
because on one side of the spectrum you
have people that just love this they're
like you know it tastes better it's
fresher it's better for you you have the
other side that's like this is freaky
food this is super freaky food and what
did you do with it because I as a
consumer feel like I've been lied to for
a long time about my food and I don't
believe you I think that's a
conversation that from my perspective
just needs to be open and say look you
want to know what's going on with the
water here it is open data right for you
check it out
you want to be invested in your food
again I will hopefully be building
sockets for you to plug into to where
you can be reinvested in your food again
and understand what's going on there's a
new farmer being born and the new farmer
lives in the city and is young you know
this is a new generation of people that
can get interested in food in a
different way and there's existing
farmers whose systems we can make better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
