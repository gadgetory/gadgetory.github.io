with more alcohol this is the cynic it
is a home beer dispenser it basically
lets you put a beer tap on your
countertop that will refrigerate two
growlers with a beer and keep it good
for up to 30 days so where you at try it
out wait a second
first you've got to get the beer now
first we need the bag to put the beer in
so cynic has these single-use recyclable
bags you have to bring to a bar to get
filled up we were able to find a place
pretty close by our office that
supported cynic bags but your mileage is
definitely to vary based on where you
live
they partnered with supposedly over
thousand places so far but not all of
them are actually set up just yet once
you get there they should be able to
fill up your bag and send you on your
way okay now we have our beer and we
just have to hook it up somehow and I
think this goes into okay that's working
there's beer flowing out of it this
diagram does not totally match up oh god
it smells like beer now okay
oh god this okay beer is leaking maybe I
should have done that this one first
it doesn't say that there's an order I
don't think beer explosion can be that
bad so
a different angle maybe like upside down
up in to the right do i these cords in
wrong this diagram is inaccurate your
different ideas of what's right right
absolutely absolutely so we definitely
we definitely put the beer and right now
we're very lucky oh my god we have beer
okay we did it
I'm pouring beer right now that's warm
but actually very good here are the
benefits
number one is gonna keep the beer
refrigerated at the exact temperature
that you want to number two your the tap
which obviously is kind of cool and
number three it's supposed to keep the
beer fresher for longer obviously if you
just get it straight out as half and put
it into a bottle it's not going to stay
fresh for quite as long we haven't had a
chance to test whether their co2 system
actually keeps three refresh for longer
but sounds reasonable
so there are some downsides including
one we found out about right after
shooting this we're setting cynic up
again for happy hour and this happened
that's the co2 tank exploding out of the
fridge because we didn't set it up just
right now remember that if you're going
to be drinking and setting up the co2
tank you might have a similar experience
that's definitely something to keep in
mind also the cynic costs $329 which is
to get your twenty nine dollars that you
could be spending on beer you're also
gonna have to keep buying cynic bags and
bringing those bags to these specific
places that can fill them up if you're
okay with that level of hassle then
maybe the cynic is for you it's shipping
now but you're probably gonna want to be
a pretty serious beer drinker maybe guys
here
I'm just gonna I was gonna start over
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
