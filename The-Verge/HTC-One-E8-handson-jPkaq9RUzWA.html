phones have all been made out of
aluminum whether it's the iphone 5s the
lumia 930 or HTC One the best designs
always come hand-in-hand with the best
materials but as bad as the reputation
of plastic phones is there are a few
that stand up against the very best on
the market they have the same care and
attention to detail and the experience
of using them has been just as good
HCC's new one the EI tries to be just
that it recreates almost everything
about the company's flagship 2014 phone
except it's cheaper and it's plastic de
8 has the specs and the same basic shape
of the One m8 but the soul of what makes
that phone appealing ends up lost in the
translation d8 is the exact same size
but its curves aren't as soft or refined
its edges aren't chamfered and don't
glint in the light and it's lighter
weight makes it feel somehow less
substantial it feels closer to the
utilitarian Nexus 5 than it does to
HTC's real flagship aluminum phone d8
also loses that elusive sense of
authenticity that's so hard for these
cookie cutter smartphones to have the
middle ma it reacts to the environment
around it and it feels a lot more
natural than the plastic counterpart
which feels alien and organic really
good plastic phones either solve for
their design problems or use them
productively but in making a direct
plastic copy of the metal ma HCC is
neglected to do that the only thing
that's adding is the selection of bold
new colors while taking away the subtle
or of exclusivity that the one m8
maintains maybe that's good enough in
fact for HTC it might be perfect it can
sell a cheaper version of its premium
phone without sacrificing any sales of
the m8 but for a company's taking its
future on design the e8 is a
disappointing missed opportunity it
could have proven that premium design is
more than premium materials but instead
it's a phone that Samsung might be proud
of the first step in the right direction
is to design plastic like it's plastic
and not stitched leather or brushed
metal or super shiny chrome HCC avoids
those pitfalls but in the process it
avoids being innovative in almost any
significant way for now at least the
finest design continues to be the
exclusive province of aluminium phones</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
