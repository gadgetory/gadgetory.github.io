we're looking at nokia's refocus app for
its their Lumia PureView phones
basically this is a separate application
that you use on your Windows Phone and
essentially your launch it up tap
anywhere and it looks like it's doing
crazy blurring and focusing what it's
actually doing is taking between two and
eight images which then once you've won
such processed you can in tap and it
will refocus hopefully you'll be just
see this clearly on the on the video
basically you should see that this red
car here is app now out of focus my tap
it it will go into focus now similar
apps are available on iOS this is kind
of similar to that effect what luck is
also done is they've added a little
color pop feature in there so you can
slip the car at the red car if you want
the colors to put there with a blue car
or even the background so you get the
leads in the background there and you
can save these and share them and so you
can share these to post facebook and
I'll move over to the Lumia 2520 to
demonstrate exactly how that works we're
just looking at demo image that is on
the Lumia 2520 now basically this is an
image that's been shared to Facebook and
essentially you can tap then if you can
see it's on the video hopefully you can
you can see where it's focused on the on
the pot here on the right hand side and
we can tap on the one at the rear and it
should be focusing on the front so even
if you share these on social networks
people will be able to to play we play
around the new friends bear to play out
and then zoom as we focus in and out so
that was a quick look at nokia refocus</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
