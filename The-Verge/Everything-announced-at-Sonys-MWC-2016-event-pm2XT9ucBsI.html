at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona
and we've just seen Sony's presentation
where they have announced three new
smartphones in Xperia range one new
smart earpiece and three concept
products which are all about the
connected home in connected life in my
hand I've got the Xperia x8 which is the
while Sony's calling it one of the
premium mid-range device it's got a
media tech 64-bit processor 2 gigabytes
of RAM 16 gigabytes of flash memory it's
got an 8 megapixel camera here on the
front and a 13 megapixel camera here on
the rear feels very very nice in the
hand continued Sony's Xperia styling
with sort of curved metal sides and
rounded glass front and this very nice
metal trim on the side it's only got the
normal power button here on the Xperia
XA which means no fingerprint sensor but
it does have these wonderfully thin
bezels here so I have here the Sony
Xperia X and the sony xperia x
performance the main difference here is
that this one is slightly more upscale
in terms of specs it's running the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 while this one
here has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 650
this one also has a brushed metal back
compared to this one which is slightly
more matte both of them have 23
megapixel cameras on the back with the
Sony's new hybrid autofocus this is
supposed to look at moving objects
within the frame predict where they're
going to go and get the focus ready in
time to snap them whilst they're moving
both of them have a power button here on
the side with the fingerprint sensor
built in much like the most recent
experience sony also announced a smart
bluetooth earpiece called the Xperia ear
you just put it into your ear connect it
to your smart phone and it can read you
the weather it can tell you about
incoming notifications on Facebook
Messenger whatsapp or lie
and you can also get turn-by-turn
direction from it you ask it to take you
to a certain place and it'll tell you
where to go using the GPS and your phone
to keep you on the map and finally Sony
announced a trio of concept devices the
first is a projector that supposed to
act as a hub in your home where you put
calendar and family messages the second
is a lifelogging camera that you wear on
your chest to take pictures and video of
daily events and the third is the Xperia
agent it sounds a lot like a personal
assistant like Siri or a lexer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
