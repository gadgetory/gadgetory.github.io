with an in display fingerprint sensor
which means that you can touch screen
unlock your phone just like that with no
need for a separate reader anywhere else
in the phone this week at Mobile World
Congress vivo is taking that idea to the
next level so this is a concept phone
called apex and the big thing with apex
is that the in display fingerprint
scanner is way bigger vehicles in a half
screen scanner it's not quite half the
screen but it's still pretty big about
this area here the size of the screen
it's it's all in display a fingerprint
scanner you can put your finger right
onto the screen and it unlocks the phone
so why do you want a fingerprint scanner
inside the screen
well one phones the bezels around the
screen are getting a lot smaller and
these are probably the smallest I've
seen on any phone around the and these
three sides it's 1.8 millimeters and
this is 4.3 so the whole reason to have
a fingerprint scanner inside the display
is to enable these kind of skinny skinny
thin bezels that we're seeing on modern
smartphone designs you can of course
just put a fingerprint reader on the
back but a lot of people prefer to have
it on the front so a bezels are designed
with an in display fingerprint scanner
lets you get there but without bezels
around the screen where do you put the
selfie camera
well vive has a pretty neat solution for
that actually so the regular cameras are
on the back as you'd expect but if you
want to take a selfie you switch the
camera and this cute little guy pops up
it makes it makes a bit of a noise and
it takes about a second to pop up like a
little bit less but it's it's kind of
cute it's a neat solution so another
thing that vivo has to find space for on
a phone without any bezels is the
earpiece speaker for phone calls there's
a regular speaker at the bottom of the
phone but if you want to make phone
calls you have to make use of vivos
screen technology where they actually
vibrate the screen itself to
it useable as an earpiece I'm listening
to a demo call now it sounds okay it's
not the world's most incredible sounding
earpiece but it it does the job so
there's no pricing or release date or
anything like that for the apex it's
completely a concept vivo is not
committing to releasing it on the market
in any form that being said as a concept
it does seem pretty plausible and
everything it seems to work you know the
EPI speaker the selfie camera above neat
solutions the fingerprint sensor itself
is pretty effective it's not quite as
fast as a traditional one but it does
work as to where things could go after
this people has said that it wants to
reduce this bezel even further vivo says
that if it could get this one down to
1.8 millimeters it would be over 98%
screen to body ratio and the company
thinks that at that point you could
truly call it a bezel verse font so all
of this seems like fairly plausible at
this point in time it is a concept but I
wouldn't be surprised to see you know
the things like the half display
fingerprint sensor and you know the
pop-up selfie camera apeun phones over
the next year or two
well vivo has thought of that and there
you go yeah it was on there it was
already on the other camera I didn't
never ruined my dramatic reveal if we
open the camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
