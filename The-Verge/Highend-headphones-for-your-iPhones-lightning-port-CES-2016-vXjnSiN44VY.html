verge here at CES 2016 and tonight we're
taking a look at these very fancy
high-end headphones for the iphone
they're made by audis a really high-end
headphone maker these are brand new
these are called the sign they cost five
hundred dollars and you can buy them
with a custom Lightning port lightning
cable that is for your iphone and then
includes a built-in amplifier and custom
audio processing the iphone will have no
problem driving these because it's all
self-contained and they get really loud
really powerful they've got a great
soundscape so they sounded pretty nice
in my tests it is kind of loud in here
so it's hard to get a really good feel
for how they sound but hopefully we'll
have more time with them soon so these
are brand new and then there's also the
ee l eight titanium series and those are
even more expensive eight hundred
dollars but you can actually buy those
at the apple store right now these ones
here will go on sale later this month so
if Apple it gets rid of the headphone
jack like it's rumored to do for the
iphone 7 this is going to be a pretty
common thing we think it's going to be
wireless headphones bluetooth and then
also lightning cable headphones could
become the norm get ready to say goodbye
to the headphone jack if you're after
high-end audiophile grade headphones
then these are the ones for you for more
at CES 2016 keep it locked at
