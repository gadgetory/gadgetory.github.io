we're here looking at mozillas boot to
gecko project basically it's the
internet on a phone it's not actually
the phone but it's the software running
on it and it's essentially just the most
intense html5 bookmarks you've ever seen
on a phone and it lets you do all of the
things you'd ever want to do on your
cell phone but using html5 in the
internet instead of any kind of native
apps so basically as soon as you turn
the phone on all you're getting is the
internet and html5 even the lock screen
and once you unlock it this is basically
just bookmarks like you can see on the
internet but like way more impressive
even the dialer which works just like
any normal phone you use is all html5
and it's all running from the web you
can actually see the source code of a
page that you're on and you can see the
drama script and all the stuff that's
running this phone and apparently you
can edit it but we figure we shouldn't
do that as you can see it's early in the
project and it's not a product yet they
were very careful to tell us that but
there's a lot of cool stuff happening
here you can play games like cut the
rope which work in html5 as well there's
a full browser and the idea is there's
going to be a marketplace and your apps
will actually follow you as you go it's
called persona and so whether you load
firefox on your browser or you load this
phone all your apps will be available
and again it's just you're looking at
tons of different bookmarks there's even
a camera and it's running html5 it
stores the photos natively but
everything you're seeing here is from
the web so right now all of this stuff
is only available if you're online
Mozilla is planning to bring a lot more
into the project and let you do a lot
more offline and select what you want to
use on and offline but for right now
this is purely an online phone and again
it's very early in the project but this
is a pretty insane way of using
bookmarks and using your
for Mozilla so that's mozillas boot to
gecko project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
