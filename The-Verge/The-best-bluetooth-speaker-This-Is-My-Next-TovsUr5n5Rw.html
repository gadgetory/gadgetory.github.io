are terrible so are your phones it's
time to upgrade to a Bluetooth speaker
they sound good they work as speaker
phones and you don't have to put them
upside down in a bowl just to hear them
but in order to buy the right one you
need to make sure you buy a Bluetooth
speaker that sounds great
that's easy to carry around that has
long range and good battery life and
maybe even comes with a cool extra
feature or two luckily that's all
totally possible
it'll cost you somewhere between 80 and
200 dollars and you won't regret the
purchase at least not if you buy the
right one portable bluetooth speakers
look like they're a dime a dozen but
they're not and the best one by a pretty
wide margin is the logitech ue boom it's
everything I'd want it to be it's cool
looking a colorful mesh cylinder that
comes in a bunch of eye-catching colors
it has good range about 35 feet before
the signal starts to drop that's pretty
normal for a Bluetooth speaker it's
battery lasted more than 16 hours and
best of all it sounds really good
it has loud 360 degree sound pumping out
of its round body it's full and clear so
you can hear the resonance in the
strings of a classical song or catch
every word Kanye says if the sounds not
loud enough you can chain two boons
together and listen even louder there
are other speakers with slightly better
battery or slightly better sound or a
slightly smaller body but the UE boom is
a virtually perfect mix of everything a
Bluetooth speaker should be if you're ok
with its slightly expensive price look
no further the SOL Republic deck is
another of my favourite portable
Bluetooth speakers it's only problem is
it doesn't sound quite as good as the UE
boom it doesn't have the same clarity or
the thumping bass and you get a little
of that shallow tin can effect you hear
on your computer speakers but it sounds
good enough for most uses and is
definitely loud enough and it has some
really fantastic extra features its
ranges ridiculous
200 feet or more it's battery life is
ridiculous it took 22 and a half hours
to die and it has this cool heist mode
feature that lets you connect up to five
people at once and have everyone DJ of
course ultimately you might just want
something that sounds amazing
that's the Bose Soundlink mini
the metallic silver speaker that just
sounds fantastic it's clear and crisp
and natural through almost any kind of
music and it has strong battery life to
more than 14 hours but a Bluetooth range
was strangely bad only about 15 feet and
it often had trouble connecting at all
it also has a proprietary charging port
and it doesn't have any nifty extra
features but man does it sound good all
of my favorite portable Bluetooth
speakers are on the expensive side of
the market if you're looking for
something cheaper the logitech ue mini
boom the smaller cousin of the UE boom
is definitely the way to go
it's tiny and plastic and nice-looking
and will easily fit into your jacket
pocket its audio does only go in one
direction without any real stereo effect
and it's sound isn't great though it is
much better than anything else in this
price range but in terms of bang for
your very few bucks the mini boom is a
pretty great choice Logitech does know
what it's doing with Bluetooth speakers
after those four there's a pretty big
drop off you could buy one of the three
jam box sizes sure but none of them are
really worth it
the big Jambox sounds great but is
humongous and the jam box and mini
jambox both just don't sound good at all
they're some of the worst sounding
Bluetooth speakers I tested and among
the most expensive you can do better
without trying very hard there are a
couple of Bluetooth speakers that sound
really good but they're just too big to
be considered portable the Bose
Soundlink is one and it's too expensive
too but it does sound good it would be a
great desk speaker if that's what you're
looking for the sound freak sound kick
gets a little closer to the right size
and it sounds great too but it's just
not something you'd toss into a backpack
and take to the beach there are a couple
you could absolutely take to the beach
like the Panasonic SCM t10 it's a
waterproof hockey puck looking speaker
that sounds good for a cheap speaker but
its battery life is pretty weak and it's
also really ugly the Bravin brv X is a
little better sounding and also
waterproof but it's only a good choice
if someone else is carrying your gear
it's huge the JBL flip 2 is another
solid choice for cheap speakers it has
that same cone round design as the UE
boo it's loud and sounds okay but it's a
little bit complex to set up and can
and it sound just isn't as good as even
the Yui mini boo
same for the IRA pure the smallest
speaker I tested it sounds better than
it seems like it ought to but it's only
a little better than your computer
speakers it's worth upgrading to get
something better last and certainly
least is the beats pill
it just sounds bad that bassy beats
sound doesn't work on a portable
bluetooth speaker not by a long shot in
addition to everything else you should
make sure that whatever you buy has an
input for plugging in a music source
directly plus easy-to-use controls on
the box itself luckily most of these do
and if you buy the logitech ue boom the
best all-around Bluetooth speaker on the
market you'll get all that and much more
I bought two
