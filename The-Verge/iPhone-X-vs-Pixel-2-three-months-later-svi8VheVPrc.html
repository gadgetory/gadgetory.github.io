first announced the iPhone 10 and around
five months since Google first announced
the pixel 2 and the pixel 2 XL so these
are both great phones which is what you
might expect because they're both
flagship phones but after actually using
them for a while it's clear to me at
least which one of these is the better
phone you mean the one that doesn't cost
a thousand dollars and it's still a
fantastic phone no no I missed this now
the iPhone 10 was a pretty radical
redesign for Apple it's the first iPhone
without a home button it has an OLED
display it sizes somewhere in between a
regular sized iPhone and a plus iPhone
and you can unlock it with your face ok
the smaller pixel 2 doesn't look all
that different from the first pixel but
the pixel 2 XL looks different it has a
nearly all screen front design both have
OLED displays and keep in mind this is
only Google's second generation of pixel
phones and already they're up there
competing with the top smartphone makers
okay well the iPhone 10 is fast like
ridiculously fast its processors faster
than processors and a lot of laptops and
in the time that I've been using it I've
been kind of blown away by it
okay well the pixel 2 is no slouch
either it's running on a snapdragon 835
processor which is powering all of the
top Android phones right now it might
not be a bionic processor but it's still
pretty fast one of the biggest changes
with the iPhone 10 though is that Apple
has also redesigned the way you interact
with the phone so the way you switch
between apps or swipe to see
notifications now that I've used this
for a while I really like it
okay I'll admit it took me way longer to
get used to these interactions than I
thought it would and I wouldn't be
surprised if other people got the new
phone and hated it but now when I pick
up other phones I just think the iPhone
tends UI is probably the way to do it
the pixel 2 has some UI changes too
although that's because of Android and
not specific to pixels like the search
bar is now at the bottom of the home
screen and the display is always on
which seems like a small thing but after
a few months you kind of find that you
can't live without it
I mean one of the things that really
annoys me about that phone is that if
you just want to see
time you have to pick the phone up no I
don't okay what time is it now if you've
been seriously considering these phones
for the past few months then you've
probably read all of the camera
comparisons in fact the verge did one
that you should go check out but to sum
it up both of these phones have
excellent cameras on the pixel to excel
a lot of the camera improvements are
happening on the software side so for
example this now shoots in portrait mode
with a nice soft background which the
iPhone has done for a while but this
phone doesn't have two cameras
yeah but the iPhone 10 not only has
portrait mode it also has studio
lighting now like this that looks awful
well it's pretty great when it works
okay also we think that the pixel 2 XL
shoots a little bit better and lo white
just saying yeah but not that much
better also the iPhone 10 and the iPhone
8 both support wireless charging which
your phone doesn't yeah but you can
charge the pixel 2 and the pixel to
excel with USB C which is how I charge
my macbook which means I'm just carrying
around fewer cables okay well your phone
doesn't have a headphone jack neither
does yours I'm just pointing out you're
finally catching up with the times your
point makes zero sense
another thing you're only going to get
with the iPhone is Siri now I know you
may be thinking Siri is useless but the
more I've used it the better it has gone
you're kidding right
no ok let's do a test I'm gonna squeeze
the phone who is the star of the movie
the post
Meryl Streep Tom Hanks and 13 others no
problem hey Siri who is the star of the
movie the post
I found nine movies for you to choose
from post-grad the post post pop
depression live at the Royal Albert Hall
the last post new mommies how to get
your body back functional post pregnancy
ex yeah I'm sorry
Google assistant is just better it just
it just is but I have faced ID I
wouldn't go as far as saying that face
ID is the best feature of the new iPhone
10 but I think it's the most significant
it means the one that feels like it's
propelling us forward into the future
now I need to unlock my phone or log
into apps or even just pay a friend with
a peer-to-peer app I just I just use my
face okay we literally wrote an article
about how face ID was unusable if the
phone's not directly in front of you
like when you're in the car and said
that you missed having the home button
yeah but it's it's grown on me I mean I
still think the in-app experience is a
little bit more useful than using it to
unlock the phone but how's your
fingerprint sensor it's fine it's
totally fine and it works and it's in
the right place where it should be on
the back of the phone yeah so what
happens when you have your phone down on
the table face up
well I guess that's bad if you're the
kind of person who puts the phone down
never also I have an ammonia oh good god
what this really comes down to after
using both of these phones for a while
is ecosystem which ecosystem do you want
to live in or be locked into but really
this is a point that we agree on I mean
it's all about the apps and services
that you use the most
like I message you love iMessage then no
matter how fantastic the pixel 2 or the
pixel 2xl are you're not going to really
want that phone because you can't get
iMessage and if you don't care about
iMessage and you don't care about using
airplay or airdrop or having an Apple
watch and you want the most highly
optimized version of Android that you
can get then you're going to want this
phone I mean I still use the same google
apps and services that you use on that
phone and I didn't pay thousand dollars
for this what she's really trying to say
is that they're both great phones and
you probably can't go wrong with either
of them but there is one that is
slightly better which is why it costs
slightly more you would say that so
these are my long-term impressions of
what it's like to use the iPhone hey
you're back I'm back where have you been
I was off shooting my Virg fiddy Oh
series next level oh is that your
average video series about innovation
yes you should watch it you would learn
something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
