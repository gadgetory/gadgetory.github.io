this is my class hololens headset and
this is inside the hololens this is the
developer edition so it's not shipping
out to consumers it's literally to
developers right now to create apps and
games and but from the outside it looks
very much the same as last year but
what's equally impressive is what's
actually inside the headset and what
powers all those unique color grams the
first is the one that you see quite
prominently at the front is obviously
the visor and what sits behind that is a
see-through holographic lenses and
there's obviously a unit that processes
all that they essentially what these
what these do is they pass the
holographic images and through through
these lenses and indirectly into eyes so
that's how you're seeing all the
Holograms around you or your your
looking at them in the environment and
then on top of the actual visor sits the
sensor bar and so this includes a
basically a Kinect camera at the top
there's a depth sensing camera and that
will sense exactly your environment
around you and then the sides you've got
the environment sensing cameras as well
and they all kind of combined together
to really understand what room you're
sitting in how you're interacting with
the holograms around you and really
feeding that back to the processor and
in speaking of the processor and this is
probably the most impressive part the
Halloween to me and this is the
motherboard so this house is the
processor the GPU and the new Microsoft
own chip which is the holographic
processing unit the HPU
it's also got the O's you got the RAM on
here as well and a Bluetooth chip and
Wi-Fi chip so all those chipsets all the
core processing power of the hololens is
in this tiny little movie board right
here
and the other really cool thing about
hololens is the spatial sound and so
it's these tiny little speakers here and
the project's sound interiors a certain
angle the hololens might use that as a
way to sort of direct you to turn around
just because you can hear an enemy
behind you it's kind of cool and these
are the speakers that essentially drive
that we've obviously got some of these
circuitry and then the free battery
packs that sit either side of the bus
myself isn't saying exactly the capacity
these battery packs and that these are
powering the entire device so this isn't
getting plugged into a computer isn't
getting plugged into a mobile phone or
anything like that and it's powering the
camera the processor the GPU every
single component in this entire device
so that was a quick look at what's
inside mics as hololens headset if you
