in the iPhone App Store good luck with
that
there are hundreds if not thousands of
calendar apps vying for your daily
attention and the truth is most of them
are garbage but if you dig deep enough a
few of them are truly great the best
ones give you directions tell you more
about the people you're meeting with and
tie into your favorite services like
Facebook and trippin but which app
should you pick
sunrise is the best calendar app for
most people not only does it have one of
the largest feature sets of any app I
tested but somehow manages to bundle it
all into a very handsome minimal and
free package sunrise does everything
you'd expect from a calendar app
reoccurring events birthdays alerts
Google Maps integration and more it's
the little things that make sunrise
truly special though like it's weather
indicators photo avatars for event
attendees smart icons that change to
reflect your events and its integration
with popular services like Songkick and
TripIt show upcoming concerts and trips
you can even add interesting calendars
for free like holidays sports schedules
or World Cup games sunrises Facebook
integration is also best-in-class
importing events and birthdays like no
other the icing on the cake is that
sunrise also makes iPad and desktop apps
which Trump Google Calendar in almost
every way there are some rough edges
like a lack of a true week viewing month
view sunrise finds a great balance
however between useful features and
information overload it not only
displays your calendar really well but
adds a whole lot to it
fantastical too on the other hand
doesn't have as many bells and whistles
but it's so solid that it's impossible
not to recommend it it comes in a very
close second place fantastical is easy
to read imports all the calendars you've
already added to your phone right out of
the box and has best-in-class language
recognition that means you can type in
dinner with David tomorrow at 8 p.m. at
Chipotle press add and you're done even
better as you type fantastical shows
what else is going on in your calendar
so you can plan around upcoming events
the app also includes a true week view
on like sunrise but offers no detailed
month view fantastical is way more
expensive than its competitors so it
might scare off all but the most serious
schedulers beyond sunrise and
fantastical there's several worthy
competitors that might be perfect for a
certain kind of person if you
desperately need the date on your home
screen for example the iOS calendar is
your only real option otherwise stay
away
calendars 5 by Regal is a lot better
alternative the app does everything well
from its fantastical inspired language
recognition to its unique portrait
oriented week view its best features are
some little touches like arrows that
indicate when you have more going on
today and elegant support for Apple's
to-do app reminder
the apps month view is also excellent
letting you quickly zoom into a day then
back out again super fast calendars 5:00
is great but expensive and doesn't stand
out much from the crowd if you're
looking for a more integrated approach
to productivity however Cal is a great
option the app ties directly into any do
one of the best to do apps you can find
and envisions your calendar as a mixture
of events and tasks and tacky stock
photography there's no other calendar
app that's integrated with a popular to
do zap like any do but Cal can be
sluggish and buggy enough to make the
trip not worth taking if you want a
calendar app that's ultra minimal and
only includes today's events peak might
be worth alone peak is definitely the
most beautiful way to see what you're
doing today but it can't do much else
the apps UI is like nothing I've ever
seen that also means it's a real
challenge to add events and pick out
calendars to show or hide so what good
is it up to is like sunrise light
offering a similar interface weather and
interesting calendars but not much more
up to selection of calendars is a
standout feature in fact offering not
just sports teams but also schedules for
shows like Game of Thrones and
alternative music releases the apps real
strength however is its shared calendar
system it's easy to share specific
events so they show up on the calendars
of your other family members but
ultimately up to just doesn't have
enough features or even week view which
comes standard in most apps want another
way to look at your day even if it looks
totally bizarre mind offers an odd but
effective snapshot of your day the
moment you open up the app tells you the
weather and what's happening but also
which event is next and how soon you
should leaves you aren't late the apps
but ugly that has some unique features
like insights about how you're spending
your time and a tool that helps you
suggest meeting times to colleagues more
attractive take on predictive
intelligence comes from tempo the app
can dial conference call numbers for you
pull attachments from relevant meeting
emails and even tell you the latest
tweets or mutual friends of an event
attendee there's also one tap access to
directions flight statuses and
conference calls tempo is a bit of an
eyesore especially when you happen to
week view but is a well rounded calendar
app that business people should love too
final options are we calendar and agenda
one's great for looking at the coming
week while the other is good for looking
at your agenda over the next few days
agenda offers a really nice way to see a
list of all your events at once the app
has great information density week
calendar on the other hand has gained a
faithful following for its even denser
week view which attempts to squeeze
everything you're doing this week into
one screen it's pretty ugly but hey some
people dig that unfortunately for you
downloading calendar app is only the
first step towards organizing your life
inputting events fulfilling promises and
not being late to your next date is
entirely up to you but there's certainly
some effective apps to help you get
there
