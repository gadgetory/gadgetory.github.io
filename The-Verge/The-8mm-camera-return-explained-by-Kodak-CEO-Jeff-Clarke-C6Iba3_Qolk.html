here at the verge lounge presented by
Ford SYNC thanks for come in I'm Sean
okay and I'm a reporter for The Verge
and I have a very special guest list
here today this is Jeff Clark the CEO of
Kodak who made probably one of the most
surprising announcements of CES I don't
think anybody really expected to come
here and wind up talking about a film
camera let alone an 8 millimeter film
camera but that's what you announce and
I would love to hear more of it because
I haven't seen it yet well originally
super 8 camera 50 years old was
announced in 1964 and obviously a couple
years later came out at the World's Fair
codecs last super 8 camera was 1982 so
bringing this back is part of a
recognition that there's an analog
Renaissance happening and we see this a
vinyl you see this with 3d printing
where you're taking digital and then
using physical property to create the
best of both worlds and we believe that
not only should Steven Spielberg and
Quentin Tarantino and JJ Abrams and and
Steve McQueen be able to shoot on film
students should be able to and aspiring
artists and filmmakers should as well as
as professionals so we want to offer
that for people to have a super8 camera
again I want to get to those filmmakers
in a second because that's I think a
really interesting part about this but
can you give me an idea tell everybody
how this thing works because you it is
it's a dislike lis digital but an 8
millimeter camera and one that I haven't
I mean the last one was released before
I was born and I've used 8 millimeter
cameras before and they are there are a
lot of fun to use and then there's but
there's a process of getting that film
developed you guys have the whole thing
sort of locked down with this new camera
right we do we felt that you needed a
full ecosystem so first of all the
camera is a classic film camera the same
cartridge that we were making for the
last 20 years pops right in there and
you have a real analog film experience
we've added some digital features we
added a viewfinder we added a digital
mic and we added a place you can put a
card in so you can integrate that
properly but the ecosystem is you take
the pic you buy the film
you then send the film left who shot it
back to Kodak we will then upload an
image on YouTube or whatever you'd like
and then you can share it social media
can watch it digitally if you want and
then the mail a special present comes
which is the reel-to-reel but you can
you can shoot at home as well
I shot on some 8 millimeter film some
vision 3 a couple years ago for a
project and I got the digital transfer
done and everything but I had to find it
was it was almost impossible I had to
find the last place in New York City
that sells it and it's this basement
office I mean it's like so hard to track
down it's impossible to find online and
then I had to bring it back there to get
developed and they did the digital
transfer it was very expensive but I did
get that real back and there was
something about as much as I had fun
working with that film in the project on
my computer having that real was
something totally wild and that's
exciting that you guys are keeping that
around we think it's important but you
know your analog right yeah you're not
digital your analog so when you feel it
when you touch it that's part of the
maker movement that's part of why
there's an analog rent Renaissance right
now is it um this show is full of very
good digital products that are
extraordinary what we've done is taken
some of that digital content and brought
back analog into it for the best of both
worlds and that's what makes it fun for
you and the ecosystems required the
ecosystem that you know frankly many of
us were shot as kids you know with super
8 in that those the movies that we have
in our memory had a full ecosystem we
could have gone to the corner pharmacy
and got that done now it's you have to
do a mail order into Kodak but it will
be it'll be good now this camera tell me
when it's gonna be released and tell me
how cheap it is cuz it looks really cool
if you haven't seen it you gotta go find
it it is like the nicest looking 8
millimeter camera that looks like it was
released in 2016
really later this fall we expect to have
a limited edition out we're targeting
prices still TBD but when we get to
volume you're talking somewhere between
400 and 700 dollars for a camera
you know pricing it right underneath
oculus well yeah yeah totally different
experiences but I mean I would expect to
look in that price range if I was gonna
try and find a working a millimeter
camera I know my brother has one though
one is one I used then it was
even that is hard to keep working these
days because it's that one's even older
than 82 yeah so you know when we
announced this a lot of people have come
back and given us feedback including a
school teacher who teaches film and he
said we've been buying them up and and
having spares you know off of the
internet and it's getting harder and
harder
there is a super8 you can buy today
which is five thousand dollars it's a
very beautiful you know all the features
that you could have and the owner sell a
couple hundred of those really unique
product this is for the masses this is
one we want to get people accessible to
students one part of getting that to the
masses is like though where I want to
end this is you mentioned these guys at
the beginning but JJ Abrams Quentin
Tarantino there are a bunch of really
acclaimed filmmakers that have already
come out before you even really
announced this thing officially have
come out and supported this idea which
must be really cool but I want to know
was that something you approached them
to talk about this idea ahead of time
did they just hear about it I mean how
deeper story than that um you know Kodak
was in bankruptcy and after the company
came out of bankruptcy we brought on a
new manager team I'm the new CEO of that
the last 18 months one of the earliest
decisions we had to make was are we
going to continue to make film it's only
10% of kodak revenue and but it's a huge
responsibility for our brand and the and
as a medium as an artist medium we made
the decision to do it and we went all-in
and so when we talked to the Spielberg's
and Tarantino's will you still shoot
film if we still make it their answer
was resounding yes and then we talked
about what's the next step in the answer
is how do we get more people to shoot
film and that means you have to have a
device it can't you know not everyone
can shoot 70 like Tarantino and so you
know we have several devices accessible
you know to people who want to
experiment and play and learn and that's
what this is all about so yes they've
been in from the beginning well thank
you so much for your time Jeff we have a
whole lot more going on here at CES this
year the shows packed with a ton of
stuff we've been out everybody back here
has been out working really hard so give
them some love and if you want to see
all that definitely go to the verge comm
also go to youtube.com slash The Verge
and click Subscribe we've got tons of
awesome videos there maybe we can get
some film videos processed and put up
there too
I'm sure we can get you some film yeah
there we go so head to those make sure
you subscribe thanks for watching
