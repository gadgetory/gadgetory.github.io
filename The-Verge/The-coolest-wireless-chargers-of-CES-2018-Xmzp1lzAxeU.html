2018 wireless charging reigns supreme
and we're seeing tons of new Chargers in
the shapes sizes and form factors
specifically we're seeing Qi charging
pads the same wireless standard used by
Samsung LG and tons of other companies
but the big difference this year is that
last fall Apple added Qi charging to its
iPhone 10 knife on eight models bringing
a huge influx of new users to the market
and plenty of companies looking to cash
in on that Apple jumping onboard means
two things
one tons of new customers looking to buy
a wireless charging pad for the first
time in their lives and to the basic
effective death of the other main
wireless charging standard PMA in fact
at CES this year
PMA announced that its Powermat Chargers
would be adopting she now going forward
that leads us to the Chargers themselves
and even though this technology has been
around for a while we're still seeing
companies experimenting and trying to
figure things out
because I'm like a charging cable
wireless chargers a big thing that's
always going to be on your desk or
nightstand and that means that it needs
to fit in your life in the way that
cable doesn't so companies are really
experimenting with different form
factors one IOT showed up with five
different chargers a pad a miniature pad
stand some weird wall mount thing in the
car man don't get also showed up with a
bunch of new chargers and they're also
just trying new things like this double
charger that's actually two charging
pads just meshed into one or new
startups like tray which are following
the steps of Ikea and building wireless
chargers directly into a whole line of
lambs and honestly that's a pretty good
idea why not put a wireless charger in
something you keep plugged in and on
your desk at all times anyway and all
this variety is really important because
different people have different tastes
and styles the fabric-covered charger I
like might not suit your tastes at all
and sure the everything but the kitchen
sink method might be a little
overwhelming but at least there's
variety especially because there might
not be a single right answer here even
mouse pads are getting in on wireless
charging with a company called Corsair
putting a Qi charger into its mm 1000
mask at ICS
which can charge your phone or your
mousepad just the same which brings me
to one of the other big advantages of Qi
charging is that it's become this truly
Universal standard that's transcended
product category or brand sure companies
are still divided as to whether these
USB C or microUSB for their phones and
Apple of course is gonna stick with
lightning for basically forever but I
can take a Samsung phone or an iPhone
and drop them on my to charger and it'll
work just the same we're really reaching
this universal standard where anything
will charge B it Mouse phone watch
battery pack or anything else new
there's also interesting applications
for the future of wireless charging here
at CES we're starting to see the
technology and make the jump from
traditional gadgets to more household
goods like crock pots or even blenders
although right now it's still more than
a gimmicky stage than a genuinely useful
solution it's also important to remember
that while chief charging is really cool
it's also only wireless charging in the
sense that you're not physically
plugging in a cable to your phone you
still have to take your phone put it on
the pad and remember to do that every
day
true wireless charging where your phone
will just magically draw power from air
for maybe a hub somewhere else in the
room is the real Holy Grail here and
we're so kind of years away from that
although there are companies at CES this
year that are trying to work on that so
the future might not be as far off as we
think for now though it's never been a
better time to start getting into
wireless charging and even if it's not
quite the magical future we've been
promised it still sure beats untangling
