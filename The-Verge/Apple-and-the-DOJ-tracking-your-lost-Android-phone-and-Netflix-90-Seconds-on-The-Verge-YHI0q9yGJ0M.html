US Department of Justice has suggested
that Apple make some serious changes
after was found guilty of ebook
price-fixing the DOJ wants apple to
terminate his contract with five major
book publishers and is asking that the
company be barred from signing
agreements that could lead to a similar
situation for the next five years the
DOJ also wants apple to let competitors
like amazon link to their own online
stores directly from their respective
iOS apps Apple has called proposal quote
draconian and the courts still need to
decide what's fair before any measures
go into place Android users have you
been waiting for a way to remotely track
your lost Android device well you still
can't but soon later this month Google
will be launching the Android device
manager users will be able to track ring
or erase their lost phone straight from
the Play Store or a companion mobile app
the new service will work with android
2.2 or higher and let's face it if
you're still using it Claire you've
probably already thrown it away in
frustration and finally Netflix will now
only recommend Nicolas Cage movies when
you actually want it to the company has
introduced multiple user profiles for
streaming accounts it will basically let
you keep a different queue and set of
recommendations from your roommate child
parent or anyone else they might be
using your netflix account it also gives
Netflix better data so it doesn't think
you're watching Dinosaur Train and
dinocroc back-to-back not that there's
anything wrong with that that's it for
today's top stories coming up tomorrow
