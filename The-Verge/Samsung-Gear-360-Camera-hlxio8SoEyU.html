the Samsung gear 360 it's a camera that
shoots what else 360 degree photos and
video now we had heard that Samsung
might be bringing something like this to
MWC but I wasn't expecting it to be
something this small and this consumer
friendly it's obviously working with a
two lens system which is becoming more
popular with these 360-degree cameras
each one has an F 2.0 lens on it and it
shoots a 195 degree field of view so the
loop image from one side and the other
side actually overlap that's important
when you're stitching those photos and
videos together it makes the quality a
little bit better and it means that each
side can be a little bit higher
resolution now this cameras going to be
able to shoot the equivalent of the 30
megapixels still and 3840 by 1920 video
so that's a little bit sub UHD but it's
still going to be good enough for even
seeing it on gear VR and we've tried it
out here in the quality looks pretty
good the stitching looks pretty decent
and for consumer level 360-degree
cameras that looks like Samsung's got
something that's going to enter the
market at a pretty competitive place and
what we do know is that it works with
the galaxy s7 to stitch all the footage
and photos together you're going to
shoot on the camera and then download
the footage wirelessly to phone and use
the processor there to stitch everything
together from there you can share it to
Facebook YouTube or any other platform
that's been supporting native 360 video
now Samsung says this is going to be
released a little later this year
probably in q2 but we don't know exactly
how much it's going to cost or how
you're going to be able to get it maybe
it'll be bundled with an s7
or the edge or where the gear VR what we
do know is that it's another entry into
the market that's going to make shooting
360 photos and 360 videos a lot easier</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
