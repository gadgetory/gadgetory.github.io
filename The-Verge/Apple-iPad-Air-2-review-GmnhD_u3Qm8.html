the iPad air 2 there's not very much to
say about the iPad air 2 but that's
because there's not very much of it the
only noticeable design change in the
iPad air 2 is the removal of the side
switch which makes it slightly harder to
either lock rotation or mute the volume
it's 18% thinner and weighs less than
pound it's kind of like holding a screen
and nothing else that screen is actually
the biggest and best change in the new
iPad air 2 previous iPads had an air gap
between the display and the cover glass
but the new air 2 has a laminated
display like every iPhone since the
iPhone 4 that laminated display is a big
reason the new iPad is so much thinner
but most importantly it looks gorgeous
it's like you're touching the pixels
directly I did notice that the screen
seems a little bit Pinker than my older
air but only when I really held them
side by side or pretty much off axis
otherwise the whole display just looks
great Apple says the new anti reflective
coating reduces glare by 56% but to be
honest I didn't notice it at all it's a
little bit better if you look for it but
you still can't really use the air to
outside and bright sunlight the other
big change to the iPad air 2 is the back
camera which is now an 8 megapixel
sensor up from 5 like it or not people
love to use their iPads as cameras and
Apple's really excited about it the
photos themselves aren't quite as good
as the iPhone 6 or 6 plus particularly
in low light but they're certainly on
par with older iPhones and most other
smart phones I'm never going to be a
tablet photographer but I'm curious to
see how app developers use this new
camera maybe they'll change my mind the
air 2 also has apple's touch ID sensor
which works just like you'd expect which
is to say seamlessly you can unlock the
iPad and pay for things and apps that
use Apple pay but it's not so much of an
upgrade that it's worth getting a whole
new iPad for it keep in mind that your
fingerprints don't transfer between
devices so I have to set up touch ID
from scratch even if you've already set
it up on your iPhone inside the new air
has an 8 X chip the same chip is the
iPhone 6 but with beefed up graphics
it's fast really fast I never notice any
slowdowns and games around just fine
especially newer games to take advantage
of iOS 8 and there's no real trade-off
between power and battery life my review
unit ran all weekend without a charge it
would also be nice if Apple took
advantage the iPads increase power and
bigger screen in a more useful way
there's nothing about iOS 8 on the iPad
that really changes the experience of
using the
it's a little bit easier to switch from
phone to tablet to laptop with features
like continuity and handoff that let you
seamlessly move between apps and devices
but using the iPad itself is still
mostly the same I still wouldn't pick an
iPad to be my only computer over a
laptop and I definitely wouldn't leave
the house with an iPad instead of my
phone the new air 2 is a much more
powerful computer than the laptop I had
just a couple years ago
but even something as simple as browsing
the web isn't as full featured or
flexible in sharing an iPad with
multiple people and a family is still a
clunky experience because iOS 8 doesn't
support multiple users the iPad is
Apple's most shareable computer and the
iPad air 2 is so thin and friendly that
it just begs to be passed around but
everything about iOS 8 feels like it
belongs to just one person it's a huge
opportunity that Apple's just leaving on
the table and that's really the story of
the iPad air 2 it's very much the best
iPad ever made but Apple is leaving so
much left undone these are all iterative
updates
there's no must-have reason to upgrade
if you already have an iPad you're happy
with holding an iPad air 2 feels like
the future it's so thin and light it's
almost impossible but Apple has to push
harder against the limits of what's
possible with an iPad if it wants to
finish the tablet revolution it started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
