and we are looking at the Lenovo a 3000
which is a 7-inch tablet it's running
Android 4.2 as you can see it has a
quad-core mediatek browser i think it's
only one point two gigahertz but it
seems like it is relatively snappy for
all that since it's running stock
Android it doesn't need to do all that
much it's got a gigabyte of RAM and it
has 4 16 gigabyte storage options and
Lenovo says this is going to be
available globally later this year but
they're not giving us a price it will
just be quote priced aggressively it has
a 1024 x 600 IPS display and it does you
know it looks relatively sharp for all
being that size although it's not you
know the best you're going to find in
this category it is relatively waiting
it feels a little bit later than say the
Nexus 7 it has sort of a neat little
finish on the back here and a 5
megapixel camera on the back as well and
one other interesting thing is you can
pop the back off here to get expanded
storage with a microSD or stick in one
or two SIM slots it will come in both
variations
that gives you hspa+ unfortunately it
won't give you LTE so there it is it is
the Lenovo a 3000 available later this
year for a quote aggressive price lenovo
also has a 10.1 inch tablet it's called
the s6000 it has the exact same
processor as a 7 inch version it also
comes in Wi-Fi or 3G models the only
difference here is this screen is of
course larger it is 720 x 1280 and it's
either running this relatively
lightweight skin that or the
you've got these folder widgets you can
add
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
