just after the end of Apple's WWDC 2018
developers keynote and you know what
this was the most google keynote that
Apple has ever presented what do I mean
by that Apple announced a ton of stuff
that is almost exactly like what Google
announced at Google i/o last month like
feature for feature the same thing what
I want to do is I want to look at all
the features at both Apple and Google
announced in the past couple of months
and compare them and see how Google does
at Google's way and Apple does it apples
way but you know one thing was the same
usually Apple gives you a clear
overarching theme at its keynotes you
sort of get a narrative thread but this
time they just like I know it's a bunch
of stuff which is exactly what Google
does at its quino's even though this was
the most googly Apple Keynote and quite
a while trust me
Apple is still Apple all right so we're
back in the studio and honestly there's
a lot of stuff we could go through and I
want to just jump through really
rapid-fire and a few of them just to get
started and I'm out here just do this so
you can look at some stuff here okay so
the first thing is this time I'll spend
stuff Apple calls it screen time Google
calls a digital well being but it's
basically an app that lets you see how
much time you're using on all the apps
on your phone and it's very very similar
another thing that's very very similar
oh my god
I think they might have fixed
notifications in iOS I'm so excited we
made a video about this before but you
can now group notifications and you can
turn off notifications directly from the
notification without digging into
settings and now the last thing I want
to do is really quick is Apple photos
and yo it is a straight rip of Google
photos they have these Zak same features
they've got this for you section where
it's like the Google assistant section
where it like magically creates fun
little things with your pictures they
have advanced search that lets you look
inside the photos and string chains of
different searches together and they
have suggested sharing where it looks at
who's in the photos and suggest that you
make a shared album with those people
just like Google photos does but the
difference is Apple photos when you make
those shared albums they're end-to-end
encrypted they don't depend on Apple
looking at it in the cloud where Google
photos you know Google puts their stuff
in the cloud now apples and and
encryption is the big story here that's
the main thing that they do differently
than the way Google does it and that
difference becomes really
throughout this entire story another
really good example of it is shared
augmented reality both companies
announcements you could have a shared
augmented reality experience among
multiple devices
Google's is cross-platform Apple's isn't
and you know what
rather than me talk about it this is the
one thing we got to try at WWDC so let's
take a look at it we've we've joined the
game that's being hosted over there and
so you can see the whole table what's
interesting about this is us having this
shared a our experience is happening all
locally this is all just getting done
directly over Wi-Fi so all the data
about the position of all these things I
see it he sees it he sees it it's all
happening without having to go up to the
cloud which is different and the way
Google does it they use this thing
called cloud anchors which syncs it up
to the cloud and then back down again
that was also really good at recognizing
that you know this object and that
object these two iPads they both know
that this table is here and that this is
a shared world and so when I send
something over to this guy he's learning
how to do it I'm just gonna dunk on him
right now by going at him okay so I
really hope that Vera and Felicia chose
to show you the cup where I won that
game because I lost most of those games
true story when you lose a game the word
victory is spelled backwards because you
know it's a shared augmented reality and
it actually has the right perspective
anyway what I really want to talk to you
guys about are two features that I think
are the most important things that Apple
announced at WWDC the first is this new
shortcuts feature and it's very similar
to what's on Android P which is called
actions and slices so an apps function
breaks out of the app into the rest of
the operating system either in search or
the widget panel or whatever now the way
Apple does it is you actually set it up
yourself it's more configuration the
weight Android P does it is you just
have to trust Google is good to just
know everything and figure it out for
you they're very similar but the Apple
way it's more configured it's more local
the Google way you just have to trust
Google but the most important thing the
biggest news out of WWC by far in my
opinion is this new paradigm for the way
apps are gonna work on Mac OS in the
future this was actually my favorite
moment of the keynote when Craig
federighi was up there and he asked like
are we finally gonna merge mac OS and
iOS and his answer was no no
no it's gonna be something much more
complicated and frankly much more
interesting but before we get into that
I want to talk about how Google does
this because they've already done this
move they have taken Android apps and
put them on Chrome OS but Google did it
in a super googly way they release a
pretty janky beta that literally just
took a phone app and slapped it on the
desktop and Chromebooks have touchscreen
so you could scroll or whatever but it
worked with Mouse clicking and they just
put that out in the world and let people
mess around with it and then over time
as they evolved the operating system
they're slowly evolving Android apps so
eventually you're gonna be able to do
window resizing and have proper
windowing and all the rest of the stuff
but that Google way of just like screw
it put it out there and see how people
react to it and we'll fix it you know
once it's out there is not the way Apple
wants to work here's how Apple is doing
it so iOS and Mac OS both have the same
like UNIX underpinnings right but they
have different ways to build the user
interfaces and so what Apple is doing is
it's taking the user interface builder
for iOS and it's adding it into Mac OS
it's called UI kit and so you can take a
bunch of stuff that you've done to build
your iOS app do some tweaking and apps
developer platform it's called Xcode and
then it'll turn into a Mac app that
feels like a Mac app where you can
resize the windows and it has proper
scrolling and it doesn't work with
touchscreens because Mac's don't have
touchscreens I'm a little bit nervous I
played on with a home app which
basically felt like an iPad app just put
on the Mac screen you could resize the
windows and that was great but it just I
really wanted to touch the buttons
because it was a button interface that
was designed for a touchscreen but
here's the bottom line
having mobile apps on a desktop
operating system is surprisingly great
even in those early janky Chrome OS
betas with Android apps it was
surprisingly useful to just have a
little Instagram app or a little to-do
app instead of a full-blown desktop app
or a web app in a you know container
electron thing there's just literally
millions and millions and millions of
them for iOS and I would love to see
some of those hit Mac OS okay so what do
we learn well we learned a bunch of
stuff about Google they do Google things
in very googley ways they release stuff
before it's ready for developers to
screw around with it and fix it and they
figure it out over time they ask you to
trust the Google assistant a lot
everything goes up to the cloud Google
analyzes it with their machine learning
algorithms or whatever you don't have to
do as much configuration which I like
it's actually a little bit simpler than
Apple's way but in order for all that
stuff to work you have to give the
Google assistant a ton of access to your
data and information now the Apple way
very different you have to do a little
bit more configuration especially with
the shortcut stuff and well I love that
that gives me as the user more control
I'm not sure I need that much control or
I'm not sure I want to take the time to
set all that stuff up of course the
other Apple thing to do is keep
everything end-to-end encrypted so that
nobody can see your stuff except you and
the people you might happen to share it
with this is why I'm really excited to
see what happens when iOS 12 and Mojave
come out this fall because we'll be able
to compare those two approaches except
no we can't because the most important
difference between these two companies
is that when Iowa says that they're
gonna ship a new version of an operating
system it goes out to millions and
millions of customers and they all get
to upgrade right away whereas with
Android P not so much a tiny sliver of
people get the latest version of Android
and everybody else has to wait a really
long time so the big difference between
these two approaches is honestly Apple
ships the worm is turned in this Apple
even though this is a really Google
keynote the apple doesn't fall far from
the tree
we're gonna be making these videos a lot
more because an apple a day keeps the
google away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
