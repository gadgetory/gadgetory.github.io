the week of May 6 aah may ish it's the
wheels in there chain it was May sixth
well done I'm Josh Topolsky and I've
gots a very special guest with me I'm
David p√®re David Pierce and i'm chris
sigler chris diggler and I feel like
honestly I don't want to knock Neal I or
Paul who are great but this is the real
verge cam yeah I appalled or like our
rest of me is with the verge Castro is
supposed to be this is like a super
group right because we have David from
from top off and you from the original
Brian we're like The Avengers oh I don't
write a full body shot people can see
that I'm not wearing socks today it's a
good luck it's now cover story summaries
not covered by the lower third well it's
very warm out it's it's sunny it's
warm it's not raining I got no socks no
underwear that's my policy to this time
of year once it's May first May first
the underwear come off and they don't
come back on til October Columbus Dana
talk to a halloween that's the day
algorithm for my costume oh sure
underwear man which is just me and
underwear and then they just don't come
off again they don't know off again
that's exactly right repeat same thing
yeah anyhow so this diverse cast were
discussed the weekend technology
technology culture culture culture and
and then really whatever that we feel
like we want to talk about and you can't
do anything about it cuz you tuned in
and you can't escape you're like how did
I get here why am i listening to this
but it's too late you already heard it
it's all over it like my underwear man
cost you am i right Billy you know
they're talking about Gelman over here
hey bae our younger viewers will not
know who Gelman is I don't think they
are older viewers she should be ashamed
of the self-referred knowing who Gelman
is or for watching this show so what do
we got you doing topics so well the
first thing we have talked about is the
video yeah obviously which just launches
problem is very exciting I just kind of
say something about what I'm doing I
don't know that have been brought up or
not but we have shelter on tap here at
the Vox offices I think the whole reason
we moved its basically
reason so we've got one of our big
request is like if we get shelter on tap
is a real of shelter uh we would do that
so we have a we can do seller on tap and
then you just pour it into a bottle but
machine sharing with you all day as a
new york office noob can I just say that
the machine is not as simple as you
would be led to believe it has one lever
for shelter it has three Larry levers
one for shelter 14 room temperature
water one for cold water because
sometimes you really want results or
what color what color do you think
Seltzer is on the machine it's green
grants right the color let's go let's do
this because green green means like
let's have a good time drinking a
beverage pretty much okay let's talk
about the video of the video how to talk
about the video hub a chat mom back
there jack speaking of the video we can
imagine his beards looking incredible
right use border better your grace just
not finding today this is it I don't
know look the beard by the way huge
hugely in now Chris you and I have had
beards for a long time Dave attacks like
really like a David is afraid to do it
but I gotta tell you the amount of
people John Krasinski was just on late
night the other night the lip sync
contest a degree I think I've ever but
his beard is like really it's fancy it's
a nice beauty yeah I'm jealous of that
beard I think that's why they're ending
the office they were like now they like
your beard you shut it down your beard
is so good there's no point going on
anyhow so so we launched yesterday our
new video site I mean it's it's part of
the verge but it's also kind of stands
alone as its own as its own thing here
here it is right here it's a responsive
design which is extremely exciting which
is you may imagine as a sign of things
to come now I think a lot of people are
looking at the design thinking like oh
is this it is the verge going to move
towards a design like this and you know
honestly what we did for the video hub
was what's the best experience we can
create for video because it's a very
different experience than the type of
content we do on the site like in text
or feature layout or if you lay out or
whatever so um I think that that this is
a definitely kind of a nod to a to a
future design but uh we're not going to
lose the threat of what we've been doing
in design on the on the main site like
there's a lot of stuff there that we
really love and whatever we're going to
do is it's going to make it better and
we have a bunch of plans and a bunch of
stuff we're working on right now that's
going to improve the site this was a
project that took a few months and for a
few months of work like our product team
just killed it you need to return an
amazing I mean this to me is like I
like when I'm looking at it's like a who
almost like a hulu level experience at
Bob we're still I mean our video player
still has like issues that I addressed a
little bit in comments on this post man
up cuz you like people you're still
using this video player and it's like
well you know we do have to make money
on ads so if you want to subscribe for
twenty dollars a month if every reader
would like to subscribe for twenty
dollars a month I think we could
probably get rid of the we could
probably sees you too if and I could get
a new card I'll need a personal
guarantee of a of a renew AAA Auto
renewing can't cancel cannot cancel the
subscription from every person who
visits the site that's it that's all so
upside is nice little segue you just get
high too is YouTube just once that's
where the segue just launched paid
channels yeah starting at 99 cents a
month that's right we could
theoretically do this we could do a pay
channel on YouTube but uh you know the
problem with YouTube is they have look
for a Content producer they have pretty
bad revenue splits trip you know if
you're like a single person or a small
group or you're already you've already
got like tons of money you don't
necessarily need to worry about
monetizing your video content this game
will technical for everybody on the
cyberspace but um then it's it's
actually great and YouTube's amazing as
a platform it's obviously awesome yeah
but uh when you are a publisher with
like you know we have a large video team
and a lot of video product you so you're
spending a lot of money on it and you
have to have you know an enormous amount
of subscribers an enormous amount of
repeat visitors to begin to make it and
we have a pretty good amount on YouTube
but it just doesn't just doesn't match
up but from the consumers perspective
like the idea that I can I mean this is
like the ala carte dream right be able
to pay 99 cents a month yes what the
board of it what are the channels well
right by the way I just was like on the
train over here when this happened so
let me just like read you a handful is
this and some of them really make sense
one is like Sesame Street which back you
a sense is my jam doc you Rama but the
channel Channel documentaries I'm
literally just gonna start at a and just
start okay let's hear we got acorn TV
baby first plus okay big think mentor
was like big star movie come on this is
all like I don't less like if you turn
that on in the middle of the night and
you're you're like kind of zoned out and
you're just watching it is it freaks you
out what is it it's just like it's just
like animals sleeping so so on Lauren
I'm
one time Lauren I we put on it was like
Sunday morning we were like out you know
partying the night before into a little
bit hungover and we put on some channel
that is it's just like really nice music
with like animals doing things like baby
animals doing things it's obviously for
toddler yeah but it was like this is the
perfect yet a little bit hungover thing
to watch it was like gentle music with
like animals swinging for like monkeys
like baby monkey swinging from trees
like let's baby baby dolphins swimming
and so you would pay 99 cents a month
for now first plum absolutely not ok ok
what else out so far you've read a
single channel as well so this is the
problem and I'm not going two ways I can
you tell me the problem is content yes I
can't in a stunning twist I'm having
trouble look John no I mean there there
a few that are one called guys night in
like I don't even know what that is and
I don't I'm fine with it hope it's there
sexy I assume it guys night in uh what
else could it be yeah I don't know go on
but like the thing for me is this this
would be awesome it seems like a really
good way to do like backlogs of TV shows
yeah what it's like 99 cents a month you
get like the whole run of you know
breaking bad or whatever and you can
subscribe for her or just watch it okay
or whatever it's actually I just really
remembered something else sorry but keep
going it i will talk about after this i
thought of a topic that one I don't know
I interrupted you huh but it like it
there's all sorts of cool things this
could be I guess but I don't know like I
mean if ABC would let me to subscribe to
ABC programming for 99 cents a mile
right but I don't know I doubt or or AMC
i would pay what are the what are the
rates do they go up it's 99 cents and I
hear something like five level for this
way if if if AMC had a channel that was
like let's say 499 a Monday one before
99 I would it be it would be it loaded
it for free Friday night yes for talk to
you can okay at least 19 am so HBO day
but okay if AMC and FX and HBO but
they're not doing this now what that is
like oh they had 15 channels over 10
bucks a month right yeah i mean i would
see a real future for my cable box going
away then it would be at least 20 month
in probably 30 month realistic yeah and
then there's like you know ESPN again i
would want it by a 20 I'd say 20 month
for HBO it's like I think it's cool
I think for for some people who've been
like they're all these crazy stories was
a guy Fred the like children's producer
guy who made the weird kids content and
away fans I literally don't know what
you're talking there the guy did you did
you did you actually just invest our
YouTube show car the red yeah I don't
know what you're talking about uh well
that's yeah another one bites the dust
but anyhow so so the log short of it is
you can pay for it to subscribe now do
you still get ads I don't actually know
that's an interesting question well I'd
like to know the answer to that and
there's a 14-day free trial which is
cool yeah but free trial on baby's first
you know baby's first internet or
whatever it is yeah is there any channel
on there that I want hey Tommy you guys
have computers and I don't how about how
about I amplify yoga that sounds not
like something I want Laugh Factory VIP
here it is mm-hmm what else there's a
there's a personal defense premium okay
ben popper would want to UFC select hmm
okay now that's easy I wouldn't want
that but but I could see how somebody
would want right there's a golf digital
Golf Academy that's sort of what is
digital golf yeah I guess you learned is
that a golf really I don't know yes that
would be so quick i would tell nat geo
yeah is that their programming natgeo
cannot geo kids well this is a pretty
amazing this is a total google move by
the way yeah it's a total half-ass like
beta move like yeah we're beta testing
this in public we've got some channels
like whatever work they don't can you
are there any channels that you can
subscribe to that are like hot now can
you subscribe to the verge on youtube
now we can't for fri blame you you can
subscribe to you can't subscribe and you
should and you get it hot youtube
content delivered directly to your
youtube inbox so there you box this is
sort of cool so this is from this is
from the post that addy wrote about it
says infamous be movie producer and
director roger corman has announced that
he will launch a page channel this
summer okay with his Studios library of
around 400 films long introductions
interviews that's cool we're watching
we're watching mystery science theater
3000 lines nice that shows so it really
holds up I would pay that what's the
whole know they have a street sign
RiffTrax yeah refresh yeah but but I
we're watching like the classic really
good really wait that's the same thing
yeah yes
people that's crazy maybe some
additional people i don't know that okay
what other topics do we have so
youtube's a thing uh-huh so Google glass
is the next thing on my list here glass
holes which i've discovered i can't say
i can't say glass Google add a little
bit of a mouse funny I don't want to
spoil it we're gonna have a very
interesting at least I think I'm biased
but I think it's a very interesting
you're saying about your bias your bias
I am buyer so nasty yeah episode of top
shelf coming up yeah I talk about class
and I don't spoil it but I will say that
I am how should I put it underwhelmed by
the product so I think the thing about
the product is first off I thought the
Timberlake thing that we did was really
a great example of why you would want
hands-free lots of to photography and
like just see what you're seeing and
take a picture of it or a video I think
that's great so by the way we're I don't
know if you guys noticed but we're doing
this series where I'm now talking to you
the viewer I think I am we're we're
we're looking at Google glass as in
different scenarios you know we we
talked about doing a review and I just
think it's not a consumer product right
now it's an explorer they haven't really
given us a release window or a price for
consumers and i think that the final
product is going to be a little bit
different so what we thought would be
really interesting is let's let's use
this thing in all sorts of different
scenarios and let's see what it's like
what is the experience does it add does
it add is it subtract is it you know
does it change it and so I'm really been
liking we did a couple we're gonna do a
bunch more yeah lot of people could hear
some here's some stuff here which I look
this actually looks really cool to me
yeah I have to say so Sam sheffer who
went to the concert wrote the thing I
saw his first draft it was like my
videos better than the people on their
iphone 5 and I like left him a comment
was like there's no way this is true and
he showed it to me in like it looks
really good it is actually really good
and um except for I don't know what I
don't eat a face for somebody's trying
to get the lights yeah this actually
looks great yeah and I was really cool
you actually genuinely doofy what's
what's so proud what's so awesome about
this and I just have to say I've talked
about this a bunch is this idea of
you're watching and this is such a
generational thing but this like instant
nostalgia that we have where you go to a
concert you're watching the concert well
instead of watching the concert you pick
up your phone and you hold it in front
of your eyes and you're filming the
concert or not and
and and then or your iPad and then you
take that and you go and you put it
somewhere and you watch it your leg
remember are the concert but like you
don't actually remember the concert you
remembers that you recording the concert
while you're watching so your your whole
memory of it is like this phone in front
of you yeah right and like hitting
record and like making sure your shots
good and it's actually kind of sucks
because if you ever gone to a concert
and just experience the concert it's
great that's what they're there for yeah
but your experian goes experience so I
have to say this is a place where Google
glass makes a huge amount of sense yeah
um got it is a mouthful isn't it right
the problem is that if you're in a mosh
pit yeah it's gonna fall off your face
you really get really dating yourself
now if you're in mosh pit I just wear
what a train concert later concert
Slayer you don't even know about train
really ya know people are tried it I
don't know pressed flowers against one
another I don't know people everybody's
hugging very hard every hugging and
questioning where they went wrong and I
they ended up the Train concert um sorry
train they used a UH bad um so i don't
know i don't think people who listen to
Slayer need to worry about wearing
Google glass in a mosh pit for a number
of reasons but but mostly because they
would definitely not wear them and look
you take your glasses off you get in the
pit you know I'm saying take it from
experience system off yeah these and
we're live by Josh Topolsky take glasses
off to get the pic yet the day get the
picture i love someone anyhow that's a
kid rock lyric and i'm depressed and I
said I so moving on oh so google apps or
anything else we want to talk about good
no I mean I kind of agree i'm like sort
of underwhelmed there's all sorts of
cool stuff it could be big dreams and
there's almost talk afterwards about
your disappointment I just think here's
the deal it's hard to imagine Google
glass is a viable thing until it doesn't
look like Google glass right that's it
like I want to I want to use it but i
will not where you just wanted if you
know your eyeglass there's no
possibility yes if they were like we can
take your glasses same glasses and put
google glass in there I'd like that's
awesome let's do that yeah uh if they
look like Google glass that's not
awesome red eye and I said you know I
said this in the the first when we did
our feature on it
who would wear these things I get why
you'd wear them i get places where you
wear them playing with your kids you
know mountain biking maybe at a concert
sure you know their specific places I
one wear to dinner I don't wear out and
about on the street you know just
they're not cool well the thing is like
not only are you aware of it at all
times like everybody you're with is
aware that at all times and it becomes
this like every time I've worn it out
every spectrum with is always like kind
of staring creepily at my head right
what right now and I'm worried I'm not
worried about people taking pictures
that I don't want them to take because
like I kind of just feel like anybody
could deal with their phone right now
right I mean yes lately less discreet
but it's still fairly discreet to take a
picture with your phone and you do the
like oh I'm typing a text message in
front of my face oh you do that you're
really sneaky / now would never even
thought to do that disgust me that you
would actually say that out loud i'm
typing uh but uh but but i think it's
just until they get cooler this to me is
like it's like this a SmartWatch like I
kind of love the idea of a SmartWatch
but I just don't think that anybody's
made a really cool smart watch that I
would want to wear right that's true
however I think that even the dorky
smartwatches you can get away with
wearing and people don't really think
twice about it they might say oh that's
a weird watch but it's not what is that
it's feel like it looks like a digital
watch right right and these don't look
like a pair of class and never been like
goofy digital watches for forever right
so people are sort of you so in fact
like it's a fashion thing that you have
like a crazy digital watch like I
remember years ago I had some insane
watch that would like you could it would
scroll text on it what was the name of
that wall over puter was it as a Seiko
know and have the joystick had like no I
had like one buttons along the side it
was kind of long and it did oh my god i
wish i could find this watch christie i
bought in Japan I remember that what was
the brand I can't think of the brand
right now I'm dying you have to figure
we gotta figure it out where I'm dying
cuz I remember being so into it's not
like awesome like in my rave days you
know when I was DJing yeah and I think I
was actually in Japan DJ and I saw this
while I was like oh my god yeah and I
gotta wear the hell out of it I don't
know where it is not pretty much threw
in the garbage it's probably worth a lot
of money I bet it's in a box somewhere
in my house I should find it um okay so
Google glass I think we all agree yeah I
don't think
here's the thing people are like making
such a big deal out of google glass
number one it's not available yet right
we and it won't we don't know all you
don't know I mean they said when I
talked them they were like end of the
year and then Schmidt said Eric Schmidt
something like next year yeah there's no
price point there's no release date we
don't know what's going on maybe they
died oh they'll tell us seems like that
logically they might say here's what's
going to happen at I oh yeah well the
great header here's what's gonna happen
and they're gonna say that I know
everybody's really hoping that they're
gonna give glass to everyone at i/o cuz
they always give out stuff they always
have cool swag oh yeah Big hope is
they're gonna give glasses ever have and
I try to see that i owe the developers
going i are going to get a glass a pixel
and an LTE nexus 4 guaranteed by the way
there's an LG nexus for TLC matches for
that's gonna be tough for me to know one
we're gonna find you like sobbing on the
streets of san fran I just kind of wish
now I mean now now that I've used this
the only thing I'm really missing I'm
not only missing anything fun fine yeah
at this point I've just that's it just
like get vine on Android that's not
Google's problem yeah I think given at I
don't have I don't have a desire I don't
have a strong desire to own a nexus 4 at
this point now that I have this even if
it has that's here I think it's a better
phone the design is just amazing yeah
it's way faster in my opinion yep yeah
by the way i was listening I have to say
I as listen to music on this I know I'd
like I know should talk beats all the
time these speakers do sound speakers on
there or reduce add does a pretty good
yeah boom done got a better maybe saying
I was flying recently and a flight
attendant middle-aged guy was like I'm
thinking about getting that of the s4
and I was blown away by just as you know
he seemed like a regular dude basically
and we got into a big conversation about
it I was and this is the maybe I think
someone else asked me about this phone
when I was using it I think that they're
they're actually making a little bit of
an impact with the advertising on this
yeah I've had a bunch of people ask me
the same question it used to be like
should I get an iphone or should I get
the game cs3 and now people like I hear
that one phone is pretty yeah I I I
really love it I yeah I mean while
they're like everybody's you know super
down on the HTC first which apparently
sold they said like less than 10,000 and
is now you can get from 99 cents on a
two-year contract it's a phone from a
different you know it's a phone from a
time
when you know you really had to compete
with the iphone and when you still have
to do with the eye you still can be with
the iphone but exactly i mean is a
generational thing I think I we go down
this rabbit hole talking about Facebook
and where it's jen weird fits
generationally but i do feel like they
have a sort of a similar problem to
apple right now where they they seem
like they're just from from a few years
ago that was like there's a time let's
be clear I'm not that Apple's not going
to i believe by the way I'm we should
maybe talk about this little but I am
highly excited about wdc which is in
June I know we're not going to talk
about it but I'm like I just feel like
this this is gonna be a fan I 17 yeah
the guy OS 7 is gonna be I'm really
hoping that it is it blows me away all I
want is to be blown away by something
like I want you to show me why your
Apple yeah yeah show me why you do it
better how do you do it better right and
show me there I mean they're not making
any effort to temper the ground swell of
belief that iOS 7 is going to be a
really big deal at WWDC right which
leads me to believe that it is going to
be this is the time when we'd normally
start seeing leaks like you know ios7 to
not be a huge range from iOS 6 and we
haven't seen any of that okay I mean
here's here's just you know I expect
this should be a big leap for them i
hopes in terms of like how their OS
functions and looks it kind of needs to
be too because i feel like everybody's
not on the side and if it's not
everybody's gonna make like snot it's
like I don't know what they've been
doing yeah well yeah if it's not what's
gonna happen is that yourself 50 million
iphone 5s is well that's not gonna
happen have you got let's let's be real
I'm we're gonna uh night Johnny I've I'm
not questioning either I'm not
questioning I think it aware about sales
I'm talking about innovation and
software design as sales are fine that's
great apples gonna do well good for them
they're gonna they're gonna make a nice
profit I'm happy and I'm excited for
them for them to do that but you need
your mind I think they make look I'm
dying to get a new computer I'm waiting
to get a new air I hope they have some
new air right there ya know but serious
I don't want a Retina you just wanted AI
want a fast computer that's small as you
Jeremih gonna air with the dollar
process do not care about the right of
this play I mean they got an issue the
future I'd be great if it were like
super duper fast and was not Jen one but
like Jen one apple stuff is like you
might want to wait till gen 2 and I yeah
do that my computer's totally failing my
battery's dying out my name is bad super
duper buggy I have to say by the way um
I'm really not psyched about the the
direction that Apple has gone with a lot
of the things they've done recently like
the app store on on OS 10 I mean I just
I've been using this app slingshot and
which is a screen capture utility and I
know most people don't need these things
but I do and you know they moved it to a
minute it's an app store app and they
had to do a bunch of changes in the
latest version that basically broke it
and it's there definitely without going
into great detail the reasons that it
was broken is definitely because of
apple's new rules about how you can do
certain things and not do certain things
and it makes me really upset and
disappointed that i have to change my
workflow and change things that I'd
become comfortable with because Apple
has decided to make these like draconian
arbitrary stupid like don't mess with
our own ass rules which sucks and makes
me disappointed in them as a company so
I hope that like I hope that there's
some new stuff that really can get me
excited about what they do in software
again because I don't think that there I
don't think that the last couple of
years have been particularly inspiring I
just want better notifications like I'll
take anything else just fixing oh yeah
we got out we got on an apple that's all
I want okay let's let's talk about
Amazon okay amazon actually is like
doing stuff negative we know about
they're making may affect their making
like all kinds of crazy so they do so
first of all they're making the this is
the wall street journal reporting this
today that Amazon is working on a phone
which we've kind of been hearing for
forever yeah didn't cover some amazon
phone stuff yes yeah long time ago
didn't doing talk explicitly about it we
basically broke the news that this was
happening right yeah it's not this but
there's been you know it's in the news
isn't really broken until it's handed to
the wall street journal pipeline come by
a company yeah uh but so the UM the news
here or the report here is that the
phone may have a 3d display awful idea
uh and that there's another phone one
with the glasses free 3d display and
there's gonna be a already one that you
requires glasses apparently this is
stupid Wall Street Journal's doesn't
talk and one well so they did couch all
of this and saying basically it's
prototypes they've built all this stuff
but the i'm sure people got all kinds of
crazy products
probably an actual blood phone that
looks like a banana somewhere in the
Amazon since I possible is open and a
phone I tracking is apparently a big
part of the whole thing and then they're
also well I supposedly when I tracking
is done by the galaxy s3 info just
horrible in the note horribly oh and the
other thing they're supposedly making is
set top box which we reported a while
ago yeah and a an audio-only streaming
device which is basically like an iPod
which seems like not a great time to be
building an ipod it's funny i am but i
don't know i mean it's listening to some
of apple's greatest hits from their
commercials it had some good music and
those yeah and I was like remember when
this was like really really like whoa a
new apple commercial and its got like a
fungus on your like what is this this is
awesome I gotta buy one that has a shame
they got away from those that's the
silhouettes dancing to music it was were
the best no but but even the reason uh
commercials have had good music in them
like the the first commercial for the
retina 15-inch retina blew my mind and I
like bought it I went out and bought the
album what was the what was the museum
uh that's a Canadian EDM group I can't
remember their name I don't remember
that at all yeah I'll pull it up um
anyhow but so Amazon yeah why why would
anyone ever by an Amazon smartphone this
is what I understand oh I saw a guy with
a kindle on that funnily enough on the
train today guy with a kindle just like
the Kindle is out um fire I'm sorry yeah
and uh I don't just depressed me they
just did it just died yeah somebody with
a playbook and like I was holding today
I'm sorry it's not it's not it's not a
full feature tablet I mean it yeah it's
missing a bunch of stuff that like you
would want and it to have an Android
tablet doesn't do gmail and and uh you
know it just feels upsetting I agree um
you know you can't do play store on it
it's just well so that's what what I
think makes the nook so interesting now
write the note weren't David things the
Nook is terrible though well it a
terrible day so I have one sitting on my
desk and they claim they've fixed all of
the problems that I originally had with
it yeah which were basically that it's
slow and the software is horrible I
don't really know how they fixed that if
they have we installed apex launcher but
if they have it could be super
compelling because they're selling it I
yeah I just my appetite for skin stuff
is like really right I mean I have to
say she did a couple things good here
but usually like the things that they
did it looks nice so it's not that big
of a deal but basically often gets in
the way of just doing what you want to
do the thing with the Nook is like
they're selling it right now for
Mother's Day for a hundred and seventy
nine dollars for the HD Plus and it's
like a nine inch 1080p screen and just
get that a nice on at nine 1080p screen
nobody cares but nobody knows nobody
who's buying the new cares about that
unless they're gonna there unless
they're gonna go hack it fair no
basically explained they're gonna wipe
it and put on like a real version and
I'm convinced that's the those are all
the other car who have ever bought yeah
and I've seen a bunch people yeah not
and and I just think that it's a tough
sell yeah it's a really tough sell
especially when you've got amazon right
you know I'm sorry I just it's like
right the addition of the Play Store is
probably not enough for most people like
oh the Play Store they don't know what
that is right it's like oh it has more
apps i guess maybe that would be a thing
but i don't know i think that it's just
a really hard sell yeah but the end but
the thing amazon has going for it is
just like all of that content and I was
actually I was thinking about the the
ipod thing could be kind of cool if you
get like us because they have audible
and they have the mp3 store which is a
lot and like there's actually some value
there I guess but I still can't figure
out why I would ever buy I don't LED
smart here are things that your things
that i've determined that i want and
need in my life in my digital life Wow
should like write this down you get a
note okay get a note i'm ready google
keep let's do this no here's what here's
what I've here's what I've come to
understand is you know basics so you
have to have a phone that's no question
it and I think it's you know it's got to
be a smart phone yep right yep unless
you're Paul Miller uh who's back on the
internet and still doesn't have a smart
he'll don't worry he's gonna get her on
her she's gonna get one give me time he
just got back it's like what's he been
doing it like it's been like eight days
or something yeah but like um come on
get up smartphone yeah I have to have I
think you still really need to have a
laptop I mean some people get away with
an ipad and a keyboard but in terms of
productivity I slowed way down I mean
when I'm dealing with Twitter and email
and the web that those three things slow
way way down and chat like any kind of
chat slows way down even on an android
tablet where you can have
you know where it's obviously a lot of
stuff isn't for me is native like gtalk
or whatever so I think you have to have
a laptop I think a tablet is still a
luxury I think it's still not
necessarily something you need to have I
don't really look at my tablet very much
I really I really don't it's in a while
it's just sort of there I found what so
at one time I had an ipad miss is just
browsing RTI looking for this this Apple
music um when I when I had a nexus 4 is
my primary phone i used the crap out of
my ipad mini because I there were enough
ios-only apps that I was interested in
that I was staying up yeah with those on
that but now that I'm on back on an
iphone 5 I never use a tablet it's weird
well I can get there were apps you want
to use you couldn't use that make sense
I just find that for what I'm doing nine
times out of ten I either need a phone
or a laptop and the tablet doesn't come
into play and we're sort of unique in
that like this goes with me everywhere I
am and for most people like they leave
their computers at the office I feel
clinical I feel crippled when i'm using
the tablet I do too I feel like
literally like I can't do things I need
to do and I can't do them fast enough
and that may just be that i'm old and
I'm used to a real multitasking in the
way that it works on a computer but I
just feel basically like I'm in in
quicksand or in mud when i'm using a
tablet no matter how fast and great the
tablet is then um and then I think like
and so those are the two things that I
feel like I really want and need with me
like no question right just those two i
mean i have an ipad mini and i love it
and i think like if I'm gonna have a
tablet is going to be an ipad mini it's
not going to be an Android tablet at
this point in time this juncture uh and
then what I really want is a box that
does two things I want a box that can
stream content from my devices any
device and play content off of it onto
my television okay or stereo way because
i have my apple TV that's only one thing
though right that's one box that's one
box notice it's only like one thing you
wanted to do you want it to stream from
i want to stream I wanted to stream from
my devices to the TV or I wanted to
stream from the bit the box itself got
it like which is what the apple TV
basically does I haven't hooked up my
stereo and my television so if I want to
listen to music
I just kick it on and play some music
from you know I can play it from my
phone yeah to the apple TV or whatever
but it doesn't work cross-platform
obviously and it doesn't have any apps
on it so I can't use Amazon can't stream
amazon content onto you know I have so
to me like that's the missing piece of
all of this ecosystem south we talk well
the really frustrating airplay is the
only still the only protocol that's
really managed to pull this off in any
meaningful way why is that I was just
gonna ask that in like it there's
miracast America everybody's trying as
opposed to be but this you don't there's
no miracast device is just that nobody
supports a you know there are miracast
devices but a part of the problem I
think is that iOS on a very fundamental
level has built in this concept of like
if you're sending audio audio out of the
application needs to go into this thing
that allows you to select where the
audio is actually going in Android that
doesn't exist so audio just goes to you
know the speaker the headphone if you
have a headphone plug right there isn't
like a selector like a default but they
get built in a selector they could build
and no one's stopping them that's right
but it beyond a nap I at basis unless
it's built into like it I want already
on Spotify to build in a sin to airplay
from my remote from this and then I'm
basically done the first thing is that
yeah yeah if i'm not mistaken there's an
app in the in the Play Store that allows
you to turn an android phone into an
airplay receiver right that doesn't help
me it doesn't help anyway why why would
anyone ever want that exactly let me
send things from my laptop and play them
on the screen in arrears 500 results
Apple TV airplay media player no that's
the thing that kills me is i have so i
get i play a lot of set-top boxes and i
have in the last like three months
bought both an apple TV and a rope says
we can use you can use between the two
it's perfect writing everything I want a
finality beam content from your Android
phone to an apple TV it seems like a
total lie probably dollars what's the
rating and one doesn't work six people
have installed it three and a half stars
that's not a good sign yeah that's
almost four no I'm sorry four and a half
no three and a half wait how many sorry
yeah yeah no but this is the problem
like this is there need to just be a
standard like right and by the way you
know because amazon has all the rest of
it right all the stuff you want to
street is fine oh my gosh I have my iPad
handy i can do the main thing I want to
do which is like when I'm hanging or
hanging out or if we have people over or
whatever I want to listen to music I
just right play it on the ipad and it
goes over to the apple TV and you're
done you know but what I can't do is
what I want to watch amazon content I
have to turn on my xbox or the Roku
right you know it's like the Roku needs
a channel that lets you beam stuff to it
from any device like that's what it
right roku receipts it wasn't airplay
supposed to be an open standard 10 thing
now i don't think so i think everything
there like that is amy well yeah that's
a yeah just like FaceTime every time
we're happening like you said it on
stage yeah Geoff Johns like we want
everybody's we're gonna open its give me
an open standard this was like four
years ago what three years ago like just
nothing just we lied we're liars he was
huge liars that goes back to our
promises no big deal I would love it a
facetime were an open standard yeah I
would love it by the way would kill
skype why don't they do it yeah I would
have the support of voice only mode
which they could easily do yeah of
course you're gonna do vau video and
voice you can do voice yeah turn but but
skype killer what happened Apple could
have owned the standard yes good we need
to kill skype that well they scheduled
me feel skype is owned by my stupid
skype is that my skype is owned by
microsoft and if I'm yeah it doesn't
mean maybe maybe Microsoft went to them
and was like listen if you do facetime
as an open standard it'll hurt our
product and we have a lot of
partnerships and wouldn't be that great
so actually I think about think about I
mean that's fair Microsoft could like
they could close off a big part of the
universe to Apple if they've well or
they really really won't create relation
look Apple and Microsoft are now
basically like buddies united against
Google true right I mean when you look
at the landscape you they're not apples
not worrying about pcs or Windows Phone
devices right they're really not at all
the word I don't worry about the surface
right they're worried about it at Google
yeah and you know who else worried about
Google with their office there you know
workplace products in there and there
and Google like the search thing and
Google's that and the search thing no no
no that is now the Bing has cloud
experts I think that we're back not none
of this makes sense now that being has
clout experts is a phrase that does not
compute in my brain
they take him over yeah I'm just like
what horse ebooks is a verified cloud
experts and as for 78 anyway yeah on
pyramids alright so so so next topic uh
so the next topic is Adobe moving a lot
of their stuff to a subscription model
think this is rich i think is gonna be
yes i think it's great i think it's
awful it's not it's the expression no it
should be an option and it was before
and now it's not I think Rob well I
don't get it I mean to be honest with
you like hears the prayers the problem I
like the vibe you don't have to pay a
thousand dollar zero dollars a month for
photoshop on this machine and that's
because I bought it ok keep using it
yeah but I'll never catch it that again
I can't upgrade to another version of
Photoshop how long is that version of
Photoshop you in Alaska what version is
it cs6 what are they on oh well that's
the recurrent no it's not yes he has six
is current that's right yeah six is
returning for me is like but but you see
you'll have a couple of years with that
good for you no news 5 cs5 cs6 is the
news so i wanted to i recently need to
use illustrator and i was like oh I
gotta go buy it and I was like oh boy
that's a lot of money and i'll probably
end up paying more money to like to you
know subscribe now but it's definitely
like in installments and i can stop
whenever I want your 360 dollars a year
right is that right I don't know it's
it's 33 bucks a month or something so
more than 3 30 like 400 bucks a
year yeah for illustrator or you could
just pay 400 hours like once yeah for or
I just torrent it and call it a day I
guess I'm saying you should dude I just
think that if you or that I I think
there are a lot of people who need to
use it for a little bit and then don't
need using a while sure if you're not
using your writing I think it should be
an option i think going all subscription
is a little weird yeah but look the
markets changing you know so you gotta
lie down anything anymore ownership is
so played you know what's just glad this
is ownership to point out there heading
into the hanging out no big deal to
think the thing from originating point
out that's good yeah I feel the same way
about this that I do about office being
aa subscription-only not in Amazonia
which is that like I don't need new
features like honestly I need all of the
features of like photoshop cs3 and
nothing else and I get it for like
designers and stuff tho those people use
photoshop rats don't need anywhere near
good no Photoshop Express magus a I'll
say this about Photoshop I've tried all
the competitors yeah I shop photoshop is
the best it's not even there are things
that are annoying about it but is pretty
angry and you know I was gonna say that
you I could even in Salt Lake Photoshop
like five or six not see us but just
five points to the point i would be fine
but in cs4 they started adding the
context-aware features and those
actually were a game changer so like
every once in while they do something
they're like oh my god i do need this
feature but i want to be able to upgrade
and pay for it i don't want to be on the
subscription cycle when do they when
does this go into effect I don't know
what's the day do they I think it's
pretty immediately of june seventeenth
pretty close though yeah and some pretty
close basically pretty much all right
what else uh well don't worry to get
through these two i know seriously where
we're rolling here talking pushback top
shelf of that we should talk about this
this big ancestry feature yeah so Laura
did large June uh did he may have heard
of her I me may have heard of her she's
great on Twitter she is great huh Laura
underscored you that's right Laura
underscore June some people get that
we're not to be confused Laura's she did
a big feature on what you know it's
interesting when when and it was like a
law it was like it's took a long time to
put this together because I think it
started as one thing and sort of turned
into something else and what it turned
into was I think a really interesting
point which is through technology and
science we have basically solved like
we've solved something that has been a
outstanding item of interest for
thousands of years forever which is like
where where do I come from right who is
my family where did they where did this
all start you know for me like what's my
personal story about where I came from
and and and what its what's looking like
now is because of and also like weirdly
like religious groups like the Mormons
have done a huge amount of work and you
know look you know I'm on atheist so I'm
not the can't cheer on religion
typically but they've done an enormous
amount of work and let made it public
right so that people can trace their
ancestry and and and what it's looking
like now is that we're going to get to a
point in the next few years where
basically you can like spit into a thing
and like send it off somewhere or maybe
even just like plug it into it you know
USB port on your
shooter and uh you'll just know
instantly who you're related to and
where your family line goes back I mean
you have to have a lot of people doing
it right but it's a kind of crazy idea
that before you had to go put all these
pieces together now it's like if that
data is there if those markers are there
it just you could just tap into it well
the notion in her piece that really
baked my noodle is said hold on what I'm
hungry I could go for that's some big
that a phrase can you say that is
anything it's in the major matrix yeah
uh you know it's really gonna bake your
noodles would you have broken in the
she's talking about him breaking them
yeah okay I take it back go on she might
say cook your noodle um cook no no it's
baked it's damn sure yeah there are by
the way there are big there are big
noodles like like Google i believe which
is like kind of a Russian or Jewish I
don't know if it's like right it's like
a dish it does have baked noodles in it
yeah they're like you make the noodles
then you bake them yeah I'm pretty
hungry a lot of casserole yeah
casseroles right um oh god I'm so hungry
right now I gotta go to this like
chinese place across the street and just
go to town go on um so yeah what really
interested me about the piece was the
fact that she at the end she kind of
makes the point that you know with
Facebook with everybody in the world on
facebook billion people in the world in
facebook in a few decades or a few
centuries this whole concept of tracing
ancestry isn't going to exist right is
that David trees just gonna be there
that habibi like the life event where
it's like I had you and you're like oh
now I know yeah the hobby will be kind
of eradicate right away just as the
technology is getting good enough to be
able to do this kind of thing yeah it's
kind of obvi aided by Facebook right so
here's my question late on it is i don't
know if i can answer who cares like I
honestly mean this like and and I've had
a lot of Wow conversations about this
with like have you ever asked Laura that
question no no cuz she's probably scare
me actually kill me but like it's the
grand scheme of like what real actual
knowledge am i gaining from this well I
think what real knowledge can you gain
for I've learned some amazing things you
know laura has done my family tree
extensively and her tree extensively and
I've London I mean what can you learn
from the past what can you learn about
how people live nothing what can you
learn about people how people
lived in where your family came from
what kind of struggles they had I don't
know I think you can learn a lot from
that I think you can learn a lot about
the person you you are in the
environment you grew up and I don't
think that I mean yes it's true that
some some some people don't have that
you can't see like some direct lineage
back to the your ancestors you know like
oh yeah obviously they were you know
they were immigrants who came here in
the 1800s oh no wonder I ended up doing
it right but I look at my family and I
think like yeah obviously I know why my
family is the way we are and where we
came from and and I mean I have this
sense of we came from a place that very
specific play surrounded by a very
specific group of people we came to a
very specific place in America and ended
up doing certain things and being
certain ways because of that I think
that's really interesting for hundreds
of years everyone your family has been
an editor and she has been editor in
chief / DJ tek tek writer and has
appeared on late night right for for
literally five hundred years um DJ yeah
i mean in the 1700s in Bessarabia
Bessarabia in it which is like in the
Ukraine or Russia or some air weird
that's a real place um but there was a
DJ DJ david in did you like Igor DJ igor
Topolsky was on the ones and twos course
the ones and twos were made of wood and
a pedal-powered right everything was
very quiet everything was very quiet
there weren't actually records they were
just stone harpsichord plates just
played with the grooves in them and they
were very simplistic but still up and
you just stole it sir don't having a
heavy for for me to keep everybody move
it sounds Rob anyhow there's going to be
an awful from whence you vm DJ igor
Topolsky i'm awaiting the tour the
torrent of photo shops any other Kesha
but yeah so I think what yo who cares i
agree like there is a there is stuff
like sometimes Laura goes down rabbit
holes and I'm like I don't know why I
don't know what to do with this you know
like she knows things about people that
seem useless to me sure well that's what
I one or two it's like what you don't
know me to know that I'm related to you
know George Washington are you I don't
know oh my god that's thank you probably
my god concern how can I one way can I
serve and you're only imagine isn't
there like a club for people that are
related to Thomas Jefferson's called
again Luminati dbag yeah
no is there club for people who related
Thomas Jefferson it's a thing yeah he
got a he got around he did everything
everyone's probably really oh yeah but I
think I think the thing is there stuff
to learn there's also stuff that's just
like kind of a not novelty but curiosity
you know there's just curiosities I mean
I just would be surprised that you
wouldn't hear at least one or two
stories that you thought like wow that's
kind of yeah that's sort of interesting
oh I didn't know that I believe that you
know yeah um so anyhow but you sure yes
you read the piece was an amazing video
go along with it ya ever really great
our video team has just been on fire
lately yeah but the other than I haven't
always been on fire the beginning of the
videos a little gross its disgusting not
gonna lie it is gross there's a lot of
soils like in 90 seconds left that's
pretty funny though yeah ultimately it's
like that nice a nice tight shot just he
hear it it's just guys it's really
Pleasant you sure here it is oh sure
we're gonna watch all right guys this is
like being like I'm oh this is skating a
topless by the way he writes for
BuzzFeed very good Ziff and and is also
my brother's fiance really yeah fun fact
fun fact you say that very late why
she's also ventured also an ancestry
hobbyist like a so she made a great
subject did she called herself a low at
a genealogist hobbyist like that is a
phenomenal I mean Laura's got like she
has so many I mean you wouldn't believe
this dakshina she's sure it's weird like
she's not you know originally part of my
family but knows so much about my family
so much more than I know like it's crazy
it's a little creepy it's just well I
mean she's part of the family now just
it's just I'm seen it was odd to tell
she's like your great Bullough blonde
she has an entire crate of DJ igor
Topolsky she has the whole collection of
his stone carving circular stone carving
records takes up an enormous amount of
space yeah no but it's interesting she's
discovered people my family didn't know
existed and connections and stuff that
it was just really wild so anyhow but
but that's all gonna go away people are
like her won't they won't need to do
what they do mm-hmm cuz they don't have
spit into something and boom you know
everything yeah that's kind of crazy
it's like in the matrix when you're like
when Dean yells like I know kung fu it
is gonna be like I know my ancestor yeah
which that you could do nothing with I
feel like we're every time joy that
toggle
and be a dbag I think mio was related to
Thomas Jefferson it was a point in that
movie were they precisely about that's
like the hidden message of the second
time I mean I'm a second time the matrix
has come up in this conversation so why
aren't people like super worried about
all the privacy and what the question is
all everybody's the ancestry is like
well first off what are the privacy
implications right that you know that
you're related to somebody dead people
don't care about that rifle can't but
it's just like II people cannot uh start
litigation sure konatsu yet dead people
don't sue wait I mean me about here to
verify that we don't that's true
actually he's gonna call in with
questions I think they're I think
they're also not capturing you know
23andme captures you a lot of your
personal information yeah but but to
just find the the the mark these certain
markers that these guys are looking for
that that in in ancestry that you might
be looking for or not ancestor ain't
necessarily but in genealogy rather yeah
you don't need to know it whether
somebody's gonna get Parkinson's fair I
guess you know that's the big use I see
there are things usually private there
i'm seeing a huge privacy concerns when
you think is like everybody's DNA is
gonna be collected and put into a big
database right but but be honest like
and I know there's an ongoing discussion
but do you really want to know that
you're going to get like some
debilitating disease in exactly 24 years
we do you really don't like they give
you that exact in but that they will
they will get to that point yeah they
can say like there's a ninety-seven
percent chance you're gonna have like XY
I definitely don't think I want i don't
think i want to know you there yeah I
mean I guess parents are dissipated with
kids play right let's argument but then
the argument is like are there things
you could do are their lifestyle changes
you can make maybe there's supplements
you could take me exercise for something
you know like everything yeah no but I'm
saying like if you're like likely to get
something but it's not a sure thing
there are ways you might be able to do
prevent my stuff and then you're like
okay i'm glad i found out yeah true
Thomas but I don't know still like you I
just feel like I'd rather not live with
the shadow of a diseased limb exami yep
leave the things that like you're
seventy-five percent likely to get
Parkinson's like you'd spend the rest
your life going like go ahead I is it
happening yeah so I happen you know
before you just feel like why what's
happening right you'd find out and Ryan
you'd be super depressed and then you'd
fight it and then you'd fight it and
then you'd win and then then you'd be
the king you would be
the King you be I heard that's what I
remains anyway it's not about parking
ticket I was sure we hide oh we were
just what possible reality we were not
could you possibly assume such a thing I
don't know he has like a thing in his
chest it could be anything who knows I
should probably eat a movie that's just
an idea had you do is talk about next we
talk about google i/o next cuz that's
where we're all going next week except
for Chris yes like deeply disappointed
everyone hates me everyone hates
everybody hates chris that's you're sure
that was on television our attendance is
like an area yeah right right it was
produced by him though right it written
there's a story of his life i believe so
people i am there's a lot happening in
the next like Google i/o the next month
is crazy but we got what's coming up
immediately as Google i/o google i/o is
NJ next week there's no yeah at ctia who
cares well and there's a there's that
there's a microphone that's like you're
you're you're sending me to this show
and tell him you don't care about it
proper to care less no I'm kidding but
it's been kind of a bummer for a while
ya know we've we've talked about it on
on the mobile choice it's gonna be a
dead so it's not spin a more time yes
yeah there let's talk about I oh yeah yo
be a beer oh yes uh so what can we
expect what do we think so first off
google is holding I out it's going to
happen next week we're going to be
covering it live we're gonna have live
video we're gonna have all sorts stuff
happening exclusive content interviews
who knows what it's and this is it hands
on is the first day this is Google's
biggest thing every year this is
Google's big event this is every year
they do one off but but this really is a
big deal for them yeah thousands of
developers thousands of people there
huge amounts of press they like really
go all out in at moscone center in in
beautiful downtown San Francisco I don't
know if that's considered downtown or
not honestly but and I don't know San
Francisco information but uh but so so
here's we think here what we think for
that I think we're gonna see there were
a lot of rumors about this new messaging
some kind of new messaging product we've
heard a ton of stuff about Apple is the
name week i babble if we don't see
something in this vein I would be very
surprised and I think that you know they
have there been leaks there have been
we've reported on it which is healing an
obvious is cool that the component of
whatever they're doing this component
their ecosystem messaging is really
important reading w
huge what about let's have a hardware
person do you think they'll be any new
hardware no I think that pixel well
there might be a variation the nexus 4
but but we've heard there's i guess i
don't know if we've heard this but what
maybe this is just what I'm hoping for
is a super high-res nexus 7 with like
the Nexus tens resolution to say i want
my neck 7-7 post 4.2 update sucks yeah i
got so sucks like really slow not good
no well has like the low-cost Tegra 3
right or whatever it's just not good
yeah stop defending it I'm scrolling is
awful on it so they disappointed I think
that that but all kidding aside I do
think that the pixel is going to
continue even that was announced several
months ago the story is continuing and
is going to continue through I oh and
there will be some announcement around
Chrome OS that will involve the pixel I
really I'll be honest with you I'm ready
for Chrome OS to graduate to something
more than whatever the scene between
state it's in it well it has to be the
merger with Android right like that has
to be the next guy they brought in
Dhahran charges though I don't think
that's necessarily true and I don't
think they're gonna turn it around this
quickly that's my gut could be maybe
they'll introduce some tablet apps you
can run I mean it would make sense you
can do tablet apps on the on the pixel
but isn't there some question about
multi touch on the screen is that is
that founded or unfounded the screen is
not multi-touch the pixel screen yeah I
think it's two fingers if i remember
correctly yeah but like not a lot that's
fine i like the idea but I mean you know
there are things about the pixel that I
heard about chromebooks in general like
I have two gmail accounts using two
gmail accounts on them is sucks yes it's
an it's not good like you can't oh it's
just bad in general this is not it does
not it's not a real computer it's almost
a real computer right there are things
it's like I'm so close like I just want
to use it I love it it's beautiful but
it's not a real computer yeah so I've
had I've had evan rodgers are our
resident like crazy hacker guy trying to
do all sorts of insane things on the pic
you like we he hackintosh tit at one
points was running OSX it was like the
perfect thing ever accept nothing more
use you called own x2 yeah so much heat
yeah well get ready I you so sorry I you
Scott OS x and then Neil I started
giving a hard time about it I was like
fine I'll called us 10 OS X is cool 10
is an actress I don't care anyway so but
then it's osos 10 10.8 or whatever it's
like what yeah OS X 10.8 it's a letter
what do they say an apple I me now over
the Apple let's ask phil schiller if you
yeah if you watch the keynotes the toes
done well then it's OS 10 guys sorry so
what about the X phone is the X phone
I'm gonna come that a thing I don't
think that's gonna be an IO thing I
really don't that feels like a
standalone event it also feels like yeah
there's more hype about it are we
excited about this I mean I'm excited
bout anything that's good so if it's
good that's awesome if it sucks that's
no good yeah maybe I mean yeah it's a
phone wise words is he gonna be a cool
phone or not a cool phone and like you
if it has incredible battery life and an
incredible display and it's super
durable like yeah awesome in the run
stock Android that's the best thing ever
I would totally be into that yeah but I
have a really good phone sitting here I
don't have feel any desire at this
moment to really upgrade I don't it's
the first time in a long time I'm just
gonna say I say one surprising I said
there's one thing that I really miss
when it's not it turns out not the big
of a deal is that you can't do light
flow on this so you can't have
multicolored notification light so this
does I think this does red orange and
green but you can't get it to basically
you can't get to even do like the red
orange green stuff like so it'll just
blink when you've got something going on
I'm like okay fine it's just like a
blackberry yeah but other than that I
mean I don't feel any strong desire to
upgrade you know the battery life is
okay on this it's not perfect but it's
it's better than my iphone 5 was uh and
I don't know if this is just me but my
iphone 5 like every week the battery
gets worse yeah yeah it's my it's like
my laptop is two batters totally right
now but I just think that I'm saying so
if they have an x-phone that's great if
there's an LTE nexus for like I
definitely would be interested in
checking it out but I think we're
reaching a point where you really have
to have something it you know and not
just a gimmick but there's got to be
some really compelling reason why I
would want to choose over this thing I
mean it's fast it's capable I feel like
I could definitely use this for the next
year and be fairly satisfied well I
think that this is the first year in
smartphone history where the the display
upgrades have been
pure gimmicks because if you look at
last year's round of 720p displays
particularly the one acts gorgeous
display I challenge any human being to
look at a 720p display vs that 1080p
display and tell me that they can tell
the difference I'm not I done now this
display looks incredible no does but so
does the One X and I think it looks
better than one ex I guess I will say
the difference to twinning areas I don't
I kind of agree with you about the One X
on the one but the difference between
the gs3 and the gs4 is huge and it's
like they also fixed a lot of the AMOLED
display stuff that's true that's just
that's been a long to come in I mean if
the gs4 had nicer hardware and better
software i would totally be interested
in it it's like if you want gs4 with
better hardware it software here it is
the HTC One I'm just waiting like I
can't really want to buy the unlocked
version of this but I really want to buy
the unlock black version of it and I'm
dying yeah dying to buy it yeah like
I've almost ready to pull the trigger on
the unlock just cuz I'm scared they're
gonna stop selling her to something but
like I really want a black fun
particularly because laura has the same
phone now and it's like I can so I
guarantee what's happening with the
black version guarantee you is that it's
black anodized and they're having
trouble durability guarantee you that's
the issue really i I'm post like the
iPhone yeah they didn't did I phones all
scuff I haven't seen by the black iphone
so it's completely beat to mine is
actually not bad no mines awful maybe
you treated like a baby boom I mean it's
like like boom like the pho wow that's
us look really good what are you doing
to your phone I just keep in my party
not doing to your phone yeah it was
actually do you not use this very often
yeah looking at these notifications I
just remember thinking about just
recently when I had my iPhone and I was
getting notifications and trying to deal
with yes like it's just so Incred what I
found is actually the main one of the
major sconce it for the first time ever
I'm sorry one of the main places i'm
actually just about it when i think
about what's funny i was like thinking
logically like where am i on my phone
most of the time i'm actually in my
notifications a ton yes but i'm actually
in and i think because of the way
android uh least 4.1 and up handles
notifications it's like yets good you
know does it in a way that SuperDuper
via I've learned to avoid notifications
on the iphone entirely and you just like
wait until there's a badge yum the app
yep and then you go into that and see
what's going on pronunciation
it's also crazy it's crazy how much like
the notifications become like the true
part of the phone you need interact yeah
because that's the stuff that's
happening everything else is like I want
to play it's also it's also it's also
it's the closest thing I think to
multitasking on a laptop where you're
able to switch quickly between
applications and you kind of like your
view view view with notifications you
kind of like can be an application can
get useful notification another
application it doesn't require you to be
fully invested necessarily in to get
getting out of the app that you're in
that's the port blackberry blue with the
hub is they like they have all of the
stuff that I want the layer you just the
layering is just it's it's like one it's
like one toke over the line like there's
too much there's too much trying to
create these mid middle places and not
enough of saying like there's there's a
there's the app there's the notification
and that's pretty much it but you don't
need to have this middle ground of likes
quasi notification / app right you know
yeah those two I don't think should live
together um are we talking about IO we
type of predictions so we think so you
think they're gonna give Google glass
people I think people say 1500 hours
last year who were all the developers
that were there are gonna flip out
because they had it like a couple of
months they had it for a couple of
months they're not even I'm sorry like
two weeks or three weeks and now they're
gonna give them to everybody or maybe
what if they just came out in this and I
get it still $1,500 but you can get it
today I think they'll say yet they're
gonna open it up to everybody there and
say maybe they'll reduce it'll say it's
a thousand bucks or something yeah but
everybody can get it right I mean cuz
then they have limited quantities I
don't remember they're they're built in
the US right is that the story with
these things oh is that true I don't
believe so just like the cube just like
the Nexus really the key oh just a
string like that I think I think they
have to address some Google at home
stuff I mean we I mean just um or
Android at home rather their their their
media situation is awful their TV
situation tryn to the TV world is awful
I mean if they were smart they'd buy
Roku yeah here's two things I would do
if I were Google by Roku by our do like
Timmy world seriously that's what me
everybody with a roku box then has it
has an android playback device yeah and
like a communication device like they
work over Wi-Fi network that's obviously
doable and Roku already has all of that
other stuff that they like they write
you could basically easily convert that
almost into a Play Store component yeah
um are do just great streaming
technology what it what are they buying
themselves with our do they're buying
themselves deals with driven
subscriptions right but but Google
Google can well they should launch at an
equivalent Spotify /r do uh subscription
I still shot know that don't know that
if they did that if they did that hears
only I here's interesting here would be
this is if I were running Google and I
was cared about that that segment of
like the television home entertainment
space by Roku announced a subscription
streaming plan for music and I announce
you know potentially subscriptions for
ya for TV stuff well so we we've heard
rumors I would just I would lose it that
happen we've heard rumors about Google
Music yeah being subscription about with
my Roku died I did pull that out of thin
air I think you completely mad but I
just make sense it does make they're not
that big of a company they have
incredible market penetration given how
small the company they are people love
them they're they're kind of out there
in stores right now it's a private you
totally think of like oh you want to
watch i watch netflix and amazon all
this other stuff that you know to me
like a google own that product it is the
closest thing that that's a good that's
to me is like a magic kind of a magic
bullet like it's it's like it's a you
get into their like you're just in their
secret but the next day suddenly of
kelly cool stuff all the prom with all
these these devices and I think Roku is
not having this problem it I like like
without even trying my entertainment
center area has like five devices right
that are do exactly that I have an apple
TV a Roku playstation 3 xbox and I'm
forgetting something else oh my Mike TV
and my blu-ray blu-ray player both have
streaming service you know I just want
one box right I here's what I usually
turn on the Apple TV or the xbox the
xbox i use for amazon and a couple of
other things the apple TV i used for
netflix and obviously itunes content so
i've replaced the xbox a little bit with
roku just because it's way faster and I
don't have cable of Yom and I'm started
using lie down right I actually ran out
I actually ran out of input so I got rid
of my roku and put a something that's
plays a nice wait you use area on xbox
no use area on the roku I'm
good it's awesome but but so here's the
hilarious thing about that is that you
could literally just put an antenna next
year TV and now be yeah but the antenna
yes you in the ass right hey it is
thingy I just I just said this is like
don't always work you to put put you
move them around like come on yeah well
string string coming out cable coming
out of the back of your TV to an antenna
i repurposed an old commute computer
monitor which didn't have speakers so I
have external computer speakers plugged
into the remote on the roku which is
plugged into my computer various monitor
and then I just use the iphone app to
control it and it's like the janky asst
system ever but it's beautiful that
sounds terrible it is lovely but I do
think there's like I did buy a
thirty-dollar adapter from radio shack
that was like the most expensive part of
the whole boy do they take you for a
ride on this yeah you might want to
check online next time you really this
is like I gotta watch it right now so
delicious right my classic move is I buy
something from radioshack then buy it on
Amazon and then once it ships from
amazon a return it for radio shack and
gold and that's why radio shack is going
out of this this is that also because
it's thirty dollars might be a little
overpriced ah what else we have here
that's I'm at the end of my list
seriously yeah we just we blew it we
missed one thing what do we know we have
seven Rogers our dear colleague is
letting us know that we we didn't talk
about the adobe hardware oh right which
is kind of oh right so they're doing a
what they're doing the what is it the
mighty smart stylist you know cuz that's
a thing well it so it comes with this
bar right and it like it's like it's a
physical photoshop toolbar basic does it
does it have the toolbar on yes so here
you can see here it's the it's the
Napoleon ruler which is kind of the
Adobe toolbar and the mighty smart style
my god last you a tablet I think so deal
that's an iPad what is that or is that a
tablet I don't know like to hurry away
tom or walk on whatever that thing is to
the left of that looks like an iPad good
yeah it does but what are they sharing
Yeah right here yeah it doesn't i pad an
iphone / blue tea and it says the pen
works much like existing style i but
when working alongside napoleon the two
tools can be used to create curves and
angled shapes in a way that would be
difficult to do with third-party stylist
you know so that's kind of cool sort of
yeah i mean for professor artists and
professional also like do you want to
carry this thing that you're in our
sian artist and a professional you
probably do there but if you're a
regular and a professional what if
you're just one fashional artist how
much is it sell for 4999 subscription no
oh the bitter nails anger the anger no
they haven't they haven't announced a
pricey I mean I'm not that interested in
the adobe hardware because I'm not but
I'm not a design professional right so
it's also I'm just sort of surprised to
see Adobe making hardware period uh
you're just never done it before it's I
think years what's up with Adobe they've
been kind of beat up in the last couple
of years you know there's a lot of
competition in particular I mean you've
got great apps like a corn and
Pixelmator that are do a lot of the
heavy lifting especially a corn for with
me get away you can ring you can get
away with those easily without photoshop
and they're like how much is a corn 40
bucks right I think Pixelmator is 99
maybe some like you know and so they
have to compete with that they've gotta
compete with you know flash has been
beat to hell I mean they're not that's
not there halo product at this point
right they've tried their plane catch up
to you know but trying to find a way to
exist as Adobe in the html5 world yeah
you know which still is not doesn't do
what flash can do right I'm not sure it
is to me like I will say this um we've
spent years beating up on flash and
people are still like you know all I
can't believe you know something like if
you load up our site on a computer
there's a flash player and right flash
is actually really really really good at
doing a lot of things there html5 cannot
do yet and uh there are some amazing
there have been some amazing websites
and amazing experiences that are carried
out in flash that are you know it
stuffed it's tougher to do them in
another and I guess it's big and breaks
your computer sometimes by God just
can't do those things right right so I
mean it's it's like you know it's
powerful yeah but it sucks because
obviously it's not lightweight and it's
powerful but not lightweight and that's
why it never it could could not exist in
the world in a world moving towards
mobile but I don't think it's I feel bad
almost for Adobe that they couldn't find
a way to distinguish like those products
they it was like there was this huge
push to like just duplicate with flash
does on mobile devices what they should
have said is look flashes and good for
mobile devices really good for these
desktop experiences or for a very
powerful device that's
we use a a mouse or trackpad or whatever
um but we're gonna do something else for
touch for uh for they should have said
we're gonna start with something new or
we're gonna take hl5 and really hone our
tools for you from day one knowing
instead of trying to push flash on to
these devices that were clearly
underpowered in terms of like handling
that content I mean so sort of getting
at that now they have photoshop you're
you know android the ipad is actually
really good yeah uh and they're they're
slowly getting there but yeah i just
think i'm not trying to i'm not saying
feel silly for a dope I mean you know
they they push their standard and they
pushed as hard as they could and failed
like you blew it whatever whoopsies um
but I will say that you know they have
to find their footing now because
they've been pretty bad or over the last
few years between Apple and like the
rise of cheap easy competition and the
rise of mobile devices where they have
basically no presence yeah you know I
mean nobody's like oh I need photoshop
for my ipad mean some people but the
majority is just not an issue for them
so i think it's interesting to watch
them trying to find a new place and i
think they're clearly with this hardware
they're saying we we take design
professional seriously right and by the
way the subscription thing I think maybe
for businesses might look like a much
more attractive option true you know
instead it's basically you're leasing it
for your company instead of paying out
right edges I you know for small
businesses particularly startups as a
huge amount of money can read can be
huge amount of money to UM to drop yeah
we use a lot of their stuff here yeah
yeah and then yeah here we want this
thing every something to say my ear that
that we use that we subscribe we
subscribe to Creative Cloud wait why do
I not know this guy how do I get in on
this John yeah you gotta be ideas we've
been for you informed you have to be on
the video team the progress who's
supposed to surely not on the videotape
but I think that's great I think that's
a great point you know we're a startup
we got a crew here they got to use their
stuff I gotta get in there get in the
trenches 40 bucks a month for lots of
hot but it comes together their shirts
for for businesses but yeah well not to
mention that if you want the entire
suite it's like a lot per month right
for like three or four yeah but it's
cheaper than going like we're gonna buy
a copy of this for everybody in the
office and we looked it but what's that
15 months of the whole suite that's that
not lie that's a lot you're lying to my
face know your line
to my ear John he's says he's not lie
and I believe inclined to believe John's
ever like there's a lot anybody sure
he's a very trustworthy guy I've seen
his dark side though you don't wanna see
John's darling I don't know it gets real
his nasty yeah I mean normally it's fine
it's okay when is dark side yeah all
right it's all over he's a lot like
Hitler that's not true that'd be like
you nothing totally different facial
hair that's true but everything else
very similar yeah um anyhow now that
I've compared somebody on our team to
Hitler I think it's probably time to
wrap that feels like the wrap-up of the
verge cast starving doesn't it so is
there anything else that we don't know I
feel like is a figure something we
missed no we chat about the video hub
yeah did he hopes pretty oh did we talk
about our webbie's are winning webbie's
the this is like happened like two weeks
ago or a week ago but I don't we ever
addressed it we want some webbing we
want 5 web apps we want every web we
want every weapon we want every are the
inner we want every webby award in every
category which we were nominated uh it's
about people's vote right which is the
people which is awesome I mean I'm I'm
and we were up against like we had we're
up for editorial-writing we're up
against the New Yorker and all Guardian
and The Guardian is that who was like
really great just like wonderful so
thank you to anybody who voted that's
awesome and we really appreciate it and
the first cast one to the verge cast
want we beat Ted in the People's Voice
summits head which is amazing and I'd
like to think it's because we have an
awesome community and it's also because
we are presenting better information
than Ted presents more information is
less right let's often less and a little
bit less like uh sometimes we get a
little wacky like have you heard my have
you heard my plan to fix the the fossil
fuel crisis this I was just say yes we
just have to we have to say we just have
to kill every human on the planet doctor
this is ty I know that sounds I know
that sound I know that sounds sort of
against the the common conventional
wisdom but I assure you that if we were
to kill everybody on the planet I mean
we would no longer have a fossil fuel
issue I don't think we can say you're
wrong no this is definitely a TEDx TEDx
TEDx for you ok that's the verge castle
this week if you want to get in touch
with us you can
emails at verge cast at the verge calm
you can find us on twitter at Virg Virg
house doesn't have its own Twitter
account it should maybe we will but for
now we're at verge I'm Joshua Topolsky
David is Pierce David which continues to
be upsetting I hate so much at David
Pierce I will I will come for you I'm
coming for you at Pierce David's how to
find you though and Chris is of course Z
Z power that's right because I just
witches by the ways Ziggler power is
that what that's supposed to be no
there's a story but no you can't tell it
you can't yeah don't tell it's not can
you talk we briefly talked about six
vast experience with you yes please I
watched it I saw a commercial for it did
and you're you're gonna watch it no but
it looks I think Laura was like there
with you think I became a nice i'm like
yes here's the thing people obviously
love them yeah there's no expectation of
quality whatsoever nobody's like
nobody's like oh that last fast furious
was really i think that's the size i was
like wait on the rock l said that okay
it was it uh what you don't eat your
don't you I feel like you don't really
need huge stars I mean yeah you have
like Vin Diesel in the rock or Walker is
no Paul Walker is like seriously be
level okay Paul Walker can't like isn't
even allowed in the vanity fair oscar
party all right move um but ubitza
basically like you don't need huge
talent people go to them like great
people just love car movies they don't
have to be explosions explosions it's
tough shooting out of the front of a
plane yeah people don't it's like
they're just keep making them like
forever they already announced seven
they don't even like I don't have to
change that in Fast and the Furious
being the production right now and so
they can just keep making them yeah look
Emma eventually vin diesel has to die
right and then they have to stop no then
he's like they'll be like Vin Diesel's
little brother shows up and it's played
by one of the like Liam Hemsworth up
Johnny diesel yeah Johnny Johnny diesel
the high point of my life was the moment
when I was sitting through the credits
for the first time seeing fast I just
want say you guys want to stop the high
point of his life no very odd was when
the credits rolled for Fast Five and
then afterwards like Ava Mendez walks up
to the rock and she's like you're gonna
want to see this and it's michelle
michelle rodriguez less I was like wait
for my brain shot
of the front of my skull it's a UH
spoilers spoilers I don't know I don't
know what that significance of okay
Letty is Dom sister DOM is Vin Diesel am
I literally have no idea who any of your
concern I saw one of these on TV the
other day and I was like I've never seen
anything that seems this stupid except
for they step up to the streets films ah
I'm how dare you I am actually starting
to feel really bad that I just spoiled
past five yeah yeah you really messed it
up for people cuz like I now I kind of
have a sense I think of what you're
talking about like somebody comes back
from the dead is every right me so you
basically just they do teach it in the
