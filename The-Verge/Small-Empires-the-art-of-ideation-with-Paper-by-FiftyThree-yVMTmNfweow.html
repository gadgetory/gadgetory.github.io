invested in them and met amazing people
using the internet to change the world
our generation has an opportunity unlike
any other we can create small empires
without anyone's permission
Tribeca this neighborhood is better
known for celebrity sightings than
startups but right here in the shadow of
one World Trade Center four guys fled a
large tech company on the west coast to
move into a tiny studio apartment to
build the iOS application that would
make people rethink the iPad forever
people think they're not artistic or
that they can't create and one of the
most fascinating things for me and
creating paper was that you know we'd
show two peoples beautiful application
which truly you can use it anyone I mean
we made it as easy as we could people
look at and their reaction is you know
their shoulders drop and then they say
it's like oh I can't I can't create some
people see the blank page and are
intimidated by it
they had their handwriting criticized
for years we're never able to master
things like painting and so we've
actually put a lot of time both on the
design side but a lot of time on the
engineering side trying to figure out
how we can create some very smart
algorithms almost Guitar Hero style that
make your drawing and your sketching and
your note-taking just look great so this
isn't like paint-by-number no I mean
you're still very much in control yeah
but the watercolor itself you know it
doesn't you don't wind up with the brown
puddle that most people do when they're
playing with watercolor it's a sore
subject for me yes no it doesn't matter
you know what your background what
you're you know degree of art skills are
and you know a few if you put some time
into it and you work with a right tool
you can create some amazing things so
the one thing that was very clear I mean
they've worked on productivity tools of
one nature
one former nature for over 12 13 years
so it's certainly a longer it's not that
I woke up one morning said is how I want
to work on tools I've been working on
tools and that's that's kind of that is
my passion and but then sort of the
mechanics of starting a company that was
that was more of a question around
timing and a couple things just started
moving the right way I'd had then you
look at okay so it did have a space in
New York City
Andrew was here Julian was freelancing
at that time so it was just the right
moment and then we have to go so you
guys you became we were you friends
first or had you started working
together at Microsoft was it and then
developed a friendship or how'd that go
down that's right I mean it's it's one
of those things how do you make friends
how do you find friends it's it's it's
we all at one point in our lives had
worked with Microsoft and we we had an
intersection there when I think of great
design there are a lot of companies that
I think of before not the first not the
first helped me understand how you all
were existing within Microsoft so there
was a small team called Pioneer students
at Microsoft that was sort of a kind of
skunkworks team they're looking at
future products one of the products
there was career which was sort of a two
screen tablet device and George John and
myself all worked on that project and
Julian was someone that we knew through
other friends and so when we kind of
went our separate ways and came back
together for 53 we just kind of tapped
on you know the best people that we knew
by the time we started 50 ever back at
last count I think we've built over 67
products
okay and you know from connect to to
game controllers to office a broad range
we usually built we talking about like
build ship like finish lines on concept
yeah
that's not amazing what was the moment
when you were like alright you know what
forget it
I got a comfortable job here but you
know what I want to go live in a crammed
apartment in Tribeca
I had actually already left Microsoft I
was doing some consulting sort of
feeling around trying to find the right
opportunity
I love Microsoft because I just wanted
to really really put something out there
I felt like I connected with my users I
didn't know what that was gonna be I had
no idea how I was going to get there but
I just you know finally threw myself
into the unknown and I waited to see
what would happen
we met late at night I got burning the
midnight oil right it's the boss in the
office and while we're in Seattle
downtown Seattle working a number of
projects and you know that's kind of
when you start looking up and you look
around and just see people that you so
deeply respect these are the folks that
I was learning from and at some point
you're just you realize that I could I
could have such a more interesting life
and I can spend more time with those
folks and that's when you want to start
that for us that's that's when we want
to start a company now you guys have
obviously taken over a number of cores
in this building but but the fact that
it started here is is special because
you leave Microsoft behind you had moved
to New York here in Tribeca and then you
Coast all of your former co-workers and
friends come like camp out in your
apartment is there where's the bedrooms
over there right yeah so yeah it goes a
little ways it got a little
did you at 2:00 a.m. sometimes I have to
kick out of everyone yeah yeah so how
did you how'd you convince them like to
do this yeah you know it was more we
have to do it yeah it was more narrow
when you look at Julian John Andrew and
us I mean we just wanted to get this
started
yeah and you do whatever it takes and
it's work it's a New York City how bad
can it get you know when you look at
what we're doing which is trying to
revolutionize creativity certainly New
York City is probably the most creative
city we are the most creative people in
the world right that's true we should
some can say that I think it's a
creative capital in the United States
and so it just made sense for us to be
around that and it's nice I think to get
kind of a diverse mix of you know not
only tech people but design folks and
art folks and business folks so feel
like we have a much sort of more
balanced environment here our market is
New York and we create tools for people
to get paid to think you have a need to
create that's New York City they're 3.2
million people who day in day out get
paid to work in media advertising do
consulting some of the best attorneys
are here engineers I mean it's such a
broad diverse population that have a
needs to create and then we were
thinking we're building a journal we
should build a journal but but we kept
describing it I like paper and at some
point we call it like paper why don't we
just call it
paper so that's what that was actually
two weeks before relaunch I love Divi I
can't tell you Hipmunk was gonna be
bounce pounce for a week or two and then
a week before launch becomes hit luck
we've gotten still weird but better
bounce just bounce bounce bounce I think
you know you definitely you don't want
to Google that no no you don't well so I
couldn't have a notice little something
on your bookshelf and I'd hope you would
tell me a little more about how would
your friends at Microsoft react to this
this Apple design order this is heavy
this is I could curl this yes a paper
one this actually one of and it's for a
technical achievement and design so the
combination of that and so you know
first grap of the week the NAP of the
month and then we want an Apple Design
Award mainly because paper showed the
way how you can use tablets or an iPad
for for creation okay so this is where
it all began but it's since grown much
bigger can you uh just take me up to the
next floor let's go let's go and have
the rest of the tenants feel about this
you know we've taken over the building
so they have no say in this you know
there's no one else right this is this
is this is our Empire
this is very cool so what you're seeing
here is actually work for one of our
designers Alan's piece and it explores
the development of one of his pieces
it starts out and start strong a dragon
then he places girl on to the dragon at
first so it looks like the dragon is
taking the girl for it yeah she's just
so chilling I was chilling right but
then the dragon becomes more fearful as
adds in the color yeah in order to make
sure that the dragon knows where it's
going to girl stands up I like it and
then it starts commanding the dragon so
it's this is really how the creative
process works you sometimes don't really
know what element is going to take you
forward or really shift the entire
dialogue and it's between between all of
the elements as you evolve it right you
really discover what the true meaning
the true story is by the end of it
you're riding the dragon that if you're
lucky it's actually been a little bit of
a progression in this building we
started the floor below us in George's
apartment then we filled that space up
moved to this floor which is essentially
just a larger apartment where we're all
the employees by the way well now we're
also on the sixth floor which is an even
larger apartment we've sort of worked
our way back down here and had a small
team here this is where a lot of our app
development happens and so we've got
development going on down here
yes--if iOS development team here hey
guys guys
now you all have a very interesting
balance you almost have a designer for
every developer which is a pretty rare
thing is there like a jet sharks sort of
dynamic to the office how do you
determine that balance we try to hire
engineers who are designed minded I mean
if you tried to work at this company and
you didn't value design I think it could
be very challenging we receive them
yeah because you'll get a lot of
challenges dropped on your plate like
this is how we'd like the design to be
but the engineering is extremely
difficult and if you're not you know up
to that challenge or you don't see the
value and why it should be that way then
if I won't be happy paying your head
banging your head on it right now
bears are falling for creation all over
right to get started you need the SDK
and muv building iOS apps in a few
months there are a lot of people out
there myself included who are like go
build stuff go launch stuff go create
yet you know you look at the majority of
apps on the App Store for instance are
absolutely people probably
they'll never get more than a few
thousand downloads for someone watching
this who wants to have paper who wants
to have that kind of success is the
lesson keep launching stuff until it
sticks or you know what don't don't
launch that yet make sure it's really
something great and and and then how the
hell do you know it's written something
right you know we're sort of in an
environment now there's so much so much
mediocrity hmm then you really have to
produce something amazing something
great to really is above it and so I do
think it's worth kind of hanging on to
your idea and spending a little bit more
time polishing it to really get it to a
point that you know you feel like it's
it's going to say something it's going
to tell a new story and it's just
extremely well executed it's useful
Benna canal
so when you told the landlord that you
needed that top floor in addition to the
other two we see pretty amenable yeah I
think it is happy I mean six floor
walk-up usually doesn't rent that
quickly good point
well this is yes this is the top floor
hey 53 hey everybody sorry to distract
you while you're busy working why do you
guys why do you guys work at a start-up
right why why is this something that you
ended up in I really like the idea of a
maker driven company and a company where
you know people are really using the
software they're making
I thought there was something really
special about that it was really evident
like what the customers were making so I
actually picked up paper and started
using a big one and was just obsessed I
fell in love and I was like these guys
get it they get creation on a tablet so
like perusing tumblr and other social
media outlets and just seeing what
people were making was amazing
wanted to be a part of that it was
energy coming out of that space would
you say you're the best artist here no
prior to coming here I work for a lot of
bigger like marketing companies and so I
had an opportunity where I was doing
some consulting and I had an opportunity
to really look where I wanted to go next
and I wanted to do something that made a
difference as cliche as that might sound
I didn't want to be in a company where
it's like let's chase the next dollar
not really care about the consequences
and this was an absolute perfect fit see
I know you're serious because you have
to wake up every morning and walk up
seven flights of stairs to get to your
work right so that's that I'm excited to
do it you're excited to it every time
yeah that's great when you think about
what paper as it stands right now is
doing for people the idea at first blush
of like oh here is here's an easy
beautiful wonderful way to create art
seems nice but it seems like something
only a bunch of art students might use
or only a bunch of like people who
already are in a creative mindset would
use how do you think of this application
when you're looking at a world of people
many of whom don't even consider
themselves remotely artistic who don't
even think about themselves as creators
or why why why would you want to try to
build a product that is automatically
going to kind of alienate a majority of
people well I mean the interesting thing
is we built paper as sort of that bridge
and so we actually get a lot of people
you know we get emails almost every week
about people that tell us that like I
never thought I could sketch before yeah
you know until I tried paper people have
never gotten the right and positive and
reinforcement
you know because of SAT scores because
of GPA is because of reading writing
people think they know how to read and
how they write and how to do math I
don't know many people who write well
hmm I don't I know a lot of people who
can put together great chicken scotch
cuts to communicate their idea much more
efficiently an emoticon people know how
to use the smiley face people know how
to draw describing in words your
emotional state complicated but people
think they know how to do it why because
they grab grades they got reinforcement
certifications and this is even on a
much bigger level when you think about
how people communicate is vision
we first we're visual learners right we
fail to educate our population right our
netic we we should all be fluent
communicating in images so when people
say I'm not creative what they're saying
is I can't draw or I don't know how to
communicate visually and I say our
challenge to make sure that everyone can
because it's going to transform the
level in the quality of our ideas how we
work together and how we get things done
now it doesn't matter how beautiful your
app is if no one uses it doesn't really
matter
the thing about paper that's so
interesting is it's not just for artists
in fact we're going to meet a high
school teacher named Brad who's using it
to change education well this is the
first thing I did with paper when it
first came out I was just noodling
around and I wanted a quick way to make
a little diary of my day so this is
actually goes on a tumblr blog I have
called a hundred percent of my time so
what I do is just ten lines different
colors representing the percentage of my
day that's taken up with these things
it's not necessarily time sort of like
Chinese miles
they're called Li Chinese miles are
longer going up than they are going down
because it's a measure of distance and
effort right so this was actually this
was a travel day you know you to get
somewhere you just sit down for a long
time and then all of a sudden you're in
a new place how early of an adopter were
you of paper did you download it second
like this app might have been a couple
of days old and I grabbed it as soon as
a as soon as it came out
I love the tool I'm not an artist but I
like doodling around and drawing and I
played around with some different apps
so it's sort of at the low end or
something like Adobe Ideas very simple
tool set which I like I like the
simplicity but it was too simple and
then at the other end where things like
what does it SketchBook Pro or something
you know incredibly powerful tool sets
for professional you know designers and
artists and that kind of thing
but when I was playing with it you know
the learning curve was really big and
the tool set was so big that by the time
you drilled down and got the tool you
wanted and came back I've lost my train
of thought or whatever I don't know how
you know but you look at an app and you
go this is just going to work there's
something in the way it's presented that
you just go okay it's going to be a
simple enough but not too simple tool
set that would allow me to just duel
around if there's one thing that
Microsoft taught me it was a certain
irreverence to technology and ten years
there saw speech interfaces gesture
interfaces multiple operating system
mobile phone operating zazz multiple
programming models and they keep trying
I mean they see technology is completely
malleable and what you gain from that is
really this understanding of
appreciation that yeah technology is
manual the most important thing is
understanding what do you want to do
with it how should it look like
and for us there was technology is there
to help people create that's what it's
for and that became the success of
focusing point anything that's doesn't
help you create get rid of it it
shouldn't be there clock not don't need
a clock while you're creating the
battery meter don't need it excites what
do you really need to get going and you
need beautiful tools that work because
beauty gives you meaning while you're
creating I think that beauty is very
important ideas you have to you have to
be able to elevate your idea the first
thing you see is you know when you try
and capture an idea if it looks bad it
just sets it off on the wrong tone and
it kind of kills the idea and they're
very fragile things ideas
your students
you know are they you know because
they're coming out of it without a lot
of the biases and sort of I don't know
the the inertia that comes with the way
things ought to be how do you think this
is going to make them when it comes to
storytelling as well as just you know
sort of how they process ideas well it's
interesting you know I think the kids
want to by the time they get to high
school where I teach all of that's gone
if you want to see we don't like all of
that that expressing themselves only I
teach a philosophy course and I often
give the kids
- apparently separate ideas and get them
to try and find the connection and if
you think linearly it's almost
impossible to do you really have to bust
out of your usual thinking so it was in
the middle of class and these are bright
kids we know we're a university prep
school and kids go to Harvard and
Stanford and all this kind of stuff and
they just weren't thinking I remember
just literally banging my head on the
desk I said opera goodness sakes you
guys would you just think for a second
and one of the students top girl in the
school kind of kid said Mr OC we don't
have time to think we just need you to
give us the answer so we can get them
down and we can get our six and seven so
we can get into a university we don't
have time to think yeah and and you know
they're they're gaming the system that
we need the marks to get to the
universities we want to get to that's
how they think you had a case so when
you give them a tool that allows them to
just think give people a blank page and
they often just bring us it go make
something and they go well tell us what
you want us to make so they're not used
you know you give any kid a piece of
paper in a crayon and they'll scribble
on it and we've got to teach them how to
you know draw and make notes
all the rest of it and I'm finding with
these technologies that I think are kind
of liberating technologies students at
first are not used to using them they
want to go where does the necessary
information so you give them something
like this and say sketchnote it don't
worry about the trivial data we can look
that up later let's capture the things
we don't know or the things we find
really exciting and use that to drive
something that's really pull into the
kids and its really big structures that
force kids into that kind of envelope
where you know the big structure is I
need to get to University which means I
need my GPA to be four point something
right so if I'm going to play around
with this I'm taking a risk with my
grades so you need to create the space
that allows them to do that too
once it gets going though every time I
give them kids that have been blown away
by what they can do you know they
surprise me every time isn't what I
would describe the applications stay to
to an investor and then they would hear
you're putting water color in it and
they would go bonkers they pee because
they Lear water color no because they
wanted PowerPoint export right there's
like export to powerpoint in there this
is just aa ha ha I mean it's it's one of
those things it's there is no one if you
ask them do you need watercolor and
they're going to say like no we're but
you do like
it's a beautiful thing all of a sudden
you're getting in you skill you can
think in color you can express it we can
color the colors meaningful it's the
choice between your red and a blue tie
that stuff matters yeah it's just
because you know you had a bad
experience in art school in year six or
seven no but that needs to be expressive
this pervasive so I mean these are
certain things where you just can't you
can't listen to people you need to hear
a little bit further you needed when
they say no don't do want or go into a
PowerPoint but they're really say you're
seeing a deeper need you're emerge which
is like ah which is I can't access this
and that is that an opportunity it's
like okay that's good you call my idea
crazy I'm going to do it I mean you need
that if people don't call your ideas
crazy or silly then you're not working
on the right thing building a product is
hard that's why I'm always telling
founders as soon as it's good enough
ship it now these four guys basically
got an education while they were
Microsoft in taking an idea and
launching a product they did it time and
time again but they couldn't build the
product that they wanted until they left
and started their own company it's
fitting that they would go on and create
an app that allows anyone with an iPad
to just get started creating beautiful
things and I want to live in a world
where when someone sees a blank canvas
they're not intimidated they're inspired</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
