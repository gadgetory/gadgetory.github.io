appliances at CES every single year
they're also really interesting takes a
normal everyday appliances to this year
so weirdest stuff that you might
actually put in your home sometime soon
is that LG just like there can never be
tuning blades on a razor or LG has
decided there can never be too many
doors on a fridge we're standing in
front of an LG fridge with six doors on
it two of which are actually hidden
inside of the front door you have to hit
a button to access the first level of
doors for this next level you have to go
underneath for some reason the buttons
in a different spot so this is perfect
if you want to deeply confuse your
guests this is like the alien of fridges
you open one door and another door flies
out at you it's kind of confusing
sometimes but it's also kind of awesome
and you can store way more things that
you should definitely be storing in your
fridge final two doors are the freezers
underneath fortunately these are single
level traditional doors only a little
less impressive but who cares you have
six doors on your fridge you know we can
complain at that point
so this is LG's between watch system it
is a washing machine that actually has
two separate compartments where you can
do two separate loads of laundry on two
separate cycles it actually has lingerie
in here right now is an example for why
you might do a delicate cycle so if one
washing machine isn't enough for you
LG's got you covered I don't even have a
single laundry machine in my apartment
so the idea of having two sounds great
I'm not sure how much I would use it but
I really do like the idea of being able
to do a quick small loaves this may look
like a normal dryer but actually for
some reason you can open the door in two
different ways LG thinks that you want
to load it this way and unload it this
way to prevent stocks from getting
caught I'm not sure I guess if you buy
it you just kind of feel obligated to
open it in different ways it's really
cool it also has a neat storage system
you open up the top they have some
beautifully folded towels which I kind
of really wants them to be like nice hot
towels in use right now I don't think
that's actually involved but seems like
these nice efficient use of storage I'll
just have this at CES before but it's
been updated this year it's basically a
closet that dry cleans your clothes you
put them inside it can steam them remove
wrinkles we've scents with bacteria so
basically you can use this instead of
getting your clothes clean spending that
money all the time and actually kind of
ruin
close if you do it too often this is
supposed to keep them in better shape I
like really really really deeply in my
bones hate ironing my clothing so the
idea of just being able to hang my shirt
up at night and have it refreshed in the
morning like I can cry a little bit I
would put this in my apartment in an
instant how do you actually plan to ship
all this stuff over the next few months
the interesting thing is as weird as
this seemed on the surface they also
really fast to go functions and I kind
of want them this is just the tip of the
CES iceberg as far as weird stuff and
weird appliances goes though so if you
