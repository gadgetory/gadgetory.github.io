this is the verge from both near and far
this week no key admitted to faking
ville sample images and video for its
upcoming Lumia 920 flagship following a
public apology Nokia want to step
further and actually let us try out the
1920s camera ourselves late last night
the preview camera takes very good
low-light images especially compared to
competitors like the galaxy s3 and
iphone 4s so good in fact that we wish
to nokia had just used real images in
the first place it wasn't perfect and we
couldn't try video but no t does have
some time to tweet sources suggested
Lumia 920 will launch November second on
18 2 and apples long rumored music
streaming service may finally
materialized according to The Wall
Street Journal the company is currently
negotiating new music licenses that
suggest the service could fall somewhere
between Pandora and Spotify in terms of
user experience the no launch window has
been set the report suggests any service
is still months away in the meantime
apple is expected to announce a brand
new iphone next week and finally 4k
resolution TVs are about to be ready for
consumers shortly LG's 84 inch 4k set
will ship next month to the US for just
shy of 20 thousand dollars let me seem
like a crazy figure but it's actually
five thousand dollars cheaper than
sony's own 84-inch behemoth that one's
due out in november and if you don't
need a fork a setback fit so Shiva's
upcoming 55 inch version is coming to
japan for more reasonable 9500 dollars
reasonable of course seeing a very
relative term and that's it then that's
it for today's top stories tune in
tomorrow to find out who will survive
and what will be left</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
