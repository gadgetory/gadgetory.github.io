a podcast is now over
but that's in front of a live audience
hi I'm Eli Patel on the editor-in-chief
of The Verge I'm joined as always by my
friend Virge executive editor recode
editor at large the Walter keishon
himself Walter s Mossberg
all right well I don't think we have any
other business to attend to
let's just get started so this is the
last control-alt-delete
it's our 76th one and you know I've been
waiting haven't said much about this but
I have to bring this up tonight of a
huge Greek grievance and the grievances
my whole life that we have we have to
see the name of a certain Virg employee
in every episode of podcast I'm only
going to say it I'm retiring I don't
care I'm going to say it one more time
dieter bone
cannot can I say this before we came on
that's my song when I think of theater I
think of the song that plays over a
drone shot of Spring Break with someone
just yelling turn it up because that's
what deters like everyday body shots
every morning before work all right
let's do this podcast we've had enough
famous billionaires telling Wall fell
great here so well on the last show yeah
we talked big big idea they got your
computing soaring pronouncements the
industry could you finally gave me
enough time to read I'll give you three
 weeks man but since then there's
been the code conference it was your
last code conference you founded the
code conference in D you had a bunch of
people on stage talking to you Andy
Rubin talking about his new phone
ambient OS right well named after that
Congress and initiative and then we at
WWC and both of you were there I think
it's go for both of you were there and
we saw a bunch of apples vision for
what's coming next right so I want to
not do too deep in the weeds and the
actual news that I'm pretty sure
everybody here saw it but I want to talk
about those things in the context of
bigger stuff right so your WABC tell me
what you suck uh well this year I think
Apple was intent on sending several
they're always intent on sending
messages yeah I think they were super
strong I think Peter would agree with
this on sending a handful of particular
messages one was reassuring all the Mac
users particularly the Pro users that
although they had kind of maybe screwed
up a little on the MacBook Pro and I'm
not you know revising their certaPro
yeah for years a lot a lot that they
were SD card reader that they were doing
it
don't you taught at the headphone jack
so has one better and so so they
announced you know an iMac Pro but this
was a keynote it lasted two and half
hours they went I mean that we were
trying to live blog it and they were
going so fast they were going Apple use
apples I was talking about to some folks
outside before a volcanoes are usually
really chill like because Apple really
wants you to understand what they're
doing and so they go through it really
really deliberatively here's the thing
here's why it matters
we're going to tell you about the thing
here this back serious tax reminder we
here's the thing here's the thing now
we're going to do demo here's why it
matters again and you can just like
write the news in the live blog and then
write why it matters and then make a
joke and then make a snarky joke and
then wait for KC new to make a much
funnier joke yeah meanwhile Samsung
keynote it's like what do you want you
want a washing machine you want to dryer
we make nuclear power plants we got five
phones look like it's like yes like
they're just a very different style
keynote felt like a Samsung keynote a
little tiny bit yeah yeah because they
don't know so fast it had so much stuff
any whoa diss on yeah yeah okay good
so I don't know it's an L is the Samsung
mic back off man
it's gonna any minute now yeah good so
so this so they were like racing through
the first part of this keynote and and
then they really devoted a lot to the
Mac because they had a that was one of
their missions was to say hey we're
still make max we're gonna we're finally
because we've got the memo we're going
to make them faster better you know
we're doing this iMac Pro and I mean the
specs on it were just insane and so that
was one thing the other thing was they
are continue to be on and this is Tim
Cook is personally extremely invested in
this they're still on this big crusade
to make the iPad a true productivity
device not unlike what Microsoft is
doing except in a really a different way
with with with really I mean I would go
so far as to say that if they were to
succeed
this hi it's really the replacement of
the graphical user interface ultimately
now they may not ever succeed in it
don't give me the know yet I know
they're not going to totally replace it
but the more tasks during a day that
people do on the multi-touch interface
whether it's theirs or somebody else's
only they kind of have a lead on that on
tablets right now sales are down but
they have a lead in the number of apps
and developers I think it if it succeeds
one day will be looked upon as the
transition to the next UX but so they
spent time on that I think however the
probably historically looking back on
that keynote the most interesting thing
was the announcement of a our kit not
the whole pod no not the home pod
although we should talk about that
a our kit is a foundational thing
they've done to allow hundreds of
millions of iOS devices to run augmented
reality you know it's got an it's got
various api's in the new iOS it's got
various it's got an SDK right and so
they're not they didn't announce a
first-party AR app it's not like the
tango a phone which is the Android
equivalent but you know it's not like
there's a million tango phone sirs am i
right Jeff there's one tango phones that
right there's the lenovo PR Linnell both
PR right there in the front row by the
way we see all the rest of you too will
be come back more products one by one
and so I know I just think you know they
they they said hundreds of millions of
iOS devices would be able to use this so
it has backward compatibility I talked
to them later about it and they said
they think it's about 90 percent of
their actively used devices will be able
to use this so I mean to me
maybe AR won't amount to anything I
doubt it I think it's going to be a big
deal
I'm not saying Apple is going to be the
leader in it but they sort of put their
stake in the ground and said hey our
approaches
you know you can just go to town and all
of these people install base who by the
way they made a point as they do often
of saying all of them upgrade to the
newest version within a matter of months
which is always a shot at Android but if
they do upgrade to this newest version
they'll have this AR capability well hey
let's go did it feel like there shot an
Android this year was like they were so
rushed they didn't spend a lot of time
on it like they do it every year this
year sounds like yeah they have one
slide bad it's boring now we make fun of
a bad day up they had the upgrade to my
yeah I think they only had the 7%
Android devices are running the latest
version 86% of iOS devices right that
was the only shot at Android yeah well
they had a million other things to
announce yeah but on ar10 it's what's
interesting to me because we have been
expecting this next iPhone to be such a
radical change a arcade on the existing
iPhone iPad 2 they demoed it on is it
very good very good just using the
camera on the phone they had other
sensors other to be the plus size iPhone
have two cameras which lets you fight
what kinds of things you can see how can
get even better and that I think is
that's the problem for the Android
ecosystem right because Google can't
guarantee what kind of hardware you have
and with Apple can certainly guarantee
what kind of I heart with it next item
well the other interesting thing is
Google's play here is tango which
requires a suite of like crazy sensors
you know special death cameras the whole
thing Apple has you told that gamma
depth not death but maybe maybe it was
like we're we're just evil now
well I'm sorry I had a follow-up joke
and I lost your you see I'm and you know
Apple stuff works on like a bunch of
current devices because they figured out
what stuff they needed that they could
do with the depth camera on the iPhone 7
and what stuff actually works so when
you do the AR kit on an iPhone
it doesn't create a full perfect 3d map
of the room or the universe that you're
in the way the tango phone does because
they're like yeah we don't need that we
just need to know what surfaces there
are the
and then we'll track those and it turns
out that getting 90% of the way there is
pretty darn good and like that's really
interesting and it sets them up in this
like there's this next you know AR
platform battle and like the players are
really weird
right the ones you expect Apple Facebook
Google and then there's like snapchat
hanging out like yeah we're about to do
this to it
snapchat can just build all their stuff
on a arcade right yes that's it they're
not please don't make a phone like don't
do that that's a bad idea
yeah but right so their app just runs on
the iPhones they can get weightless and
when we mention a company will the
representatives right right but they're
just going to keep putting an app on the
phone yeah so they get the value out of
this that's a that helps snapshot right
and I think a very specific way but and
I think I'm sorry guys i but snapchat
needs also like I don't know if the AAR
kit thing is true for them because
snapchat is a new company just IPO right
not well that well they need growth
that's what new companies do and the
iPhone is dominant you know in the US
and certain ways but around the world
they need Android they need to actually
start getting well but there's nothing
said that can't use both there's a but
but keep but a pure Apple your thing all
new chips on a arc it and that it is but
if you're thinking if your Apple and
remember you guys know this very well
but but cool makes its money over time
when you use their services including
when you use them on and I on an Apple
device Apple makes most not all but most
of the money that you're that they're
going to make off you when you leave the
store or make your monthly payments or
whatever you buy the phone and so if
your snapchat and a our kid is good and
you know it's good for Apple Apple can
say well snapchat stuff looks better on
our phones because we have this thing
and on Google's phones they have to kind
of do their own code or you know it's
it's going to be it's going to be
interesting home pod we should talk
about that for a minute I think it's
important you know as reporters and
reviewers we have to say we don't
there's a whole lot we don't know about
home pod especially the parts that will
directly compete
in artificial assistant kind of terms
with the echo and the Google home you
all know that I mean I've been tweeting
and also writing but tweeting per year
about Siri fails taking screenshots and
putting on two United Airlines yeah
that's well whole squares will the
United Airlines you are president as
their hands sit now returning home
podcast right so you know they have
apparently gotten more serious about
Siri but to the extent that my
understanding is they were building a
music player they said they've been
working on it for years it was pretty
clear that the parts of it that did not
have to do with music seem seem to have
been added pretty much later because the
slide was on the was visible for about
ten seconds that that said oh and I can
also do all these thing you know can do
all things you have that musicologist
Japanese acknowledge every consumer
wants and the best by saying I don't do
you have any musicologist because I was
and Best Buy says yes that person over
there in the blue shirt and I magnolias
anytime you're seeking the help of a
knowledge us there's something wrong
with you so so some of you may may have
read about this but if you haven't I'm
going to say it anywhere but you just
got police do it again they waving its
senior equal so a thief at the event
they took the turn I guess not all the
journalists but a selected group of
journalists broke us into groups of one
or two or three and then we were entered
this little room they had set up inside
the convention center where they had
they made it sort of a fake little
living room and they had a sonís play
three which is a very good speaker for
those who are those who and one know
this I think it's very good it's a not
for an audiophile lunatic left you but
for normal for podcast listeners I made
the
and they have had an echo which is a
garbage garbage but you don't expect you
know by an echo thing no I'm buying the
best speaker in the world and then they
had this home pod set up and of course
the home pod literally blew them away I
mean it just sounded pancakes went
through a series of four or five songs
they point of different things out at
one point they combine two home pods and
in gan Hotel California the acoustic
version and you could hear that that's
what the young people walk yeah and $700
to get Hotel California rendered is
excellent ever been already sure
acoustic version pretty sure people that
want to listen to a perfect rendition of
the acoustic version of Hotel California
live is the exact target market that
they are originally yeah it could be
yeah but I get it going did you not
think it sounded got some class by the
way open it Salah weakly like you expand
your mind
I thought the I thought the home pod
sounded incredible I think that whatever
it is they're doing on a single speaker
to like craft the audio and bounce in
different directions is very confusing
Neil and I have had many fights about
this many many fine I think that the
Alexa sound like garbage but the Alexa
was playing over Bluetooth instead of
drugs and li-fi oh yeah yeah the echo
get it right I'm sorry no I'm not
everybody else calls it like so I can't
do okay dad silent I am Telling You this
room of nerds you'd not vote with us bro
like it's an echo I just kept quiet
after I chaste says you and waited for
the other well my first up parents on
controls Willie's going just ya know it
is so-so
it sounded good it sounded good but the
Sonos sounded weird yeah I agree
and when I was not I was in a different
session than you and in our session
which had the great John Patrick patch
Kowski there used to be a colleague of
mine now is at BuzzFeed we were both
looking at each other and we actually
both several times asked the Apple
people I usually say were saying well we
took it out of the box we tuned it you
know how Sonos has a tuning system on
your phone and they said oh we level set
everything it's all
you know we're liking doesn't sound like
our cirrhosis so so the big question
with how God is not I'm sure it sounds
great right I mean it is a just it has
better speaker stuff in it than the
other speakers of its class whether or
not you think it sounds better than
various Sonos things a matter of taste
yeah but I'm sure it is good yeah it's a
high end of good the real question is
how does it compete with the Amazon echo
yeah and Alexa family of products how
does it compete with them you know I
have zero information on that right
colleges they're not they didn't show it
it isn't ready yeah those parts of it I
suspect are not ready right and so if
they're expecting to fill in with what
also Syria you saw Siri that means your
expectations are immediately low right
because right now people are buying
Amazon products and talking to them in
their homes instead of talking to Siri
on their phone right or they're buying
the Google home and talking that instead
of Siri on their phone so why would you
buy this other thing and I there's as
far as I can tell no information no
innovation but I will say two things
because I think you put it really well I
think one reason they don't talk to Siri
on their phone is that it has
disappointed them that's over the years
but the other reason is there is
something to be said and we talked about
this on this podcast in The Verge cast
many times that the idea of it being
ambient in the home it's not fully
ambient cause there's a device there but
still it's kind of ambient you can talk
to it is a different use case it's a
different experience and and it's very
engaging once you start doing it as long
as you believe it's not listening all
the time and really it's not listening
until the wake word is said but that's
the same of the rails right not only so
I think that despite that experience
which has made people want to talk to
the echo I don't know anything about the
sales of Google home I know I have a
vague idea about the sales of the echo
just because of what analysts have been
saying and I guess they I don't I
haven't read anything about the Google
home
sailes it hasn't sold amazingly but it's
done pretty well and I give Amazon a lot
of credit for it and yet most of the
people who own an echo do not use the
6000 skills it has which is the their
word for a voice-controlled app because
you have to say another trigger word
after the main trigger word nobody can
remember the other trigger words and
it's a whole thing so I mean we're very
early on all these things an Apple
jumping in now presuming that they can
make Siri fulfill its potential it isn't
too late to jump in I mean everybody
knows that every product they did which
people
ten years later think they invented they
really didn't invent they just kind of
perfected it or protected it enough to
commercialize it you're just trying to
goad me to talk about the trio and I'm
not going to do it I I have no problem
we can devote the rest of weekend about
the rest of podcast to you and I
defending the trio and Neil I not
Harbhajan the other thing I'd point out
I love the to dear God neither I need to
leave the stage
the thing about Syria the whole Ponder's
Mobile trio best trio ever made actually
yes oh god oh god I had to take it one
today I attended that goats Rio pro was
actually supposed to be the first
Android prototype Windows Mobile trios
yeah well now they do yeah again Thank
You Diderot meaning give a quiet room
but one guy said wow I'm taking that
front of that the other thing that was
interesting about Syria and the home pod
is the way Apple talked about it on
stage they talked about how Siri is
going to support certain domains and
then use that same language on the
iPhone and like the way that Siri is
going to open itself up to third parties
Amazon's like any app you want if you
can remember the key word sure what the
hell it can work Google is like well
we're going to try making or like work
like the web and I don't know what that
looks like but we'll see Apple seems to
be somewhere in the middle they want
more control so that it isn't chaos but
doing that and getting a bunch of people
to throw in and the way that everybody
threw in like what they did on the App
Store is
very very difficult and I don't know how
they're going to do is I would only
point out to you that if my you know I
sit here and at my age and brain cells
are dying every second we sit here but
as best as I can recall the
theory the original company app Siri
would it was before Apple bought it
debuted at my conference they came and
demoed it to me I I was in charge of the
demo so I put it on stage they called
them domains also and they did they had
done deals because they were a little
company nobody understood what they were
doing every cared so they had done deals
with you know companies that aggregated
sports scores companies that did weather
companies that did moving in fact they
had many more domain skills Apple
actually got rid of a bunch of them and
I suspect part I can't I don't know the
history but I think part of it might
have even been legal I'm not sure once
if it's a little startup company and
they want to use your stuff it's okay
it's fine there's a big company with
deep pockets that want to use your stuff
suddenly the calculus changes but yeah I
mean I think they're I dare use of the
word domain is not unlike skills per
Alexa what I want to talk about the
Google version compared to the Apple
version right I think we are I'm just
speaking for you all we are probably
familiar with how the oh let them speak
for you you download the ox app you go
through the skills you have this go do
it on an echo not a common Alexa Alexa
system
and one down and then there's the Apple
version in the Apple version it seems
like it's gonna be the same as we know
nothing about let me know nothing that I
put but the way they talked about Siri
and the way it will be extended is
basically you download an app on your
phone and that Apple taught Syria then
series email address that app that is
Siri kids is they've talked about for a
couple years now you can do that with
iOS 10 so anyways but the Apple's answer
to every problem is we made an app store
like what's a Smart Watch good for an
app store
what's iMessage it for the wildly
successful iMessage and the Google Ads
is whole other idea yeah and I think you
probably know more about it than anybody
can you try to explain that Google's
idea is they want to make these
assistants work like a website so
instead of saying hey Google I made this
app for the Google assistant put it on
your thing and them saying yes we
approve of your app now it's available
in our store for people to find they
just want you to say hey we made our
assistant app it's over here at this you
know web address and I'm like cool we'll
look at it it works cool now you can ask
for it so they're trying to the same way
that you don't install a website on your
phone unless you're cool put the verge
comm on your homescreen let's take a
five minute break everything that you
they don't think that you should have to
install a website on the Google
assistant now that's a very beautiful
dream which I don't believe they can
actually pull off anywhere nearly as
easily as they can because the assistant
gives you one answer if you ask for a
thing vocally and you get five results
you are super unhappy with that
experience so they're always going to
give you the top result and that top
result that could be garbage could be
garbage and there's no transparency to
whether that top result arrived because
it like won the search algorithm or
because they made a backdoor deal with
Google's look even even very hard to
know where this is going to go there is
like you know look as I said before I'm
the king of pointing out Siri fails I
think but it doesn't fail all the time
and if you ask it about sports for
instance you get a beautifully on the
phone
or it's a visual experience
and again don't know about home pod but
does have a screen on top strange place
to have a screen I don't know
but where you want is a screen facing
directly up in the corner of your room
well maybe it'll maybe it'll project
like reject down to the healing room
like those alarm clocks to do that you
know but yeah Apple built in 1986 radio
panic alarm clock I've been waitin by
the way you can have for $300 only plays
Hotel California but here's the thing
the the domains they've chosen to really
work on do better are presented in a
better way and I found actually a more
accurate way if I say how are the Red
Sox doing it's actually smart which I do
for the most part how are the Patriots
doing those are there Cheetos the right
team out there really do you think
that's wait a minute do you think that's
a right answer because to me the right
answer is it's the ones they just won
their fifth Super Bowl I didn't say they
did it just won their fifth Super Ball
super you really want to you really want
to throw down and is doing later are
they doing well not nice no but he I was
actually making a tech point using using
a heroic example the Red Sox so if I say
hired the Red Sox doing and there's a
game underway CIRA will give me the
score of the game if I say how are the
Red Sox doing and there's not a game
underway at that moment they'll give me
the standings and they'll actually say
something that seer will actually say
something intelligence like the Red Sox
are they'll use verbs like Red Sox are
creaming the the Blue Jays or the
Yankees are are edging the Reds or
whatever it is you know and it sounds
almost like you're talking to a person
with a funny voice but you know it's one
of the better things they do and that's
I think one of the reasons they they do
this domain approach the thing that
apples about the run face first into is
the thing that Google has really not
done a great job messaging which is Siri
on the home pod is going to be able to
do a smaller set of thing
what Siri on the phone can do so when I
talked to the Google assistant on a
phone on my watch or in Google home or
in my car it will randomly fail to
achieve the thing I asked it to do
because it doesn't work on that
particular device and Apple's already
admitted its going to do a smaller
domain of thing
well Siri already does different things
on the different device right even
before home plus with the iPad 2 but
like having a speaker tell you sorry I
can't do that when you know the phone
can do it is incredibly frustrating
right it is frustrating although in and
this is not a debate cuz I agree with
you but I would just note yeah that at
least in my experience in our house that
go in the Google home say I can't I
don't know that or I didn't understand
that or and my favorite on the echo is
that has all the songs because you've
connected it to some service or I'm
actually I think on Amazon so music
service whatever and you asked for song
and it gives you a version by somebody
you've never heard of that it's like a
cover by it's like I don't know it's aw
you have to be really specific and then
you try to get more specific no I want
the you know I want Adele's version of
Adele's number one and from the album 25
or whatever you know and and then it
says well I don't the light goes out it
hasn't understood you so and it's
insisting on playing the cover by
somebody you never heard of and that
kind of thing goes on well I think the
other thing is interesting is Google is
so far I think is the only company
that's really figured out multiple users
yeah the assistants Apple is like
surprisingly bad at knowing that more
than one person lives in a house like
the Apple TV's like it's you now you're
not as friends the only person I've ever
encountered in this living that you're
misunderstanding a want multiple Apple
tea being so into the house yours is
Becky their neighbors
you have just in case they come over
about the street right um but I think
that's like another home hard question
right they haven't really solved
multiple you so we're spending all this
time talking about something we really
have admitted six times we don't know
everything too much about but except
what we know what Peter and I know is
that under certain controlled
circumstances it sounds amazingly good
yeah it's all I can tell you and it has
you know you can touch the top of it to
change the ball you so I know this so
zoom out for me well so you see the big
feature of Andy of computing you see all
these little Apple moves you see iOS 11
turning the iPad into something that
looks more like a computer just wrap up
where you think Apple's position now
business well I think Apple first of all
I can't prove what I'm about to say but
I believe Apple has a huge significant
effort on a are I think they have a
smaller effort on VR I think it's
interesting to talk to people I was just
talking to somebody who knows a lot
about it outside in the reception I
think there is a changing perception
about VR and AR nobody thinks I mean
everybody thinks both of them are going
to be significant but I think people
think AR is going to be the more broadly
adopted thing both for consumers and for
enterprise and verticals
obviously VR will also have roles in
both those domains to use the term but
Apple has a small VR effort they did do
a VR demo on what the iMac the iMac Pro
or just the regular new iMac which is
also beefed up but really I think
they're putting their principal weapon
and AR now Google is doing obviously
famously has daydream and some other VR
things but I think they're doing a huge
effort on AR and I think really
everybody I think the secret story is
that everybody is trying to get AR to
look like this yeah and I think until it
looks like this we're going to be seeing
it on 2d screens until somebody can get
this and this by the way is not
necessarily a 10 year time frame um one
big temper
company talked to me about and I don't
know if they'll pull it off but they
talked to me about their hopes to do it
in three or four years something like
that and they actually you know how to
have a timeline for it so I think I
think Apple wants to be in the AR game
in a big way and so that even though we
saw Big Mac demos and and the home pod
which everybody wrote about and the iPad
stuff of which they managed to make very
impressive but I'm sure it is I mean you
and you've got a chance I get a chance
our colleagues got a chance to hold
those iPads they're very nice and they I
said iPod did not but I mean I've had
they they mean the specs that on the
iPad are better than on a lot of laptops
and the specs on the new iPad pros just
feel like apples just showing off like
that there's literally nobody in the
planet that is within like three years
of producing like a pure tablet
experience except maybe the surface
which is sort of a different category
and apples like yeah well we just we
made it better because we had nothing
else right but I think again just to
repeat maybe the maybe we'll be done
with the with WGC but I just think that
that ARS is a is a but one of the book
you know they're working doing something
with cars I can't tell you what it is
but I think a are is a big focus for
them yeah so we were just a code always
together
yeah right codes your last code here you
just assume they all know what it is so
they're Kafka knows what it's a room for
billionaires
just like this room you want to tell the
same ticket price you there's no VIP
reception that you know kept you know
Karen I killed that really yes some
years ago just kill the open bar make a
billionaire Spears right tell mother get
your of conference somewhere yeah so
well I mean so Kara Swisher who's a
fantastic journalist and has been my my
business partner for years and I in 2003
started this conference the idea of
which was to put the leaders of tech and
media industry on stage
interview them and we've done that I
think there's pretty much nobody major
running a tech company could think of
who hasn't at least once been on our
stage some have been on multiple times
and we now call it the code conference
and it's just finished and these guys
were there and he'd be amazed at the
budget they have for tickets I mean it's
just like incredible and you know there
are always are a number of highlights
but brass purposes this podcast I think
one of the interesting highlights and we
talked about this a little before is
that Andy Rubin came I interviewed him
on stage he as you know is the guy who
invented Android and then sold it to
Google and then ran it at Google for its
most you know kind of its launch and
then follow-on period for about what ten
years yeah and really built the Android
organization the Android ecosystem and
but before that he had another
smartphone called the the sidekick he
really wanted to call it the hip hop
which was the codename the cool kids
called it the hip hop no t-mobile vetoed
it on them and and when you would go
into their headquarters it was maybe 40
mobiles renegade baby behind yeah he's a
pro hip hop signs all over the place but
company was called danger and it was
kind of it was a cool thing so Andy
knows a lot about engineering he knows a
lot about heart he loves hardware he has
a company it's kind of an incubator for
hardware other hardware companies and
then part of it he explained on stage as
a studio where I guess they fiddled with
their own things he loves robots he has
some robotic stuff that we didn't talk
too much about we didn't talk too much
about it because they announced the day
of his interview that they were bringing
out a phone and a home device like the
ones who have been - maybe not like
maybe better who knows they're talking
about and it's this ambien OS you
mentioned and you know the phone is well
dieter what did you think of the pump
yeah but I think the only two people who
don't work at that company who like play
with them right so we're just think I
thought that it felt a lot like a
contrition
no it's a phone that knows what it is
and that's a weird thing to say but it's
it's kind of square and blocky it
doesn't try to have rounded edges it's
got a ceramic back but it just feels
like glass but that's all like standard
stuff honestly well titanium titanium
sure I I want to be more impressed with
titanium but it's like it's another
metal like I don't they make Joe Penna
dieter bone with just on the metal yes
yeah they make jet not Liam they get out
of my face
ceramic get out of here but the the
gimmick insofar as are like it has a
thing that differentiates it is one it's
made by an a/d Ruben - it has a couple
of pogo pins on the back and a little
magnet like Mickey your what - Pogo pin
logo Palin is a little spring loaded
metal contact that you can use to charge
things without having to like actually
plug it into a jack can I just - thank
you some inside baseball here yeah so
well it's like has any onstage she's
like talking Andy Andy agrees with Walt
to let us publish a bunch of information
about this device yeah tonight before
which is like very normal journalism
stuff well lets us know that this deal
has been made I would say 12:30 a.m. the
night before dieter and I are sitting in
the bar my name bars always 3 a.m. in
the Austrian we're sitting in a bargain
or with like you know the c-suite our
company like drinking whiskey we going
to call from Walt and he's like good to
work so you're not a true story what we
did for dinner and I truck it but you
understand I called you five minutes
after huh from Andy I'm sure not like I
was like I'll watch a TV show and then
I'll call him five minutes
Sabir are furiously blogging and work
and we just keep saying the word that
drinking an ordinary I don't my mom's
listening to it we're we just ate a
whole bunch of skittles and we just kept
saying the word pogo pins I did just get
getting increasingly funny saga bins by
the way are not funny i case you're
wondering they're just small
spring-loaded pins
yeah yeah but a
the plugger pants are just there for
peace or the story really ends on a low
note a reality of code opens sets in
what they're there to do is charge up a
bunch of modules because he's trying to
make a modular ecosystem of things that
you can clip on to the phone or to the
home speaker tear wall or to your sister
like I like whatever he wants like what
else very strange energy was our
environments everywhere oh my god very
nerdy i/o happening and think of fun
while inevitable technology behind the
module I'm just going to keep powering
through this yeah keep going Pogo pin
fro do it I think was better than we
just said his name now he would eat me
good okay keep talking other than the
fact that his name is Andy Rubin what
makes him think that he can launch a
brand-new OS a home speaker and Android
phone and have any of them actually be
successful okay so I think that that is
the key question here's my take on it
so the phone is a little bit of an
outlier I think he just want I well I
know this he wanted to do a phone he's
wanted to do a phone for years now he
said in his blog post which also ran an
oddly as a print ad I mean look I worked
for print newspaper for a long time so
I'm not going to knock print but for guy
like him to buy a print ad and the Wall
Street Journal in New York Times is a
little bit odd we're looking for when
you open the New York Times nowadays is
self relief I think nobody you want
relief from the news so there I go
anyway he criticized Android and Android
phones I think he said Android makes you
fight with yourself with something and
and he said on phase of you there are no
good Android phone yeah so he wanted to
make a phone I think at roughly the same
time or a little bit afterward he got
this idea for this broader vision which
is really amazing so the phone is
Android it's a nice Android phone it
could have been a nexus or a pixel
coming out of Google if he still was
there he probably would have done the
thing with the pins on one of those
I think the you have to show you have to
put that to one side the real story of
what Andy is trying to do at this is
company which is called the central is
is the ambient OS new platform designed
for the era where we're heading toward
ambient computing we're heading toward
the computer kind of controlling
everything and being less of an object
that you're focused on and being more of
a you know I think ultimately the the
carpets the walls your clothing
everything will have sensors and chips
and you won't be talking into his device
or the home pod or the echo or the
Google home just be sort of like you and
I book uses phrase and columns in the
last few months it'll be like on the
Starship Enterprise you to speak and the
thing has a big it will talk back to you
and if it needs to can throw something
on a giant screen so I think that's a
ways out but the steps along the way are
to try to be ambient so I don't know
what this OS is going to look like and I
don't think I mean he and his team may
have some rough idea but I don't know
but I think his intention is for it to
be different than Android and iOS not
just because it would be insane if it
wasn't different but because he's aiming
at a different thing obviously Google
and Apple think they can get there with
her with modifications of what they've
got obviously he thinks it's better to
start fresh and also maybe there's some
legal issues I don't know but that's so
that I think that's the more important
thing and I I don't think the home
device is his last device that he's
going to try to do I think he's going to
try to do a kind of hardware ecosystem
backed up by this new software platform
but will UPS what seems to be a
microphone you have to have the phone
right the mellor what he made the point
you don't have that problem for the rest
of the network
if you are trying to watch this kind of
body regardless of what happens in
future handy computing I think the
screen in your pocket is tremendously
important I think yeah for the next ten
years I would agree with you yeah short
and then we'll just fill the screens
into our arms and then
neither sister well Wireless Exhibit A
with all she was a very nice person but
no but like if he wants to build this
ecosystem of things having the phone
under his control means he's going to
put essentials assistant onto that song
if we'd even mentioned that kealoha he
has anna city wants to do an assistant
also but his home device he claims he
claims it will interoperate with Siri
Google assistant Cortana yeah I don't
know Bixby which is the Samsung one I
mean I say onstage well what's it a
bunch of them and then he said I didn't
mention Bixby and Andy Rubin said thank
you for not mentioning it because can we
can we get him to record his phone call
when he calls up Tim Cook and asks him
to put Siri on his snake they're running
MVNOs what I would love to be a fly on
that one this is like the big question
and I Walt and I basically just directly
threatened eater that we'd make him talk
about the open web no con but I'm going
to come at it sideways we're now
entering a world you brought up the one
true answer earlier so you asked Google
for a question that you kind of don't
know why it's going to give you the
answer right is it it's easier which we
see it on so you're easier if you can
see illiteracy this is promoted
advertising Google stuff and here
presumably is what the algorithm that
you know everyone tries to game has
delivered to you here's some other stuff
here are some YouTube videos you know
where that stuff is coming from because
you see it all in context with an
assistant you get one true answer
there's been a lot of criticism
particularly of Google and how they
deliver lunch I answer but all of these
assistants are fragmented in extremely
serious ways like do you see that ever
interoperating the way that the web has
trained us all to see you know in our
operable devices and services I mean the
way I see it the metaphor is think of
the assistants as your browser so like
Alexa is navigator and sure they're
pretty has a firebox serious Safari
Google is chrome right and the stuff
that they go out to get is you know web
pages and early
information off the web the thing that
makes navigator Thunder why hello I'm
school that's good man a vagator in
Safari one at Chrome version how many
people in the audience were alive when
navigator was a big deal yeah one all
right here a lot if you got a thing in
your car graphic a lot of not raised
hand a lot of people furiously googling
the thing that makes I think it makes
all those browsers work is when you make
a web page you're like I'm making this
web page that it's going to work in this
way it's going to here to the spec it's
gonna here's where the header is here's
where this is and they're all
standardized and they all everybody
agrees is what it looks like when you
ask an assistant to go get you
information the thing that the assistant
goes and seeks out is not standardized
at all and the big question I have for
Apple and Google and Amazon and
Microsoft and essential and who else is
making assistants and Amazon or favorite
robot comm and it sounds like a dog
machines just none of them so far as I
can tell are talking to each other about
how this assistant should interoperate
with apps or with information on the web
or anything else they're all just racing
to build the best algorithm for their
assistants to figure the stuff out on
their own and build it builds deals on
the backend to make all of their you
know assistants get you the information
and so one of the things is that I made
this our current tech revolution happen
was that there was for a period I don't
know if it still is here but there was
for a period a big open web where
everybody competed on a level playing
field and you know as long as they could
like pay for servers to keep their
website running if they just made a
better product customers could just go
to them and nobody would stop them
like for instance to travel sites yes
what is the number one travel site and I
don't know the answer to this as of this
moment but I know it has changed yeah
every couple years Hipmunk
kayak whatever something separately Abed
right in a world of ambient computing
where you don't know how that
information gets to your computer and
like if anybody is like we're
to make sure there's a standard for it I
don't know that we have that open web
thing and I actually even Google who
says they want to follow that model I
don't know if I trust that they're
actually doing it well and and you know
one of the limitations of Syria and I
think they've actually one of the things
they've actually fixed a little bit
still have a lot more work to do is they
started Syria the company before after
bought an apple kept this relationship
they had to deal with this outfit
WolframAlpha which is a very I think a
very high quality but very but it's
limited in what it kinds of things it
knows repository of you know site that
has a lot of information on it and
that's the that's where it initially
drew a lot of answers then they did a
deal with being and for wild thing was
you know in a very serious race they
never caught Google but they were
pouring a lot of money and so they were
you know they had a plausible base I
think now I mean I far as I can tell
Microsoft has not if you're listening
Microsoft I'm not saying you've
officially given up on being but I think
as a priority it's certainly a much
lower priority than it once was at
Microsoft and but it's what Siri goes to
for a lot of information because Apple
and Google are competitors so they're
going to have to figure all that out in
it so your points I agree all your
points about the web I think we can't
close off this part of the discussion
are we done yet by the way our last
thanks we can't close up this part of
discussion without talking about privacy
and security because I think they're
really important there really is no
proof independent proof that I've ever
seen that these things are not listening
and are not recording what you say until
you say the wake word they all say don't
worry even though this is set up in your
bedroom or your kitchen or wherever and
Amazon's putting cameras on it man yeah
the Amazon has one that is called the
echo show that they actually want you to
use in your bedroom because they it can
show whether your looks great
is the camera I'm sorry yeah I'm sorry
the look and supposedly it has the
intelligence to say whether you look
good in whatever you're wearing but I
think of Amazon I think a computer
telling me about yeah right exactly
in your bedroom so you know there's I
don't I don't think Amazon would do this
based on what I know about Jeff Bezos
and the company but there's no actual
guarantee that somebody at Amazon didn't
make a mistake
somehow they aren't listening and even
if they're being perfect and they don't
ever do anything until you say Alexa and
by the way I'm not singling them out it
could be just they made this thing for
your bedroom with a camera I don't know
but kind of aggressive it's an
aggressive move but the the others will
have the same issue so the other problem
is hacking what I mean what's to stop
someone even if all these companies are
doing exactly what they say and they're
being really scrupulous about it what is
to stop somebody from hacking into
either the servers or somehow into the
devices and there's no it's not just
hacking it because it is there's also
governments like yeah I consider the
knackers yeah well thank you hackers for
the common book their control all it's
doing with the rest of his career right
okay look right now Haley I know we're
not going to get into this subject I
swear and I'll kill you guys if you try
to get into it but
this subject so James Comey is a big
hero but let us let us not forget no let
us not forget that James Comey tried to
try to make Apple make a version of iOS
with a backdoor and said don't worry
give it to the FBI no one will ever get
it yeah three weeks ago my right about
three weeks ago it was a global ramp
somwhere attack that was based on an
exploit supposedly locked up and some
the digital vault at the NSA and somehow
it was stolen so uh you know yes the
government is a factor hackers are a
factor eight up rogue employees could be
a factor there's all kinds of back but
was Alexa in particular there has
already been one criminal case where the
government went to Amazon and said give
us the voice commands that this echo
device received so we can construct the
timeline of when this person was home or
not it actually end up going nowhere
because I think I just confessed Amazon
was like well we don't have thought
about this right but it's going to
happen again and again and right and
that but that would be venting work that
was even asking I mean that was limited
to asking what happened after you said
the wake words yeah an issue demands I'm
talking about what happens before you
say the wake word I mean there are lots
of people who don't want that thing in
their kitchen or in their house because
they are not a hundred percent sure that
somebody is somebody whether it's the
company or some intruder or the
government somebody isn't recording what
you're basically putting a big
microphone on an array of seven
microphones or the home pod is six and I
what does the Google homeless three geez
just to yeah your book basically putting
a bunch of microphone you're bugging
your own house that is what you're doing
you really you're bugging your are next
I wish I had written that in a column
that's a good phrase yeah got a couple
hours I give it to you guys get to work
you're bugging that's a headline you're
bugging your own house and you're
trusting that a the bug won't record
anything until you say of some magic
word that they give you and B once it
does it will only act on certain
commands
and see it will erase the will only use
the recording guru bits machine learning
and then it will erase it and this is
Apple kind of like huge advantage
because their business is selling you
things discrete right and also services
I think you should all be aware that
Apple yeah but they don't sell they
don't still ads right and they don't but
Google's business is collecting the data
and using it to do all this other stuff
particularly on rising Amazon's yeah I
mean Amazon will tell you constantly
that they're about privacy Amazon
relative to Google I think Amazon and
they collect a lot but they collected in
a particular going to use the word
domain which has to do with what you buy
obviously they try to build
psychographic profiles of you and all
demographic profiles but it's really
about Commerce and so does Google but
and certainly Apple knows what you
bought from Apple but Apple sells Apple
stuff they don't you know they don't
sell you can't buy tied from Apple so
you know there's a progression they're
very nineteen that purchase I have a
question goober novo announces like a
really high-end speaker worth election
see yes is that coming out
give me due date when how much fun
trying to break some news here on the
stage there's our what those of you
those of you who are not journalists
first of all congratulations but
secondly that exchange with one of the
one of the best and most honest PR
people I know is what happens that's our
life what is that coming out soon all
right so we got a few minutes left
before day questions giving me we always
do stay in the state I think we did say
said last show we talked to the big
companies but give these people who
listeners submit advice how do you how
should they start thinking about these
companies which they expect from these
companies these companies are asking for
our money our time our attention our
data in different ways explain like
what's your view of what we should be
asking for in return and what is too far
so first of all you know we've been most
we talking about the and we really
haven't talked much at all about
Facebook which by the way now has a
hardware lab can you can raise your hand
if you love Facebook raiser everyone
person
do you love Instagram like yeah okay I
think this is Facebook's biggest Pro I
was talking about raise your hand if you
love Apple raise your hand if you love
my clothes a lot of hands not like but
love this is love really words is what I
hesitate okay all right that's fine fine
no judgment pretend you're in your
therapists office just no judge picture
sauce guy raise your hand if you love
Google Wow all right your hands an anvil
but more vocal so but I think your
Facebook point is well-taken and what I
was about to say is addition to
everything they do including owning
Instagram as you pointed out earning
whatsapp owning oculus which is you know
it's a hard work company and a software
company with an fabulous app store so I
understand it ah they have a certain I
have to disclose that my wife is where
the audience works for oculus is App
Store it's my my favorite app and I can
now disclose that after I retire I'm
becoming their nationals folks for the
oculus aster because I am the
demographic they want because no I but
what Facebook does have this thing
called building 8 they hired this really
smart woman who primarily is a heart Wiz
a hardware engineer and used to run
DARPA the secret research agency to
Pentagon she's really smart and really
terrific to interview name is Regina
Dugan and she's running a thing called
building 8 and I don't know what they're
doing except when she's what did she say
they're they're going to eventually
figure out or they're working on trying
to figure I can type with your brain and
some others you can hear with your skin
I think here with your skin yeah pick a
body part right
- yeah thanks thanks for putting em in
my head so I don't want to I'm not going
to go through the list of come and say
this this this run buttons which here's
what we with these big companies which
are have a lot of power over a lot of
aspects of your life and are going to
get more I think we need to expect a
very high level of a consumer care and
by that I don't just mean oh if it's
broken they'll fix it if they have a bug
in their software or there's some
problem in their hardware they'll take
it back you know I think what we need is
for the big companies as well as the
small smaller startups like I don't know
tinder or something is one example with
as many others so knows we talked about
is a very good company but it's not
giant like these guys and then a lot of
companies whose names we don't know yet
who are working on some of the stuff the
closer we get to ambient the and there
are these steps if you get a are glasses
if you get a home device that kind of
literally so good that it fades into the
background in your mind and does a wide
variety of things it knows a lot about
you because that's the way it gets
better I think we have to have not like
micromanagement kind of regulations but
we need at least a broad set of
principles in a statute passed by the
United States Congress I'm laughing
already and there's like waltz
retirement role is like Congress
Congress will do it passed by a United
States Congress that might be inclined
to actually be intelligent do something
bipartisan and think it through that
would talk about prime you know we're
the only developed country in the world
that has no privacy law the Supreme
Court has evinced a you know a privacy
doctrine but it's there's no statute
covering this kind of stuff and also
security may may be one law then maybe
two laws I don't know but it has to be
written
you know this you know how many times
have you and I talked about it on this
very podcast the FCC has keeps depending
who's in power they keep jumping between
titles of a very old telecommunications
law to try to deal with national
American one yes I agree with you but
the point is I think is a better
solution which is to have an actual the
law that directly addresses it because
that's 2017 and it's going to be 2027
and we need a law that will will be
worth something in 2027 so yeah to
answer your question I think that's
really important and I would tell you
something I think the companies and I've
talked to some of them about it they
would as they move more and more into
this ambient stuff they kind of see the
benefit of having some guardrails that
they know they can live with it now
ability in the market yeah and of course
they have lobbyists in Washington
they'll make sure the bill isn't right
too bad for them as consumers in this
room in the regime that we currently
live in
what should we how do we how we ask
those companies to get there is it just
by the right stuff yeah I think you vote
with your dollars I mean that's the most
important thing so I mean I'll just be
uh this is not a surprise to anybody
and I've actually answered it directly
before I carry an iPhone it's not I own
a Google pixel because I'm a tech
reporter and I have to know but I
actually think it's quite a good phone I
gave it a good review but I value I want
Mossberg personally value privacy more
than necessarily maybe everybody has a
different way of weighting these things
I weight privacy very highly and I think
Apple because of the business model you
explain their lit much less likely to be
collecting stuff about me and certainly
to be selling it or using it in a way
that's bad so and so and the encryption
is better on the phone because they
don't really they make their money you
know as we said when I walk out the door
of the store or get it online and so
that's a big for me personally that's a
big reason I mean I like iOS I like the
phones
I like the iPad a lot there really isn't
a competitor for the iPad but
big part of it in my mind is privacy you
may have a different set of expectations
if there's something you want these
companies to do you should vote with
your dollars and maybe not upgrade to
the same thing next year maybe switch to
the one that you think is is standing
for something or acting in a way that
you want to encourage and don't buy the
one from a company you think is doing
something you want to discourage basic
economics it's great advice but most
stuff is free it's hard right like those
our attention yeah well but with you
never right calm
where where where we respect all of your
rights all the time unless you're a jerk
in my comments in which case I'm Oh baby
okay we're going to some questions we
got two mics right here get up line up
yeah you can't just raise your hand in
the back sorry you got to come down here
all right we got one over here
Wow there's just a lot happening if
you're listening um get this a lotta
people one going over to stage it is the
Thunderdome in here dogs first we're not
here all night but we'll take this
minute all right well it's not over here
oh you guys turn this mic on there we go
he has a switch yeah I know
hey I just learned it from the birds go
yeah my question is that you guys talked
about privacy and security a lot but
what about Smart TVs tracking us all so
I'm here for you it's like really
pervasive right I mean if they actually
install the tracking at the display
driver level so before whatever comes on
your screen they're analyzing the
picture initially and they know if
you're playing a video game they know
what video game you're playing
you can turn it off and I think it's
becoming more and more important for us
to explain how to turn it off and it's
becoming more and more important for
people who review TVs to say don't buy
this one because it aggressively tracks
you I think it's really difficult
because the TV manufacturers also want
to sell the services but they don't make
the boxes right so roku make some TVs
but let's just say on some TVs and plug
the roku into it
that conversation hasn't happened in a
real level yet I think it will actually
take another entrant into the TV market
who says we're not doing this but our TV
is just as good to like actually make a
change but it's super pervasive yeah
because I mean I have a Samsung and that
that turning death thing off is like
going through I don't know well we did a
whole yeah control off the lead about
how how complicated the UI is on TVs
after I bought an lg tv which I have the
same TV we like the picture on it right
speaking of my wife Edie Mossberg sign
there I'm the only person at this table
who does not have a webOS TV yeah and if
you don't know the depth of the agony
that causes him we're going to use one
that's going to be bad for you all right
over here
hi sorry I'm just recording this real
quick a couple episodes ago you guys
spoke about the fab 5 companies you know
Apple Google Amazon I think we call them
fat but I got my van I made that up
sorry so how long do you think before a
company can be successful without going
through those five and five companies
and what do you think they were well you
know I mean I can't tell you how long
but I think obviously in the first few
decades of this whole thing remember
this whole personal computing thing that
made the web possible that made mobile
possible that it's going to make
eventually make ambient computing
possible autonomous driving that only
started in 1977 which sounds like a long
time ago for some people but it's only
40 years ago and when you compare that
to I don't know the railroads the
automobile industry you know the textile
industry all these things are much older
so I think these weren't always the five
big companies and they may not always be
the five big companies that could be
something that pops up that we don't
know that gets into one of the
leadership positions and one of these or
two these guys may drop away so I don't
know how long it will take for there to
be changed but any changes in the
business and in particularly in the tech
business is assured I just don't know
what the change would be or when it will
and I'm not hoping for any one
particular one of these companies to go
away but what makes these companies big
are they they're all platforms and
that's different you know Samsung is is
a very powerful electronics company that
also is a giant conglomerate that builds
ships and buildings and makes chips and
does other things but it's not a
platform where it's tried constantly
keeps trying but it's not a platform and
these five companies are big because
their platforms for other companies yeah
yeah hey my name is Jonathan Walt thanks
for taking a picture with me earlier
uh-huh no problem myself
my question is I've been watching your
interviews with a lot of people since
fifth grade and I'm curious I'm serious
I'm serious I'm curious to know in it I
mean really my wife is going you're old
yeah I'm curious to know I hope you did
something else I must say not really
yeah I'm curious to know just because
aside from the fact that you are a non
tech person reviewing tech products what
do you think makes your taste in
products and how people interface with
their products so perceptive and has
become the trade that even tech mogul is
really admire and respect I mean Tony
Fadell was talking about the yeah we
paid everyone that well first of all I
meant 10 years as a tech hobbyist at a
time when you know to put memory in your
computer you had to buy the chips one by
one and plug them into a board at a time
when you had to learn basic this isn't
well known about me but I'm kind of a
code I've wrote I wrote like little
games and basic you got her to said one
point and $79.99 on the App Store laughs
a collection
uh and and so you know I'm not wasn't
when I started my column I wasn't
entirely for the time I was pretty tech
for that period of time without for
somebody who didn't have a computer
science degree and wasn't in any way an
engineer I knew a lot about the state of
the technology then and then I just kept
up with it but what I don't know what
made it click but I will tell you that I
got up every morning to read about tech
and to write about tech thinking what
would a really smart person who doesn't
really care about the insides of the
thing and and how the code works and how
the hardware works they just want it to
work what would they want to know about
this whether they should buy it whether
they should not buy what are the things
that make it great what are the things
that make it bad and that was just the
mindset I kind of put on my head every
day when I would try to evaluate the
stuff or write about the stuff and you
know other people eventually came around
to doing that too so that's the kind of
you can find that a lot of places now I
just I just kind of took that approach a
little earlier than some other people so
one piece of advice Walt has always
given us is to bounce out how much we
treat our enthusiast audience with our
big consumer audience I think it should
be clear that dieter and I care about
the enthusiast audience little bit let's
go over here I'll well done out of all
the podcast interviews and conferences
you did if you can relive one moment in
time which one would that be yes yes yes
deal dieter in Neela I would like to be
redoing this one
like Groundhog Day again and again I
know I mean look if you're talking about
the onstage interviews and the TV things
and that kind of stuff you know the
highlight was obviously getting to
people who you could arguably make the
case made the computer revolution the
personal computer revolution happened
there were many other people who also
did and what you don't know when we got
gates and jobs together on stages that
we called out in the audience four or
five other big pioneers who were not in
that interview but who were around at
the time but getting them on stage was
was probably the highlight on stage
thing the one I would so I would do that
again I mean there's many variations of
that interview you could do and they I
think a lot of them would have been good
care and I actually said to the two of
them in the green room before they went
on there's a whole story about how it
almost derailed which I'm not going to
tell now but we said to them from our
point of view as producers of this
conference if you guys want to get up
there and have just a giant cat fight
that's fine too but they didn't they
were sort of like Statesman the one and
then there have been some interviews
that didn't go very well just because
the kit didn't click and look or the
person doing the interview it was a very
smart CEO successful but that doesn't
mean they were good at talking to a
reporter on a stage I mean it's a
different skill one that I would have
liked to had happen differently was with
Mark Zuckerberg who I do respect and
think is really smart and he just didn't
wasn't feeling well
unwanted he's been more than once to our
conference and he was turning white on
stage that because he was afraid of us
but he just wasn't feeling well
literally and we care and I were both
afraid he was going to like faint on
stage and care asked him to this is I'm
not telling a new story that people
known care in fact you can watch it
happen on video asked him to take off
his hoodie Casey because he was looked
like he was getting hot and you know it
worked out okay but it was
I sort of wish maybe we had known that
he wasn't feeling well and we could have
pushed boned it to the next day or done
something to make it a better experience
but I'm like pretty for the audience and
us but especially for him yeah so that's
your answer
uh hey thanks for doing this tonight
guys so I work in the health space and
on your your recent kind of world tall
tour while you mentioned that you know
health might have been one of the areas
that you that you would have covered if
you didn't go into Magnatech and
eventually health tech last week at code
mary meeker included a health section
for I believe the first time in the sign
over the first time but she was serving
the Internet and which I think really
exemplified how much health and big data
are actually intertwined well it sold me
to tell people ask a question oh sorry
I'm setting it up there um yeah but you
so where did you see you know the the
kind of health tech space today and you
know what do you think it's Challenger
or what the biggest opportunity well
look I I have not written a ton about it
but partly I'd be I'm really honest with
you over the years I've had briefings
companies they're doing interesting
things in health and I've typically kind
of shied away from doing a review where
I recommended or didn't recommend
something because I didn't feel that I
had any medical qualifications and I
would the last thing I wanted to do was
to give people what could be construed
as medical advice so I didn't do it but
I did a few things where I thought I
knew something about it but not for the
most part I think it's super exciting
and important and I think it's part of
ambient computing in a way and you know
I think that the FDA has got to get more
modern in its approach to consumer tech
medical devices like glucometers or you
know I don't know just
stuff that people have to use who have
different medical conditions to manage
their health in a better way
but I also think there's a there's an
issue there's an there's a hubris in the
valley in Silicon Valley where people
who are very fit and very healthy think
they can have figured out a way to I
don't know cure cancer cure diabetes
they don't have the medical basis for it
and they just you know there are these
fad diets somebody at our conference who
I don't know or didn't had just met was
proudly telling me that there are a
couple of people to conference that were
fasting entirely fasting for a week and
that this was good for their health and
it was part of what his company was
pushing and I was like I had a little
argument with them
and and so because I even I said how
many doctors do you have but what kind
of doctors are they and you know all
that stuff so you know I think those are
kind of the push and pull of it but it's
it's going to be huge all right we have
time for one more if you didn't get
we're going to sign a bunch of posters
give away t-shirts so don't worry about
it but we have time for one more here
Thanks
what would you retiring it's very much
like a change now there's a lot of
people here who are no harder than me
we're not retiring in fact to us next
week all right this is actually for all
you guys because it's very much about
the changing of the guard from you all
to guys like these guys yeah
I like them okay but anyways so I really
want to know what you guys think about
what the future of technology journalism
looks like okay spend a lot of time we
should all talk about it and and Nilay
and either actually think about it more
than I do because oh I'm leaving but
first of all let me just say and I this
is something I absolutely believe and
you can doubt me if you want but these
are two of the best journalists and
particularly the best tech journalists
I've ever had the pleasure to work with
and remember who my business partner has
been the great Kara Swisher she's
fantastic
these guys are great and they have a
fantastic future ahead of them and I'm
on their back about certain things fair
annoying I and I think so you know tech
journalism changes like tech changes the
principles the ethical principles the
way you do journalism in tech journalism
should not be different than the way you
do journalism in sports journalism
political journalism whatever I mean all
this FUD that's been thrown up about
fake news and you can't trust you know
mainstream media or whatever there's
just a lot of junk but people at these
news organizations are working very hard
and they are ethical for the most part
that were like any other profession
there are going to be outliers there
going to be problems I saw I think the
first thing is tech journalism has to
stick to principles of good journalism
and then you have to go out and you have
to do several things one of which is
you'd like to be you'd like to bring to
your readers news before other people do
but not I mean two minutes before in a
sloppy way I don't think that's very
valuable but I think if you can do it
early and have the time to explain it
that's great because then readers get
the reward of learning something first
on your site much more important is
explaining it much more important
is wading through like we've been
stumbling around trying to do on this
podcast what it what are the what is the
tech industry up to because one of the
lines and it's a little more subtle even
than what Neil I just described one of
the lines is between a genuine
enthusiasm for the technology you heard
Bill Gates in that video which by the
way was completely done without my
knowledge and I was stunned when they
showed it at the code conference one of
the you know one of the of the important
things is to bounce an enthusiasm for
tech with a balanced approach saying
well this works in this product and this
part of it doesn't work and and not be a
cheerleader you know be happy and and
encouraging to the readers about the
things tech can do but not be a
cheerleader for this company or that
country or that company so need to end
it I just want to say I convinced Walt
to do the podcast with me ages ago it
has been just the ride of my life
absolute honor to have you work at the
verge do this show with me and I know
last week you know that the code
conference kara through what she called
Walter Palooza and all the industry
Titans got to say goodbye to you but I
am very happy that the last thing you're
doing with us is having an audience of
consumers say goodbye to their your
audience so thank you very much thanks
for coming
so differences
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
