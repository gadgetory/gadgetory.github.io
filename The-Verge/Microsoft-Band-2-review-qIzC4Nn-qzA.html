not thinking wearables and yet Microsoft
has gone ahead and made yet another
activity tracking wristband simply
called the Microsoft band this is
actually a follow up to last year's
Microsoft band which was a pretty
capable fitness tracker but it was a
little bit more expensive than other
activity trackers and it definitely was
not going to win any design awards so
what's new with the new $249 Microsoft
fans and will it win people over who are
considering something like the Fitbit or
even the Apple watch Microsoft says it's
making a fitness band because it cares
about your health
that's a nice yarn to spend but for a
lot of these companies activity tracking
devices are an easy way to get a better
understanding of consumers habits
interests and lifestyles but there's no
doubt that the Microsoft band is very
Fitness focus his new band has a
slightly curved design which is a
welcome change from the angularity of
last year's band it also has a new oh le
d-- display coded and Corning Gorilla
Glass it certainly looks a lot nicer
than last year's band but it's still not
the most comfortable band to wear
especially it to sleep there are two
physical buttons in the band one that
triggers the display backlight and
another one called the action button
that stops and starts your activities
otherwise it's all touchscreen all the
time that's how you see your activity
checks at time and mainly interact with
the band like last year's Microsoft band
this one has optical heart rate sensors
to get your heart rate readings from the
wrist
although the placement of these has
changed and like last year's band it has
built-in GPS something that Apple watch
most definitely does not have if you're
comparing that as a fitness device the
new band now includes a barometer for
measuring your elevation and like last
year's band it works with Cortana
Microsoft's virtual personal assistant
that you access through voice control so
what can you actually do with the band
well it tracks runs bike rides and golf
swings
there's a generic exercise tile for when
you're doing something else like lifting
weights or practicing yoga and there's a
tile for adding preset or customized
workouts you can for example go into the
Microsoft health app and download a
workout from Gold's Gym or shapes
magazine or even make your own workout
you overachievers here it even measures
your vo2 max something that serious
athletes like to take note of it's not
been to track swimming though so serious
overachievers like triathletes may not
apply and battery life isn't great my
van lasted just under a couple days
especially if I track workouts for two
days in a row also syncing the band's
data to the Microsoft health app on iOS
is painfully slow something that
Microsoft acknowledges the problem some
days it just didn't work it's like if it
doesn't track it dude it even happen on
the upside Microsoft band works with
Windows Phone Android and iOS making it
one of the few totally platform agnostic
activity trackers out there and you can
see a lot of data in the app how many
steps you've taken for the day what
percentage of your daily goals you've
reached your most recent workouts your
sleep data assuming of course that
you've sucked it up and worn the thing
to bed and that your data syncs to the
app Microsoft health gets even more
granular when you log into the website
another good thing about this band it
shares information freely with other
popular health and fitness apps so if
you're into Strava or RunKeeper or
MyFitnessPal or lose it your data will
show up there in a lot of ways the
Microsoft band is a very capable tracker
the inclusion of GPS is great and I like
the automatic sharing of data to other
apps but I just can't get past the way
it looks and feels on my wrist even with
the improved design and 2-day battery
life that's getting into SmartWatch
territory whereas if you're looking at
more fitness focus devices
Garmin or a Fitbit surge will get you
double the light so even with the
improvements made for the band Microsoft
band is still a bit of an identity
crisis on your wrist one that I can't
today is my number one pick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
