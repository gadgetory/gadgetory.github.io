we're here looking at the new Apple TV
interface not the new box but the new
look that's also rolling out to old
devices now it's much more visual than
apple TV used to be used to be very text
and menu based and now it's all icons it
looks kind of like iOS except that these
are the only apps you get instead of the
whole app store the apps themselves are
actually still kind of text-based they
haven't changed much from the store to
netflix they all still look pretty much
the same they have the same cover flow
and you can actually subscribe to
netflix using your iTunes account now so
it's really easy to sign up if you
haven't before which is pretty nice
there's also a new feature where you can
download movies that you bought through
iTunes it's sort of surprising that that
wasn't there before but now if you've
bought a movie on itunes it shows up in
your iTunes Match and you can watch it
pretty easily that way movie the movie
store has been redesigned a little bit
there's this new genius feature that
lets you see movies based on Moody's
you've already liked so Mission
Impossible recommends bond and Bourne
movies and it's a nice feature it's
basically just like what we've seen from
netflix or recommends movies that you
might like but it's a nice thing to have
and again you can rent or buy movies
through itunes now and then watch them
unfortunately if you have the old
hardware you can still only stream in
720p if you buy the new box which is out
mark 16th for $99 you'll be able to
stream in 1080p and that is the new
Apple TV interface</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
