Francisco and we are holding the LG G
watch which has just announced it is a
watch from LG obviously and it is kind
of the standard option for Android wear
like everything that we're seeing here
today it's running just this retail demo
so it's not a fully working model but
you can get impressions of the hardware
the screen is relatively bright the
colors are fine they're a little bit
washed out but not too bad the bezel is
quite large but the speed and the
responsiveness at least in this demo is
pretty good it's pretty thick and if you
were to compare it to anything I would
say it looks quite a lot like just sort
of a big pebble steel but obviously
you've got a really nice big bright LCD
on the screen it's always on which is
pretty great it's in black and white
mode and then when you move it that's
what turns it on it charges via contacts
on the back and the watch band is
rubbery and it's you know it's not great
but it'll do the job and it's pretty
easy to swap it out for something else
again it's it's not too bad it feels a
little bit smaller than the gear live
which we tried earlier which has got
gigantic metal looking bezels this is a
little bit more restraint so there it is
it's the LG G watch it's on pre-order
today should be shipping on July seventh
and it's going to retail for 229 dollars
us
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
