the latest high-end smartphone from LG
and it will be available really soon for
a flagship price now there's some
interesting things to talk about with
the v40 but first I want to set up where
this sits in LG smartphone world like
Samsung LG releases two flagship phones
every year in the springtime there's the
mainstream flagship phone so that's like
the g7 that I have right here and then
later on in the fall there's the other
flagship phone which is really similar
to the first model but with a little
extra on top and this year that's the
v40 now as a result the v40 shares a lot
with the g7 it kinda has the same
overall look and design it's got the
same processor and specs it's got the
same boombox speaker and so on now there
are a couple of differences but the big
major standout feature with the v40 that
separates it from the g7 and virtually
every other phone on the market is its
new camera system this phone comes with
a total of five cameras not one not two
not three or even four that we've seen
before but five cameras between the
front and the back
now there's two cameras on the front
there's three on the back and the whole
thing kind of makes the v40 look a
little like a bug-eyed monster now it
may seem crazy to have so many cameras
on your phone but the way LG is using
them on the v40 is actually pretty smart
and interesting in addition to a
standard camera the v40 has a super wide
angle option and a telephoto camera
unless you change your composition and
feel the view really quickly and without
having to put on any attachment lenses
this is just something you can't do with
other phones right now and it separates
the v40 from the many other options that
have multiple cameras on the back
there's be clear the v40 doesn't just
have three lenses as three different
cameras on the back and they have
different specs across them
the main camera is 12 megapixels with
40% larger pixels than the g7 and in F
1.5 lens with a 78 degree field of view
this is like your standard camera the
super wide option has a 16 megapixel
sensor and 107 degree f 1.9 lens
basically the same as a super-wide
camera on the g7 finally there's the
telephoto camera which has a 12
megapixel 47 degree F 2.4 lens which
gets you about 2 times closer to your
subject than the standard camera and
with the differences in specs between
these it's obvious that you'll get a
different quality image from each camera
and I can tell you right now that the
telephoto camera does not work well
indoors that's largely par for the
course with smartphone telephoto cameras
though now in addition to having 3
different composition options the v40
unless you do some interesting things
with the 3 cameras there's a standard
portrait mode which blurs the background
and there's some new portrait lighting
effects but those aren't really any
better than any other phone that does
them and they're not that great but what
is cool is the ability to preview the
shot from each camera before you take it
which you can do right in the camera app
even more interesting is LG's new triple
shot mode which takes a pic from all
three cameras in one button press then
it stitches them together in an animated
clip and gives you the still images from
each camera it's an easy way to get all
three viewpoints if you just can't make
up your mind but it could be a little
faster and processing the animated clip
which is fun but not particularly useful
anyways over on the front there's a
standard 8 megapixel camera and a
wide-angle 5 megapixel camera but the
second camera is only barely wider than
the normal one and it maybe lets you fit
one or two more friends in your selfie
there's also the portrait mode and
portrait lighting effects up front but
again they really aren't that great for
the rest of the phone the v40 has a
standard snapdragon 845 processor 6
gigabytes of RAM 64 gigs of storage and
a micro SD card slot it's 3300 milliamp
hour battery is larger than the one in
the g7 but definitely not as big as that
note nines monster cell it also has
wireless charging ip68 water and dust
resistance and of course a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack LG has also
included the same button on the left
side for the Google assistant that the
g7 has
the v40 s displays a big six point four
inch OLED panel has good viewing angles
bright colors and dense resolution it
may not be a searing or in-your-face as
the note 9 screen but unlike older LG
OLED panels I really don't have any
complaints with this one most of time
when we're talking about smartphone
cameras we're talking about incremental
improvements year-over-year the kind of
things that are maybe noticeable but
probably not unless you're comparing
phones side-by-side all the time but
with v40 you're getting an upgrade in
what you can do with the cameras on your
phone and unless you capture images and
compositions that you just can't get
with other phones if you ask me that's
the kind of upgrade I'm into hey thanks
