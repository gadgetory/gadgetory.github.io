from the Hollywood Palladium this is
going to be a lot of fun and it should
be right because we're all here for one
simple reason all of us share one
fundamental belief and that's that games
are the best form of entertainment on
the planet
that's Madden like you've never seen it
and I might be biased but I'm pretty
sure that's the most innovative Madden
we've done in well over a decade for the
next three days we're here to celebrate
play with all of you and what better
place to start than with a game that has
taken the world by storm battlefield one
first night Maps debut this summer in
Neville Knights and praised it to her
you'll need to deploy tactics as you
fight through the night in a massive
network of trenches second we're
bringing epic battles to the Eastern
Front of World War one in the name of
the Czar expands battlefield 1 to the
blistering winter in the east and with
it we're bringing you six new maps the
Russian army including the mighty hussar
cavalry new vehicles and weapons to
expand your arsenal and the iconic
women's battalion of death all of this
coming in September as part of in the
name of the Czar now competition is at
the center of EA today and we've always
thought about it a little differently we
believe in making stars of all our
players this fall we're launching the
largest FIFA championship ever with many
ways to compete the best fuck players
will compete in the FIFA Ultimate Team
Champions cups and in our official
Football League competitions you can
represent your favorite real world team
that's true you can
I went early Roger I went early
Rod's look at this look at how the
world's game comes to life in FIFA 18
player personality that differentiates
even the tools from the small they've
now got the ideal athlete helping to
develop the game is to anyone better and
more genetically sound than Cristiano
Ronaldo could you get anyone better than
that the biggest story in football is of
course Alex hunter the new hero of the
virtual pitch and the star of the
journey the journey Alex would go on to
score more than 360 million goals in his
first season obviously we're very
excited to tell everyone about neeps be
payback here today but more importantly
show it in payback you are on a revenge
mission to take down the house with wild
heist missions intense core pursuits
grueling car battles and jaw-dropping
action moments we're putting a new
narrative into the game where you drive
three different characters
Tyler Jess and Mack all bring their own
unique playstyle to the game you drive
across city mountains deserts and
canyons in the most diverse open-world
ever made for an equal speed game go the
idea for a way out came to me when me
and a friend trying to find the co-op
game that wasn't just a drop in drop out
experience I wanted to play a game where
the characters had unique personalities
and goals a game where me and a friend
can embark on an emotional journey
together and this is exactly what a way
out is now what we know today is that
interactive entertainment will change
more in the next five years than it has
in the last 45 so when we were thrilled
when we got our first project
Scorpio dev kits from Microsoft six
teraflops and true 4k graphical fidelity
now these mad and LFA NFL 18 visuals are
just a taste of what can be accomplished
combining frostbite with project Scorpio
new IP is one of the purest forms of
innovation in our industry here's the
first glimpse of our brand new IP
from Bioware the wall its our armor it
protects us from what lies wheel
but out there you either live with the
choices you make
or die trying to change them
the story doesn't end here hey everybody
I'm Sean O'Brien and I'm here today to
share the latest about NBA Live 18 with
you we've spent the last two years
completely overhauling virtually every
aspect of game play we call it the one
it's I'm using my right stick dribble
control I'm any combination of moves I
want I can go behind the back between
the legs and now I'm trying to attack
the basket Katie or Hugh cuts me off
with like a big left stick and then I've
got to go back at him again this time
I'm gonna go middle but huge late he
doesn't hit his left stick misses a
timing window and now I have an open
lane to the hoop we're excited for all
of you to get your hands on NBA Live 18
and everyone will have an opportunity to
do so for a free demo coming in August
now this demo will give everyone the
chance to start the one and be
introduced to this new basketball world
now we got a massive finale coming up
here in just a moment
thirty minutes of pure unadulterated
Star Wars but but before we get there I
wanted to pause for just a moment
last week we did something pretty
amazing together we held our annual EA
play to give campaign celebrating the
importance of inclusion and play in our
communities and in life and by coming
