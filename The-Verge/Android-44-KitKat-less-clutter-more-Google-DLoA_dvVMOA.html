android 4.4 kitkat and the new Nexus 5
now it's interesting about both of these
things is neither one blows the doors
off of anything design-wise
they're both relatively conservative the
design of the phone is pretty simple and
feature updates they included in KitKat
are kind of minor when you look at it
but for Google that's actually not a
problem
they really think that they nailed the
core structure of Android with Ice Cream
Sandwich and ever since then it's been
about refinement since we first
introduced this Android style with Ice
Cream Sandwich right we were really
confident that we were on to something
that we had a center to our design
language that was built for the future
is systems not mature install evel's
what we call our hardware abstraction
layer is maturing so that means that
what each subsequent version of Android
we don't have to read redesign or
reengineering
you know core parts of it and so that
makes it easier and faster for for
device manufacturers to bring up their
next devices KitKat is really about
three things the first is its ability to
run on low-end hardware that's important
but it doesn't really apply to the Nexus
5 but does apply to the Nexus 5 are all
the refinements of Polish that they've
added to the UI the consistency in the
status bar so all the icons are now the
same color you know nobody's gonna
notice that but oh I'm gonna be very
happy
the expanded range of Roboto that we
have now just giving us a little bit
more typographic freedom in the home
screen we may be icons bigger you know
nobody's gonna notice that's great I
love it this is why I love talking to
you guys also notice that you guys got
rid of the little weird tabs in the app
drawer so what was what was the thinking
that you wanted a simple simplify oh
yeah again we just want to make it if
you're gonna add something from the app
drawer just make that after our
experience all about apps the
translucency that's the mute kick on and
that's an opt-in feature so you can
decide if it makes sense for your app to
be translucent or not so something like
a launcher it wallpaper makes a lot of
sense or the lock screen with album art
makes a lot of sense we have new modes
as well one of the we have - what we
call a full-screen immersed
the idea is that the system URI
literally folds back out of the way now
we have that before the difference now
is that what the mode is it can latch
into that mode because you know you you
about fruit ninja the classic problem is
you're swiping in the accident or faults
now we can have that UI go away and stay
away until you actually do an explicit
swipe up together
most importantly KitKat shows that
Google is able to take all the different
pieces of its company and start building
it into Android having the Google now
cards to the swipe away being able to
say okay Google don't actually do
something but have it do something you
know just just by hitting the home
button you know any time that you're
there as soon as you unlock that device
I think that's great and you look at
dealers on smartphones if I was to be
getting smarter but the dialer have
traditionally kind of been stuck in that
feature phone world I had one of those
paper takeout menus you remember those
was actually printed you know and I so I
punched in the number like dialed in the
number and actually figured my phone
figured out that I was calling a piece
of Chicago and I guess I already knew
that I was calling pizzas Chicago at
that part okay fine but what was cool
was it was in my call log at Pizza
Chicago now not as a random number not
the random side numbers so then when
they called me later to say hey you're
delivery guys on their way I knew who it
was rather than saying okay I have no
idea what this number is I'm sure
everyone had that experience it really
starts turning the types of things that
you do to be less about you predicting
what you're going to need and
downloading the app ahead of time and
putting it in the right place and
instead switching to the model that drip
kind of we all use on the web where
Google is gonna help you find what you
need when you need it
and actually some of the time help you
find it before you know you need it
instead of Google Apps just being a
thing that you run on Android Android is
becoming Google
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
