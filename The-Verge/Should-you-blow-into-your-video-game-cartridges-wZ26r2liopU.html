to blow into your cartridge to fix a
buggy game does blowing on your
cartridge actually make anything better
it's the sort of thing that sounds like
it makes sense Mario isn't working
there must be some dust in the way to
find out whether or not blowing into a
cartridge would actually help things or
make them worse
I talked to Christopher grant the editor
in chief of polygon an expert in retro
gaming hardware when your NES didn't
read the cartridge when you put it in
and played the red blinking light if you
blew on it and you put it back in and
you got it you blew it just right get
that one piece of dust off it would work
people do this over and over again
thinking that this was the solution that
dust was the problem but in fact all
they were doing was reinserting the game
over and over again and that the sort of
placebo effect made it feel like the
blowing was doing something when in fact
it was just a receding of the cartridge
that did it okay so blowing it to the
cartridge doesn't fix anything but it's
okay if I still do it anyway because I'm
used to doing it right you should not
blow into the cartridge at all
so blowing into cartridges not only
doesn't help anything but adding
moisture from your breath into the mix
can actually make things worse corroding
the copper connectors and damaging your
games and your console no longer
Nintendo actually started warning
against this behavior with later
consoles the Super Nintendo included a
note on the back of each game saying
that cartridges should be regularly
cleaned but only with the proper
cleaning kit and the Nintendo 64 went
one step further outright stating on the
back of each game in large block letters
do not blow on the edge connector the
myth dates back to the original NES
which used a zero insertion force or zip
and while zip sloths are great for
making it easy to swap in at a game
because like the name suggests it
doesn't require much force to slot it in
it also means that the contacts on the
cartridge aren't properly connecting
you're gonna get stuck with a glitched
out screen instead but there is still a
grain of truth to the whole thing
because while the actual blowing on
cartridges didn't do anything simply
taking the game out and reinserting it
as part of that process gave you another
chance to have the contacts properly
connect letting your game work right
which may be the origin of why people
assume that the blowing was working in
the first place so yeah don't blow into
your cartridges but if you've got a
retro console that isn't working there
are solutions out there that might
actually help you get your games up and
running again that don't involve you
spitting on them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
