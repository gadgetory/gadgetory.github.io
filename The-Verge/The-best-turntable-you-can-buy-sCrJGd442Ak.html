a big comeback right now people are
buying more and more records every year
and it's not hard to imagine why maybe
some of us are tired of Spotify
playlists and iTunes downloads now I
live in Brooklyn and I've got a beard
and I wear these glasses so of course
I've got a record player but if you want
to get into meinl which one should you
get well there's one obvious choice
that's one that won't break the bank the
best turntable for most people is
audio-technica's a TLP 120 USB it's a
mouthful it's $300 which isn't cheap
it's more than those $99 turntables to
find a Target and Best Buy and other
stores but those are awful you should
stay away so if you're going to start a
vinyl collection you should start off
with a player that does that music
justice and the best thing about the LP
120 is and it comes with everything you
need out of the box just no speakers
there's a phono preamp built-in so all
you do is plug it into some powered
speakers and start playing the cartridge
which is that small thing that actually
leads the records is pretty decent and
you can always upgrade later if you want
to there are two main downsides in this
player one is that the tonearm is manual
so you've got actually go over and lift
it off once you're done listening it all
sort of spin and spin and spin the
second those cables on the back that
plug in the speakers are actually
hardwired and they're kind of short so
you're going to be pretty close to the
speaker's wherever you put this
turntable the LP 120s other tricks to
record the vinyl collection to a PC over
USB all the software's included and it's
pretty simple
now other turntables like Sony's new
$600 model also do the same thing so you
can make high-risk copies of all your
records now why would you do that
some people just swear that vinyl sounds
better and they've got a point
final tends to offer more dynamic range
so the music isn't so loud loud wild
like CDs and digital files now if you
want to spend between $400 and $600
there are a lot of other good options
that do sound better but now it's so
much better that's worth spending that
much money upfront before you're sure
you're going to stick with vinyl in the
first place the full Jack carbon is a
good choice and like the sony is a
little more stylish than the audio
technica even the $200 projects
elemental they've got here is no Kate
pic it's also plug and play because
their built-in preamp but this built
that wraps around it that's how it spins
tends to come loose every so often
setting up your turntable takes patience
but there are guides online that show
you how to
do it and audio-technica zone
instructions do a good job of guiding
you through records also need upkeep you
should clean them every so often to keep
them in good shape I always put them
away as soon as you're done listening
so look stay away from those cheap $99
record players at Target they're awful
instead if you're getting serious about
vinyl you should start off with the ATL
p120
but finding the right speakers on your
favorite record store in town well
that's up to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
