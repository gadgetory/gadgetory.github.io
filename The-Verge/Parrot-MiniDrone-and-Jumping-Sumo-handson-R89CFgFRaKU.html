CES 2014 and we're taking a look at two
new toys from parrot the first is the
jumping sumo which is a little car that
you could drive around that has some
pretty incredible capabilities pretty
self explanatory drive around and it's
actually a pretty good time you can tilt
it just like this to get it to drive you
have a camera here QVGA best thing for
me to do I think is swiping down just to
get 180 degrees it turns on a dime it's
pretty unbelievable it has two different
wheels that are controlled independently
of course as a driver scope and
accelerometer and their help it keep
balance there are a whole bunch of other
little tricks they've added in here you
can make it jump we've been playing with
the jumping sumo a bit here at CES and
the range has been pretty great parrot
says it's rated for up to 160 feet in an
open area but here in like a hotel with
walls uses advanced Wi-Fi technology a
o2 11ac as well as five gigahertz if you
need it the battery life is expected to
be about 20 minutes which is about as
good as you expect for something that's
small and it should be quite a bit
cheaper than the AR Drone when it's
finally available
they say it should come out later this
year the other new toy from parrot is a
little mini drone that's the name of it
and it's taking a technology that
they're using an AR drone into this tiny
little guy and he's kind of like a angry
bee that you can control control quite
accurately let's see if I can just get
them to take off here oh its default
mode it has wheels on it so you can just
very slightly just wheel back and forth
with it and even turn around a bit if
you need to move your position before
you take off but the fun really starts
when you take off of course and in this
mode it's just like the AR Drone ill
hover if you just let go of the controls
it uses gyroscopes and a whole host of
other sensors ultrasonic there's a
camera facing down to calculate the
altitude there's a barometer and a whole
bunch of other sensors to make sure it
doesn't crash so I have to say it's
crash proof but it is pretty easy to
control we don't know when it's gonna be
available but it does use Bluetooth 4.0
for communication they say has a range
of about 160 feet if you're going in a
straight line it's probably bit less
than that indoors
and it's just about six minutes of
battery life that's the parrot
mini-drone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
