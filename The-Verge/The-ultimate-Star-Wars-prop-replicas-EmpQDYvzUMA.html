verge and we are here in San Diego
comic-con at the booth for Prop Shop now
you might be wondering why I have a kylo
Ren lightsaber in my hand that's because
Prop Shop is the prop shop that
basically made the props for Star Wars
The Force awakens is making the props
for rogue one is making the posture all
the upcoming you know Star Wars films
that are gonna be coming for you know
the next 5 10 20 years and what's cool
is they absolutely called the ultimate
studio Edition where they basically take
the props replicating the exact same way
that they made the originals aged them
weather them and then sell them for
high-end collectors there is kylo Ren's
lightsaber there is Ray's lightsaber
there's Poe's helmet there's Finn's
helmet basically everything cool you
could want from the force awakens you
can buy all of these things are
individually numbered and each prop has
a chip inside of it to prove that it's
authentic
so this is the ultimate studio edition
of Rey's lightsaber from the force
awakens
you know these lightsabers were
originally back Monday made from graft
lights flash handles and here you have
the entire body of the graphics flash
gentle replicated clamp the grips you
know the d-ring cobalt be bringing here
in the end and it's all like incredibly
detailed and you can tell this is from
the force awakens by a couple of things
actually in force awakens there was this
clamp that had no printing on it in the
other movies they basically had a piece
of foil tape stuck around the Graflex
logo and also these grips are actually a
little bit short on the bottom and they
were back in the in the original films
but it's an incredible amount of detail
both in the way that things were put
together but also the weathering and
that's what's really kind of spectacular
about this because not only does prop
strap make these items they then go back
and take the ones that were used on
screen and scan them again to see all
the detail in terms of weathering paint
smudges scratches all that kind of stuff
they can then treat the newly created
objects that they sell to look just like
the thing that came off the set so I'm
gonna try to not break this this is this
is obviously Darth Vader's melted helmet
this is a little bit intimidating to
hold I'm not gonna lie you know it's the
scene of them film where kylo Ren is
kind of looking over it and no one's
saying Li will fit
what's your story this thing was
originally is sculpted kind of like the
influence look like a skull you can
definitely see that and this item is
basically then 3d printed the final mask
and and there's this incredible detail I
mean there's like the wires coming in
here there's the you know the tough slew
no tests it's really is kind of a
incredibly detailed and frightening
piece of work again these things are
very very limited and they are they are
not cheap because you're paying for this
detail in this craftsmanship but my god
this is kind of breathtaking so I'm
standing here with the latest addition
to the ultimate studio edition line it
is a panel from the lynnium falcon you
know they obviously had to recreate the
falcon for the new movies and this was
pulled from that these machine these
switches were all like kind of like you
know machine by hand the electronics
inside they all are functioning and they
work it's kind of great if you're
imagining if you're in the Falcon and
then you know like I'm looking at like
this it's to the left if I'm Han Solo
I'm not so much on so but it's a it's
pretty great this kind of interactive
thing you could see it being on your
wall and as you know this being nerding
outlet is there and it's pretty
remarkable is to view this interactive
prop that's so familiar if you've seen
the movies this thing basically does not
have a release date yet it's going to
come out sometime this year there's no
information you had about how much it's
going to cost either with Sony more
movies coming out and with the returns
of older timeframes and some new
timeframes it's one of these people
gonna be very very busy and if you want
to get the most authentic licensed prop
possible you're gonna be talking to
cross shops for more videos like this be
sure to check out our youtube page at
youtube-dot-com forward-slash the verge
oh my god this is kind of breathtaking
yeah this is Darth Vader's helmet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
