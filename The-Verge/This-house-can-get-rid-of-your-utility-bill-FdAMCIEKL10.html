that uses all its own energy first and
then if that's not enough it draws from
the grid right now we are pretty darn
free at independence people they build
these monuments to their wealth and what
we want to do here is build a monument
for what's possible a great building
we're gonna see more and more people
having renewable energy and battery
storage together and knowing that they
can be independent of the grid they
don't need to have the grid to power
their homes
I'm a progressive cowboy a lot of people
talk about freedom you know are you free
when a company has the ability to cut
your power off when you're trying to
take care of your family
and just live your life I just wanted to
build a green house as we could come up
with we felt it was possible and this is
a fantastic model it can be done I could
done a large scale and you all you do is
scale it back and you can do it
the challenges along the way was to
bring in these technologies in it it
kind of snowballs a little bit like how
about doing this and how about doing
that okay one what's the best way who's
the expert knows how to do that with our
dual axis solar trackers we're extending
the solar day out to a very long period
of time typically it's about five hours
for a solar day with ground mounted
solar trackers and we get up to nine
hours a day
it's remarkable with the tracker
technology how much we're able to gather
dual access trackers it means you're
tracking exactly where that Sun is
across the sky both vertically and
horizontally and when you add it all up
it's the 40% more than if you had a
stationary amount PV panels these strong
well-built German trackers can go up to
75 miles an hour
before they actually go to a horizontal
and shut down so that they've not
destroyed by the winds it's like this
beautiful piece of art that is very
functional and productive clean that's
gonna generate enough to take care of
all the lighting needs of the house so
this particular one is called a vertical
access so when it turns it actually
looks like a solid cylinder the birds
actually see it we didn't want to be
chopping up needles
right now those batteries are for
electrical outages when the grid goes
down which happens a lot out in this
area what we'd like to do is to be able
to be off the grid for three or four
days if we have no son eventually with
some lithium-ion batteries like Tesla's
developing we'll turn off the grid
altogether we came up with the idea
midway through the project of utilizing
rainwater to provide the domestic water
supply here it sounds like a lot of
water but it's not that much when when
people use shower and do everything they
do in their and their daily lives they
can use water pretty quickly and we
became the first property of its kind to
have a black water treatment system in
San Diego County
we've put a lot into this quote unquote
case study home but there's a lot of it
that I see being the homes of the future
I like to think of the term the high
hanging fruit the low hanging fruit the
low hanging fruit or things that are
easy to do are not expensive to do that
can make your house much more energy
efficient
