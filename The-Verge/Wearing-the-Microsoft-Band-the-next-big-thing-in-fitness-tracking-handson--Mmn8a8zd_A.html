this is the Microsoft band this is part
of Microsoft's new huge Microsoft health
ecosystem this is the first Hardware
though it's the first of many but it's
the first one so the big thing about
Microsoft health is that it's all about
these little bits of information right
it's tracking things with ten sensors
and also giving you notifications so the
whole interface is just left and right
swipes through everything these are
called tiles and you can use some of
them to see let's say your most recent
text message from my friend who thinks
I'm dead or your emails if you have
anything new you get call notifications
you get all kinds of stuff on here
that's sort of a miniature version of a
SmartWatch but this is really a workout
tour so if you want to run you start the
run and you hit the one button and then
it snaps you right into a run you can
turn on the GPS so it'll track you that
way or you can just start running and
then you want to end it you just end
your run so the whole interface is
really customizable you can have it
start a workout and it'll actually know
what you're doing it'll figure out that
you're doing a push up it'll measure
your heart rate the whole time there's
an always-on heart rate monitor so it is
literally every second taking your heart
rate and it measures things like
calories it measures your steps it
measures how much you travel there's
just a ton of data being compressed into
one little band here so one of the
coolest things about the band is that
you can actually download workouts to it
you can get a whole workout from Gold's
Gym or Microsoft or what have you and
then come onto here download it and
it'll automatically start you on the
workout so right now I'm supposed to be
doing a via not entirely sure what that
is but I'm supposed to be doing it for
20 seconds and it'll buzz it me when
it's done and when it's time to move to
the next one so I moved to the next one
and it gives me the rest and then my set
so this will guide you through all of
your workouts and then if you order your
phone it'll show you how to do proper
form it'll show you how to do exercise
all this stuff so it's working together
to make sure you are totally set with
your workout when it's off it's showing
the time it's got this sort of ambient
display mode this is very much a fitness
device it has a few Smart Watch things
again you can set a timer it's also
designed to track your sleep
so it'll know how much rest of the sleep
you get and how much sleep you get
period and it's goal is to combine all
of this data into something that's
really useful for you
the band itself that you're not actually
supposed to do that much of it if you
pair it with a Windows Phone you can
talk to it you can respond to a text
pretty easily or you can quickly set a
reminder or send an email but for the
most part this is about tracking the
stuff that you do it's about tracking
your workouts it's about tracking your
runs
it's about tracking your sleep the band
itself is kind of big it's a little
chunky it's definitely not just a watch
with a band or something like that it's
there's tech everywhere here there's a
heart rate sensor there's the charger
it's see the heart rate sensor is always
on the charger is here it's a little
awkward and sort of a magnetic thing you
put on the clasp is actually really cool
so the clasp will slide so you can put
it on and then change it so if you want
it tighter or while you're working out
but looser while you're wearing it
normally it's really easy to do so that
part is clever but the thing itself is
kind of big and rigid and it's not the
most comfortable thing I've ever worn on
my wrist you're definitely going to be
aware that it's there and with the
horizontal screen - it's just a little
bit awkward it actually works better if
you put it on the inside of your wrist
but then I just feel weird holding up
the inside of my wrist like this so this
is a Microsoft band there's gonna be a
lot of hardware like this Microsoft is
licensing its software it's licensing
its hardware and there's going to be a
gigantic ecosystem of devices that run
on the Microsoft l2 platform but this is
the first one it's $199 and it's the
Microsoft damned
