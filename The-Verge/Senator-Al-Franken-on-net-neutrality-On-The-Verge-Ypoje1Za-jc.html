neutrality I have always been yeah yeah
I've owned I mean it at that moment you
were a particular vocal supporter yes
when the FCC was debating it now it's
well when the FCC was debating it and
then when the house tried to overturn it
yeah and so I was very disappointing
that thing our readers know that I'm I
do a lot of swearing when we talk about
net neutrality God passionately believe
it's important well you know quite a lot
of House members the internet did just
fine yeah but without net neutrality
which is just hilarious that's my
favorite thing i saw i mean House
members will get on the floor and go
like you've seen all this expansion of
the internet without net neutrality why
have it now yeah let's go you I would
calmly say that's we don't want to
change anything yeah that's the
architecture net neutrality is the
architecture of the Internet has been
the architecture of the internet we want
to preserve that that's my answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
