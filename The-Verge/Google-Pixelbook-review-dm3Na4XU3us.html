with this the Chromebook pixel as you
can see it's a beautiful well made
aluminum laptop with a high resolution
touch screen that you can flip around
into this tablet mode the question for
this review isn't is it any good because
it is very very good at being a
Chromebook no the question is is it
worth spending $1,000 on this chroma and
there are other questions can it replace
a MacBook or can it replace a Windows
laptop or even an iPad pro to answer
those questions we need to talk about
the software Chrome OS especially with
Android apps is more capable than it's
ever been I can use it for me for my job
from 90% of the stuff that I need to do
and I'm lucky enough to have other
computers around for what I need to
finish that last 10% everybody's 10% is
different for me it's video editing for
you it might be a great Mac app or maybe
a really powerful Excel spreadsheet or a
dope iPad game now I do believe that
Android apps are going to get better at
filling those gaps over time but it's
gonna take a while I wouldn't go out and
buy this thing in the hopes that the
situation is gonna get better in the
next few months or even the next year
but today right now this machine is much
more powerful than most people think
web apps on it are really great you can
take them out of tabs and run them as
separate windows and even split screen
them and a lot of those web apps work
offline but then there's the Android
apps you might have heard that they've
been running in beta on Chrome OS for a
while and that that beta hasn't been
going well good at all it's been
terrible but now they're out of beta on
this machine and I can report that
they're better but the situation is
still a little bit tricky really the
main thing that I run into is it's weird
to have two versions of the same app so
take slack for instance it has a great
web app but in tablet mode the Android
app is way better so you end up doing
this awkward juggling between the two
things but the other thing to know is
that not all Android apps
run that well on this most of them don't
have resizable windows now the good news
is they don't bring the machine to a
halt like they used to on other
chromebooks some of that I'm sure is
that this is just a very powerful
machine but a lot of it is new bug fixes
but we should talk about some other
Chrome OS changes so Google assistance
is here now you get to it by just
hitting this button here or you can say
okay Google there's also Google search
of course and just like on the pixel
phone it's integrated into the on device
search lastly there's a new launcher it
does a better job of distinguishing
between web apps and Android apps and it
looks nice there's also this pen it's
the pixel book pen it cost about a
hundred bucks and it has a battery in it
that should last about a year you can do
all the usual note-taking stuff and it
even does handwriting recognition if you
don't want to type now it's a full walk
column stylus and that means that it has
a bunch of angle and pressure
sensitivities on it but that stuff only
works in apps that have been updated to
support the pen in those apps the input
lag is barely noticeable but on other
apps it's actually really bad so
hopefully the stuff you care about will
get updates soon now I'm not really a
stylus guy but my colleague James b√¶rum
is and he says that this actually feels
better to write with than the Apple
pencil on the iPad pro the difference is
that the iPad pro and also Windows
machines with its stylus have way more
software if the software support were
actually here on the Chromebook it might
be a really interesting fight as it is
the iPad pro and Windows machines
definitely have the edge when it comes
to pens the other thing the pen does is
help with image searches you can hold
this button down and circle stuff and
the Google assistant will search for the
thing you circled if you have a pixel
phone you could turn on instant
tethering heck if you have any recent
Android phone you can unlock this
computer with your phone's fingerprint
sensor but not everything is rosy with
the software the files app for example
is pretty twitchy and tablet mode can
sometimes just be annoying it's fine for
reading or watching a movie but you
can't split screen apps and sometimes
Android apps and tablet are just clumsy
it's also just not as good at managing
windows on the screen as you know
windows so Google has some more work to
do there now let's finally geek out
about the hardware
you would think that there's only so
many ways to make a laptop even a
convertible one like this but Google's
managed to create something that's
pretty unique actually more than unique
from a purely materials and build
quality perspective this laptop feels
like it's worth every inch of the
thousand dollars that it costs it's made
out of aluminum with a glass screen and
this glass shade behind the lid which
makes it look like it belongs next to
the pixel phones it's also sturdy as
hell with zero flex it weighs just about
two and a half pounds and is a little
under half an inch thick the industrial
design is also unique with these squared
off edges and symmetrical elements it's
just really nice but there are a bunch
of details here that are smart like the
palm wrists which are made of silicone
and feel better than metal to rest your
palms on I'm hoping they won't get grimy
but if they do I'm betting they're gonna
be easier to clean than the fabric on
Microsoft Surface devices the clever bit
about those palm rests is that when
you're using it in tablet mode
they act like anti skid feet they also
do a good job of keeping the keyboard
from touching the screen when it's
closed just look at this little gap here
now the keyboard is great it's got more
key travel than a MacBook without being
too much thicker and I should also point
out that it's backlit which is a really
stupid thing to point out but a lot of
Chromebooks don't have that which is
super annoying the mouse is also really
great it's made out of metal and it's
got a nice click but I will say that
when the laptop is closed it's annoying
because if you squeeze right here and
click the mouse as for the screen it's a
twelve point three inch display with a
three by two aspect ratio and the
resolution is 2400 by 1600 it's really
good it's responsive to touch and it's
sharp the bezels here though are a
little bit bigger than I would like
there are other convertible laptops with
smaller bezels so I don't buy the
standard argument that they make it
easier to hold on the things in tablet
mode so sure your thousand bucks is
paying for very high-end design but it's
also paying for very high-end specs it
has a proper Intel Core i5 seventh
generation processor eight gigs of RAM
and 128 gigs of storage that's way more
than normal for a Chromebook
but you'll use it for Android apps
downloaded movies and games and so on
the other thing is that like a lot of
recent machines they've made this with
its powerful processor without needing
it to have a fan now if you're like a
crazy person
you can spend up to six hundred and
fifty dollars to get a version of this
with a faster processor 16 gigs of RAM
and more storage
now as for performance it's kind of a
screamer usually with Chromebooks I have
to give this speech about how many tabs
I can open up before it starts to bog
down not the case of Paul with this
machine it runs chrome better than any
other computer I've used recently that
isn't some 15 or $2,000 super or pro
plus thing now that's how it should be
with a machine like this but I'm really
happy to report that it is now Google is
claiming you can get 10 hours of battery
life on this thing but I'm not quite
getting that now admittedly I'm pushing
this thing really hard but I wouldn't
trust it past seven or eight hours
unless you're being super careful
luckily it charges really fast over USB
C and speaking of USB C I was even able
to eke out some extra time by using one
of those in-seat USB ports on an
airplane
speaking of airplanes this is what
laptop should be now Apple good on you
for refusing to put a touchscreen on
your laptops and Microsoft good on you
for making a traditional laptop but this
is just so convenient especially when
you're on an airplane that it should be
the shape of laptops from now on look I
get it there are a million things that
the Mac is better at than this thing
same goes for Windows same goes for the
iPad pro they are better at hitting that
last 10 percent of the things that you
need than this but what this is good at
is being very simple it's always up to
date and it's very good at doing chrome
things here's what the pixel book is
it's a supercomputer for web apps with a
side of Android now I'm not going to
tell you if that's worth a thousand
bucks to you and I'm not going to tell
you if it's possible for that to replace
your current computer but I am going to
tell you is that Google is closer than
it's ever been before even saying that
it's possible and for a platform that's
only six years old that's impressive
good to see you you're just gonna keep
on popping up while I do this video
aren't you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
