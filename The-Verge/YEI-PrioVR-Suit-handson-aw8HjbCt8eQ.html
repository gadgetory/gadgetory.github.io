here at CES trying out creo VR it's a
new way to control your video games that
takes the spirit of Microsoft Connect
and tries to improve on it they've
strapped me into the upper body suit
that they're now developing we're going
to take a look at a demo game they put
together and see how it works so an
issue some of us have with things like
Kinect is they just don't track our
motion very well by being strapped to
your body pre OVR is able to capture
your movements much better than things
you might be used to for example when I
move my head to the left or right the
camera tracks along with me it's a
really cool experience as I played
through this zombie game I just found
myself having a lot of fun and very
impressed at how well pre OVR was able
to capture my movements pre OVR is going
to launch a Kickstarter on februari 14th
in hopes of shipping later this year a
full body suit would include legs as
well as the upper body they're trying to
sell that for less than four hundred
dollars and they expect that the upper
body suit only will cost around 270
