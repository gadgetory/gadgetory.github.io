know about the iPhone 6 plus is that
it's a big iPhone really big iPhone
after years of mocking Samsung and
others for putting out giant phones
Apple's finally caved the clear demand
for enormous screens and it turns out
the knife owned with a huge screen is
pretty great the iPhone 6 plus is
enormous
although it's a similar size to the
Galaxy Note 3 it feels bigger than the
Samsung when you hold it it's taller and
thinner and getting your hand all the
way around it isn't easy between the
size and the slippery curved aluminum
edges I prefer using it in Apple's
leather case this might be the first
iPhone that's better in a case actually
I'm not a big fan of the weird antenna
lines and protruding camera lens in the
back of the phone and a case hides all
those things nicely of course the reason
this thing is so big is the 5.5 inch
1920 by 1080 retina HD display which
looks fantastic
it's the highest pixel density screen
Apple's ever shipped on a phone and it's
definitely brighter and sharper than the
previous Retina displays it's not as
supersaturated as samsung screens but it
looks far more accurate and especially
when you're taking photos until apps are
updated to support this bigger screen
you'll definitely see some fuzziness
since the phone just makes everything
about old apps bigger even the menu bar
gets bigger which makes it feel like
you're using a phone for old people
blown-up
apps look fine for the most part but
some get pretty fuzzy looking Gmail is
particularly bad but I'd expect most
software developers to update their apps
relatively soon but you don't need these
updated apps to appreciate the screen
right away it's just so big and gorgeous
and browsing the web and watching videos
on it is a joy video in particular is
terrific I watched a Packers game for a
couple hours in the 6 plus and never
thought about switching to a TV it's
that good of course watching video and
any big screen phone is great so it's up
to Apple to figure out how to take
better advantage of this new size it's
in between an iPhone and iPad it's
starting slowly apps that are updated
for the bigger screen to take advantage
of some new features that make the
iPhone 6 plus almost like a smaller iPad
there's a new two column view in
landscape that shows you more
information in various apps at a new
landscape keyboard that includes arrow
keys and dedicated cut copy and paste
buttons it's all very useful even if the
icon this paste button is terrible
seriously this is awful come on once
there are apps to take advantage of this
new size properly I can't see ever using
my iPad Mini again the iPhone 6 plus is
almost
big has an awesome screen and is also my
phone which is a huge advantage and
iPhone six-plus battery seems to last
forever if you're a frequent traveler
the six plus is a no-brainer the six
plus also has a killer new camera which
is now so good I can't imagine ever
using a point-and-shoot camera ever
again
it's still eight megapixels but apples
added what it calls focus pixels for
faster focusing it really works this
thing takes picture is fast you can also
take 240 frames per second slow motion
videos which is awesome and the 6 plus
has optical image stabilization which
makes it even better in low light than
the iPhone 6 it's just an amazing little
camera but apart from the huge screen
and terrific camera upgrades the iPhone
6 plus is still very much an iPhone iOS
8 offers a wealth of new improvements to
the basic experience of using an iPhone
but there's nothing drastically new here
Apple pay looks like it will be the
first successful mobile payment system
ever but it's not rolling out for
another month or so and new features
like Wi-Fi calling and voice over LTE
might finally bring voice calling into
the modern era but the carrier's have to
support them first so right now the
iPhone 6 plus is really just an iPhone
with a huge screen if that's what you're
looking for you should get one you won't
regret it but eventually the iPhone 6
plus has a potential to be much more
after being on the road for a few days I
found myself using it for everything my
laptop and my iPad remain safely tucked
away in my bag this is the future of
phones and it's a future Samsung and
others have been chasing for a while the
iPhone 6 plus might be late to the game
but it's off to a great start
