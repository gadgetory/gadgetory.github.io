people who always seem to be on the
cutting edge of what school parents just
don't understand them but brands are
desperate to win their affection in fact
one of America's biggest brands Verizon
just launched a massive marketing
campaign for something called go 90
the app is verizon's attempt to
transform itself from a stodgy old phone
company into a hip mobile media service
so this is go 90 it's a pretty standard
mobile video app verizon is paid big
bucks to get folks like comedy central
ESPN in the NFL in here now normally
you'd need a paid subscription to watch
that stuff on mobile here you just have
to sit through some ads and of course
there's also a lot of videos on here
you'd recognize from youtube verizon is
also paying web video creators to make
original content folks like vice and
Nerdist news the idea is to have lots of
live events so we have great network for
doing live video over our mobile network
so we can do live events and we have
music we have news and we have sports
there's a combination of content that is
a traditional television content you
know things like The Daily Show and
Internet content so it's only place you
can get those things put together in
whole and we have a fair amount of
original content that we're bringing it
okay before you get too excited you
won't be seeing verizon's version of
house of cards anytime soon they're
going to be paying web video creators to
make originals that you can't find on
youtube and they're going after people
like vice and Nerdist news hoping that
they can bring their community of
youthful audience with them now what
that means is that Verizon isn't just
trying to create a video platform it's
also hoping to build a social network
when you first look at the app even when
you just browse content social is
inherent in the solution so you can like
shows you can comment on shows or you
can create these these these groups
called crews and then you can have a
dialogue around a show inside that crew
so share that out to your crew let's
dance oh gosh what's happening this
morning like I see some monster dunk I
can come in there and I can i can create
that clip and then if i click continue
it takes a thumbnail that represents the
click and I can say cool
whatever kids say
so ignoring the painfully street-savvy
approach of crews clipping may be my
favorite part of go 90 you can easily
grab short little highlights your
favorite joke or sports dunk and then
you can share those with friends it's a
smart bet I believe what we are doing is
we're in the process of at least
reinventing part of Verizon to see that
around the other deals verizon has done
bringing an AOL it is about changing the
DNA it's about you know bringing
bringing the company around to more of a
technology focus more of a experience
focus they think you know the apples in
the Facebook's of the world are the sexy
products right and and we want to have a
compelling solution for them as well and
not not make them think of Verizon as a
you know a telco or phone company
verizon has a big business telling cable
TV subscriptions but it knows that
market is shrinking and fast now teens
may not think of verizon as a brand they
love but millions of Millennials do rely
on its mobile data network to power
their smartphone habits so verizon is
dreaming of a world where they're not
just the dumb pipe carrying that video
but also the media company creating and
packaging content like this
going anyway they
landscape as you can see creating
verizon original content that isn't
cringe-worthy is going to be an uphill
battle if it was as simple as collecting
video from a lot of other places and
putting them in front of a big audience
then Samsung's milk video would have
been a hit instead it's closing next
month love it or hate it go 90 is going
to be around for a while verizon is
putting a ton of money behind this
project and there are lots of media
companies old and new were more than
happy to take it time will tell if this
is actually a product which can connect
with the youth or just a very expensive
experiment from an aging telecom trying
to reinvent its brand high knees are
pretty weird yeah but gonna he's pretty
cool it's the ultimate recommendation
engine high five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
