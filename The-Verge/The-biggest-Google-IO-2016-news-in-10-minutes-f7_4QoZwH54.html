pushing ourselves really hard so that
Google is evolving and staying a step
ahead of our users this is why we are
evolving search to be much more
assistive so today we are announcing the
Google assistant we think of the
assistant in a very specific way we
think of it as a conversational
assistant we want users to have an
ongoing two-way dialogue with Google you
can ask Google who directed the revenant
the revenue was directed by Alejandro
Gonzalez Inarritu and you can follow
that up with the question show me his
awards notice that I didn't say the name
which I'm glad because I find that name
very very hard to pronounce and Google
could pick that conversation up and
return the right answer so we've been
thinking hard but about how to bring
this vision of Google assistant into
your home to give you a preview I'm
going to invite Mario from the chrome
casting today we want to give you an
early preview of how we're bringing the
Google assistant to the home this is why
we're creating Google home a device
which will be available later this year
Google home lets you enjoy music and
entertainment throughout your entire
house manage everyday tasks more easily
and ask Google what you want to know
with Google home we set out to create
and design a beautiful product that's
warm and inviting and fits naturally in
many areas of the home we think it'll be
a beautiful addition to any room in your
house and we're even more excited about
what it's going to do for you Google
home will be available later this year
another core use case on users phones is
communications but given our
advancements in machine learning we
wanted to approach this core use case
with a new perspective Erica is going to
join to talk to you more about it
Communications is all about sharing
life's moments so today we're giving you
a look at what we've been up to with two
new communication apps that show what's
possible when we bring Google tech
ecology to this essential human activity
the first is a new messaging app called
allô allô is a smart messaging app it
learns over time to make conversations
easier more expressive and more
productive
we designed a low to help you express
yourself and keep the conversation going
let's look at whisper shout rather than
tapping the send button he slides it
down to whisper and slides it up again
to shout sit down to whisper and up
again to shout another way allo helps
you express yourself is by letting you
type less when Joe asks dinner later
that ominous offered to smart reply
suggestions I'm busy and I'm in the more
you use a low the better the suggestions
will become now I want to show you
something really cool
al even offers smart replies when people
send photos to you the intelligence
behind smart reply also gives you a
taste at how assistive technology can
make your message experience simpler and
more productive the Google assistant
built right into alo takes it even
farther so I'm pleased to introduce one
of our leads Rebecca to tell you more
about the assistant in ABBA
so as you had earlier the Google
assistant is an ongoing dialogue between
you and Google that helps you get things
done in your world so I'm going to show
you how the assistant can help in a
mitten Joy's conversation
the assistant intelligently recognizes
that they could use some tips for
italian restaurants nearby and you can
see it's proactive suggestion at the
bottom of the screen there in a low
emitting joy could choose and reserve a
restaurant right there in the chat in a
natural and seamless way you can also
have a one-on-one chat with Google and
it's a big real Madrid fan and he wants
to know how they got on in their last
match so we asked the assistant did my
team win looks like they did and we can
keep going like this and find more news
about the team and just by tapping on
the suggestions there so that was the
assistant in allo allo is all about
messaging but let me talk to you minute
about video calling so I liked it in
truce introduce you to duo a simple
one-to-one video calling app for
everyone
duo is the video call it video companion
to a lobe it's fast
and performs well even on slow networks
and it works on both Android and iOS but
here's a feature that makes a though
really special nocknock shows you a live
video stream of the caller before you've
even picked up so as you can see and
Elena apparently toons popping in there
I haven't even picked up yet but Ava's
right there smiling and making funny
faces I can tell she's really eager to
talk so let's answer it hi Ava hi Elena
oops both allo and duo will be available
this summer on Android and iOS to talk
to you about a bit about Android I'd
like to invite to the stage our resident
rock star Dave Burke Android is the most
popular OS in the world so let's talk
about what's new in the platform let's
jump straight in and talk about some of
the biggest changes in an around
performance security productivity with
em we're making our biggest leap forward
with the introduction of Vulcan Vulcan
is a modern 3d graphics API designed to
give game developers direct control of
the GPU to produce incredible graphics
and compute performance second we've
added a new just-in-time or JIT compiler
and JIT compilation means that app
installs are much faster 75% faster in n
so now users can get up and running in
your apps much more quickly would N
we're continuing to strengthen our
defenses in three key ways first n
introduces file based encryption second
we learned the importance last year of
hardening the security of the media
framework third and automatically keeps
your phone up to date with the latest
version of the system software without
you having to do anything and pesky
Android is upgrading dialogue is finally
gone a third area of focus for us is our
continued effort to improve productivity
so we decided to simplify by
automatically removing apps in the list
that you haven't used in a while also
based on popular demand we finally added
a clear all button at the top
notifications is another area we've
worked on to improve productivity in
Android we've added a new direct reply
feature which lets you quickly reply to
a message like so an android is the
first mobile platform to support the new
unicode 9 emoji standard unicode 9 also
brings 72 new emoji glyphs so now you
can let your friends know for example
when you're dancing like the left shark
while juggling and eating avocado toast
in order to win first prize in that
selfie contest we're still putting the
final touches on the end release and
weeks
like to launch it later this summer
there's one more area and that we've
been working hard on that we haven't
talked about yet and to tell you more
about what it is let me invite up clay
before thank you Dave I'm clay before
and I lead the virtual reality team at
Google
and yeah just to get right to it virtual
reality is coming to Android n now what
we've built won't be available until
this fall but we'd like to introduce you
to it today we call it daydream daydream
is our platform for high quality mobile
virtual reality and in it are all of the
ingredients you need to create
incredible immersive VR experiences so
we've introduced what we call VR mode as
part of Android n we've worked at all
levels of the Android stack to optimize
it for VR now this is obvious but a VR
headset it's something that you wear has
to have great optics has to be
comfortable but the controller how you
interact with VR it's just as important
let's have a look
that's it for VR and Android to tell you
about wearables in Android I'd like to
turn it over to David singleton and
today I'm sharing a preview of our
biggest platform update yet Android wear
2.0 we know that the most important role
of your watch is helping you stay
connected to what matters and that's why
we're evolving the platform to build
even better experiences for the watch
face messaging and fitness with Android
wear 2.0 apps can be standalone
that means the apps on your watch can
have direct network access to the cloud
and that means a fast and richer on
watch app experience for both Android
and iPhone users starting today
developers can download a preview of
Android wear to zero and everyone will
be able to enjoy these exciting new
watch experiences in the fall hi
everybody I'm Ellie from the Android
team we'll be showing you a sneak peek
of a new project we're evolving Android
apps to run instantly without
installation we call this android
instant apps B&amp;amp;H photo and video has a
beautiful Android app but I don't have
it on my phone because I don't shop for
cameras every day with one tap the app
opens up right to the bag I want to buy
I can also swipe here and see more
details about the bag you should know
that instant apps is going to be
compatible all the way back to jelly
bean and with that I'll hand it back to
sundar things previously thought to be
impossible may in fact be possible we
look forward to building this future
together with all of you thank you for
joining us at Google IO
my god
