preference if last year was all about
next-gen consoles this year is all about
next-gen games from the very beginning
of the conference Microsoft seems like
it was trying to make up for straying
from the Xbox's core functions gaining
it was a cavalcade of teaser trailers
and demos with clips from Silicon Valley
stars talking about how much they love
gaming and Phil Spencer talking it up as
the fastest growing medium it wasn't
just about getting games on the Xbox one
it was about getting games there soon
around the holidays not next year or
later Microsoft's strategy for selling
the Xbox one is essentially reminding
people of how much they like to play
games on the Xbox 360 or even the
original Xbox and then telling them they
can play those games again the biggest
news of the conference might have been
the Master Chief collection a remastered
version of the entire Halo series that
includes every single multiplayer map a
halo was big news last year to Ridley
Scott is also directing a digital series
that will lead up to the next
installment halo 5 and along with the
latest Call of Duty and Assassin's Creed
titles we also got a look at a new
crackdown game and a remake of action
strategy game phantom dust it was mostly
a year of big-name sequels with a focus
on co-op multiplayer to set the new
titles apart assessments Creed fable and
more can all be played with friends but
it's also gave a nod to indie developers
and it's ID at Xbox program that
included a trailer for inside a new game
from the creators of limbo it might not
have been as technically impressive as
Call of Duty but it was one of the best
looking games with the show so what
wasn't there in a word Connect today is
the first day you can buy an Xbox
without one and Microsoft didn't even
show it off during the press conference
nobody shouted orders or used voice
commands the only Kinect based game we
even saw with a new dance central which
got a couple of minutes as an
afterthought Harmonix is Camtasia game
more surprisingly we also didn't hear
anything about Halo developer bungees
new game destiny but since the demo is
coming to the show floor we'll be
learning a lot more soon this was just
the first of several press conferences
on the first day of III and we barely
got a taste of most of the games it's
way too early to say what will actually
be good or what most of these games will
even look like when they come out but
we'll spend the rest of the week finding
out what we can about the rest of the
year's gaming liner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
