Pearson this week we're doing something
a little different our whole team is in
town which means people from all over
the world are here in New York who we
never get to see and a lot of them have
really weird gadgets a lot of that is
just our people being weird and there's
also different stuff going on
internationally than in the US so we're
gonna take a look at some of it starting
with you
Thomas Ricker the Flying Dutchman I just
decided that that's your name that's not
you can't tell me that that's not true
you're from Amsterdam right so tell me
what you brought you brought okay I
think your assignment was bring weird
things right I don't know how weird
these are as much as just absolutely
beautiful and stunning craftsmanship
from from a small Dutch company called
Mineo they're located about an hour
north of Amsterdam and it's company just
ten people just ten people ten people
and they're not like outsourcing their
manufacturing to somebody else they tell
you people who make they do it all
themselves they do all their design all
the all the all the craftsmanship they
do a complete line for iPhones or Apple
iOS devices right now so they have the
full-size iPad case they have for the
iPhone 5 and you can see a number of the
cases here and they have an iPad Mini
case like this one which has just just
been announced and I don't think you can
buy it yet okay and these I'm assuming
are astoundingly expensive yes so this
one here this is called the the iPhone
the the the mini oh book is gorgeous
this is a yeah this is absolutely
phenomenal the craftsmanship on this is
just beautiful I don't know if you can
see it I think that the top is a I'm
gonna probably only get the wood on it
it might be a teak I think and this is a
maple doesn't I have nothing to prove
you wrong and it's all just going so all
the wood comes from managed forests so
it's as as sustainable as you can expect
as you can hope but they replant and
Sunday dad but these are I mean there's
a magnetic close can unit yeah
just that's phenomenal it's gonna work
but this craftsmanship is absolutely
beautiful yeah this one I love that it
like it rolls up here it's you and it's
all of these feel like I see these and
they seem really precious but none of
them feel particularly breakable or no
and the super premium and it you know it
acts like the the Apple cover as you
would expect it to they are expensive
though this one here is $190 which is
pretty yeah expensive for a case serious
yeah this one over here is about 90 I
think after the European after the Euro
transit translation and then the iPad
Mini one comes in and around 80 I think
so not too bad but this is I mean it's
all handcrafted it is phenomenal is
absolutely fun on the way they put our
logo on right will they do that for
anybody oh yeah here this is it's the I
would five there's a feeling there's a
lot of things called the I would five
yeah but this is the mini Oh Cobra which
is nice because it's like the Shelby
Cobra design it's really beautiful I
think and you can get all these two
macaws and you can actually customize
these cases so this one here you can you
can have as many strips of different
colors as you want so you can actually
do the Cobra in this design and really
unbelievable wars so does this company
just happen to be Dutch sure is there's
something sort of about where you are
from that makes people pay lots of money
for I don't sound like a thing
oh just spoke excellent yeah expert
craftsmen I mean think about the wooden
shoes and this is Jo this is the this is
the next iteration 2013 wooden shoes
okay okay so you're something else to
wait yeah a new gap so this is that this
was a Kickstarter project this is a
company called waka waka which means let
me see if I could if I can remember this
it some shine bright really in Swahili
okay isn't that also what Fozzie Bear
says Henry on okay but this is amazing
cuz um if you if you camp this is a
phenomenal little device it's a it's a
light it's a battery so you can charge
all your USB devices so cool and it's
solar powered so you can charge it off
of off of the sunlight or you could
there's a micro USB and you can just
charge it off the main so you just leave
it on the table all day and yeah
hopefully
and how much how much power to get out
of this so this is a 22 milliamp Hertz
battery inside it charges the company
claims that if it's pointed directly at
the Sun at that was a latitude longitude
of New York City it'll charge at about 8
and a half hours okay that in my own
experience I've just said it in a room
that gets direct sunlight about three or
four hours out of the day and I just
said it there I didn't like I didn't I
didn't adjust it so it turned white Sun
or anything directly right I just left
it in the room and I came back after a
day and it was about half charged okay
now when this thing's fully charged
it'll recharge an iPhone to 100% and
you'll still have two out of four dots
remaining which is pretty good yeah
that's a lot you can get it's a light
too right
yeah okay so you touch it once and you
get the you get the four indicators to
see how much batteries left you touch it
again and then you the flashlight and
the flashlight is adjustable to multiple
levels and then if you press and hold on
the see if this works then you get the
universal distress yeah that's what else
that's kind of genius yeah so it's great
for camping no / - battery's dead yeah
SOS yes that's the worst thing that
happens you recognize right you
recognize that just automatically I know
I should but I don't know now here's
here's the thing so the company behind
this has a foundation set up so if you
pee if you buy this for $69 they put $10
towards a foundation that helps young
entrepreneurs develop solar technologies
they've also as part of the Kickstarter
wouldn't they raise five hundred
thousand I think and that allowed them
to send 10,000 of these things to Haiti
because three years after the earthquake
they still have like 300,000 people who
are without light so they sent these
down but they've also they've had
buy-one-get-one offers and all these
things and so what they do is they ship
these things to developing nations now
this has two things right it has a
battery and it has the lights in like
1.5 billion households around the world
still or not actually 1.5 billion people
around the world do not have electricity
at all
and then there's millions more that live
in brownout situations so something like
this is amazing because you know people
light their homes with kerosene lamps
which are there's a health hazard
there's an environmental hazard too
and in developing nations are used
mobile phones for everything I mean we
use them for social media and for doing
fun things playing game right but these
people they do their banking they do
like farmers will check crop prices and
find the best price for their fields and
then use that to sell it so the mobile
phones are incredibly important to them
so to give them a device so that they
can charge a mobile and like their homes
is amazing for not a lot of money yeah
and one of the other things about this
is these solar panels they're they're
super efficient they're like twenty two
percent efficiency and part of that is
through a deal with innovation it's
another Dutch company that makes these
power management chips um so they claim
to be the most efficient device of this
kind available so yeah this is just a
it's it's so it's def technology it's
Dutch design and they're very proud of
it and it's not even shoes
Thomas Ricker thank you very much thank
you up next he's from Japan but he's
also from Canada he's canapa knees
that's actually what he told me Jeff
Blagdon Jeff hello hello and what in
God's name is that it's funny you should
ask that this is a TV hand actually
could have guessed that so you know how
difficult it can be to control the TV
this is like the beginning of your keep
going so like there's a lot of buttons
there's a lot of complexity there and
what the TV hand tries to do is
basically solve that problem with some
simple gesture based interface so you
just is like a universal remote control
only crazy yes only better um so what
does he do so you pointed out to TV and
just waggle it back and forth but you
can change the volume you can change the
channel if you turn the switch you can
turn the TV on and off just by it just
by the way down okay just pure waggle I
just really like the idea that you're
pointing you're like no no TV no no and
it turns off you show the TV who's boss
yeah exactly but yeah it works with any
TV or any Japanese TV I should say setup
is really easy you just press and hold
the button and it I think it just it
just pairs
yeah I want everyone to be like that
that's awesome it's pretty simple but
also powerful and so does it do anything
else
then it'll change the volume or the
channel or turn your TV on and off it
does it does it's also it also so it
lights up which is really handy if
you're like reading at night and you
need that actual bit of right enough I
guess it is yeah yeah if it's dark I
mean it's pretty bright in here but you
can turn it to throb mode as well you
can turn it off and then also please
don't call it's wrong so when you're
reading it can be a pain to actually
like reach down and flip the page so
what you can do is use the the
rubberized finger here and actually grab
ahold of a page that you can turn page
mean there's a that's clearly a lot
easier than using your fingers it's
pretty there's no question it's pretty
efficient yeah but you were saying
you're talking before and you're saying
this is like front and center at a big
electronics store that's right yeah
they're they're pushing it this is
awesome so how much does this cost
it's like eleven dollars okay so it's
dirt cheap yeah well Jeff thank you so
much get this thing actually this is
mine thank you very much all right we
see it later ok so we've seen beautiful
and we've seen sort of odd and now I
think we're about to get really weird
with this man Sam Byford and I I can see
these things I have no idea what they
are
so none of them look like gadgets me
you'd be surprised I know
apparently so this is actually a line of
merchandise for an app in Japan which is
super popular it's a messaging app
called line and it's along the lines of
whatsapp viber this yeah they're trying
to make waves in the US but it is that
big in its its colossal in Japan it's
like the noodle mode of communication
for a lot of people Wow ok and yeah it's
not really taken up in the US but one
thing that has taken off in a way is a
the business model of stickers where you
yeah they're like kind of glorified
emoji so a lot of people like pay money
online for new stickers and like
Facebook and Perth have sort of done the
same thing right recently so in Japan
because the apps so popular these
stickers the characters have become like
Hello Kitty style characters in there
right all starting just from the app
also neater from the app yeah so my
favorite is this bear called brown his
hair is called that's his name he's
broke ground the bear yeah sure and his
the thing about him is his face never
changes and he's always putting crazy
situations ok looking unemotional ok
it's a yeah he's very he's very
nonplussed
yeah so whatever is going on because
because he's popular you can buy the
usual range of merchandise you expect
you know like cuddly toys and so on but
of course because it's an app a lot of
them are kind of gadget related so for
example you can get this little capsule
thing for about a dollar where you are
it's got a sucker in it and you can
stick it onto your phone and then if I
put it down it's like a nicest phone
stand and you can see he's unfazed by
the right
crushing so that's like I just I need
that it's life I don't even use the app
and I need constantly just something to
prop can you just put heavier things and
see if he ever gets angry about it I
don't think it's faced with everything
but there gets a little more complex
with something like this which is it's
kind of like a Roomba
like a robot vacuum cleaner but for your
phone so what yeah so let's see I've got
a pretty fingerprint the iPod touch yeah
if I put this all the way I like that
you just keep just whipping gadgets out
of your pockets here this is what let's
see if he pulls up the edge and this
does this work I guess it kind of does
so that's like carving beautiful
patterns into your fingerprints yeah
he's just trucking alone like it's
totally another big deal he's I'm pretty
impressed by his you know he's not
falling off the edge that's true as to
whether this phone is clean I mean you
can sort of see trails yes he's getting
there if you gave him a couple weeks
you'd get that which in fairness is kind
of what a Roomba does as well I think if
you give it a point day and a half it'll
Krabs perhaps we're expecting too much
of the ground that's fair
so this is these are part of just a huge
line I mean if there's these things
there must be all kinds of oh yeah and
so I got all these at a toy store in
Harajuku it's maybe the most famous toy
store in Japan okay and like the entire
sort of front entrance area has been
taken over by line stuff really like
that sort of painted the characters on
the glass doors and yeah it's like you
can't go to that show up and like miss
this range of stuff is now there are
like TV shows that's like this yeah
that's like an online like anime okay
kind of Japanese style animation and
there's like manga and things that go in
magazines it's a yes it's it's pretty
strange to see this kind of crazy
mainstream thing just come base
before that or other apps like this or
is it just mine that became so popular
than people there are others like this
one called Kakao Talk which is from
Korea and light is actually done by a
Korean company but it was produced in
Japan and Kakao Talk is kind of popular
among certain people in Japan but uh
lines definitely the biggest so we
what's this this looks like something
you would like that I would give a kid
who really wanted a cell phone but that
you get to have a self that's pretty
much what it is and I feel like because
of line that because the characters are
so cute and you can buy the toys
everywhere that's gonna result in a lot
more kids wedding cell phones
specifically smartphones just to be able
to use yes characters but also but also
in the media as with them a lot of sort
of a you know new social technologies
right so and often those kind of concern
in the media about you know like letting
kids communicate with strangers around
their children is probably is very
different so you can get this which is
the line tell and my touch it is
basically a fake phone oh wow and it has
apps the control system is out of
control so this is this like touch panel
thing where you like it's just an
Android phone from two years ago yeah I
mean the screen might be a little better
but uh yeah it's not Pentel but um yeah
so you can do things like you can play
games you can play rock-paper-scissors
with the characters and if you win you
get more stickers to send and you can
send stickers and messages to like
friends who also have one of these by
like touching their phone together so
it's kind of a it's sort of an evil
scheme to get kids into fair falling in
love with the characters or toys in
general this high tech I mean like you
you just this is a very technologically
advanced toy it kind of is you can touch
phones together and yeah it's like that
so this costs about seventy bucks and
it's a which is pretty cheap I guess but
I mean you know products like this the
price is falling all the time not only
outside toys it's a I'd say this is
definitely at the upper end of like what
you have casually give it but uh but
then again in in Japan I mean it's hard
to see a kid that doesn't have like a
Nintendo DSO right and I think so it's
not really not really out of out of that
rate I guess I would say the
functionality is a little a little
limited beyond I guess that's why that's
why they give you the smartphone yeah
once you turn
well you graduate yeah but it's um it's
pretty interesting
nothing else so do you use line is that
I did yeah absolutely I used to not
everybody but like I mean my girlfriend
for example just we we write in light
mm-hmm just to be able to communicate
using distance of air yeah absolutely
awesome Sam thank you very much and
brown the bear I guess thank you as well
thank you alright and that's our show
thanks so much to sam Byford and Thomas
Ricker and Jeff Blagdon for being here
and our whole international crew for
liking and buying very strange gadgets
we'll be back next week and we'll see
you that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
