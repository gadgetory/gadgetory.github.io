it's called the surface go you may have
heard of it and it's ready to take on
the iPad or maybe it's ready to take on
Chromebooks or maybe it's just a really
little surface pro you know what here's
a question what is this thing designed
to compete with all right so this is the
surface go and as you can see it looks
quite a lot like just a little tiny baby
surface and pro now they're not exactly
the same of course and I'm gonna get
into the differences and before I get
started I'm gonna say that this is not a
review yet we've only had this thing for
a couple of days but I do have some
thoughts so let's start with the
hardware now if you're familiar with the
surface pro hardware you know exactly
what to expect here it's just smaller
but some of the edges are a little bit
more curved which makes sense for how
small this thing is it is a little bit
thicker than an iPad pro which is kind
of a bummer but it makes sense this is a
full PC afterall the screen is 1800 by
1200 and it's nice but it feels I don't
know a little bit cramped because the
bezels are really huge to make space
with Windows hello camera and also I
don't know they're just really huge the
kickstand it's great it's a standard
surface kickstand it works at pretty
much any angle and it can use it on your
lap just fine in terms of ports the big
one the one I'm most excited about is
USB see hooray if you use an Android
phone you can use that charger to charge
this thing although it won't charge
super quick with that you're better off
using the charger that comes with it
which uses this little surface connector
now unfortunately this doesn't have a
standard USB a port and the surface
connector here doesn't have one on it
either unlike on the surface pro which
is a little bit of a bummer but whatever
get a dongle there's also a micro SD
card slot for expanding the storage
which I'm really happy about and last
but not least there is a headphone jack
oh sorry there's a one more connector
and that is the keyboard connector on
the bottom for connecting it to the
surface keyboards so we should talk
about that as of the surface pro there
is a surface type cover designed
specifically for this computer you have
to buy it separately though it's a
hundred and thirty
and it's designed for this thing which
means that it's really really small just
like this computer but Microsoft did a
pretty good job making the keys go edge
to edge so although it is a little bit
cramped I got used to typing on it in
just a couple of hours it's actually
pretty much fine it has really good key
travel much better than a MacBook and I
like the touchpad it's not very big
because this computer so small but it
works really well and I haven't had any
problems with it overall I really like
this hardware but I have to admit that I
have a soft spot for tiny computers and
this is just a tiny little cute computer
so you know I kind of love it build
quality though it's really good the
magnesium is solid and it might be a
little bit more plastic II and it's
finished than the surface pro but
whatever it runs Windows 10 which means
that it can do more than a Chromebook
and you're probably able to be a little
bit more productive than you could be on
an iPad it's a little surface so cool
we're done here where we're not done
here no we got about talk we got to talk
about price and specs because you know
what that's where things get a little
bit weird so the base model of the
surface go costs 399 and for that you
get an Intel gold four four one five Y
processor it's a relatively new
processor but it's also pretty low-end
so you're not going to be able to do
super intensive stuff on this thing it
also comes with 64 gigs of storage and
here's the issue only four gigs of ram
which for most people isn't enough to do
the stuff that they want to do on
Windows now that Ram situation might not
be that bad if you leave this thing in
its default state which is running
Windows 10s mode the version of Windows
that can only run Windows Store apps but
turning it off is really easy and I
think most people do because you can't
get the apps you want like Chrome one
password and the Amazon Kindle app I
have lots of feelings about s mode and
there's not time to get into them in
this video anyway I think most people
are gonna want to get the upgraded
version which costs 549 and comes with
the same processor 128 gigs of storage
and 8 gigs of RAM and that's the version
I've been testing for the past day and
for basic stuff it's actually been
pretty fast and that Ram means that I
can have a bunch of stuff open but that
brings me back to the price the right
surface go I think for most people is
the upgraded model which costs again 550
bucks plus 130 for the keyboard that is
600 and
dollars now accounting for the surface
pen if you want that which costs an
extra hundred bucks I'm not saying that
I think this thing is too expensive I
mean after all an iPad pro if the smart
Keyboard starts at a little over eight
hundred bucks and that's 680 you can get
a pretty decent Windows laptop
I feel like buying a computer in this
price range it just turns out there's no
easy answers the bottom line for me is
buying this new kind of device in this
price category is surprisingly
complicated as a new kind of device at
trying to do a new ish thing in
computers I think the surface co is
really intriguing but I do wonder if it
kind of falls in this weird middle zone
so okay I'm a middle child I don't know
if you can tell and being a middle child
sometimes kind of sucks the big kids get
to do all the cool stuff and the little
kids they get all the attention and the
middle kids they just constantly have to
prove themselves and the surface go it
has to prove itself at the end of the
day I do think the surface go Falls in a
very similar category to the iPad Pro it
could serve as your main computer but
definitely not for everybody hey thanks
so much for watching like I said I'm
gonna be reviewing this thing so let me
know in the comments what you'd like me
to test I'll try and fit it into the
review and one quick note sometime in
the near future we're gonna take a break
from making these episodes because I
don't know little bit tired but I
promise you we will be back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
