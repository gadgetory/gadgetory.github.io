with Adam Lee of beaucoup beaucoup has
been doing mobile payment integrations
for a few years now but they're starting
to turn more to the consumer they're
doing some special offers they're doing
some mobile apps that are helping
consumers get better visibility than
what they're spending and so I'm going
to take a quick look at what they're
doing here at the show
so what poke accounts does is it allows
consumers to integrate their money
account which is represented most
commonly by a car into their mobile
phone to create a more enhanced
interaction and so what you have here is
basically a set of apps that beaucoup
publishes we have apps for Android
phones you have apps for iPhone we also
have apps for mobile web so if you
really work with any cloud hosted app as
well and what that does is it links the
phone directly to the account in real
time I can always see my balances I can
always see my activities but what's
really delightful for the consumer is I
can also see a flexion at the various
merchant offers and loyalty programs
that are going to be sent directly into
my phone and that links up with
MasterCard is that correct
well our our payment instrument is a
MasterCard card that you could use when
you checkout it with the merchants that
way you get instant sort of merchant
acceptance that 30 million locations
worldwide
the idea here is I look at this I look
at this Marcin offer dollar enjoy dollar
fifty off on a minimum purchase of $10 I
can actually share it on my social
network so I can post this on my Twitter
tweet about it but I think most
importantly what people want to do is
actually redeem this offer yeah and
redeeming this offer is as simple as tap
making the purchase at the merchants
site either using an NFC sticker that's
literally just a sticker that's not
integrated with the phone right that's
right it the phone can actually be off
even and you can still make the purchase
if that if the merchant happens to have
a contact was terminal if they don't
have a contact with serval you do have a
companion and when you use the companion
card
here I'm just charging myself $10
that goes through
and now the charge is going through for
$10 and what's going to happen is my
phone actually lights up got a text
message right I got a text message now
what that text message just said is you
spent 850 not ten dollars
you saved a dollar fifty exactly what
that offer had promised and what we
believe is really special about this
program is exactly that that we've
managed to insert the mobile phone into
the checkout experience in a way that's
not annoying in a way that's not too
spammy in a way that's going to be
appreciated by the consumer so that
every time they make a purchase the
phone lights up they look they see how
much money they've saved it could also
be invited okay come back again you can
save more money
here's another offer or they could be
informed of where they stand on their
loyalty program so how does this stack
up against Google Wallet it's obviously
that's that's got the buzz right now
right how do you compete against that
yeah I think there's a lot of companies
that are interested in a slightly
different mission which is to replace
the card with your phone and there are
folks that are very interested in that
that they don't want to carry the card
anymore they want to use their phone for
checkout and you could if you wanted to
right that's right we want to be board
compatible with that vision and we want
to ride that wave as it happens but we
also want to bring value today and right
now you know less than 1% of merchants
accept contactless payments and we think
that there's a way to sort of introduce
the mobile phone into the into the
experience earlier and so even by using
a plastic card that you would still pull
your phone out interact with it in a way
that the merchants that are is going to
appreciate it in a way that the consumer
is going to appreciate sure could we see
the iPhone have no quick - sure one of
the other things that we wanted to do is
not only bring value to the consumer by
way of merchants offers and loyalty but
also what merchants what consumers have
told us is a way of integrating this
this card into my phone also allows me
better visibility and control over over
my spam so being able to see my balance
at all times being able to see where my
spend is is being allocated or right I
want to see wet restaurants I'm spending
my money at and if I want to actually
place some controls right give me a
little greater visibility if I want to
create a fifty to fifty pound budget for
restaurants so that when I spend 80
percent of my budget give me in a little
alert give me a heads up like hey I'm
about to deplete what my goals were for
it restaurants I create that budget it
instantly sort of shows me where I stand
and then it gives me yet another reason
to interact with my phone post
have you announced any partners yeah for
them we're not announcing any partners
right now other than MasterCard which we
announced last week okay any carriers in
North America potentially I'm just not
allowed to announce that right now fair
enough Adam thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
