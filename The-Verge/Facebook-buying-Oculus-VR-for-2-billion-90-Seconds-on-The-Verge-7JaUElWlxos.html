to get a whole lot weirder this is 90
seconds on the verge Facebook has
acquired oculus VR makers of the oculus
rift headset for two billion dollars
that includes four hundred million
dollars in cash and over twenty three
million shares of Facebook stock it's
certainly not the most obvious choice
said CEO Mark Zuckerberg quote oculus
has the chance to create the most social
platform ever the two billion dollar
acquisition is twice what Facebook paid
for Instagram in 2012 but it's just a
fraction of the 16 billion Facebook paid
last month to acquire whatsapp it's been
quite the success story for Palmer
Luckey
oculus rift which started as a
Kickstarter project in August 2012 where
it raised over two million dollars at
this month's Game Developers Conference
the company unveiled the final
development kit featuring a 1080p OLED
display that's expected to ship in July
for three hundred and fifty dollars
aside from the obvious use in
first-person shooters the oculus rift is
so far been used for touring Jerry
Seinfeld's apartment swapping genders
and well Biss Sony this month announced
its own VR headset for the PlayStation 4
dubbed project Morpheus oculus now has
Facebook's resources but it also has
some of its baggage Markus Persson
better known is not just announced on
Twitter that he is canceling an oculus
port of minecraft saying quote Facebook
creeps me out the acquisition is
expected to close in the second quarter
of 2014 however a consumer version of
the rift headset isn't expecting too
late this year or early next and that's
today's top story coming up tomorrow
facebook acquires me for three billion
dollars 1.5</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
