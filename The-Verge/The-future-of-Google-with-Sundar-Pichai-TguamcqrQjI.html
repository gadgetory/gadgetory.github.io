put in charge of a whole bunch of stuff
at Google Chrome Android apps search if
you use a Google product chances are
he's running it why does that matter
well Google's kind of a big deal for
technology and what he thinks about
technology is going to be what Google
thinks of technology so if we can
understand what he believes we can get a
small glimpse into the future of tech
every year Google holds a huge developer
conference called Google i/o it's a
place for them to let developers know
what they're thinking about for the next
year and what Google is thinking about
for the next year involves a lot of
high-end computer learning so this is
your first I oh I think where you are
fully completely officially in charge of
everything that's getting presented has
that sort of changed anything about the
way that you guys run i/o or like these
are like a theme that you're sort of
able to fully like be in charge of at a
high level I think you know I think of
what we are doing in terms of two core
things okay we really want to work on
big problems that helps solve big
problems and users lives right and we
want to do it at scale we want to do it
for everyone the second is our core
mission statement which is to organize
users information and for me in a lot of
that means how do you do it in the
current world in a mobile context
because that's what users are grappling
with for me when I look at mobile it's
been one of the most amazing things we
have all seen but from a user standpoint
a deluge with information which is which
is great they get a lot of stuff done
but we think we can help do it better so
you will see us talk about how we can
take Google now and make it work better
in the context of you know your phone
and if you're looking for information in
the context of using applications how
can we do that if you listen to what
Sandara is talking about you can see how
it applies to everything that Google is
announcing here at i/o photos is going
to give you all your photos in the cloud
and it's going to use Google's computers
to help you search them Android M has
this crazy new feature called now on tap
that can search inside apps and give you
suggestions for what you want to do and
even cardboard is using Google servers
to stitch together 360-degree 3d
virtual reality video they're all
examples of Google's advancements in
machine learning it gives everyone the
power of Google supercomputers right on
their phone supercomputers for you or me
is great at all but Google's next step
is to bring them to people that haven't
had computers at all so I've been
talking to a bunch of people over the
past couple weeks and a phrase I'm
hearing over and over again is you know
the next billion if there's a billion
people using Android how do we get the
next billion and it seems like you guys
are doing a lot but what do you think is
like the most effective where you're
going to have the most gains you know
the anti-peace industry reached about
1.7 billion people we are truly dealing
with the first computing platform which
is going to touch people at scale mm-hmm
at a core we want to build products for
everyone
and so about a basic level at a
foundational level both providing
computing making it accessible which is
why we are interested in Android one
their interests in affordable
Chromebooks and the thinking about
connectivity over time which is why we
are doing things like project loon
Project loon is probably the most
obvious example of how Google is trying
to reach the next billion it's floating
giant weather balloons over remote
regions of the world to provide Internet
access and it's this kind of crazy stuff
that I find really interesting about
Google as a company it's shown interest
in AI robotics and even curing death and
there's also programs like a tab which
combines hard science with incredibly
short deadlines to create things like
modular phones and radar enabled
wearables that are so ambitious they
hardly seem believable it seems like a
lot of the stuff is like really cool and
interesting but it's hard for me to see
a path for it to be anything more than
like a cool experiment and so I'm what
I'm wondering like what your feeling is
about these different divisions within
Google that are doing crazy stuff and
like should they just keep doing crazy
stuff or should stuff be like push to
become productized or become a core part
of Google we do them because we we
believe that software is at a stage
where you know software increasingly is
playing a more and more critical role in
solving things which it didn't before
okay so to me when I look at cars people
spend an inordinate amount of time in
cars these are resources which are very
poorly utilized
right now as we speak you know you can
look outside and you can see all the
cars which are proud cars we rented we
ready to get here is just sitting in the
parking strike so they can't use less
than 10% so we see these problems and we
see okay can we swallow that scale and
just computing play a part in it
software and computer science and while
the effort may seem ambitious or crazy
aha you know we take a very disciplined
approach inside right you know so those
are taught through like businesses which
we are building and it's just to be able
to take a long-term view but we run them
in a very disciplined way our research
can be longer term and we do that
precisely in research you know when we
take research projects like Google a tab
or a core research we never know whether
some of them even makes viable business
applications but we want to push the
technology at times because you don't
know what's possible on the other side
okay I'll admit that it's totally a
cliche to say that Google is trying to
give everybody a supercomputer in their
pocket but that is really what they're
trying to do it's in a gala terian
vision of the future of computing and
even if you're not a fan of all of their
advertising and tracking it's still hard
not to be inspired by cinders vision the
thing which attracted me to Google and
to Internet in general is that it's a
great equalizer right and so to me
always being struck by the fact that
Google search work the same mm-hmm if as
long as you had access to computer with
connectivity if you were a rural kid
anywhere or if you were a professor at
Stanford or hard work and and to me you
know I want Google to strive to push to
do that not just build technology for a
certain segments right for me it's it
matters that you know we drive
technology as a as an equalizing force
as an enabler to everyone around the
world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
