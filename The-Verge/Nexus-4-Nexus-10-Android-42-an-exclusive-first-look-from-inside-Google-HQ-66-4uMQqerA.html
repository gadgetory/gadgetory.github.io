Mountain View to talk to the team behind
the Nexus line of products we're gonna
take a look at what goes into making
these products and where the company
goes from here it's actually going to be
very exciting year for us because
instead of having a single Nexus device
we actually have a family of Nexus
devices we work the seuss leading up to
this summer to launch the Nexus 7 and
now we're going to show you a device
that we've partnered with LG on and a
device that was partnered with Samsung
this is Nexus 4 which is our new
flagship Nexus phone that's the official
name that is the official little leaks
the leaks have been right why am I even
here
I don't know I'm here for you
obviously Android being really you know
a platform but also an ecosystem it's
all about partnerships you know that's
how Google really gets our innovations
out to users as their partners my name
is Patrick Brady and I run our Android
partner engineering team I'm actually
super excited this Christmas because
it's like finally we have a Nexus
portfolio that is worthy of the Nexus
name do you feel that previous devices
were not up to your standards in terms
of build quality I think the previous
devices the technology wasn't there and
we weren't able to push ourselves hard
enough but this year the partners that
we chose really brought amazing
technology to the table and they were
willing to go you know the what is it
the last mile the ultimate mile they
were able to strip the extra mile you
know when we build the Nexus devices we
really do form one team so we have you
know the Android engineering team
building the next release of the Android
platform and at the same time we have
our hardware partners on-site actually
downstairs in this building
working together making sure that you
know we're building the best possible
hardware for our next Nexus devices and
we have the best possible software
experience
what we're doing in 4.2 is we're
actually bringing the widget framework
from the home screen to the lock screen
so that you can do things before you
actually unlock your phone I scroll to
the right from the edge of the screen
here I can go into my camera if I scroll
to the left I have all my widgets here
I've got my inbox I've got my my sound
search widget here so if I hear a song
in a bar and I immediately want to know
what it is I don't have to unlock the
device I'm gonna add widget here and
let's say I'm going to put on calendar
Laxmi in an obviously from any of these
lock screens if you want to get through
just swipe up bring up the the actual
unlock UI and then one important new
thing here on the notification shade is
this icon on the top right that gets you
into quick settings so the screen just
flips and gives you access to things
that you need you know often like Wi-Fi
Bluetooth configuration and if you
really if you really want to get into it
there very quickly instead of swiping
down on the notification station
pressing that icon you could just swipe
down with two fingers Google now was one
of the hero features of jellybean even
back in June when we announced it what
we're doing is we're continuing as we
said continuing add new Google now cards
with new and more interesting things so
what Google now is doing right now is
when you receive an email that contains
a delivery you know deliver details with
a tracking number
it takes that tracking number for you
and puts it on a card that basically
says this package is shipped if you want
to track it just tap here and that'll
take you directly to the website of you
know whoever whichever career is being
used so what what we're doing in this
new version of Google now if you've
received a confirmation email for your
flight Google now you can pick up that
information about the flight save it and
then when the right type and the right
time comes and the right time is the day
of your flight it then shows you this
car similarly if you get a hotel
confirmation email Google now will pick
up those details for you and display
them on the day of that reservation so
you've got the the reservation details
in
so next is four it's got Gorilla Glass
two front and back it's got two deglass
on the front so it's got a little curve
to it the device is really just all
about the glass are you worried about
break these things breaking because you
know glass is a tendency to break so one
of the things that we've done with this
product is we've paid a lot of attention
to how you hold it and how the center
frame protects it so the the center
frame actually protects the glass when
it's resting down here
it also comes up to the edge of the
glass and surrounds it on the backside
and it's carefully curved up there even
though it looks like it's got a little
chamfer on there that chamfer edge is
really nicely rounded so it fits really
nice in your hand the previous Nexus
phones we curved the glass to fit the
way that you talked on the phone
but this device is really much more
focused about how you interact of the
phone so the curve happens on the edges
and that means that it's really well
suited for all the types of interactions
that you do with an Android device all
the swipe gestures especially the swipes
that come from the edges just kind of
naturally glide in 4.2 we're adding
another method of typing which we call
gesture typing so this is Alex white
whether it's you know like swipe or or
not I think is less interesting because
we've actually spent a significant
amount of time thinking about how this
thing should work we do real-time
gesture recognition so the recognizer is
running at all times it's collecting
every grit single data point from your
fingers gliding on the keyboard and then
recalculate and recalculating
recalculating so what we do is we put
what you think you're typing on this
little square that shows up where your
finger is
so at all points in time you're looking
where your finger is going and you've
seen what it's telling you
all right so it's pretty unique so Nexus
4 has an 8 megapixel rear facing sensor
Sony BSI sensor and will be supporting
HDR and we have some cool new panorama
modes that I think you guys will like so
here is Cameron Andrew 4.2 we took
everything out of the shot like we all
these knobs and controls and things that
we used to have they're all gone
picture right there I can swipe back
into it there's a shot fantastic you
know I can't apply some filters to it
right here so I think you're gonna look
great bleach and other things it's right
there so that's done
that seems a duplicate right they'll be
the original and the original will still
be there yeah
now the other thing that we did was we
have these accelerator gestures in
camera now so if I want to for example
change my flash setting I can just hold
and then swipe to turn it on and it's
given if I just want to turn it off and
that'll locate anywhere yeah so I can do
it down here I can do it up here for
since I see a so for about a year
because ice cream sales we've had
panorama mode but we've wanted to do a
lot more than that because we think a
panorama still doesn't capture the
entire scene
so we're barring from some of the
technology that we built for Street View
to build a completely new approach to
taking these immersive photos and that's
called photosphere what is full
resolution it depends on how many images
you've captured into your
you know but it could be tens of can we
see can we see those people over on the
left that's pretty cool
I've had pretty crazy how's it
terrifying I would be worried about that
man we look for the partners that we
really see innovating in specific areas
and so we really liked what LG was doing
with a couple different technologies
specifically around inductive charging
some of their display technologies and
just some of the devices we saw them
bringing out and looked like great
hardware platforms for us to really
showcase the next version of Android and
this is our newest duck our wireless
dock the webOS fed over here losing it
this is still a pre-production sample
actually all the devices I'm showing you
or not the actual final final hardware
because that's how we roll around here
but this is our inductive charging dock
there's an inductive coil on the device
and it works just like a charger some of
the devices are partners you know come
and pitch to us they want to work with
us on Nexus devices and we have lots of
partners coming to us and proposing new
designs we typically look at that and we
have an idea on the hardware side we
have things we like we have things we
don't like about it and we work with
them to refine that Nexus 7 we really
worked with Sue's to change kind of the
grip and the radius of all the curves
and the vessel so that had a great feel
in your hand we did a similar kind of
process back and forth with LG on the
Nexus 4 as well as with Samsung on the
Nexus 10
what is this is Nexus 10 which is a
10-inch super high-resolution
tablet it's 8.9 millimeters 603 grams
and curved to fit your hands the Nexus
10 has a 2560 by 1600 screen early on we
said we have to have this screen it's
gorgeous and we needed a chip that could
power that and the only one we found out
there was the Exynos 5 50 to 50 from
Samsung
with Nexus 10 we set out to figure out
okay well how do we get something that
is just as comfortable as Nexus 7 was
but in this large size and so that's why
we focused on the details of how the
product fits and feels in your hand it
has kind of this camera body gunmetal
finish on it this isn't a metallized
back that's gonna just slip out of hand
this is something that you can really
easily comfortably hold one-handed at
kind of an incredible angle because the
back really grips your hand it's
actually kind of a nice finish it's
weird but it's so you're so you're
saying this is this is plastic this is
just a single piece of plastic it's a
single piece yeah but you're kind of
touting that which is usually people are
like we made it look less like plastic
but this is a this is a beautiful piece
of plastic that is essential to making
this device so light you know a 300
pixel per inch green you know in the
abstract it's just a metric on sort of a
tech specs sheet but when you bring your
Google Play content together with it
what it means is I can open up the
magazine's reader and get a beautiful
high def magazine experience with
beautiful pictures you know very crisp
clear text all that sort of stuff really
kind of bringing together how play
content works in conjunction with the
hardware and the software one of the
amazing things about this screen is its
resolution it's basically print the
other way that we sort of have been
trying to evolve in google play is
thinking about discovery within the
store now there's a new feature we call
the music Explorer that allows you to
look at similar artists of the genre
across the store to get some you know
different ideas of bands maybe that you
hadn't heard about that you would like
to know about when I was a kid my father
had this console radio in our living
room
this gigantic piece of furniture and it
had this huge knob that you can spin and
it would sort of whip across a dozen
radio stations at once and so we thought
like how could we bring that sort of
more of an analog discovery experience
to the tablet you don't wanna make a big
like analog looking knob that you could
flip through were there early were there
early designs that were we're not really
about the brushed aluminum so much but
you know I think it's actually kind of
an interesting thing to to bring you
know an explorer that has a vibe that's
pretty close to the Android aesthetic
right I mean I think we're actually you
know trying to you know come up with
what this certain sort of feel to our UI
and one that is really you know informed
by the cloud and not the sort of you
know literalness of a radio sitting on
your desk
I feel like you guys have been promising
a tablet software for a couple of years
now will you have the software and can
it be a more attractive price point than
the $500 $600 tablets that are on the
market doing essentially the same thing
well I don't think anybody is doing this
nobody has a tablet that this thing
nobody has a tablet that is this light
and nobody has a tablet at this
resolution and all that said it's going
to be very competitively priced what
about the apps one of the reasons why we
were happy with Nexus 7 coming out first
is because we really wanted to excite
the Android ecosystem about the
possibility of tablets apps that are
designed with a tablet in mind for Nexus
7 we're great on this so you can almost
think of Nexus 7 as a bit of a bootstrap
to the ecosystem part of the reason why
you know we've invested significantly
billing what you're holding is exactly
so that we have you know more and more
motivation to the developer community to
do that like we you know we are we don't
we don't go out and pay people to do
stuff like we would never do that
that's not how Google developer
relations works but you know we are
trying as hard as we can to develop this
ecosystem and you know when there's a
significant number or even a trend
towards a significant number of tablets
like this in the market people will see
it Android without these Nexus devices
would not be possible and and that story
of you know what used to be called lead
devices right way back with the t-mobile
g1 with HTC has evolved into more of a
brand for end-users so that is Nexus and
that's I think incredibly important to
Android as a whole in the Android
development effort ultimately it is up
to the ecosystem we can only go so far
by ourselves
