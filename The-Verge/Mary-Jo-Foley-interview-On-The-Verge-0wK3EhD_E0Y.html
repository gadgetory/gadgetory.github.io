she's been covered technology for 25
years 10 years on Microsoft she's the
author of Microsoft two point oh how
microsoft plans to stay relevant in the
post gates era and sure hoc nazi dnet
has been for a week baseline let's just
get around here ladies gentleman please
welcome Mary Jo Foley
we're doing work be careful with the
sofa oh boy oh we yeah nilay during
during the interview neil i push the so
far I think straight on it it's fine you
something any sudden movement l Mary Jo
thank you for being here really really
appreciate so we wanted to UM want to
have you on cos going talk about
Microsoft I don't know if you've heard
they've been the news a lot lately hi
yeah mmm what was that is everything
okay are you all right sir okay good
uh-huh Microsoft has been in the news a
lot lately you've been covering my cover
Microsoft you get some fantastic scoops
they don't when I see them I don't get
angry or sad I just think what a great
scoop not I wish I had that scoop anyhow
but you do you can't you even covering
Microsoft for a long time and you really
know them and all the people there yes
ah they've just announced some pretty
major stuff i mean windows 8 we knew was
coming right we knew there was me
another version of Windows Phone mm-hmm
the surface is not something that was
necessarily like a slam dunk like oh
yeah of course they're gonna do this
yeah what did your take on that I mean
what do you think is this is this the
right strategy for Microsoft in 2012 to
make their own tablet their own pc
essentially but what is your what do you
think all I can tell you is until I saw
that surface I kind of thought windows 8
was gonna be a disaster really but once
I thought I was like okay now there's
hope there's a hardware form factor that
it's got me really excited so you say up
until the surface as want to be clear
yes you were like Windows 8 total
mistake you didn't see any partner
hardware no Suh snow HP I it all kind of
felt the same to me and I really wanted
something really exciting cuz I have an
iPad yeah I shouldn't say what no I know
you actually wrote you come on we're
gonna actually actually if I can if I
can digress for one quick second you
wrote a post years ago when you got your
iPad and it was a guy got an ipad and we
had this big debate when we were at
engadget we're like sure we cover this I
was like well Mary Jo buying an ipad
doesn't seem like news we had this big
debate and we actually ended up creating
was it engadget all yeah we ended up
creating engadget all because really we
want to be able to hit the stuff that is
like interesting to us but not news
necessarily so any I'm you actually
brought a lot of that thinking to the
verge so you're sort of you basically
are the reason we exist when you think
about your purchase of an ipad but you
say you bought an ipad i bought an ipad
in fact there was a headline somewhere
that said blood rains down on the Holy
Land the day I bought my iPad who wears
a bit I just like those kind of really
explosive head lies exactly yeah but you
know the reason I bought an ipad was
because I couldn't find a windows tablet
that I loved cuz they're all terrible
they were all terrible just terrible
like he's beyond horrible I mean it bill
gates if that was the gates vision yeah
he needs glasses right agreed well he
wears glasses he's stronger glasses he
needs x-ray vision I don't know what he
needs but hey I'm go go on yeah so the
but when I saw the surface and I haven't
even gotten to see one in person yet
like I've just seen pictures I've seen
one in person you have I've seen it and
I was allowed to touch it briefly uh
yeah for a moment you couldn't really
use it it's a nice piece of hardware
yeah it is really nice and I will say
that I felt maybe that's how you felt
but they've been telling this story and
I spoke to people you know Microsoft
wraps I'm sure you talk to the same
people and they're like you'll see
you'll see we've got a plan and I was
like I don't get it like this thing's
not good to use on a laptop and your
tablet offerings are garbage at the
moment you know nobody's really making a
great wind it's like it's not just that
the software doesn't really work that
well but it's like the hardware just
isn't that right so it was like how is
this going to work and what is this this
transitional device where I'm going back
and forth and when I saw the service and
I saw the what do they call them smart
covers no smart cover is wrong vendor
smart cover is Apple touch their type
cover and touch kiya hai public Oh smart
I could see how this would work I you
really see this working but but why but
why Microsoft why aren't they partnering
why didn't they go to partners and say
we want five you guys to make these
thing I know I wonder if they did you
think I can get them to make them you
know you can get you can get a susan
samsung to do almost almost they'll do
anything yeah at all or doesn't have to
be making stuff either like take him out
you know anyhow I'm sorry I don't know
where I'm going with this but but yeah
why buy microsoft
no I I'm not totally sure why they
decided to take the plunge because you
know it's not a really popular move with
their partners as you might imagine but
yeah they've been very quiet about that
uh at least on the record they've been
quite well didn't who said it was like a
sister or a sursum okay I was good too
it was uh yeah it was a acer right yeah
thank you honey she yeah they prepared
the idea he's like oh it's just it's
just a gimmick don't worry this is just
a fake thing they're not gonna go
through well they don't have a choice
and what do you what are you gonna do if
your dell right you're gonna leave
windows Dells basically but they said
they're not really doing consumer stuff
right but I any of any of you if you
make laptops and you're out apple what
are you going to sell if you go away
from my desk and that's kind of like
Mike I think Microsoft is neural goblets
and funny linux we're gonna set up yeah
linux desktop that's real Mary Jo that's
real funny you keep cracking jokes
figure this out figure cell linux dell
try dad y'all was doing this right kind
of trying they're like always doing this
kind of feels like Microsoft woke up and
was like oh they're all screwed we can
do whatever we want and they're just
kind of doing whatever they want I mean
they're gonna make a phone eventually I
guarantee it so do you Mary Jo do you
think windows 8 will be a success and do
you think that that what is success for
windows 8 and then what is success for
the surface yeah all the small you know
you know what all right um I think
Windows 8 is gonna be successful on
tablets and not just on surfaces I think
on a touch tablet it's a really
interesting and good user interface I
think on PCs especially for business
customers uh maybe I mean not as sold on
that one so but but business customers
are really important to Microsoft they
are I mean they're really important yeah
if you were to i mean just and you tell
me cuz you're the expert I'm just
nothing I don't know anything but uh if
if Microsoft were to lose I'm to saying
like suddenly it lost its enterprise
customers would it be in business no
okay so they kind of have to make those
people happy video although you know if
you look at what they did with Windows
Phone okay not a gigantic seller but I'm
one of the three percent of Mary Mary
has you talk back said she has a windows
phone I didn't want to know I have the
HTC trophy which is the only one right
now in verizon yeah cuz freising was
like why wait was there one clap I heard
one I literally a single set of hands
come together one time it was like no
come on we have our own shirts we are
the three percent you do like the Occupy
that's us but you know like I don't wear
what how should I feel about the three
percent cuz the one percent they're bad
right they're bad or evil they gotta be
sauce they're just downtrodden the three
presenters still super rich right
everybody there they're like but the
Masters of the Universe we think tit
with women they can afford a windows
phone and then the iphone that they
actually yeah but we think different and
I don't have a knife wait what you think
different have you heard that somebody
yes if we got to be real mixed messages
going on here I'm still curious about
the first answer of surface saving
windows a just from a consumer
perspective it is it that was all they
were lacking I feel like they have a ton
to prove consumer wise not just in
hardware they have a ton software yeah
to prove I you know again I think with a
tablet your hardware experience is so
tied to the software experience you know
like when people see an iPad what draws
them to it it's not the software like
people don't go wow I want that
operating system you know they want but
actually they don't say those words but
do they even think that well okay but
but but hardware will only get you so
far right hardware is like when you turn
it on if it's a terrible experience
you're like oh god yeah it doesn't
matter how stack to the hard work I mean
let me put it this way i think the n is
it n900 I'm galleries get to Lumia sit n
900 no Lou me a 900 the Lumia 900 so I'm
thing at the n9 yeah can they just
figure out a better gaming scheme was
the n9 the 800 and the 900 it's
confusing but i think the 900 is the
most beautiful looking piece of hardware
in phones on the market but because of
this offer and because of some hardware
limitations just in terms of what they
put in it i mean i wouldn't buy it and i
think a lot of people feel that way you
know and so so it will only get you so
far but it helps it helps a lot it does
but what will be great as if you pick it
up and it's also like an amazing
software experience but
where they haven't got I mean that the
HP TouchPad was a nice piece of hardware
well there was alright that's very sad
all right so let me let me let me shift
gears a little bit here well not
completely but so Microsoft posted its
earnings recently 492 million dollar
loss but they had this a quan of write
down of 6.2 billion dollars which is no
laughing matter they paid how much they
mean for skype 8.5 billion which is
insane by the way that number makes this
estimate all right but how are they as a
company like where do you rank their
health right now in other areas their
performance is actually quite good yes
so they have a big growth the
entertainment device division so I'm
just curious to know like where do you
what does that mean is it all even out
yeah you know when I looked at their
numbers this time cuz i look at them
every quarter when they come out
obviously what struck me is what's still
powering Microsoft is their enterprise
software so products that some people in
this audience might know sharepoint whoo
come on are you rocking sharepoint go on
office system center all these
enterprise products right this this is
what is powering Microsoft and so as
long as these products continue to be
healthy they can keep taking losses on
things that they're kind of thrown at
the wall and seeing with so they're just
gonna sell windows 7 for a decade like
they did with XP and like see that's
really it's super sad I media is that I
mean I guess the question is like is
that as other people move into their
spaces that you've got google coming on
strong apples not you know believe me
i'm sure if they get their hands on an
enterprise customer they're working hard
to do that you know as their products
becoming less and less they become less
and less desirable certainly to
consumers doesn't that have a kind of
echo effect and by the way i just want
to preface I nobody thinks I'm like a
I'm like the worst kind of workers I
gave the Lumia 900 a 7 out of 10
but I am excited about eight and I'm
excited about the the surface I mean
from what I saw I really liked it and so
I have like this hope that this is going
to be the thing that the kind of changes
their placement in the market you know
the minds of consumers but but if they
keep losing consumers if it isn't you
know and if they have are on this little
bit of a downward movement in the
consumer side doesn't that eventually
pull away from the enterprise with all
these other forces competing yep I I'd
say you know that's that's the thing
they're trying to hedge against and what
they're doing right so they're they're
kind of still very rooted in the
enterprise but the ultimate plan i think
is to start turning things around
starting with windows 8 it's it's going
to be a long process i think they know
it's not going to be an instant
overnight success I don't think I I
think even in the most optimistic
Microsoft projections nobody is going to
say Windows 8 is going to just come out
of the gate boom and knock windows 7 off
no it's not what's going on with the
desktop I mean I think that's the thing
right because windows 7 has people know
it it's it looks like every other
version windows right and what if what
if this version doesn't stick that's too
weird do they just try something else
you know what I'm guessing is gonna
happen and this is just a pure guess I
know one for Microsoft told me this pure
hundred procedures with people at the
ready to hit this statement if it sounds
really juicy OD yo I um I think you're
gonna see after windows 8 comes out this
October I think you're going to start
seeing Microsoft change how often they
do windows releases hmm to go to yearly
or whatever right to go closer to yearly
if not yearly right now it's every three
years that's too long way and it's a lot
of pressure everything years you get
like you got to come with a big it's
almost like when you look at Apple's
doing they've you know the change from a
lion to mountain lion is really
iterative stuff like a service pack
exactly yeah and if they call service
packs up you know like actual they gave
him names or something cuz that service
pack whatever it might change my picture
what does the windows 9 look like you
can you tell us if I find you I would I
actually writing a blog post I actually
I asked I asked a microsoft rep who
shall remain nameless being it he knows
who he is I said you know we're at the
surface event I said so if this is the
transition then windows 9 won't have
windows desktop and it will it you know
he was like you don't really expect me
to answer that question so and then yeah
and then he winked at you and he threw a
mouse in the car that's it really first
I was like why a mouse like a live mouse
but but but but there's a lot of deep
said below what you just described would
make a tremendous comic and I would like
to see somebody pen that okay a couple
things I wish we had more time we went
if only I hadn't done that stupid intro
a couple quotes and then I have a big
question for you Ballmer said that the
coming months it's that it's the most
exciting launch season in Microsoft
history do you agree or disagree agree a
hundred percent this is like the highest
pitch it is launched at like every
single product that the company is about
to be revved in the next 12 months and
and and then on the flip side well I
mean he's obviously excited but valves
Gabe Newell said this recently I a day
ago I think Windows 8 is a catastrophe
for everyone in the PC space I think
we'll lose some of the top tier pc oems
who will exit the market I think margins
will be destroyed for a bunch of people
if that's true then it would be good to
have alternatives to hedge against that
eventualities I'm smirking because you
know what his alternative was Linux well
that is insane can you sit can you throw
some more burns at Linux my guidance I
could be like a half hour I Linux burns
Mary J I I don't um I mean he we know he
doesn't like Apple cuz they're too
controlling right and now he's mad that
Microsoft's gonna be more controlling
right he just hates control right now
which is why he wrote you know you don't
agree you don't but you don't agree at
this point haven't seen the surface you
don't think Windows 8 is it you and
described as a catastrophe though you
did say prior to the surface you thought
it was a disaster I don't boards you're
off did you say disaster I think you did
maybe I did I don't know um what it has
to be disaster a disaster fee does
that's what's waiting for you
is that no hey I think I think like I
said I think windows 8 is going to be
very interesting on touch tablets and
possibly on touch laptops I think people
who install it on existing non touch
laptops are going to be surprised if
they haven't tried it already about what
that experience is like surprise in a
negative way that see that's very
amazing so very sad those are the people
who are gonna be installing it there i
mean it's not everybody's gonna be a new
pc purchaser well you know the way most
people get windows anymore is getting it
on a new pc most people aren't like you
know techies they don't go to Tijuana
legs it's kind of like we're gonna take
our chances right but I mean but if you
get it on a traditional laptop the
experience is your Start menu is
suddenly you're no more start button
right there's no start button right it's
a completely different experience like
people will be shocked and confused like
people who only know that you know who
are using like it's gonna be a starter
decks are you right now or something
there's gonna be a learning curve was
the learning curve for you like it was
really weird for me it's really weird
yeah I don't I I'll tell you i don't use
windows 8 on my laptop that i use for
work I don't well that's not a ringing
endorsement use linux all right I didn't
tell you that she loves she all right
final final question and I wish we had
more time I do I would we gotta have you
come back maybe as we get closer to
launch every October something we could
do like a round real get some get rid of
these games yes Gotama War II I get a
real table through out here through
Microsoft round I won't be here either
Oh his Ballmer is Ballmer destroying the
company oh the light question to end
yeah just a little like because there
was this Vanity Fair article there was
like Ballmer's just spent the last 10
years dismantling Microsoft you but then
I counter quench that is this whole
write down of the quanta the nitrous is
the end of the gates era yes and now
we're truly in the balm rare I agree
which is kind of like revisionist
history no it's been the bomber here for
a while yes I guess you just been like
and Steve Ballmer is not the sort of man
who lies and wait all right like he's
there oh you don't know the boy is going
scary he was he likes getting your car
Ballmer's in the back seats they just
drive just drive it don't say anything
turn the radio to the sport station
house where else no I I I don't think
he's just been laying around waiting but
I think he also was cleaning up some
messes that were left to him when he
took over as a CEO what were the messes
of Bill Gates left to Steve over a
number of projects are making money is
that that they've kind of gotten rid of
downplayed some things close divisions
gotten rid of things like a cuanto you
know like the quantum was not a great
weapon agrees and yeah we have to write
about Mary Jo thank you so much you got
to come back I will Mary Jo Foley
