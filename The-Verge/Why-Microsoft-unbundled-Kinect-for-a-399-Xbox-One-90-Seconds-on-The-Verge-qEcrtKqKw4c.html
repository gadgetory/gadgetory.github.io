there are people out there that want to
make the choice when they want to make
it microsoft announced today that
starting june nine the company will be
in selling a version of xbox one without
connect for 399 dollars that means the
base model now cost the same as Sony's
PlayStation 4 which so far is outselling
the xbox one worldwide right now there
are only a handful of games that use
Kinect in any meaningful way with
today's announcement the incentive for
developers to make Kinect games is
further diminished this is the second
major back pedal for the Xbox one which
was originally going to require a
persistent internet connection and
severely limit the used games market

like Netflix and HBO Go will no longer
require a premium xbox live gold account

monthly games with gold promotion which
brings us back to Microsoft's original
vision of an always-connected experience

knows it won't be able to realize that
dream if it can't at least compete
against the PlayStation 4 for more on
Xbox one check out the verge coming up

announces the return of J's ball</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
