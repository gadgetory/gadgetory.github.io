I got new glasses.
Do you like them?
Great, thank you.
The neat thing is that these
are actually smart glasses,
and they have a tiny
little laser that's in here
that allows me to check my notifications,
check the weather, talk to Alexa,
get walking directions,
and even call an Uber.
(uplifting music)
The Focals remind me of the Vaunt glasses,
and North actually ended up
buying Intel's IP late last year.
Unlike those glasses, though,
which were a big idea with no plan
to come to people like us,
the Focals are on sale now, and
the company has storefronts
in the US and Canada for
people to get fitted.
They start at $599, with the price going up
depending on if you get different frames
or prescription lenses.
The implementation and app
support isn't all here yet,
especially if you use an iOS device,
but the fact that these
glasses exist at all
shows how far we've come from
products like Google Glass.
Before we get to all that, though,
let me explain how they work
and what comes in the box.
As I mentioned, there's a laser
in the right arm of the glasses
that functions kind of like
a heads-up display in a car.
It's the same effect in that
the information projects
in front of you, and you can
look straight through it.
You might also notice the
spot on the right lens,
which could catch someone's eye
if the light shines just right.
It's a photopolymer material
that allows the laser
to broadcast an image and be seen.
The projection bounces off that material
and hits your eye, creating
a 15-degree viewing area
that's about 300 x 300 pixels.
It doesn't take up your
full view, and it isn't huge.
Beyond the glasses, you'll need this ring
called the Loop to control what you see.
It's a button and a joystick,
so you click down to wake up the glasses,
hold down for Alexa, and move it around
to access different menus.
The glasses have a microphone
and a speaker inside,
so you can talk to Alexa
or dictate a text message.
The speaker will chirp
when you get a notification,
and Alexa will respond
to your commands aloud.
You can always mute this, by the way,
or silence the notifications,
which you'll definitely want to do
if you wear these to a movie, like me,
or if you're in a serious
workflow and can't be distracted.
The glasses mirror your
phone notifications,
so any time I get a text,
email, dating app notification,
or any other push, it pops
up in front of my eyes.
It's a lot, especially
during the work day,
and you don't realize how
many pointless pushes you get
until you see every single one
in front of your face all the time.
I weirdly didn't find
this to be too distracting
and actually kind of
appreciated being able
to evaluate every message as it came in.
I even checked my phone
less because of the glasses.
I didn't look at Instagram
for six hours one day.
Don't judge me.
Because I wasn't checking
my phone for notifications
and then getting distracted
by the Instagram app icon.
Now, the glasses require a
special charging case to charge,
and that case, which is huge,
needs a USB-C connection for power.
If you wear these regularly,
you'll definitely need to
charge them every night.
North says they should
last about 18 hours.
I might've gotten more like 15.
My glasses died a few times
because I didn't charge them regularly
and didn't keep them in my
case in an accessible place.
I want to talk about the apps a bit more,
but before I do, let me
tell you about the fit.
They're plastic frames but
have adjustable nose pads,
presumably to keep them
from slipping down.
I'm used to plastic frames,
so I found these nose
pads super uncomfortable.
The glasses are also
heavier than I'm used to,
especially when you
clip on the sunglasses,
which you'll need if you want
to use the Focals outside.
The projection is nearly
impossible to see in daylight,
but the glasses are splash-proof,
which might make me a little
nervous in a heavy rainstorm,
and the ring is water-resistant,
so I wore it when I
washed my hands or dishes.
So, onto the apps.
Immediately, when you
click the glasses on,
you'll see the home screen with the time.
This was a really helpful screen for me
because I'm always running
late, and I'm on the subway
and needing to know the time.
Now, I don't have to take
my phone out of my bag
just to get that information.
If you push over to the left,
you'll see all of your
recent notifications,
which you can clear, and
if you go to the right,
you'll see your text messages,
which you can respond to,
either through voice or
prewritten messages.
But because I'm on an
iPhone and using iMessage,
the glasses can't use
my real phone number.
So, it takes my messages I receive,
puts them on North's servers,
comes up with potential responses,
and then allows me to
send an SMS message back.
That response doesn't
come from my phone number.
Instead, North has given me a number,
which is extremely confusing
for my friends and family
because it forces us
to start a new thread.
Now, if you keep swiping
over to the right,
you'll see your calendar,
then your location and the option to map.
Within the Focals’
companion smartphone app,
you can set your home and work locations.
So those are available by default.
Right now, the glasses can
only provide walking directions
through a service called Mapbox,
which I didn't have the best luck with.
It often told me it lost
internet connection,
which made no sense,
and then when I did
successfully input an address,
its directions were totally off.
I mapped home from my local
grocery store down the block,
and it suggested a route that
took me way out of my way.
Transit directions would be helpful,
but North hasn't said
when we can expect those.
You can also call an
Uber from that screen,
but you can only call an UberX.
It'll show the fare on the map screen
and call it as soon as you click.
So, don't just click for fun
because an Uber will show up at your door.
So, yeah, the app support…
it's not all here yet.
I would like to be able
to control my music through the glasses.
That'd be neat.
It'd be huge for me, actually,
because it's really the only reason
I check my phone when I commute.
Phone calls might be nice, too. 
But more than anything else,
this texting solution just is not viable.
The actual technology, yeah,
it's cool and futuristic,
and I grew to enjoy having
notifications in front of me
and being able to see what
was happening on my phone
without having to actually pick it up.
Functionally, though,
it's pretty much the same
as wearing a smartwatch,
which also doesn't require
you to take out your phone,
and is way less expensive.
Still, they're unlike
any other smart glasses
I've ever tried, and as far as
the technology and ideas go,
again, they feel like the future.
No one can see my display
when they look at me,
and most people have no idea
I'm wearing smart glasses.
I kind of feel like a spy.
But some of the problems,
particularly with texting,
aren't North's fault.
Coupled with the mapping issues, though,
it makes the entire
experience feel insufficient.
I want my seamless texting,
music playback, and mapping.
Then, I'd be set.
Thanks for watching this review.
