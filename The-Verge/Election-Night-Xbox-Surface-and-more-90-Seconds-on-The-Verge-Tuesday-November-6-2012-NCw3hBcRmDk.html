Patel and this is 90 seconds on the
verge front on the verge today millions
upon millions of Americans head to the
polls do their civic duty that includes
writing for the next president united
states as well as a few other government
positions and referendums but most
continue to use a classic paper method
thirteen states are using electronic
ballots which are controversial due to
their security weaknesses it's worth
noting the three of those are hotly
contested swing states those concerns
aren't stopping New Jersey from
implementing an emergency email voting
system for citizens displaced by
Hurricane sandy either way it's gonna be
long and stressful night for all of us a
terrible for years for a fifty percent
of us but if you're looking for
something a little less violent halo 4
also came out today Microsoft is
building its own 7-inch gaming tablet by
the way I look really good in my life
sources tell the verge that initial
planning is underway for an xbox surface
it won't run a full version of Windows
but rather a custom kernel whose focus
is on gaming it could however support
messaging and other entertainment at the
smaller Xbox surface could join these
surface tablets and the rumored surface
phone and building a family of products
to compete with Apple finally amazon
prime is trialing per month plan in
addition to $79 annual subscription you
can have opted for 799 per month plan
it's more expensive you go for a full
year but it's also less of a commitment
that price is no coincidence it's a shot
across the bow of the similarly priced
netflix and hulu crime amazon has been
aggressively beefing up its own prime
instant video offerings to compete with
the two prime owners also get access to
the kindle owners lending library and
free two-day shipping that's it for
today's top stories now if you'll excuse
me my people need me
