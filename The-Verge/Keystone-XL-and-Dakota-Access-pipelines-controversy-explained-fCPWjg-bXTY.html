Trump's fourth full day in office he
signed two presidential memoranda that
resurrected oil pipelines everyone
thought were dead with respect to the
construction of the Dakota access these
pipelines are concerning for States
landowners and tribal nations worried
about construction and dangerous bills
and for environmental groups who want
the u.s. to move away from fossil
resources the Keystone XL pipeline is
intended to carry crude oil for 1,200
miles from Canada to Steel City Nebraska
and connects to an existing segment that
ends on the Gulf Coast and the Dakota
access pipeline toward Apple is a three
point eight billion dollar pipeline
stretching 1,100 miles from North Dakota
to Illinois it ignited a massive protest
movement that started at Standing Rock
Sioux Reservation in North Dakota which
happens to be right next to where the
pipeline would cross the Missouri River
the Obama administration had paused both
Keystone XL and 2015 and the Dakota
access pipeline were recently in late
2016
Trump's memoranda directed the agencies
in charge of approving each pipeline to
speed them through the review process
and that's a problem because there were
a lot of reasons people wanted these
pipelines to be gone for good some of
those reasons have to do with the
pipeline sprouts with Keystone
construction would need to cross the
Ogallala Aquifer which stretches beneath
Nebraska South Dakota Wyoming Colorado
Kansas Oklahoma Texas and New Mexico the
aquifers water is used for both drinking
and irrigation so if it were
contaminated by say yeah pipeline spill
it could be devastating to people's
health and nearby agriculture while
pipelines are statistically safer than
transport by train or truck they're
still prone to breaking and when they do
spill they spill about three times more
volume than trains recently a Canadian
pipeline spilled 200,000 litres of oil
and days later there was another even
larger spill in Iowa despite these risks
pipeline companies continue to claim
that there
for the economy TransCanada the company
in charge of Keystone XL promised it
would create thousands of much-needed
jobs for Americans Trump echoed that
claim when he signed the memorandum if
they'd like let's see if we can get that
pipeline built a lot of jobs 28,000 jobs
great construction jobs but those big
numbers are misleading sure Obama's
State Department calculated that
Keystone XL might create 40,000 or more
jobs but they would only be temporary
construction gigs over the long term it
would only create about 50 permanent
jobs in the US this is going to be full
employment for lawyers you know because
I think we're going to see all of these
things contested in the courts the war
is not over but I'm afraid it's going to
be much more of a guerilla war in the
courts already being challenged in the
courts the Dakota access pipeline
construction on the pipeline is almost
complete except for the final most
contentious stretch to finish it the
pipeline operator energy transfer
partners needs to drill beneath Waco ah
hey on the Missouri River and for that
it needs an easement from the US Army
Corps of Engineers lekha why is the
water source for the Standing Rock Sioux
tribe which has been fighting the
pipeline since April Standing Rock
leaders argue that they weren't
adequately consulted about the pipeline
which could contaminate their water
supply and endanger sacred sites after
eight months of clashes between the
protesters in an increasingly
militarized police force
the US Army ruled that energy transfer
partners would not be allowed to drill
beneath the river but President Trump
asked the Army Corps to revisit that
decision Obama could unilaterally decide
to stop it three months ago and Trump
now even though he's issued is never in
it doesn't say go forward and grant this
permit more outs
it says agency you need to consider
these for them simply to stop that
process switch gears I think
it was the door to some significant
potential legal challenges particularly
their decision is essentially arbitrary
aside from legal battles what might
really kill these pipelines or economics
dropping oil prices might take away the
incentive for companies like say
TransCanada or energy transfer partners
to invest in pipelines in the future
which would be good news for the
environmentalists and the First Nations
people who have been fighting for
centuries to protect their land there's
this whole other wrinkle to that we
didn't even get into which is the
problem eminent domain in the state of
Iowa the government granted there's 200
parcels of land to the Dakota access
pipeline and of course 17 of those
landowners were like no and they sued
and then in Nebraska with Keystone the
state government couldn't actually agree
with in itself who had the power to
grant eminent domain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
