here with Apple's new iPad pro this is a
twelve point nine inch iPad pro it's the
larger one but it's smaller than the old
twelve point nine inch iPad pro this one
was actually about the size of a sheet
of paper this thing is really thin it's
five point nine millimeters it's got a
camera bump that's a 12 megapixel camera
right there you can see it's got these
LTE lines which are not beautiful but
there they are and the smart connector
has been redesigned that actually
instead of at the bottom it's on the
side now so when you plug it in so the
new keyboard case goes there bang it out
and apps in the keyboard case smart
connector on this side so you notice
there's no home button here it's the
same gesture controls as the iPhone 10
10 s 10 R so I can open an app here
that's great
swipe around swipe up to go home ice so
I've been told
get the app switcher I can pick this
photo of baek again swipe from the
bottom and go to another app real fast
that stuff is all super cool I can also
grab Mayo put it over here and get the
little pop-up overview of mail I can go
home now that I've got that you can
slide mail over you the actual
side-by-side view then I can swipe
between apps here she's here those Becca
is that then I can go back myspace has
been maintained so very familiar
multitasking setup to previous iPads but
now you can do it a little bit faster
with the gesture support and no home
button Apple has totally reengineer the
screen it's providing a liquid Retina
screen it's the same idea as the iPhone
10 R it's got pixel mask rounded corners
there's also face ID right here this is
the face ID system this is technically
the top of the iPad the face idea will
work in landscape they actually say
it'll work any way that you pulled it
which is super cool and you've got USB C
on the bottom which is super exciting
an important note this is not
Thunderbolt 3 like Apple does
it's laptops this is USB see Apple says
it's USB 3.1 gen2 so it supports 10
gigabit transfers and it's optimized for
file transfer and DisplayPort so you can
run a 5k monitor off of this and you can
plug in a camera we've got a camera over
here and turn on I took a picture of
Becca earlier I'm just gonna plug it in
and you can see just like the old SD
card adapter for the iPad it's going to
pop right into photos open photos and I
can grab this photo I took it Becca hit
import then I'm importing it right off
of that Sony camera over there so keep
it and I can go into photos there's a
girl that nailed it there's still no
file system here when you plug in a hard
drive it's not going to do anything you
plug in a printer Apple said we'll find
out what happens together control you
have finished our smaller class prepara
if you're looking at cameras you're
looking at monitors those are big deals
for the iPad it has not been able to
support all of those things in the past
we're gonna plug in a lot more stuff
every app can add its own support from
peripherals over USB C so we'll plug in
a lot of stuff and see what works but
after all purrs are gonna have to do a
lot of the work here
yep ad pro the 12.9 here starts at $9.99
for 64 gigs of storage there's a smaller
11 inch version it's the same physical
size as the old 10.5 with a bigger
display that smaller one starts at $7.99
there's 64 gigs inside you've got an a
12 X Bionic processor the X line is
Apple's beefed-up version of the a12 in
the iPhone 10 s and 10 are Apple says
these are faster than 90
percent portable computers ship today
they really really want you to think
about this in comparison to a PC and not
other tablets that's why they've got us
PC that's why they're pushing its
performance specs that's why they had
Adobe on stage to show up Photoshop
actually have a video Photoshop and app
that you should check out and that's why
I hear when I'm talking to them they're
showing me lighter in CC on the iPad
Apple also has a new Apple pencil which
is honestly way nicer than the old
pencil it's kind of a matte finish it's
a little bit smaller it's flat on one
edge which makes it easier to hold it
charges magnetically there's none of
that old lightning port stuff going on
so I just click it in you can see it
drops a blue pencil 97% that's super
cool if I'm on the lockscreen here I can
just tap on it
I guess it opens two notes again right
away hello that's super cool bye double
tap on the pencil it'll switch to the
eraser it's gone I can double tap switch
back to the pencil and I'm writing again
that's super cool it's something people
wanted for a long time and then I closed
it up it's still locked it's still ready
to go I can put the pencil back on top
of it it's charging again and this isn't
programmed to my face so I'm going to
grab my friend Steven over here and
we're just going to have him unlock it
so he's looking at it swipe up a lot
face idea works like a charm this is
fast as a 10 SNR so that is the iPad pro
$7.99 for the 11 inch 64 gig version
$9.99 for this 12 point 9 inch version
and she's for 4 gigs it looks pretty
cool we got to get one we gotta plug all
kinds of stuff into it we got to see
what USB see honest thing can really do
and I personally am gonna have to get
over the lack of that wrench so there's
a true depth sensor here so it also
supports an emoji of course I like to be
this fox what's really interesting is
Apple had to recalibrate the system so
you're not looking at it off access
because the camera is over here not at
the top in landscape that's pretty neat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
