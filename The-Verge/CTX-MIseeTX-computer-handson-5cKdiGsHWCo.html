we're here at ctx technologies booth at
CES with the little computer called my
ctx the whole computer is in this tiny
little thing it's got the screen here
and it actually projects the keyboard
out at the bottom so you can do it that
way it's also got basically every port
you can think of there's going to be an
iPod dock here this is not a production
unit yet but this is one will look like
it's got all kinds of ports on the side
for SD micro SD USB Ethernet and all
kinds of audio ports and stuff here but
it's also got which i think is great is
a projector right here so you basically
just set the thing down on a table put
it up against the wall and it just
starts projecting your computer and you
can do everything just within this tiny
little box so as you can see it's
projecting a virtual keyboard out of the
actual computer itself and you can just
type on any flat surface and it's a
little finicky to use and probably
harder than even like a phone but it
works it works pretty well and it
projects the image up onto a screen and
it has an LCD on the computer itself you
cannot you can also plug in peripherals
like you can plug in an Xbox and use the
projector just as a projector or you can
watch movies and what I really like is
it rotates so you can actually point it
at the ceiling which is great for like
lying event watching movies and I
totally want to do that it runs windows
7 it doesn't seem like the fastest
computer we ever used but it seems to
work fine and it's going to be available
pretty soon for about six hundred
dollars that's the CTX live ctx
you
