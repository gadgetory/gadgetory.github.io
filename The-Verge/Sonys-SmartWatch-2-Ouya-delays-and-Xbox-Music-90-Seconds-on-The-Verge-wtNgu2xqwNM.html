miller there's been a murder most foul
and we'll get to the bottom of it if it
kills me this is 90 seconds on the verge
Sony was one of the first major
companies to dabble in smartwatches and
the company is taking another crack with
the new SmartWatch 2 thanks NFC pairing
is much easier than the older models and
the new interface uses for more familiar
Android navigation options sony
smartwatch 2 is expected to hit retail
shelves in September and I'm sorry
iphone fans this one's Android only the
long-awaited android console Ouya is
finally out but even some early backers
are still waiting the project's
Kickstarter backers were told they'd
receive a console before it's official
release thousands are still empty-handed
in the meantime the $99 console has gone
on sale at places like target amazon and
best buds we as ken Stevens wrote that
the missing consoles were somewhere in a
shipping facility in Hong Kong but they
should be arriving in the coming weeks
finally get ready for a slammin jammin
hell of a party thanks to microsoft
sources tell the verge that microsoft
will be launching a web version of its
streaming music service letting users
listen to songs without being tied to an
xbox or a Windows device it puts the
service more in line with cross-platform
offerings like Rdio spotify and google
play music all access it's also one up
on iTunes whose new streaming services
offer Pandora like stations instead of
ala carte selections according to
reports the web version of Microsoft
Xbox music is set to launch next week
that's it for today's top stories but
coming up tomorrow my suspicions are
confirmed</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
