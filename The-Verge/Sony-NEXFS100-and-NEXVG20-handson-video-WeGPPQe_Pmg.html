PSP HD f PG 29 surely that is liking
them 10 part of relationship so it's
hard ass names in the book back to an
ergonomic design the right we might as
well armada separate you know lenses on
the council this isn't sony the email i
don't go to the same as its next
hairless cameras or resell the kit lens
with an 18 200-meter millimeter if I pop
it up here it's actually got an aps-c
sensor which is again the same Houston
is regional snail character so we
haven't even 10 millimeter pancake by
regional sales and so this week over a
much wider angle but also significantly
reduce the form factor of the device to
confront our late
okay you conceive in 16-millimeter field
it's pretty wide angle and the advantage
of it being more comfortable 12 more
compact poker of course it works with
any lens in the email range the 280 55
if you are electric lamp is also a
natural man turns it over so it gets
more options than a traditional camera
while also giving the benefit to the ssl
RSA and now we have the next fs100 which
as you can see from the crazy array of
buttons is a much more of a professional
camera it uses the same lenses of the
next system so it's going to email here
as you can see the sensor
it's a stupid 35-millimeter
so we can pop on another lens here let's
try this neck to neck crew
so this is the 30-millimeter filled
field of view and manual focus on yes I
have let's try
yes I have been filming in with a nice
big sensor in the back row
pretty unusual ability for a camera
camcorder
