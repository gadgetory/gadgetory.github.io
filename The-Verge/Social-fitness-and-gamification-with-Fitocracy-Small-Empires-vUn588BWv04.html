invested in them and met amazing people
using the internet to change the world
our generation has an opportunity unlike
any other we can create small empires
without anyone's permission
Union Square major downtown hub lower
Manhattan and also home to plenty of
college students I'm about to meet two
founders who met each other their first
year of college and use their own
personal physical transformations to
build software and a community in
photography that helps millions of
people all over the world change their
lives through fitness usually when we
hear about startup success it it happens
overnight so these guys success has been
anything but tell me about photography
photography is a fitness social network
at its core that gets everyone to get to
the next level of fitness it does this
through the combination of community
knowledge and gamification we have
everyone from sedentary Joe - Arnold
Schwarzenegger using the site because
it's so powerful to helping people level
up their fitness what's this the chakra
see turns Fitness into a social game
fits opressing fits chakra see fit opera
see fit across the I don't know phenoxy
husband keeps me busy ten getting
beauties there and it's a really cool
site I started photography two years ago
with my co-founder Richard because we
wanted to build a world where Fitness
was possible for anyone it was a
stunning from our own personal
backgrounds from your sous vide is
really out of shape peaks and then made
these big fitness transformations and
that experience was so meaningful that
we want to bring that to as many people
as possible and so today in two years
later photography has now got an
incredibly user base of nearly a million
users making these huge transformations
in their own lives every single day
all right I was kind of expecting to see
like basketball court
free weights hello woman
nice to see you dick yo dude sitting
next to I kind of feel like the before
photo and you're the after photo when I
was young I was you know always kind of
a fat kid I don't want to say kind of
fat I mean like really fat and it's
funny because both of my parents were
doctors both of them had me eat healthy
follow the food pyramid like eat less
move more exercise all that fun stuff
but I'd always been fat at some point
when I was 17 you know just like all
geeks if you want to get into something
if you really get into something right
so I was really into video games I
played that request like 16 hours a day
17 hours a day okay and what was your
class I was a shadow knight troll a
shadow Knight yeah I was 20 out of my
mind um you're talking to a level 52
bard which I guess technically about 50
I know I know I don't know what I was
thinking
it's against a nice group class it's
really annoying PvP cuz we just sort of
run in circles
chaining you get over juggling but the
speed and it's it's embarrassing death
so a lot of well a lot of world apart a
lot of EverQuest a lot of EverQuest yeah
and at some point I just transferred
that same geekiness into fitness and I
was like all right I'm gonna geek out
over Fitness we met at a dining hall
UPenn our freshman year dick will say
that I was the one putting tuna and
broccoli into a plastic bag but in fact
it was actually dick he was shelving
that stuff into his plastic bag I saw
him eating chicken and tuna and broccoli
in the cafeteria okay and then I tried
to like ask him to see if he was like
into fitness and he said that I'm
cutting right now and cutting is like
the term that people online are mostly
in forums use when they're talking about
you know losing weight or leaning out
would see I mean do you think he was
weirded out by this a little bit like I
think hulking dude comes over to him
it's like I wasn't walking back that
looks like you're eating tuna broccoli I
think we have a lot in common which is
all I mean I think that when you have an
interest that you're really passionate
about and you don't know anyone in your
offline circle who is passionate about
the same thing
you tend to very starved for those kinds
of people clearly there was a mutual
love of fitness right when did the whole
love for entrepreneurship start or when
did that when'd you guys go from talking
about working out together to working
together you know I think it started as
early as our senior year of college
in your senior year of college you are
in a situation where you're thinking
really hard about your career and
there's this temptation to follow the
herd and go into the standard finance or
consulting or or management or whatnot
and I was definitely a part of that as
well but there was always a little
something in the back of my head where's
like well I would really like to do
something on my own I would really like
to start a company eventually but at
that point I was kind of deferring it I
was saying well I'll get a few years of
experience and then do that I went to go
work for comScore he went to go work for
consulting in Connecticut tragic yeah
you know I was chatting with dick
everyday on instant message I think I
was one who had to convince him on the
idea cuz he was pretty happy with where
he was working at the time I was like
did you know we're young we don't have a
lot of obligations right now we're gonna
do it but might as well do it now I had
to go and sell him on his idea of
quitting it and taking a huge risk and
starting something together and it took
you know I think maybe a couple of weeks
to get him past that point and once we
were past that point
then we started thinking what to work on
together a lot of ideas the worst was
like Groupon for CPG and then there was
like social gift services we thought
about fitness but everyone was like you
know the fitness space is super
saturated you're not going to be able to
make a dent in it it is a difficult
space no matter how you cut it you're
really driving at these human behaviors
that are notoriously difficult to change
we weren't even founders at the time yet
we were thinking well you know there's
seem like these larger companies out
there how are we possibly going to
topple them at some point we looked at
each other and were like dude we know so
much about the space we look at kind of
founders and you know people who have
startups in the fitness space and they
reduce Fitness down to like eating less
moving more and tracking they don't
actually understand the habit component
or the human component
behind fitness which both of us really
do because we've helped a lot of people
we've spent all this time learning about
this and so we're like and if we're
going to spend you know conceivably the
next five to ten years 80 hours a week
on something it might as well be
something that we like we were hanging
out in DC at the time this was I think
in August of 2010 and we're just like
screwed dude let's just do something in
the fitness space because we know this
area front-to-back there's all these
products out there but they kind of suck
but do something interesting and at that
point we commit ourselves to that and
we'd never look back so I'm not
exercised in a very long time
see how this goes Ben what's up I'm
Alexis great to meet you gonna meet you
two ready to uh exercise yeah and we've
got we've got our photography apps I've
got the closest thing I could find to
athletic equipment in my home yeah I'm
looking forward great alright
Segway race yourself
so I took off my Walter White's and I
put on my RG threes
we're where are we exactly what's this
gym called we're at Marc Fisher fitness
all right I love the use of unicorns in
this gymnasium all right this is very
empowering I despite the fact that I
have not exercised in a decade between
the unicorns and your guidance I think
this will not be a total disaster so
where do we begin
well we're going to start at the squat
rack all right never done one of those
before
I have squatted not with weights on me
but we the way a solution to fitness
isn't the solution that most people
think it is we don't need to put weights
on that we can just use the ball yeah
well start I always warm up with the bar
anything that's good I knew that most
people think that you just have to be
super disciplined and like apply
willpower and like grit through and just
like run in the morning and like eat
healthy etc the actual solution to
fitness is ten times simpler than that
it requires you to really suppress your
ego and understand that you don't really
know anything about exercise and
nutrition so we don't have to roll
cameras for this part all right all
right
a couple steps back oh alright then
Bennet your hips first been way like
lean forward a little bit yeah
there we go yeah all right now stand
back up how'd that feel awkward to me
this is very much a personal mission I
think a lot of the team feels the same
way to help solve the obesity epidemic
another thing that's the thing that's
keeping me together right now the smile
raised my Mary and knowing Emily
photography points I'm getting for this
oh yeah this is very very high impact
people are looking in the wrong places
like people are looking at wearable
devices which is the dumbest thing like
if I'm a person who has never stuck to a
fitness program and I try to optimize
for steps taken that increases my hunger
that makes me more tired and that
expends willpower that's going to make
me overeat in fact I might actually be
worse off a lot of people like to make
it seem like people who are obese
are aways on the next dr. oz does
getting healthy feel like too much work
take the easy way out with dr. Oz's lazy
girls guide to getting healthy no
workouts burn calories without exercise
no cooking can order pizza
you can order Mexican or Chinese eat
what you want lose weight prevent cancer
if you're gonna be a lazy girl do it
right minimum effort maximum results
this last tip is the ultimate many fat
people are like the hardest-working
people you'll find it's just that like
since it's not a solution of eat less
move more and it's incredibly complex to
solve like this problem of weight loss
there's this stigma on them we just need
to absolutely blank it and dominate the
web and the app store everything Fitness
related we can get our hands on and that
means like making a lot of noise calling
people like dr. oz out for being
bullshit you've been talking about the
five biggest fat Buster's 4 5 body types
in just 5 days and now I've got the
number one miracle and a bottle a girl
with that like prescribe something like
raspberry ketones a supplement be like
this is a miracle fat burning supplement
how'd you find this these amazing
research research research they help
your body burn fat
not only that they slice it up inside
the cell so it burns fat easier and we
all want easier easier it makes a
smarter there's no research to support
that I don't know where he's getting it
from but all these you know housewives
who are overweight listen to him they go
out to GNC G&amp;amp;C ratchets up the price of
Raspberry Ketones sale like get their
hands on as many as they can they take
it what happens they don't lose weight
dr. Oz says it's a miracle fat burner
but they're not losing weight so how do
they think about fitness suddenly
they're like man I must have the worst
genetics ever like Fitness must be
impossible it's so hard I'm just like
really passionate about like disrupting
that kind of a that mindset is just like
you want to say to dr. oz right now you
can just say it ready camera dr. oz you
suck you are a scam artist and a
charlatan and you're going down
so who who is responsible for the mascot
the robot that's all Jared I'm a bit of
a mascot nut what inspired the robot the
server was running really slow at the
time and own workout submission so there
was a time between you submitting a
workout and you waiting for your points
and you know we brainstormed a little
bit about what could happen during that
time and it was a natural progression to
kind of lead into the red mascot this
this little guy who sits there in the
background and calculated points and
kind of helps you through the doctors
experience so does the mascot of a name
yeah Fred Oh Fred is which which kind of
name for a robot stands for photography
rewards for exercise droid but that's a
great official thing nice acronym okay
that's some good veteran photography
trivia right there for the superfans
were you just just chilling an
illustrator one night you were like all
right I got to come up with a mascot
like I was with the robot no I was in a
BA and drew it on napkin really and that
kind of a cocktail napkin it was a
cocktail napkin and that translates it
if this shit does happen when you
started out you probably weren't
thinking how do I grow this into a
billion dollar company you were thinking
like how do I make sure that we can pay
the rent like next month because you
guys bootstrap this thing from the first
savings right for how long for the first
year the first year yeah so talk about
bootstrapping a startup in New York the
first year we were saving up we weren't
spending much money because we knew it
was gonna be pretty lean times and when
we moved to New York we found a really
cheap apartment in Brooklyn the
ghettoest of getting places in Brooklyn
okay wait whatever uh it was Clifton
Hill but it was like right about last
night it was like ah that's I was like
next that makes you unsure and that
makes you cool I moved in with dick and
his girlfriend at the time and their cat
so we were splitting the rent three ways
ice the cat was not paying cat was not
paying you know it was very like kind of
heads down we were sticking inside the
apartment all the time we were buying
her food from Costco
and there was really no time to go out
or money to go out or spend any real
money you just like sat down learn how
to code Brian learned CSS and HTML and
we pumped out the like a Bleus website
anyone is ever such a web app this is
before the iOS yes I didn't come on to
like a year and a half at okay this was
just a website website of the ugliest
thing you've ever seen in the first
several months we were rolling out of
bed straight to our IKEA table getting
to work in the middle after the
afternoon dick would end up cooking a
whole bunch of food for us to eat in the
midday and then go right back to work
and we'd probably work till like 3:00
a.m. every night and you know it wasn't
that bad in terms of not spending much
money because we were so focused all we
wanted to do was just get this thing out
the door so we you know iterated it was
still really ugly at some point if there
were like 10 people at the same time on
the site it would crash the server like
we knew it was so like really crappy but
we're like okay we're ready to like just
show more people and so Brian posted on
Reddit and said that you know me and my
best friend from college starting a
fitness fitness site trying to turn
Fitness into an RPG and people are just
like super excited because that type of
user didn't just look at kind of the
surface of the site and say oh this
designs ugly they looked at the I guess
long term vision so I wouldn't he would
have had on the inside yeah was that
really what sort of launched yeah
autocracy really was um um so right why
doesn't reddit get a cut of this early
you know you guys are sharing this
office space with a couple of the
companies do you guys find like as I
noticed wait real quick tweet just is
this this is work-related presumably
strong curves a woman's guide to
building a better button and body
yeah I don't mean to blow up your spot
like I don't even know what I was gonna
ask now but wait so okay oh yeah well
it's undoubtedly work-related what what
percentage of the stuff the knowledge
that you use every day would you wager
was learned sort of from the internet
from your own self learning from books
like not from college curriculum yeah I
called it yeah that's pretty reasonable
you have to go the extra mile to learn
on your own a lot mmm I'm gonna I think
that's sort of like he's gonna you're
gonna learn a lot more on you you all
possess arguably the most valuable skill
of this century right being able to
write code bills I'm like extremely
valuable at no point in human history as
such a valuable skill also been so
ostensibly accessible like like as you
said most of what you learned is
self-taught that's amazing but yet
there's still this gulf of limited
supply not enough people doing it and
and what appears to be unlimited demand
what do we do to bridge that me I think
a lot of it is you know there's a mental
block that a lot of people have I don't
know how to code and it's intimidating
and it's the kind of thing that it's
easy to get stuck on a small syntax
error and your first leak
six months and never get past it I feel
like a lot of it is just kind of being
able to recognize that it's not
infinitely complexed and then just
learning what has been the lowest moment
so far and then what kept you from just
quitting and going back to a good salary
and a normal job at a certain point we
had started to discuss a financing term
sheet with a relatively small fund out
in California and this was going to be
the first significant money in the
company and all signs pointed to this
going through it was almost a sure thing
we're basically just negotiating the
terms did you have a term machine we had
the term sheet you had a term sheet
funny oh yeah this is an important note
yeah okay so we had the term sheet in
front of us we were discussing the terms
yeah just going through some of the
details and then over the span of maybe
a week or two weeks there started to be
a little bit of slowdown on their end a
couple of red flags and then there's a
Monday evening
Skype call it was at like 10:00 p.m.
because the investor that we're working
with was overseas at the time and he
said look we actually can't do the deal
anymore
and I won't get into details as to why
but basically they pull the rug out from
under us and you know this was in August
so we had been going on for eight nine
ten months without a salary our bank
accounts were running low and it was
just this moment where my head just
instantly hit the desk you know heart in
the stomach sort of feeling and I didn't
know what I was going to do and the next
day you know I gathered together with
with dick and and
our engineer at the time and look this
deal isn't happening even though we
pretty sure it was a sure thing and we
don't know what the alternatives are
other investors aren't biting right now
we're just going to have to think about
being really lean and figuring out how
to survive and of course the thought of
shutting down was you know running back
of our heads now
what was amazing about that week was
that news came down on Monday and then
that Friday of that week I woke up to
find Dick freaking out on Twitter he was
like oh my god photography's on xkcd I
was like the hell is this guy talking
about
you know xkcd is a huge deal and a site
that can't be right and then I went to
xkcd and there we were in comic number
940 and in the following month I think
we more than doubled our user base at
the time so how did you first hear about
photography but it was actually on a
xkcd cartoon yes in like August of 2011
I think yeah I think I was one of like
thousands of users that joined because
of that cartoon yeah and that was a
moment where I was able to go back to a
lot of the investors that we've been
speaking to and say check it out like
we're up and to the right we're hockey
sticking right now and we were able to
actually start playing around today
today those investors connect the dots
that it was thanks to this execute CD
comic or they were just like whoa up
into the right let me get my checkbook
you know I think some did they didn't
realize it but they saw something shift
you know there was this this moment or
like oh like conviction happened
wait so at the time well like would you
see what was your fitness level was it
like who Alexis - Alexis level even I
mean you City have more doubt in 10
years like at the time I joined
photography I had never touched one of
these well why did you want to get
healthy what motivated you when I was a
kid I was always I really want to be
strong and I realized that I'd reached
the age of 30 and I had never really
taken steps to achieve that goal that
had heads for 25 years so I was like
well what if I did just decide that I
wanted to get strong as an adult where
do I start and that's where photography
came in and like the
immunity there the forums the knowledge
centre the group's turns out when you
have a million users a lot of them have
had the same goals a lot of them have
travelled the same paths and got a lot
of advice to share has this reached a
point of like almost a mission because
like we said earlier there was an
undeniable epidemic of obesity right
he's photography then Oh an undeniable
part of the solution yeah
obesity is not a data problem it's a
human problem my father passed away when
I was a teenager because he didn't take
good care of himself he didn't watch his
diet he wasn't exercising and you know
in the end it meant that he passed away
relatively young I think that's a
tragedy especially when we're living in
a world where we have so much abundance
in excess and we we can see the great
achievements that were reaching in our
careers and our personal lives but if
you're not focusing on the the body and
your wellness then none of that stuff
matters there's like trillions of
dollars it's a you know with with
obesity and like billions of dollars in
the fitness industry and to be able to
solve that and like be a piece of the
solution means that you know photography
has a very high upside when it comes to
just being a profitable company but it's
upside is I completely aligned with the
social mission photography only becomes
a billion dollar company if it can
really help solve the obesity crisis and
I'm just like really grateful as a
founder for that because I get to do
like two cool things that I love like
helping people and making money you know
I think we're still just at the tip of
the iceberg we really really believe in
creating that greatness and others and
words we're still living in a world
where it's not top of mind for a lot of
people and we're trying to change that
two guys met each other over broccoli
and tuna they worked their butts off in
Brooklyn to get this company up and
running and today photography has over a
million users who are as passionate as
their founders you probably also have a
passion
something that you really care about and
chances are you too can use the Internet
to build a similar community of people
who care just as much as you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
