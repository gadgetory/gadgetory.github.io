be Paul today anyhow this is the verdict
after discuss the week in technology
culture and culture culture and called
the culture club my favorite band from
the 80s yeah million yes that was that
was the song that the culture club
performed okay come and go Josh yet you
come and go that's I really do Eddie how
we are we're back we've had some we've
had a few weeks where where I've been
off not working or trying to not work as
i go for you it's going great here i am
not working over it's good i was trying
taking a little bit trying to get a
little bit of rest before the CES
insanity started and everybody's been
away for the holiday so anyhow but we're
back to talk about what's been happening
and it has been some news uh yea though
even though it's been the holiday
there's been news even though we haven't
been around to report it basically which
I terms of the news happens even if
we're not uh yeah online on the internet
straight disappointing you know news and
I had a tight relationship I thought you
guys were guys that you guys were just
exclusive things just bought a case
without news it just does its own thing
so so hornet so I want to get into I
want to talk about this really quickly
this is something that's near and dear
to my heart so there's been a lot of
Instagram today there's been Instagram
news there's been a lot of insanity and
and craziness about these Instagram
Terms of Service there's like a spot of
light that just like right in the middle
of my face anyhow uh so I opened up my
my Us Weekly's this week which I always
do and this is the Miss is the first
page of Us Weekly it's Kim's Instagram
outrage uh this is on their hot
Hollywood page a literally page page one
of us and this is all about how how Kim
Kardashian me let me read you exactly
says uh it was a shock shocking turn
around December eighteenth when just
moments after showing off her new clip
on bangs Kardashian 32 threatened to
quit the photo sharing app her issue new
terms announced December 17th that would
allow Instagram to sell user photos
without asking or pain
yeah I really love to Instagram
Kardashian tweeted I need to review this
new policy I don't think wow she got her
lawyers right on the case then then she
immediately went to the verge calm where
she read Neal eyes brutal takedown of
the thud of the Indiana but I mean I
have to say this is maybe the dumbest
story that has ever occurred in my
career as tech reporter really dumber
dumber than the story about Randi
Zuckerberg yelling at kelly Schweitzer
on Twitter about reposting her Facebook
photo also number the number one non
story of 2012 I mean Dan Lyons wrote an
editorial about it man that's how big
that story was sorry I don't need to get
sidetracked now I understand now we
should talk about that too I mean I
think that's hilarious but this one was
was was true the layers of
misunderstanding here that the the
ferocity in which we wanted the world
wanted to discuss the implications of
something that had not happened uh word
I mean it was just astounding I mean
it's a nightmare yeah after Graham
debacle is a most important thing that's
happened do you want your what you want
to go through you want me to go through
it real fast could you I'm just trying
to identify where this light is coming
from this there's like a just a small
all right so why he investigates that go
ahead i'm just trying to where is this
light originated yes mall dot of light
all right go ahead i'll see it now it is
you see it's annoying right it's like
god I don't know where that's right i
wish i wish i understood how light works
wow that is gross whatever you're doing
now is it's truly macro on your hands
yeah you like that oh that reminds me
i'm supposed to that reminds you yeah i
was just turned off the over uh what's
are here sure i mean here's the new i
turned off both i did that minds off now
you've got your ear no I turned I turned
something else on I see very nice Oh God
so pro so profession yep great stuff
thanks for us uh so look here's the
basic situation the the old Instagram
Terms let's see I'm trying to find the
exact when I image the old Instagram
terms said they could add to delete from
modify use modify delete from add to
publicly perform publicly display
reproduce and translate your photos and
distribute them through any media
formats through any media channels
that's the you know however millions of
people have signed up for instance SEO
that's the original term but those are
the original terms ma and then the next
line said Instagram a place advertising
potions on about or in conjunction with
your content and that content was
broadly defined to mean your photos your
musical works sound recording anything
that Instagram Instagram ever touched
from you they got this incredibly broad
license to wherever they wanted that was
the old one the new one was written in a
much more friendly indirect way and said
we have a license to use your photos we
take a sublicense you have to they used
the word sub licensors a formal legal
word but like YouTube and Twitter use it
because that's how you run your API and
then it they have a license and the part
where you got all mad about was the
sentence you agree that we can display
your work in connection with promoted
content without compensate me I can
actually read it you agree that a
business may pay instagram to display
your photos in connection with paid or
sponsored content or promotions without
compensation to you which was almost
immediately inaccurately interpreted to
mean instagrams and sell your focus to
now rage i would describe what would I
mean I just the the depth of wrong there
is like shocking well no I want our
separate hippies I do know it's legally
wrong interpretation but to a lay person
who's going to read them we have to
accept that people do occasionally
retention services now no that's fine so
I think you know the mistakes here re i
don't know uh so I think there is the
mistake of instagrams lawyers to use
words that like our other words in their
legal context without any notion of
telling you what they are and there's
Instagram fail of them saying here's a
kind of advertising we're going to do
here are the specific things we're going
to do with ads uh and here we change
collect what we're going to do instead
they just change their terms of service
said we're going to share data with
facebook now and that's why we change
the terms of service and cnet why don't
you go ahead and freak out about this
this change in the terms so that's like
a huge fail and instagrams part but the
so the metaphor and copyright law for
things you can do so when you take a
photo you get you get the immediate
copyright to its automatic under the law
right and then the metaphor that like
law professors will use is a bundle of
sticks right so your rights are sticks
and you can hand out the sticks any way
you want and one of the most important
like right that you can give away is the
right to create a derivative work right
which means I think it's a paint to
paint your stick to paint yet depend
I'll it to coca-cola coca-cola uses it
in an ad they've made they've changed my
photo in some way right and I have to
pay me to do it Instagram never never
asked for that right they never said we
have the right to model be the thing
that you need to like printed on a
billboard but that was completely
ignored so so so so you're saying that
that that the main point of contention
here is the idea that Instagram that
somebody that an advertiser could take a
photo from Instagram because like
somehow Instagram could cut a deal with
coca-cola for the Breton's to Graham
photos and go make a billboard of like
hey look at all these people
instagramming drinking coca-cola there's
like just which is which is not actually
what was happening so not what was
happening by the pole there's no way
they could do that without talking to
you they couldn't print a right out but
ok so so is there any legitimate outrage
about their rights to your photos the
legitimate outrage would be so that the
types of things that could do are pretty
simple right they're allowed to display
your photos in connection with paid
content so it's New Years Eve so coke
could buy the hashtag Nye in all the
photos on that page on Instagram might
have the word sponsored by kokor what
about what about on coca-cola website
but you can do that already right
instagram has an API so coca-cola can
put up a box on our website that says
instagrams of this hashtag and that you
could have done that before and but I
think that
you're saying it but you're saying
instagrams had the rights to do that
before these new Instagram had broader
rights before this is actually the thing
that like this right side so done
Detroit and took took their box of
things they were allowed to do and they
went like this range i'm just trying to
identify that that there's nothing in
the new terms of service that give them
more right over your photos or they can
do more with than in the previous terms
of service absolutely can do less on the
right soso kisser i just want to be
clear that Kim Kardashian's Instagram
outrage as documented by Us Weekly
magazine by magazine of choice when
relaxing can we go back out who is the
person the bottom left I've been trying
to figure that out that's uh that's
Dixon what is named Mason Dixon Mason is
it that's Mason Disick yeah I was close
I liked it better as mix can take exit
to base in Jackson at space actually
where they should have named them Mason
Dixon disagree with it anyhow uh and
then Betty White is in the other corner
uh and then kanye West is in is in the
upper right left hand any other point is
um Kim's outrage was over thought it was
over a complete far outrageous over the
idea that this horrible thing was
happening without any you know but this
is what always happens I mean this is uh
the world loves Fudd we love to be
scared we'd love to hear like the we
love to like think of the worst I mean I
just can't think of a worse business
model for Instagram then we're going to
collect people's photos of like whatever
they're drinking at night and sell them
like you know I like it I can think of a
worse business model like no business
model which is what they seem to
currently have but but they don't need a
business model they're owned by Facebook
right but there but their business model
from facebook is much simpler it's we're
gonna pay we're in coca-cola and lipton
and Ben and Jerry's on already running
promotions using Instagram are going to
pay us to run promotions on Instagram
and as part of is part of paying us to
run their promotions in Instagram you
know we reserve the right to run ads and
hear your photos and that's what they
were trying to say right and I utterly
fail you know if you look at on the
promotion's have already been running so
Ben &amp;amp; Jerry's had one where
if you hashtagged a photo capture
euphoria and they picked your photo they
would run a ben &amp;amp; jerry's ad with your
photo in it in your hometown right ok
excuse that's like but you know the idea
dies don't use hashtags and don't say
what you're doing in your photos that's
what I would if you wanna of it so but
Lipton had one why where if you the the
hashtag was brisk pic which is like if
you're to hash tagging a photo bris pick
you know Lipton is gonna take yay i do
want to save it I I want to say that as
a as a person in the world as a human
being if you use a hashtag provided to
you by a some sort of you know consumer
entity like coca-cola if a it's like you
know hashtag coke is it and you're using
coke is it I you don't deserve to have
the right to your proper to your stuff
because you are basically doing an ad
for them that's what the hashtag is like
make no mistake about it when a company
has a hashtag not so you can seem cool
or participate it's so they can get your
content rounded up in their community so
that's the thing so russell brandom who
is one of our newest riders russell be
random i love you he did a great piece
on what the advertisers actually he's so
crazy he'd be random he'd be red uh no
but he did a great piece on what the
advertisers actually want out of
Instagram and they don't want your
photos they photos are cheap in the
grand scheme of creating advertising
right you hire a photographer you get
the photo you want it exists right
what's expensive is getting people to
care about you so it's they're not
trying to round up stock photo emotions
are expensive right love love love do
cost a thing actually I have to go
that's awful um no but like so getting
people that engage their brand and use
the hashtags and care about your product
and and tweet pictures of it using
Instagram that's hard um photos is easy
so right if you know Russell's piece was
the advertisers are like we're not
interested in the photos at all we're
interested in the data about who's
engaging with our brand how much they're
engaging with a brand what they're doing
and it's all this like when I read it my
eyes glaze over because I don't care
about advertising right so it's funny
because the the second level of kind of
dumbness here is yeah sure maybe
Instagram
your photos but does anybody want to buy
them and the answer is kind of like no
well we've all seen the taco we've all
seen the Taco Bell ad with the Instagram
pictures in it and I don't know half of
those so half of those are fake the
majority of them I think are actually
fake and then the other private doesn't
surprise me that their act that the
photos are staged like that's right idea
but they used so here's the thing so you
used a handful of user photos and
there's a techcrunch and a piece on it
yesterday and they used a handful of
user instagramming user photos in them
but they went to the users and paid that
right they paid them in taco bell gift
cards which is lame and horrible okay i
was like i'm gonna pay you to talk about
gift i guess if you're the kind of guy
who instagrams the photo of yourself
eating the doritos yeah taco bell taco
right here you're gonna be pretty stoked
if they're like will give you like 10
free Dorito tacos in this troubled
economy when the dollar keeps changing
value that talk about gift card that
talk about obviously that's right always
gonna be worth of race always gonna be
worth of talking uh the true gold
standard in America I think that I think
that uh you know I thought that doesn't
surprise me at all first off but I think
the fear is like you look at that
commercial you go oh man what if they
decide to just do that if they could
just do that you know and I think that
was the where the fear the main fear
came from and I you know look you wrote
the piece and it was pretty clear that
you know once the once the terms were
explained by somebody who actually
understood the terms it wasn't what you
thought it was but there was a moment I
felt the same way when I started reading
about the new terms of service but look
he won't get up but if you look at for
example take take it to somewhere else
look at twitter yes so twitter has much
broader terms and Instagram right
Twitter can take your tweet they can
modify your tweet they can distribute
your tweet they can republish
rebroadcast every single day commercial
organizations use Twitter data that
people submit so we embed tweets all day
long we make money by running ads next
to those tweets no one's freaking out
right I when you watch the news after a
big event it's just news anchors talking
heads a reading Twitter right right
that's what that's the experience of
watching CNN after the presidential
debates they're just putting Twitter on
the screen I love that stuff nobody's
paying the users of that right i mean
that's commercial exploitation of their
work and nobody cares
years now at crazy man 69 says I'm so
happy Obama won right does that guy
action does that did Twitter just sell
his tweet yeah I mean that's the thing
though right like you did that happen
crazy and I don't know crazy man crazy
man season yaad and and that is by the
way my alternate twitter handle right
and then it's uh you know obviously the
more the larger example is youtube where
YouTube has an insane array of rights to
your content I mean they can do anything
they want would that feel but that feels
like but but the YouTube feels like a
more even exchange in the sense that
okay if I put something on YouTube
YouTube can sell ads again said they can
use it to promote YouTube do all kinds
of stuff like that but I get an awesome
streaming awesome hosting service and a
public venue to show my videos so it's
like it feels like there's an exchange
Instagram feels very personal like and
even in its in the same way I'm not
saying that legally there's a difference
i'm not arguing that there's a legal
difference what I'm saying is to a
customer to a user of Twitter or YouTube
I see a clear direct and obvious benefit
to you know there's a trade-off I'm
getting this public broadcasting channel
and they're getting like my content
which they're going to use in different
places I feel like it instagram it
doesn't seem as clear because Instagram
feels very personal I think the
difference the truth is they're exactly
the same especially now that instagram
has like public pages i mean the fact is
like they're exactly the same in what
they do I think it's the association
that people have with them that makes
them feel somehow like how dare you like
my Instagram is going to be you know
putting some hash tag group in on a
coca-cola page my god how dare you yet
like if your if your was instant
you know was Twitter hashtag group
somewhere yeah yeah well I put it out on
Twitter like obviously that's going to
be out all right so I think that's
important but you know what I think let
me let me try to blow your mind here a
little bit there is this outrage over I
put this stuff on Instagram and now
Instagram is taking some piece of my
copyright that I never wanted to give
them and they're going to sell it and
make money off of my stuff right and
there's this worldwide outrage Kim
Kardashian is mad you know it's
obviously and this is this is as big as
it gets then the flip side Viacom sued
YouTube because k
are running around taking their music
videos and putting them illegally on
YouTube uh and they you know before VEVO
existed they weren't making any money
off of that and that was you know that's
why I common the record label saying why
is the service profiting from our work
that we paid for that we created without
any compensation now you know how it
feels guys the level of outrage in
return for that was why is why calm so
stupid right look why don't they
understand how good this is for that
it's like the the imbalance there is
enormous and it's well one I don't feel
any sympathy for a large corporation
like they should they should know that
YouTube is good by the same as human uh
yeah their people their people's united
uh but on the flip side its people only
care about copyright when it's theirs
they only care about property when it's
theirs to give away or not give away and
we're very quick online to just trample
the property rights of others right and
that's like that's what all that's the
tension all these services face
especially because you know this this
question that is it was asked all last
week why don't people just pay for
instagram they don't sell ads at all the
revenue potential of you know a million
people paying a dollar for instagram is
pretty low it's a million dollars the
revenue potential of coca-cola pay us a
million dollars to run a month worth of
advertising is very high so there's no
you're never going to get to pay for
these services it's never going to work
like that and so the tension between how
are we going to use our users property
to make money and attention between what
do users want from everyone else is like
Facebook is valueless is everybody stuff
is private right I mean ultimately it
has a value see if you can't just go see
everything on it so Facebook is always
trying to get people to share more stuff
is it enhances the value of their
service but that tramples you're right i
mean that's why facebook is so shady all
the time because they're constantly
walking there they're coming up to
you're basing of the fence of your yard
and saying how about we move this back
in it well this is every time this is a
good segue into the the thing that
happened a few days ago come this non
story that i was joking about right uh
you know so a few days ago cali
Schweitzer who is who works at vox who
works with us it tweeted a photo of
randi zuckerberg of the Zuckerberg
family right
Christmas I don't know whatever
celebrating the holidays and to be clear
it was a totally posed photo like using
the poke they were they were trying out
the poke app for the first time or
something at the Zuckerberg home and and
Randi Zuckerberg put this on her
timeline on on Facebook and Callie was
fret his friends with her sister on
facebook and she saw it in her time and
her feed and was like oh this is a
really cool picture I'm going to tweet
this now let me just stop really quickly
and say and I talked to Callie about
this and I think it's like you know
everybody has a different association
with how they use things or how they
view things on the Internet i I think
it's bad etiquette personally I think
it's bad etiquette to take to take
somebody's content from one service and
repost it on another unless it's like a
company or the person is being clearly
promotional like if Dell posts a picture
of a new laptop on Facebook and we write
about it on the verge or wheat I tweet
about it and include the picture I feel
like not a big deal because it's a it's
a the attention was there was to be
shared LT intention was to be shared and
Callie actually explain this to me that
she did a lot of that she did it she
covered a lot of the election and that
it was very common during the election
that Obama or Romney or some he would
post something on their Facebook page
and then all the media would go and take
that picture and repost it on Twitter
because they weren't sharing it to
Twitter they weren't sharing the same
things and so that was her thinking like
Oh Randy posted this publicly which is
how it appeared to her anyhow long story
short Randy didn't post the thing
publicly she had tagged her sister in it
and it appeared on her sisters timeline
I think this is how it worked because
and because Callie was friends with her
sister it appeared on Callie's timeline
or any peer in Callie's feed and it
appeared to be public so Randi
Zuckerberg threw a hissy fit on Twitter
and was like I don't know how you got a
hold of this how dare you repost this
but it was like really so it's like
these two these two per this perfect
storm of of like I think that digital
etiquette on Callie's part sorry Callie
um and Callie's very lovely and she had
did not intend to like make anyone angry
it to defend her for a second like it
look out it looks promoting well its
promotion also Randi Zuckerberg is the
former like people know I
I agree AJC it did seem promotional also
if it seems like if it's in a public
feed if it appears to you as a public in
a public feed it's kind of like a little
bit more of a fair game than if it were
a private like thing or just shared
amongst a few friends but but but so but
then Randy Zuckerberg reaction was like
totally bad form it's like if you're
Randi Zuckerberg like wouldn't it just
be easier to DM the person or email them
and say hey I saw you posted this
picture i didn't really wanted to be
public do you think you can delete it
her reaction was to go on Twitter and
start complaining about it which is I
think what set off this like I consider
the thing a total non story it's like
hey somebody made a bad judgment call
and where to put a picture and then
somebody who happens to be a Zuckerberg
got mad about it and complained about it
on Twitter to me those things are like
not stories people made it into this big
like even ready Zuckerberg doesn't
understand Facebook privacy and like it
really wasn't that it's like she didn't
know that Callie was friends with her
sister so she didn't understand
immediately how Callie saw the picture
which is fine like I don't you wouldn't
automatically be able to judge how
somebody saw a picture if you saw them
reposted on another service um and like
that's the long and short of it but it
became this really stupid story like I
honestly I'm sorry like we we talked
about it a dozen different times like
should we hit this and I could not find
the actual story in it yes like oh let's
it's like if dick costolo DN failed if
he tried to DM everybody and he screwed
up and then we wrote a story about it
like even bukas tolo doesn't know how to
use dm's on Twitter like it's kind of
not a story it's like everybody makes
mistakes like Randi Zuckerberg
overreacted and Callie made a mistake of
repo senior picture not really a story
but it was like seriously on the front
page of reddit the next day which was
surprising not just right it was it was
in a taxi TV news feed like I saw it
like on the airport Oh a home that's
when I first I I mean obviously it's
just an opportunity for people to make
fun of randi zuckerberg I mean that was
like well so I think that's actually the
deeper connecting thread here I said our
fear and distrust and antipathy towards
Facebook is so high that Mark Zuckerberg
sister who no longer works for facebook
is now a reality TV show producer for
Bravo uh
we're eager to to tar and feather her
because she doesn't know exactly how
Facebook how and she's in a unique
situation right she has facebook
subscribers she has facebook friends I
mean like that's not a normal Facebook
privacy situation for her right right
well also the whole thing is abnormally
it's like Callie has a bunch of
followers on Twitter ya ready Zuckerberg
is ready Zuckerberg it's not like this
happens to regular people you know like
my aunt is not on Facebook going like
how come my picture was reposted on
twitter by a person with a hundred
thousand followers like that doesn't
happen because that's right not going on
in reality because nobody Instagram I
think Instagram would have if Instagram
wasn't owned by Facebook and they
changed their terms I think the world
would have seen it in a different light
yeah they would have gotten you
certainly would really say I think they
would have got anything so if the same
was still a six-person start-up and they
changed the terms of survey I think they
would have gotten more slack I think
they would have gotten a lot more psych
instead it was immediately read as evil
Facebook continues to you know know and
when I first saw it it was definitely my
first instinct was oh this must be
something that has they've been kind of
pushed into by Facebook like Facebook
was like you need to get in line with
our Terms of Service so please change
your policies like that was my initial
reaction and I think it's like we have
we have a high miss trust or distrust of
Facebook because Facebook has been and
really irresponsible company they've
made really irresponsible decisions and
you know like I don't I don't interact
with Facebook the way I interact with
Twitter or Instagram or any other any of
these other discrete services because i
feel that whenever i do something on
facebook i'm making i'm giving them
something they need to run their bit
like I'm making the exchange with them
which is like they're only providing the
service in so far as it can get them
something that you know to me in so far
as it can get them something they need
which is similar in the sense to youtube
but I feel like what YouTube provides
far outweighs what they take away
whereas I don't feel on Facebook that
what they provide outweighs what I put
into it you know right I think it's
actually quite the opposite it's like
social networks are nothing new what
they do in terms of sharing is not
really special or new and in fact like
there are
20 different discrete services that do
everything the Facebook doesn't probably
better in many ways but Facebook makes
it feel like there's an unfair exchange
happening every time you do something
and that makes me less interested in
using the service it makes me feel more
guarded about what the service will want
from me and what it'll take for me and I
think that that goes right back to the
Instagram thing which is people felt
suddenly that they were taking more than
they deserved and I think that's you
know I think there's a question of of
their the bigger question here I think
is not you know whether the Terms of
Service are fair to the user but what
are we willing to give up to have a free
service because other give us everybody
to pay twenty dollars a month for
Instagram they would lose you know a lot
of users pretty quickly I think I don't
think people would say like oh I gotta
pay day to you know what its flickr get
20 bucks a year for a pro account
something like that all right you know
we've seen it even with um with games
and iOS right there was a punch quest
was a game like a freemium game yeah and
they were gonna run entirely based on
like in-app purchases or whatever and it
just didn't happen they used to make any
money until I they they they change
their mind and said we're gonna start
driving people towards in-app purchases
yeah right people don't want to pay for
stuff and they have no desire to do it
the freemium model is really hard unless
you start to do really shady things like
say we know everybody wants this one
feature so that's the feature we're
going to hold out unless you pay the
money and that feels cheap to people I
don't that doesn't engender good will in
your user base you know I think the
question of what are we willing to give
up for a free service there in my mind
that this was the second piece I wrote
about Instagram if the reaction to we
change our Terms of Service is always
going to be this like heightened
scrutiny and this crazy and people are
going to get it wrong I think all these
companies are just going to start
writing incredibly broad terms of
service when we write about a new web
service that shows up we don't ever do
an analysis the Terms of Service right
like right when we when we're like yours
if this than that like we never went
looked at the terms and said they can
take everything from you right on right
but they it's better for them now to
write in terms of service that in for
every startup to write in terms of
service that enables them to take
everything for
yeah at least they can that's right and
never change it and I think that and I
think that and it and it's really
important to note that it's not just
that they're you know it's a companies
are in you know if you're in business to
make money or you think you're going to
make money at some point I mean this
goes for everything no matter what it is
and I've done you know right obviously
we've done leave business contracts with
the verge and with Fox I've done
contracts in music and like and and and
you know I've had apartment contracts
and you know weird things in New York
that you end up getting into because you
live in New York and in every case when
it comes to the person who's giving you
the contract their job is to cover their
ass as much as humanly possible and even
if it's like aggressive or malicious
towards the person who's getting the
contract I mean sign a lease in New York
and check out what the lease says
believe me believe me it is not fair to
the person who's renting the apartment
it is fair to the landlord who owns the
property and has something it really is
something to lose right um so I think
that that you know you have two people
have to start understanding these are
businesses their intention is to make
money and be successful and and in order
to do that you typically when you enter
into a contract with somebody for your
business you do whatever is in your best
interest in the contract and you don't
as a user you don't get to negotiate you
know you're there sign the contractor
you don't I mean we've been doing this
for 50 years than not 50 years we've
been doing it for how long 30 years with
computers you get a piece of software
you put the DVD in or you put the disc
in and it asks you gives you this this
huge page of legalese which nobody ever
reads and it's like agree or disagree
well I'm guessing that 99 times out of
100 you agree right and you have no idea
you're creating two well I disqus people
don't know and it's usually crazy like
if you actually read it you'd be like oh
wow I didn't know that adobe has the
right to anything I create you photoshop
which they probably do for all I know
right but so here's the thing which i
think is interesting if you look at the
history of like consumer protection law
which is like basically started in the
60s and 70s I mean they were to the
state governments are like to the point
where they're mandating certain size
fonts in like rental car agreement
that's right they're like this has to be
in capital letters and asked in like
fourteen point x a greater like this is
in the law
and it do any good like you can't make
people read the contract you just can't
like you can you can do all kinds of you
know song and answer at it but there's
nothing you can like the government can
do to make citizens read contracts with
third parties it's never been proven to
be effective what you can do though is
you can you can say well Facebook is bad
at this and I think this is probably
Facebook fears the most is facebook it
has this terrible reputation for doing
shady things uh is there going to be an
alternative service it has a better
reputation is that service possible well
everybody say just like they said with
dig dig sucks now we're all gonna go to
Reddit and now write like dig is better
now and people are like there's all this
like Reddit controversy they're gonna go
back to dig like will people was there
actually a market for privacy in the way
that there's been a market for user
experience and like features all this
other stuff are people actually going to
care about it and the answer for
facebook overwhelmingly has been no they
don't care Facebook continues to do
like just terribly shitty things to its
users with their data with their privacy
and the people keep signing up for
facebook and I don't know where the
breaking point is going to come it
certainly wasn't a rumor that Instagram
was going to sell your photos what's
next you know like is it is it like Mark
Zuckerberg comes to your house and I
gives you like a body scan like is that
the level like I don't honestly I don't
know so here's here's the one concern I
have is re when I agree with about nine
members and everything you've said about
this the one concern I have is that
we're basing this whole conversation on
the person the people just getting the
interpretation wrong was there a way for
Instagram to handle this better and get
that Terms of Service out the way it was
originally had I mean it's a publicity
issue first and foremost I don't want to
completely blame everybody for having an
crazy reaction because it's what's in
them so they went backwards yeah so the
thing is that they didn't have the piece
in place what they needed to do was say
here's how we're going to advertise on
Instagram they don't know the answer to
that question so what they did was they
rewrote their terms of service to enable
them to share data to Facebook and to
you know allow this narrow set of uses
we're going to put ads around your
photos um that's great they still don't
know how they're going to sell the ads
if they had said here's how we're going
to monetize Instagram here's a list of
like five specific ad types we're going
to do
and then we've changed the terms to
reflect it I think people would have
focused on the specifics and they never
would have looked at the legal language
but they don't know the answer and I
think for Instagram that's the biggest
dangerous they don't know the answer to
how they're going to make money and I
need it now why why change it now why if
they had to expect something like this I
think they changed it because they
needed to share some data with Facebook
and in order to share some data they
they changed some language about and
this is actually thing they message we
changed their terms of service so that
we could share data with Facebook right
that was the pr headline of the terms of
service they should that should have
said that right well thats I say that
was the first mistake right but that you
know we mentioned Facebook we got boss
my facebook we need a sense and data to
them we need to help do some but they
didn't say instagram so people read the
terms and said oh I get it this is how
they can make money we need we need it
they should have just said look we need
ducker Brooke needs to personally look
through every photo see if there's
something that turns him on right and so
we just have to alter our Terms of
Service what's it you know my question
for Instagram is are they gonna ever
will they get past this are they now the
poster child for bad terms of service
and for like confusion is that part of
their brand I think that I think that
the Instagram I think this kind of
tarnished their moment I think that this
is I think Instagram was but you know
Twitter's done all kinds of horrible
things that the media made a big deal
out of like all the aggressive stuff
they've done towards developers and you
know it there was a lot of there's a big
brouhaha everybody was very upset for a
week and then a new story came up and
the rest of the world went on using
Twitter as they had previously which is
using the Twitter app right now yeah
yeah just they adjust it to the change
the difference between their lives
there's a difference between this tiny
community of pissed off Mac developers
you are loud and vocal and and want to
believe they were on the internet even
though they don't and there's you know
that that's great they can believe
whatever they want they can go to app
net and you know talk about like Mac to
seize or whatever as they do there yeah
but there's a big difference between
that and like very characterization of
the people on app.net that's that's what
I believe they do and how much
and how much better they are than
everybody else that's not accurate and
there's a difference between that and
people saying oh use Instagram oh they
can saw your photos but ok what about
what that's like real you know no no I
mean there's definitely now in in the I
mean the fact that look the fact that
this exists I just want to once again
yeah the front I mean just to be clear
like I want to point out how what a big
deal this is here's the cover of Us
Weekly okay here's the page you open a
story about Instagram like it's like the
first thing that I us weekly needed you
to know about um I do think that they
are that I do think that their image has
been tainted I think that the next time
look it's like but I hear people say
crazy things about technology all the
time I heard people talking in the
airport a few weeks ago about how
Samsung um won a court case against
Apple Annapolis and two billion dollars
um you know like people don't know
what's up like people regular people out
in the world don't know what they don't
know what you know frankly I don't know
what I do but I think you have to
understand that there are all sorts of
crazy rumors about stuff up and you have
to ask is it going to be a deterrent
when somebody gets their phone for the
first time and all of the friends are on
Instagram are they going to say no I'm
going to use what are you going to use
instead of Instagram to share your
pictures of cool filters do you know the
Twitter now has filters or Google+ like
you don't care about that stuff you know
that sharing photos with cool filters
happens on Instagram and where else you
going to do it you're like exactly how
we nine times out of ten or ninety nine
hundred times press the agree button I
think people will say like you know take
my chances so I do think it tarnishes
their image for a moment i do think
they're gonna carry this around for a
while but i don't think it'll actually
stop people i mean only the biggest
nerds are going to like let me put this
way it's kim kardashian still on
instagram yes or no do we know did she
quit I haven't checked i'll bet you a
thousand dollars a Kim Kardashian is
still on Instagram you know why she got
mad about it on Twitter for 10 minutes
and then got her nails done and forgot
about it tan she moved on to like you
know whatever the next thing the Kim
Kardashian is not here has not posted a
photo of herself on the service since
the necessary words you having her
lawyers look into it yeah I mean it has
been the holidays actually while we're
looking this up you get rid of her
account
she delete her account nothing she has
no well here's what she said on twitter
i really loved instagram i need to
review this policy i don't think it's
fair for days ago she posted a
gingerbread house she's fine listen
listen to this if instagram can sell her
images says our Kardashian pal she has
to quit because that leaves her with no
control I mean I tried Ashley and powell
is speaking out remind me cuz that uh
this does remind me a little bit of a
Twitter's Promoted Tweets and like the
promoted hashtags that that kind of
happened no one cared then either or was
it was there a hoopla our backlog
there's always a hoopla because you know
people don't want to believe that other
companies have to make money it's like a
Facebook's promoted right so the same
thing right like if I really want
somebody to see what am I like Facebook
status updates i can pay facebook to put
it everybody's feet yes is that do you
care I don't think I'm offended I'm
offended about all of it I mean this is
this is a classic we should move on to
another topic cuz I'm getting bored of
this but this is a class I mean I think
this is just a classic internet move I
think that we're i think that the
Internet has made something just like
the Randi Zuckerberg angry tweets to
cali I think the internet loves to make
mountains out of molehills and I think
that this is not this is a combination
of fud of people not knowing I'm not
understanding writing before they
understood um the you know this is this
is that what is the Winston Churchill
quote it's like you know al I will go
around the world twice before the truth
has a chance to put its shoes on or its
boots on pants on or something I mean
this is club this is a classic humanity
like we love the stuff that sounds the
worst and it's in we love to gossip and
it goes you know it travels far faster
than the truth the truth never gets a
word in edgewise and and this is just
another case of society latching on to
BS and and not letting go you know and I
think that I'm and I think that that you
know I don't think Instagram is going to
have there's going to be a material
impact to them but also it doesn't
matter because their business is part of
Facebook's business and it's either
going to be a right down to there going
to be a billion-dollar right down from
facebook or not and I don't think that
they're a billion-dollar right down at
this point no I yeah I think
facebook facebook has bigger it's funny
cuz facebook like they so obviously
don't care you know service they
launched this ain't the same week of the
Instagram controversy uh uh no not poke
uh the test of you can pay a dollar to
message people that is right not French
oh yeah which is like the shadiest thing
I've ever heard so so let's actually
talk about that I want to have a poke as
well and snapchat of course we have
talked about snapchat but um so this
dope a pay a dollar to message someone I
just want to understand the the logic
here so I'm on facebook yeah and I am
friends I'd see I'm like searching for
something right or I see and I see
somebody who seemed to babes I'm
cruising for babes and I want to talk to
somebody about not friends with them and
not friends with any of their friends so
I pay a dollar to Facebook and they let
me send that person a message yeah is
that the idea that's the idea and they
think this is be a profitable part of
their business know that what they told
Ellis was this will help us cut down on
spam which I don't understand because
haugen spammers said how can you use if
you in our friends with people right
there they're just like they're they're
seeing if you know if they're seeing if
people are inch into it it's like it
they're basically copying an idea from
LinkedIn right if you sign up for like
LinkedIn premium or whatever it is finds
the difference to me is that LinkedIn is
explicitly like a social network for
businesses it's for businesses right you
would you would pay as a business to
talk to somebody that you want to talk
to right right and that's like that
makes sense to me on facebook it's like
you know who's gonna pay a dollar to
talk to me is like jerks from high
school creepy like yeah dirtbag yeah and
it's like no i mean if i were a dirtbag
on facebook um i don't i feel like i
would just find some other Avenue I
would just know I would just move on I
mean a dollar seems like a lot to pay to
send it to throw well they're gonna well
it might actually be the low end you
know this is but it's also funny because
facebook keeps on trying to extract real
money from people in exchange for like
increasingly Dumber things so they've
been pushing Facebook gifts for like
forever right I give us a dollar and
we'll put like a present icon on your
friends page it's like this nobody buys
this which is wildly I mean like wildly
stupid in my opinion I just don't get I
don't know I mean now that the new
myspace exists I feel like Facebook's
days are numbered uh I mean I just feel
even on it
I r you all are you all over it head man
I'm all over the new myspace uh-huh or
else I'm loving it this is this I'm
loving no I'm Irish yeah my new I in new
myspace is Justin gates just a music
service basically right i mean they seem
to be fully almost one hundred percent
focused on music and like listening and
like connecting with artists I mean
could any of those terrible nu metal
bands for the early two thousands have
existed without my space I mean Shane
cook isn't Dane Cook a product of my
space really I think so yeah and then I
think we feel me ya know PG was a real
bad before myspace but they needed my
space to help them but i think that uh
no I don't know if the new myspace is
not is nothing to write home about I
have no strong opinion on it except that
I don't need another social network and
I certainly don't need another way to
connect with musicians or youth listen
to music so I'm not gonna I'm not I
don't see myself using it I mean at this
point if your social network you really
have to justify your existence and some
meaningful way beyond like we have a
different interface and Facebook right
so thanks to that music a facebook so
that is snapchat and what's funny is
that Facebook copied it's so fast but
that was snapchat right yeah snapchat
was a social network that allowed you to
basically not keep a record of what you
do and to communicate using the internet
and all these great tools we have now
without the creepy permanence of the
internet all these tools we have now uh
it would apparently became an instant
haven't used it yet because I don't have
anybody sexual i mean III had a my my
brother's girlfriend Katie who writes
her BuzzFeed is obsessed with I fiance
his fiance is obsessed with snapchat to
the point where like I've had a couple
of meals with her where she'd like won't
stop talking about it and I have to I
had asked her if she's like being paid
by said she's just really anything she's
not be paid she's really into the idea a
snapchat for some reason and not for
sexting or anything just for blix any
weird stuff to people and and so I
signed up for it and I mean I played
around with it i think i'd seen it
already but I've I don't I I mean to me
like there's only we're really is only
one use
right i mean it's for texting okay it's
for its for dong it's for dong pics okay
fun tonight like and like and yeah you
know is it for underage people sending
around like nude photos probably cuz
that's what kids do right nowadays
that's what I'm told I mean uh you know
ATT offers their unlimited texting plans
I have for anyway that's what I think is
I think there is a real beyond just that
I think there's a real fear that like
you know we'll have some conversation I
am or text or whatever and then like you
show it to somebody else right ah and
that's like but you're gonna be home
people are afraid of that right you this
actually gets back to that that
conversation about Randi Zuckerberg
photo which is digital etiquette and and
what we think of as what is proprietà
sand what is not and I think that um uh
you know we have two people are gonna
have to deal with the fact that they if
they're living their lives online that
that that digital breadcrumb trail is
forever right but that's what I'm saying
but so that's so snapchat you're saying
like to be a new social network you have
to offer something Facebook can't yeah I
think that's why snapchat was successful
even if it I you know they're not real
it's taking their positioning their
positioning is all wrong I mean yes
maybe but it didn't offer it is like
they weren't like you know what this
gives you an opportunity to communicate
with people and not have to worry about
leaving this this trail of breadcrumbs
it or let you know having them repost it
on somebody else to service or whatever
it's the positioning was like share hot
pics with your friends know they've been
even getting way away from they've been
knocking they've been backing away from
you guys they realize that like being
the service that like 16 year olds used
to send nude photos is probably not a
sustainable business or is it or is it
the most asuras at the ultimate I don't
have a sustainable what if you're like
what is a never-ending market it's 16
year olds who is a 60 year olds making
bad decisions like that market never
ends sorry there there will always be a
new group of six year olds making poor
choices but about their bodies in there
and then and there but so it's funny is
it Facebook immediately launched poke
which they developed in like 12 days
yeah you know so by the way so yes a
facebook launched a basically a
competing app which is poke which is
funny because Facebook it's at entire
existence is predicate
Zuckerberg has even said this and and
into it to a weird and upsetting and
creepy degree that Facebook is
predicated on knowing the real you like
knowing the actual nilay patel or the
actual josh Topolsky they don't want you
know they don't want crazy man 69 or
whatever my other headless body that is
a real account by the way on what or
dude crazy me a 69 on twitter yes oh
sorry buddy you know what you're you're
that's your fault for making using that
name um so start fault it's just fault i
played crazy man okay by the way his
last tweet is you look damn fine girl so
the one before it to Daniel Tosh about
how long you prolly lost in bed this is
only four seconds i told i told you this
is my alternate account I'm so fat I ran
out of gas going around her after
filling up and it was a hybrid
thankfully today no Daniel Tosh burns
okay so then you were great name I'll
and your rhymes are tight keep it going
don't you don't hear me talk about that
stuff and everything man hold on a
second I wasn't you I was getting to a
point that's amazing which I'm
completely off track from do you know
what I was what point I was making just
before you start saying the great
science you know facebooking predicated
on knowing you know that their entire
existence is predicated on knowing the
real you and using the real you to make
money um and and and this is like oh
here's a private way to message people
like to think about snapchat is it can
be it can also be anonymous you know and
I think it's weird that facebook wants
to get in on that game but you know
jason calacanis uh wrote and I and I
rarely you know talk about him or or
even probably agree with him on things
but you know he's a smart guy and he
wrote uh this great piece about poke
which was basically like why is Facebook
making such a big deal out of getting
into this game when they should be
focusing on on what their product what
kind of revenue stream their product is
going to generate or how it continues to
generate revenue and this is not a
revenue generator unless unless they're
going to merge that dollar yeah
that dollar message service was stabbed
chat it's like pay a dollar to send an
anonymous image to sub 1 hey free idea
Facebook not but no Jake the piece is
really good and it's on it I think it's
on his launch blog or something um i
right Alice you know Ellis from a
similar piece for us which was that yeah
poke has no chance of competing right it
was is actually for poke launch people
in there just rumors and Alice repeat
pieces like people don't want people
don't believe facebook is going to throw
anything away they believe they're going
to take everything and keep everything
and like build some perfect advertising
profile of you and so they're not going
to use poke and I don't even know what
the numbers for pokemon are now I don't
know if people are using it right no one
has brought it up to me I think it's a
great use of that brand you know in
facebook first launched poke was like
the feature like that was the thing you
did with facebook that's a great foot
boat that was the facebook that we're
like we can just ate a poke button
there's nothing sensitive about that and
also Facebook isn't too bad right yet
right well it was that was like baby
College facebook before hands right but
like it's a it's a good use of the brain
I just don't know if anybody's going to
use it like I I certainly have no desire
to give this goes back to what you're
saying Josh I've noticed our to give
Facebook more things and they I mean
prove they that they are a good place
those things to go yeah and I mean it
and I think it's like it's it's it's
really important to to think about well
first off what what's the point of the
service I mean and how does it mean how
are most people can interact with i mean
do you have a reason to use snapchat no
yeah sadly no like right sadly now i
just say all the people who need to see
my dog have seen my dog wow that is bold
and an amazing out there is that true
deeply a fee that is deeply any i'm
moving on you come to in your life
you're older I just had a birthday and
so speaking speaking to realize that the
dong list is closed speaking of dongs
now chat snapchat it turns out there
they've got some security issues they
had a bug I think it was covered last
week that that you can
see the videos that you send people
after the period with you could watch
them I think it was it's not and poke
though I think polka issue yesterday I
don't know no snapchat had an issue
snapchat we ran snapchat the story like
today has like an iOS bug where you can
see your videos the videos that were
sent to you so you know that's the thing
is ultimately a these aren't really
they're not really private and there's
always going to be some way around it's
like once that picture hits somebody
else's phone it hit the phone and
there's going to be some way to get at
it and I think that there's also some
theory if you can do to be able to save
these photos right so it's it's not
Chuck and Facebook so what it is like
it's there's a photo file it's an easy
movie file if you just have a file
browser for iphone you could just grab
these right i mean i think once you
create you know bits there people can
copy them in one way or another I think
that's like fairly obvious but right you
know it's like a well the BBM used to
have like read receipts like back in the
day and I remember Jacob Schulman
telling me about all these like BBM
hacks he'd done so he could read
messages without letting the people know
that he'd read the messages like it's
distinguished it's the same thing it's
teenagers are gonna like a if you're
gonna make bad decisions other phones &amp;amp;
B figure out how to avoid the technology
in place to insulate them from those bad
decisions right they're good at it you
know like that's that's just the way it
goes yeah and I think that um I think
that I don't know and I think I think
the time has come where you know based
on this like the Instagram stuff uh you
know people need to really start
thinking about what it is that they what
it is they're doing what they want a
service for you know that that you can't
just be like everybody's just signing up
for every new service I mean and we have
this you know in our industry it's it's
like this desire to use the new thing
and I feel like a lot of times you kind
of rush to use the new thing without
thinking like what is the new thing do
for me exactly or what does this do that
other things don't do and I think that
that i'm not saying let's not use new
things because i love new things but i
am saying like maybe a tiny bit more of
critical thought behind what it is we
want to do with them and how we want to
interact with the world using those
services might be beneficial also
understanding what what
terms of service meeting versus
right-thinking you understand what I
think I I imagine poke at a decent
launch because the cost to try was
nothing but there's nothing I kept it
around yeah but but you have to want
like if you're a.m. if you're in a
Facebook user you have to want to
communicate the way Pope wants you to
communicate and how many facebook users
are like oh man finally I can send
discreet secret messages me all this
time I've been interacting on Facebook
the service that lets me connect with my
family and friends but what I really
wanted to do was send dong photos to my
to my loved one like we're happy like
where did she turn you take your dog
photos like I haven't honestly I haven't
used pokes I can i really can't talk
about to me right i mean it crazy minute
69 is you spoke well into only today
extremely to send sick burns Daniel Tosh
I gotta do you have to do it in a
discreet manner Tasha talk show get
catch on alright what else we have in
our list of topics anything do you see
the hobbit I was actually very curious I
haven't seen the hobbit i won't i won't
i won't see another three and a half
hours of anything set Miller I just
don't I just don't care I mattress do
you see it I have not same thing I'm
just like I'm not essential I just don't
want to see it in 48 frames I mean I
feel like I have to go see cuz cuz of
the 48 frames right but can you like can
we just do like half of it and walk out
okay just going to see what it looks
like that's all I want to see I mean I
guess it's here's the thing I really
really hate going to the movie theater
bad like it's I vowed never to do it
after seeing dark knight rises in the
theater and because it just was the
worst experience I mean that's a thing
like movie theaters are just bad
experiences for seeing movies I me if
you want to hear the movie or and be
comfortable um I'd still love I max I
think IMAX experience is something I
think an experienced a guy max is what
you're worth going to that I I I person
I'm not a big imax fan so I know that's
sacrilege is to say I like old fat I'm
like Quentin Tarantino I like
old-fashioned movie yeah uh but uh but
yeah I've just know I was like the level
of interest in The Hobbit that I have
right now is could not be lower yeah
especially because it's parently a bad
movie but I feel like I have to go see
it I mean I don't know go see it go see
it for us would you
I mean are you and are you a know you're
like we ran a review of it like yeah
right somebody something to somebody
else saw I mean I want to see it for the
48 frames I just want to know what
that's like cuz you say look let's go
it's like breaking new movie theater and
CS Ross you and me I don't give to break
in you can try just a light ticket I
just want to like see it you know like
why don't you just buy a ticket and we
go see a little bit of it and then leave
alright that's we're doing it's yes
that's actually what we should talk
about uh yeah like Oh see ya we're going
to see us again in just over a week yeah
you guys don't realize this but CES 2013
is happening in the verge will be there
in full force of course yes and this
could be a really interesting CS and
what we're gonna put we'll put some some
info about CS activities up on the site
very soon yes um this can be really
interesting CES because a lot of the big
players are not going to be there in any
meaningful way like Microsoft for
instance is not going to be there and I
think everybody's got seems like they've
got scaled very scaled-down plans and
maybe I'm mistaken maybe we're going to
be blown away by something maybe this is
the year that you know sharp just slays
it uh it's like 4k man yeah I mean maybe
I mean maybe but I don't know a lot of
people just bought their HD TVs and I
don't 4k is like it's cool but it's a
far off dream at this point you know I
don't think like there's me a big push
for 4k next year because the industry
does it I don't think industry feels
like changing up everything that they do
at the moment when they haven't even
figured it out I think once again and
this was was happening last year we saw
a ton of smart TV stuff happening with
everybody anticipating that Apple was
going to introduce something they had to
like beat them to the punch everything
that was introduced last year was
essentially a failure nobody cares about
it nobody talks about it remember there
was like motion-controlled who had most
like Philips head not Phillips up no
Santa Samsung and LG inside
motion-controlled remember that
everybody talking about how they're cool
motion control TVs work like no nobody
talks about it nobody cares about it
voice controlled nobody talks about it
nobody cares about it smart TVs are
basically a non thing you're either
using an xbox or a Roku or an apple TV
to get smart TV content I think my
favorite stat of the year has been most
TVs now are smart TVs it's like yeah you
made all the TVs smart TV no I mean this
is like using that my TV
this is like my TV is a 3d TV and I will
never ever use its 3d functionality like
just because you put a feature in it
doesn't mean people are going to use it
and it's not it certainly doesn't mix
that it doesn't show that there's any
uptick in in in use it just shows that
you put the feature into the TV because
it was cheap enough for you to do it was
it was at nielsen NPD that just at the
report said no one's using Smart TV
features which is kind of a no-brainer
report I have a smart TV and I use I I
never ever touch the Smart TV features i
also have a smart blu-ray player like
there are three i have like three things
in my in my yeah set up that art that
are smart and I never touch them I'm
gonna open up my menu for the first time
right here you oh no this sucks never
mud now they're really slow I mean
they're they're bad you know the thing
is it like with Smart TVs like the
internals of them have to get better at
the same rate that like smartphone
internals get better for that experience
to be good it's like why would you put
like a gigahertz Snapdragon your TV to
use three apps that you're never going
to use like so there's no incentive to
do it and you can't the market doesn't
change fast enough like I agree with you
Josh I think the cs is gonna be very
very muted I think there's going to be a
lot of uh I was talking to somebody in
the TV industry couple weeks ago and I
was like CES for me is always a series
of elaborate lies from TV manufacturers
and cable companies yeah and they're
like yeah that's what we do yeah like I
think I i think i think i actually think
as in in technology the lies are ours
are more see-through now and i think
that you know like putting your ma your
money where your mouth is is actually
you know as consumers as a growing a
massive consumers adopt and accept and
use tech real technology in their lives
you know there's some pretty interesting
data from christmas sales you know
something like some crazy uptick in
smartphone and tablet ownership like
three hundred fifty percent up
year-over-year and you know half of that
stuff was tablets you know I think it's
now one in four Americans has a tablet
right I think is that is this statistic
I think it's not like more more than
your readers at this point or something
like yeah and and it's like you know as
tumors get in touch with real technology
that is actually the kind of
life-changing and meaningful and execute
and delivers on the stuff that they have
been told it's going to deliver on you
know when you when you use an iPad and
you really get it for the first time
you're like oh this is actually doing
something that that I was promised and
it delivers you know I think that this
that this is the CES trend of showing up
putting on an exciting show talking
about how your new technology somehow
better than everybody else is new
technology it's like the follow-through
really has to be there the delivery
really has to be there and I think that
CES is is hurt by I think the whole idea
of a consumer electronic show is hurt by
the sheer amount of BS that welcomes its
deliver there and i think i think for
until the smartphone era right you could
go to CES and this is true this is why
CS was big and important you would go
there and every company there would lay
out some vision of everyone is going to
have this product everyone's going to
have a smart toaster or a 3d TV or
whatever it is and it turns out that the
product everybody ended up having was a
smartphone right and now that everybody
has a smartphone you have to convince
them that they're going to get something
else on top of it yeah and that's
something else nobody knows what that is
because it seems like almost every
product can be done good enough buy a
smartphone so a point-and-shoot camera
like cratered right because you can just
get a smartphone all this like crazy
home control stuff crater because you
can just like do it in a smartphone like
why would you install a massive home
control rig or home automation Reagan
like have a dedicated pc when you can
install like three of those like belkin
wemo like light switches and controlling
from your smartphone right right that's
what I see okay all God all this uh like
the Nike Fuel band and the Fitbit and
all that stuff I bought one for Becky
and I bought one for my brother-in-law
they have not once used their laptop to
interact with the Fitbit right they
they're only using their iphone staying
around with it because it's a better
experience and then
every single thing is collapsing into
well I have a smartphone and then
secondarily to I have a tablet you know
I haven't actually i'm only using my
laptop I'm not the autumn home for the
holidays right I'm only using my laptop
when I need so i get it and do like
serious work with it i've been using the
ipad in the nexus 10 like almost
exclusively this entire time and I
haven't like been drawn back to the
laptop yeah that's that's real I mean
that's like um you know we're buying a
new TV and we just did this crazy
roundup of Windows 8 All in One Touch
computers and like I'm it's a veteran TV
I'm seriously considering just buying a
windows 8 like touch TV for that thing's
running netflix on it because its a
bright it seems smarter to me than
spending out why would i spend eight
hundred dollars on a 40 inch TV when I
could spend eight hundred dollars on a
27 inch windows when I you just spend
why don't you spend like three or four
hundred dollars on a 40 inch TV and get
like an apple TV or a Roku because that
that's like I don't want all those boxes
like I just don't want one monitor a lot
it's one box it but I but that's the
thing it's like to me it's like I don't
this ain't right at set-top box like a
big screen later like don't you want
that I I would yeah I would get the dumb
display and get the Box attack whatever
that that's it but so that's a thing
you're saying you would get the dumb
display but the industry is I'm to not
sell you a dumbness no no I get that but
the industry is failing I mean we know
they're failing us but there's something
not it's a displays that nobody's using
you know how many opportunities vote all
homes across the every piece of the
industry is ok it's a consumer
electronic show what type of consumer
electronics are you show me that is
better than my smartphone right well
it's also it's also it's also trying to
justify you know I mean I just think
that in given our act the economic state
of the world right now trying to justify
a secondary purchase of a you know
either sir I think we there are certain
things you need right in your house
right you you've got to have a TV right
yeah you've got haven't evening most
consumers will say well I need to have a
TV at least in my living room and it's
got to be hooked up to cable that's like
bare minimum right got it I gotta have
cable and tv I need to have a smartphone
right I don't think
tablet has reached they need to have at
this point but it's getting pretty close
like I think we're right on you know
we're teetering on the brink of them you
need to have a tablet okay and then it's
like a laptop or desktop that's it
you're done you're basically done on
your you need to have like small
consumer electronics I guess TV's not a
small electronic but for a pricing
standpoint there now relatively
affordable and I think that I think that
you know you really have to justify your
existence and and CES to me seems
increasingly like a place where
justifying your existence is very
difficult not only because you're
surrounded by people doing the exact
same thing because the things that
you're talking about are actually
non-essential right to make everybody
just know the point everything looks the
same like we're in this point like all
the hardware designs where ubiquitous
you know we have like every company just
showing off different size slates that
have the same operating system a little
bit different it's a software story now
but CES has always been set up as a
hardware kind of event and we're seeing
my it's fun it's providing you gadget
you know I think about how we used to
like three or four to see us and we were
doing in gadget it was like very gadget
focus for like but okay what are the
camera stories here one of the best top
stories right the laptop stories and
it's like do those exist anymore are
there is there a camera story to told be
told in CS hmm no I mean IV the last the
last thing that was excited we know the
last thing is exciting CS was like two
years ago I think was the it was the
atrix right like wow this could be sorry
Josh but it was the one one of the few
things I can think of in the last few
years of CES where I thought whoa we
haven't seen this before right this we
didn't expect this and this could
actually be really cool like what if my
smartphone became like the the heart and
the brains of my laptop and I just took
like this kind of shell and this phone
and like that obviated the need for one
of my pieces like cool idea awesome idea
totally did not work total failure yeah
but but I think the fact that that that
that's the last thing I think of like
what happened last year no I mean it was
nothing right it was like there's a
little bit much but like that's it yeah
as Windows Phone state yeah but
Microsoft's presence was nothing new and
it's gone they already seen in Windows 8
was we'd already seen windows 8 and we
already knew what was coming and and you
know that dick the surface and it's all
just kind of a variation on a theme at
this point it's like kind of it's like a
touchscreen laptop or a laptop that is
it also tablet you know or so it's like
that mean but that's that's the same as
you know an ipad with it with a keyboard
dock to me it is introducing right like
well the surface is obviously different
but you know I'm saying I don't think
it's a revolutionary concept and
computing the way Microsoft wants it to
be at least and I don't think people are
necessarily asking for that I but so the
question is now what what next right and
everybody says the next thing is the
living room but I think we're actually
in a valley you know I think we just
happen to be in a valley when it comes
to innovation and I think that or you
could say it's a plateau either way I
think that we've hit a point where
there's been so much rapid-fire
innovation of the last five or six years
that we're now just kind of coming to
grips with what it's like to live with
this innovation and what it's supposed
to do you know you barely had a chance
to see what an iPad can do at this point
I mean I don't think it's nearly realize
the full potential of something like an
iPad or even a smartphone you know I
mean in Japan people use their
smartphones to get on trains like we
don't do that here in America and there
are a million other examples you can use
of ways that smartphones can be used I
mean home automation is a place where
home automation is not a new idea but if
someone were to make it simple enough
and prove that its energy efficient and
prove that it's actually an improvement
to your life in some way that you can
afford and that you want that would be a
big deal but that's all kind of tied
like you said to the brain of the
smartphone to the existence of having
this thing in your pocket right i think
i think i saw i agree with you I think
we've we've hit the point where we we
put the computer in everybody's pocket
which is a remarkable thing to have done
now the question is okay now what like
what are you gonna do now like really
you you and I actually think the way
it's the way things will look for people
in the future is you will have like the
one big desktop computer in your home
and then you have like phones and
tablets it like revolve around it in the
cloud so that your photos don't just go
to Facebook or Dropbox or Picasso or
whatever they actually land at home and
you have more control over them wait you
think you actually
you think people are going to start
doing to us I thought they were at the
point of people just do not want
desktops are you know I think I think
people are going to stop buying laptops
which we're already seeing happening
right like the trend towards buying
tablets instead of laptops is real i
just bought for christmas have bought my
mom a new ipad and so the laptop like
right she's never expressed any interest
in honing a laptop to me she's had one
but she has a combination of an iMac and
iPad and that's what she wants but you
think they were actually start going
back to desktops of games like I want
some physical location for my product
well I think you are I think people are
gonna want a big screen and I think
they're gonna want like storage yeah i
mean like you take a lot of photos on
your phone i think you want to see them
ma I need them it's it's the cloud now
like that's what we're gonna say it's in
the cloud I have a clot there's there's
no 21 inch screen and for you to look at
the cloud right like Josh do you have it
you don't have a desktop do you ever
miss one you know it's funny I was
talking last night about thinking that I
maybe wanted to get a desktop you know
we're moving to a new office I was
thinking maybe I would get a desktop for
the office and just use that for work I
also you know thought it'd be cool to
have one at home I don't nothing I do
require as a desktop I mean I just don't
see any need for it I mean I'm not you
know it just doesn't make any sense to
me I can't understand why you have like
you have a time capsule I'm it's like
I'm trying to remember what your setup
is as you've told me so you have some
place where like their storage in your
life right like your computer's all back
up to something I'm now backing up
exclusively to crash plan oh really in
the cloud yet in fact I'm actually i
paused a backup that I was doing of an
old drive of mine to crash plan I think
crash plan is brilliant it takes like
all of the guesswork out of this stuff
and it's like a little bit it's like a
little bit more complex to set up and to
use then you know something like a time
machine mm-hmm but it seems to be way
more reliable and I don't have to worry
about my stuff disappearing because it's
redundant Lee backed up on a bunch of
server somewhere it's its cloud again
there's no physical location yeah I'm
over I mean the whole the whole I mean
the whole idea physical storage to me
seems like ridiculously hopelessly
outmoded and like when I open iphoto to
downloads my photos for my photo stream
it seems like the
archaic experience no really does it
just seems like it's puzzling to me why
would even exist in that manner like
yeah right your iPhoto folder should be
issued your iPhoto should be like a
folder like a like a Dropbox or Google
Drive folder on your computer that they
just exist in and that like they're
there they just like you have to open
iphoto to get the photos down to your
computer it's hilarious isn't so when it
does it's the part of it that does the
sinking right like San just bizarre like
I don't even understand why I'd want to
store stuff like iTunes like I was
talking to you know we talked about this
before but when I do the thing with
Brian Williams I was like do you still
use itunes he's like yeah and I like to
me the idea of opening itunes to listen
to music is just a totally alien to me
now I hardly ever do it and it just is
not how i ingest or experience stuff and
so I think that I think that the you
know I mean like the cloud is obviously
where everything is headed I mean look
we're using a cloud service right now to
have this conversation you know I love
the fact i don't have to open skype to
do what we're doing I mean it's
incredible I'm also like also it's just
it's like better like this is extensible
like that we're using this hangout
toolbox which is something you can
install it to the lower thirds like to
me this is such an amazing like concept
and this is in a browser you can do this
on a Chromebook that's two hundred and
fifty dollars there's nothing happening
here that can't happen on the 250 large
role which to me is the most brilliant
thing in the world then I think that um
you know when I think about my phone and
my tablet everything that I do on a yes
it download stuff but ultimately
everything i'm doing like if i'm not
playing a game is cloud-based right you
know whether it's social whether it's
reading you know if I'm using like I use
reader on my iPhone on my iPad and some
other RSS stuff on my google products
but you know they're pulling down stuff
but essentially it's pulling from the
cloud it's not like I those don't need
to be there they could I could view them
only in cloud form like news stories
twitter is all obviously cloud to
Instagram is all cloud like I'm not
storing Instagram photo but I'm thinking
like if I had to like build the hat like
the house that I wanted it would have
like an imac in what in like my office
with like hard drives there
for all the stuff that I don't want to
put on the cloud and I want to keep near
me right what is that what would that be
I mean hard drive your hard drive is
more likely to fail your personal hard
drives more like I mean I'm not saying I
wouldn't like backed up but like the
photos that I take well want to download
them from the cloud every time I want to
look at a photo that I've taken I'm my
niece and nephew they watch they just
bought elf right from itunes I've
downloaded it to one of their computers
I don't want to stream that from itunes
every single time I want to watch it and
sometimes like they go in cars and I
don't want to like yeah I mean you know
why there's definitely no there's
definitely situations where you want
stuff locally stored um but it's I mean
I'm just like at pains to think of when
those situations happen for me you know
like like I get that yeah you kids go in
the car and they want to watch a movie
on an iPad and you need to download the
move to the ipad okay fine you should be
a checkbox that says download this to
the ipad that's what that's what that's
what you know that's what um Google
services do like if you get something on
their TV whatever you know there a story
you can download it or you can stream it
like you gonna come when it comes to
pictures you're not looking at the full
res every time we're going through the
thumbnails then u del are you looking
where who needs the full res on your
regular size monitor right you know even
on it even on a 1080 HD TV you're not
full res is like your knit way out of
the vicinity of what full resume but who
doesn't want to zoom in endlessly okay
fine but but but that's fine but I mean
on a decent internet connection you know
sorry but what I'm saying is I think to
bring this all the way back to CES I
think the next part of this puzzle is ok
now we have like 50 disparate things we
have 60 cloud services but an average
human being doesn't know what to use how
to use it how to connect a phone to
their tablets there right right how to
make how to bring all the stuff the end
this is why the living room is a Holy
Grail right i mean this is housekeeping
though ultimately you know I will it's
but it's it's housekeeping only in a
sense that like instead of there it's
housekeeping the sense to me has to
build the house right i mean it's we've
dumped a bunch of like cement in like
two by fours in a yard and a pile it
enjoy this is my guess
actor I've just pictures like nobody
nobody ever actually said like here's
the here's how you should live I'll be
on to the you and I think about local
storage my main thought is storing
things on things that I have control
over like physically usually ends in
tragedy for me usually ends in um like
my stuff getting erased or being
destroyed like this just happened with a
bunch of time capsule backups that I had
they got destroyed because something
happened to the drive-in that if I'll be
honest with you somebody could come up
with a if something could invent a hard
drive that was like zero failure rate
like this will never break that would be
like you will never lose data on this
product that would be a revolutionary
project will drive you'd lose it in a
movie okay fine let's just say it's up
to me to make sure that the physical
drive doesn't get lost all right that I
don't it doesn't get burned up in a fire
or dumped in some water if you can make
a drive that was like no mechanical
failure no data loss like absolutely
resilient and redundant in some way that
meant it would never ever lose my data I
want to use local storage a lot more I
would download things a lot more often I
just don't trust I don't trust my hard
drives I don't trust this equipment to
store my most important things what I do
trust is an array of servers and and
drive somewhere that are like
essentially infinitely redundant you
know I believe that Google will do a
better job managing my data than I will
I believe that Google has more
redundancies in place than I do I
believe that crashplan has more
redundancies in place that Dropbox has
more donesies in place you know why
that's their business their businesses
data storage and so like I think that
would be a great hurdle to jump over but
i do think getting sorry getting back to
the the living room idea or this you
know i do think there is the question of
making all this stuff work I mean look I
am uh we had Christmas dinner a few days
ago and Katie's uncle who was in the 70s
has had just gotten an iPad and he was
setting up for the first time and man he
knew nothing about it he did not know
how to set it up and it he never would
have been able to figure out how to set
it up and like when he was using it for
the first time he didn't know how to
touch it
and it was crazy to me seeing someone
like he was like trying to get in there
with his fingernail and he was like
here's like aggressively tab and I was
like I was like just touch it like
you're just you know like you're
pointing out something on a page like it
was Eva I couldn't even explain how to
touch it properly why would you figure
no was it like something he was just
used to like this bad like no but he was
like he was interacting with the buttons
like they were physical buttons like you
had to like press down on them hard or
get your like get it on edge on them
somehow like it was just bit the but the
thing is like I said I've icloud for him
and I felt like God in a million years
most people cannot figure out how to get
this stuff working properly you know
cannot figure out how that's the thing
about google that i think that they
don't get i don't know if they get
enough credit for it but you know when
you set up a gmail account like your
stuffs just there like you know you the
password to your gmail account like you
can just get at that stuff there's a
place to click on it it's wherever you
go there is no setup you know you're not
downloading anything you don't have to
connect anything there's no syncing it's
like it's just there and like now that
they've integrated a bunch of their
services uh you know like targeted ads
of course which theory yeah i mean i
just--that's just like an honest review
service targeted ads that's all what
that's exactly what facebook does 24-7
yeah so like oh i guess you hate
facebook to you know like oh how about
you know it's like I don't have a
problem a targeted ads like they don't
bother me they don't bother me in my
email even because it's just I machine
reading words but the point is that
their stuff sinks and works and when you
get an android phone and you put your
gmail account in like you get your
calendar you get your contact you get if
you are drive user you download drive
and you say I want to use this gmail.con
all of a sudden your contents they're
like ah to me like that they actually
have been they've been solving the
problem all along and that's where
everybody else has to play catch up to
it's like put your TV down in your house
put in your gmail account and all of a
sudden like all your content is there I
mean that would be that would be a
problem solver they have obviously
haven't done that but i think that they
try and fail to do that I think there is
this lack of connectivity between these
things and lack of like understanding
for most people how to make them really
useful you know I don't think I cloud
provides the seamless like wonderful
elegant experience for it ready
provides a kind of a confusing
experience so I think that for TV makers
or for set-top box makers or for people
who are doing home automation or talking
about the living room or the household I
think to make things work together is
would be a big is that is that building
the house nilay is that what you think
yeah I mean that that's it it's it's
take you know my mom when she um we got
her an iPad but watch what she was
saying for like the week before
Christmas was I hear nooks are good for
reading and we couldn't figure out what
the hell she met uh and she was just
being very opaque it turns out that she
just meant that uh when you get when you
have a no can you go into barnes and
noble they let you read for free for an
hour so was she disappointed when you go
to the ipad no cuz i was like look it
has LTE like you don't need the free our
Wi-Fi barnes &amp;amp; noble she's like oh
that's that's way better for me and like
yeah what what just happened like that
it's it's this the level of confusion
over this stuff you know that i keep on
we came to samsung ads were they they're
sharing the videos by touching together
touch to share over NFC but in the ads
are a complete lie uh because the videos
don't transfer just by touching like
after like go up to the you know what i
mean like yeah it's not real but that is
the vision there and it's it's not even
to do right right um but that the
division that's out there in the world
like this is once you get this stuff you
just start doing all these amazing
things yeah really is once you get this
stuff you have to start making this
endless series of decisions over what
services you're going to use over
whether you trust google to store your
data or you trust instagram do not sell
your photos or whatever the media is
telling you it's going to do or how much
do you want to use facebook to connect
to your family in like this a series of
decisions is like impossible for but i
also think that you know oh i agree with
that and I don't think that Samsung
makes it any easier I mean Samsung ask
you to do all kinds of weird samsung
stuff like they've got their services
and keys air and like all this dumb
yeah nobody's copy right ya know all the
all the extra stuff that they've
included that are like they've thrown up
barriers you know um you know I do think
I do think that you know Apple still
gets it most right with the it just
works yeah scenario and for most things
like for our sample
simple setup but I do think there is
like removing those barriers removing
those that decision making process to
some degree and letting things be fluid
I think like what what technology needs
to do now is focus on like a reduction
in friction when I see the share screen
even an Android when you see like the
how you share like it makes sense it
does make sense it makes more sense of
what Apple does but there's stuff like
that I think that that's one of the
things all over iOS since i've been
using an iphone again uh I'm just like
man the level of friction that happens
here the lack of fluidity between things
just seems crazy to me you know and i
think that reducing friction is a big
challenge in technology and i think that
the reason it's a challenge now and that
it should be in the spotlight is because
regular humans are using to this is not
for just us it's not your for just nerds
it's not like hey I know how to do a
really complex setup and I know how to
go through all the steps and I'm happy
to choose like destinations and sources
like that's us but most people and the
people who are adopting those one in
four you know the three hundred fifty
percent increase in purchases on
smartphones and tablets that's that's
the world and at some point you're
either going to like drown in these
options or someone's going to find a way
to like throw you a flotation device so
if it yeah exactly so if we can talk
poetic vision I mean there are nodes and
their connections the nose was the
hardware we're bored with that it's
there the connection is how do we get to
the internet how to think right now it's
incremental improvement in the in the
hardware I think the software has been
incrementally improved too since I phone
the first iphone I think you know the
last big leap in software thinking I
think comes from what Google did with
ice cream sandwich and what they've
pioneered since then like I think in
terms of fluidity and i think that you
know i think that there's a the whole
range of thinking you know the ipad
interface is not the best the ipad can
be i don't think that it was made for
the ipad think it was made just it was a
scaled up you know I phone so I think
that now that I mean Ross what is your
exact question I need me I kind of cut
you also does that question which is an
idea I trying to connect this idea I was
going to talk a little bit about
wearable interfaces or
different kinds of way of interacting
but like that's that's more like a
guilty pleasure I don't think it's
actually a big deal this year but it's
something I wish it would be well I mean
I guess with wearable i gifted what is
the question you know what is the
situation where physical of a more
physical interaction makes sense um like
I don't like talking to my phone or
tablet well to be incredibly
uncomfortable and and can often
counterproductive and uh and slower than
tied Mia well you know it's actually
interesting is um other there are two
things i do a siri-like basically like
four or five times a week i use it to
set alarms which is it's actually really
good at yes and I think faster than
monkeying with a clock app uh and I use
it to make a phone call and I use it to
I asked it to call the car service in
Brooklyn that I use and what's funny is
it about i would say quarter of the time
I pick up the phone and instead of
saying call you know our service I just
ask it for a car uh and it's funny to me
that that's the thing that I actually
want to do is I don't want to like skip
the step of I want it's called a car
service I can talk to the operator I
just want to tell the phone what I want
I want it to be here right um and I
think that's where those interfaces need
to go beyond for this basic set of phone
functions so I'm asking for this set of
like life functions which is a car and I
think they're gonna do that I've and I
think and I have to say I think this is
one of the places where where Google now
gets things you know not always right
but often right where it where it
assumes where it assume something and
does tend to assume correctly yeah about
what your what your desired action is I
don't anything so Ivan I've been using a
nexus 4 and I really think Google now is
destined to become the home screen of
the phone I think it's right now it's
hidden away in this this piece because
it's not you know it's not terribly
useful but it should at least be a
widget it should be a widget but they're
you know they're adding cards to it it
gets more useful over time they do i
think it is getting the like i see it as
the home screen of the phone we got the
phone i turn on and unlock it and it
just shows me all this stuff that's
going on and it's basically if you its
most basic level
just automatic widgets right right well
as deciding what is the data you need to
see I mean it's time it's time it's like
you know search time location-based
widget yeah ultimately you know but I do
think that you know asking it to do
something is really not like asking a
computer to do something is what we know
how to do its what we used to do it and
like you know I'm it's I'm more likely
to get the result I want when I type it
into Google than I am when I ask Siri to
do it uh I found honestly I think series
most useful for locating things and
making phone calls like when you have
when your hands are full that to me has
been the thing that I found this series
like if I'm walking around or if I have
like a couple of things in my hands and
I need to get a phone number I need to
make a call that stuff is like it's like
it is like the assistant portion of it
really functioning well but I think that
in terms of being able to take action in
your life it doesn't it does fall short
and I think the talking to a phone is
not the most useful way to get
information talking to a talkie due to a
computer is not the best way to interact
with it I certainly like maybe people
sit around and dictate their writing my
my brain doesn't form thoughts like that
and maybe because i right but my brain
just doesn't work like I can't think of
clearly forum questions or actions in
that way and as those a privacy thing to
you unless I want people to hear you say
that well that's you definitely don't
want to be in a car with your friends
and you know dictating a text message to
somebody that's obviously not ideal so I
think that I think that I think that the
voice stuff is a little bit of a red
herring I think it's just like I think
it just didn't put in general like the
more inputs the better you know the more
it knows what you're doing the better if
it knows like where you are and what the
time of day is and what you just search
for um you know that's that's really
helpful um so anyhow we should wrap up
uh unless there's anything else we need
to talk about not really it's crazy by
the way that was the most depressing CES
preview I think we've ever done I'll be
honestly no CES is is uh is it has
historically been a gadget show um you
know I think that that
gadgets are interesting but are far from
the most interesting thing happening
right now you know I think that there
there's incremental innovation happening
in hardware I think that a higher
resolution screen doesn't blow me the
blow me away like you know good we know
what good screens look like we know that
there will be better screens we expect
that faster CPUs we expect that thinner
lighter form factors we expect that the
question is like what are the things we
need now you know what are the things
that people haven't given us yet that we
that a consumer needs or a user needs to
do something and and like I just think
that we oh we have plateaued a bit in
the hardware on the hardware front right
now and it is a question of good
software and the difference between good
software and bad software can completely
change your opinion of a device you know
I think the iPhone 5 is a beautiful
piece of hardware i think the software
tremendously diminishes often like how
elegant of a device i think it is you
know where is this has been going around
i think the tech press for weeks now why
phone is loaded up with google apps
that's yeah i mean i use i use chrome to
browse i use the new gmail app for my
email and i use maps exclusively like I
won't touch their maps at all and it's
not just because like it just doesn't
have the information have the data I
need it's not because I think the maps
are going to give me wrong directions I
do you think like most of the time at
least here in New York and I'm looking
at a map i'm looking for something
really specific and if I can't find that
thing in my first try when I'm out and
about and doing things yeah then the map
has essentially failed but um but you
know anyhow it's just like you know
software there's a lot to of work to do
in interaction with these devices and we
have done we've barely scratched the
surface I mean I feel like we're so you
know when I think about that I think
that the webos interfaith still seems
like really innovative and fluid no but
like at years after years after it was
announced and a year now a year after
it's been essentially killed I still
think man that interface was really
intuitive and really natural and made a
lot of sense and I still don't feel that
way when I'm using most modern devices
like I don't feel that I'm using a
really a really natural human targeted
device I feel like I'm like still kind
of grappling with a computer
it was it was a form over function thing
like it was a great interface it did a
lot of stuff whatever those cards itself
though just couldn't do enough
functionally yeah but I mean I'm take
mean take that concept now and put match
it to a quad-core CPU within a crazy GPU
and tons of RAM I mean that that I mean
that what we're doing i'm not saying
that like hey let's go back to use webos
his interface but i'm saying that the
palm did something that i still look at
and think this was intuitive and human
in a way that a lot of other interfaces
aren't and why aren't we doing more of
that why are we doing more stuff that
feels right to a user you know I know
that blackberry 10 is trying some of
that stuff and we'll see how well they
pull it off I think windows phone has
done some real thinking about what users
are actually doing but I think we're
lacking a general fluidity to these
devices that would be that would really
change our experience with them yeah on
that meaningful Dean or rather odd yeah
so uh so we will be to really quickly oh
I guess we should just say if you want
to get touch with us you can email us at
verge cast at the verge calm you can
leave a comment in the post when it goes
up you can find us on Twitter the verge
is at verge Neil is reckless I'm Joshua
Topolsky ross's oh no Rosco no e on the
end Laurel never any um and uh uh but we
will be at CES uh we're going we have a
big big plan a big exciting stuff
happening there a ton of video tons of
interviews live lots of live video 90
and 90 k talk about that Ross go for it
we're gonna have we're gonna have every
90 minutes we're going to have a 90
seconds on the verge all day long so are
you crossing yourself yeah brasserie I'd
never go so be dead by then we have a
moment we're gonna have like that we're
gonna have like a live show in the
morning we're gonna have 90 on 90 we
have a live show in the evening and and
tons of live interviews and hands-on
xand demos and all kinds of stuff like
the whole time we're at CES we're
bringing like a big crew out there i
think we now have over what is it 60
people over 60 at least over 60 people
come in which is insane we have a
double-wide trailer we're going to have
like it's cool we're going to be on the
floor we're going to be in the trailer
a post-up probably on Monday about you
know our CES kind of outlook in preview
and what's happening and uh and though
we have an awesome CS hub page where you
can get all the stuff you can just plug
right into it which will be up very
shortly and we're very excited about
that with a new kind of a tweak on our
design and it's cool so yeah so we're
still very excited by CS has a lot of
stories to tell their we're going to be
telling them there's a lot of stuff to
cover then we're going to be covering it
we are going to be we are the official
what is it our titles official tech news
source for CES um title exclusive we're
also the official we're also the
official interplanetary yeah new source
for CES which'll I people don't talk
about but that covers a number of number
of planets yeah within our solar system
and anyhow but it's gonna be big fun
it's going to be a crazy week of news
and that's get started what is the
official start date of cs is that the
should know this i think the first big
day for us can be the seventh that not
yet it officially starts on the 8th but
we'll be there many many days before
this can be there's always news
beforehand and there's some live events
the night before so we'll be covering
that stuff come anyway I just gonna say
if you want to tune into the best the
best of the best I mean here's the thing
about ces there's a lot of crap there
and we will be doing a lot of avoiding
the crap and giving you guys like the
best of the best that is happening there
and you know we've got some I'm excited
because you know last year we experience
our first year doing CS as the verge and
you know we found that stuff like our
story streams were just like hugely
helpful for to telling some of these
stories about like hey there's a
thousand new laptops like how do you see
all of them like how do you understand
what's going on in like so I think that
we're going to lean a lot on are some of
our tools that I think ya feel are very
helpful to telling these big messy
stories like there's a thousand new
point shoot thousand new routers I know
you get excited about that it would be
that's my new site rather than is that
anything anything else from you guys
before we go no I've been here so yeah
that's our verge cast have a happy and
safe new year
even though we know the terrible things
are about to happen to you and your
family Roger walls are shy goodbye give
a bad goodbye Paul Paul</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
