and this is LG's v20 the company's
latest smartphone and it's the first
smartphone you can buy that comes with
Android 7.0 new get out of the box so if
you don't have a nexus or you're
impatient you can buy this phone and get
all the Google's latest features built
right in
you've got all of new gets built-in
features you can run two apps at once
with split-screen just like that have a
browser and YouTube open and LG still
has their second screen up top so you
can have shortcuts to apps you'll see
your notifications up there stuff like
that it's handy it's not essential it's
kind of gimmicky but it's cool to have
if you actually want to use it so I'll
just going to really market this phone
to audiophiles
it's got a hi-fi microphone system
built-in so you can take it to a concert
rock concert and it'll record that not
clip or have any kind of distortion so
if you want to save your memories of
concert it's good for shooting videos
making recordings and things like that
and there are four decks built-in so if
you're a headphone listener if you plug
in your headphones you're going to get
better sounding audio from this phone in
just about any other phone you can buy
so the b20 looks a lot more like the g5
than it does the v10 from last year it's
got a smooth metal back this is metal
and the top and bottom actually
polycarbonate so those are plastic it's
got two cameras on back one's wide-angle
ones regular and you can actually pull
the back cover off so you can swap out
the battery so if you're at 0 dead
battery and just put in a brand new one
and be right back to a hundred percent
so one of the best things about LG's
phones and they've kind of seen it
forward here which is really cool
the b20 is a fast powerful phone that's
got all the fast specs you'd want it's
got a Snapdragon 820 processor 4 gigs of
ram 64 gigs of storage plus micro sd so
it'll do any task you throw at it
without any difficulty whatsoever we're
not sure in pricing that's gonna be up
to the carriers to decide there should
be out sometime this month fairly soon
and so that's our first look at the LG V
