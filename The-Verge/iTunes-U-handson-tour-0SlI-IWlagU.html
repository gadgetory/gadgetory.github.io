and today Apple released their new I
books to which is centered around text
books but they also released an app for
their new itunes you it's been a desktop
app but now they're bringing it to the
ipad and the iphone so let's take a look
at it here so iTunes U is really meant
for students but anyone can actually
come in here and take courses so if I
select this one here from the catalog I
obviously don't go to Yale but I can
come in here and subscribe to it I've
actually already done that so I can pick
that up here in the library and so what
you get here is basically a course
overview you can come right in here and
watch one of the first lectures so
that's going on here you can actually
back out of this and take notes as
you're listening so if I come in here
and add a new note notes come back out
and go back out to the other posts and I
can read some information this will take
me out to another out to outside link i
can come down here and watch a
powerpoint so lots of information you
can get here even if you aren't a
student and of course there's tons of
other listings I got this law and
vengeance book and I made a note about
how I want to be like Nilay Patel which
autocorrected to in lipa tell and so you
can just get tons of things lots of
content in a lot of these some just have
the lectures but overall it's just a
really nice way to get higher education
materials right on your iPad
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
