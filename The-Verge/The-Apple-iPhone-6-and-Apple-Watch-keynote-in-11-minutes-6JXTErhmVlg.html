introduced the Macintosh to the world
you will agree that this too is a very
key day for Apple the biggest
advancement in the history of iPhone the
iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 plus anodized
aluminum back complete its stainless
steel Apple we call them retina HD there
are a lot bigger here on the left is an
iPhone 5s in the center iPhone 6 and on
the right the iPhone 6 plus and boy are
they packed with pixels over 1 million
pixels thinner than anything we have
ever made well if you double touch a new
generation chip the Apple a8 up to 25%
faster CPU performance up to 50% faster
graphics performance is up to 50 times
faster than the original iPhone it's 50%
more efficient than the a7 chip and that
allows us to sustain performance over a
longer period of time
good morning today I am thrilled debut
for Juventus
of 1.3 million polygons running at 60
frames per second and more than 100
fully animated characters all

hours of music listening 14 hours of HD
video playback 12 hours Wi-Fi browsing
LTE browsing 3G browsing really great
battery life well the new generation m8

walking you're running it also has a new
ability to estimate distance and for the
first time give you credit for elevation
as well flights of stairs the LTE an
iPhone 6 and 6 plus is faster than ever
150 megabits per second and there's now
20 LTE bands that's the most in any
smartphone in the world maybe you've
heard of it it's called volte it means
we can take the voice data and move it
up onto the 4G LTE network
makes calls clearer sounding and you
always have simultaneous voice and data
there's also faster Wi-Fi which is up to
three times faster up to 433 megabit per
second you can make a standard call in
the same way and will go out over Wi-Fi
but as you leave your home and
transition on to the cellular network
the call will seamlessly just handoff
and keep going there are great new
cameras in both iPhone 6 and 6 plus

generation eyesight sensor in it focus
pixels this is called phase detection
autofocus best way to do fast autofocus

just $1.99 for 16 gigs 399 for 64 and

configuration I'm going to start to ship
them on September 19 be able to
pre-order them starting this Friday on
the twelve and the team is were thank
you we've been listed the help of a
couple of our friends to do some fun new
ads
dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun Justin
Timberlake and Jimmy Fallon these guys
are incredibly fun to work with
so that is iPhone our vision is to
replace this and we call it Apple pay
that's that it is so cool and we've got
a groundbreaking NFC radio antenna built
across the top and it stores all of your
payment information encrypted and
securely we don't store the credit card
number and we don't give it to the
merchants if your iPhone is lost or
stolen you can use Find My iPhone and
suspend all of the payments from that
device there's no need to cancel your
credit card Apple doesn't know what you
bought where you bought it or how much
you paid for it
the cashier doesn't get to see your name
credit card number or security code
McDonald's with 27 million visitors
every day and McDonald's is even adding
Apple pay to its drive-thru and that's
Apple pay thank you we have one more
thing it is the next chapter in Apple's
story and here it is
Apple watch is the most personal device
we've ever created
and it works seamlessly with iPhone and
it's also a comprehensive health and
fitness device it's this dial it's
called a crown the digital crown
includes
infrared LEDs and photo diodes that
translate rotary movement into digital
data the watch senses that you're
raising your wrist and then activates
the display the digital crown is a
remarkable input device it fluidly zooms
into apps it enables nimble precise
adjustment and critically you can use it
without obstructing the display it's
also the home button or you can even
share something as personal as your own
heartbeat it's been laminated to a
machined and polished single crystal of
sapphire the display also senses force
we've developed a linear actuator that
provides haptic feedback to complement
your interactions it's essentially
miniaturizing an entire computer system
onto a single chip infrared and visible
light LEDs along with photo sensors
detect your pulse rate the watch
provides a comprehensive picture of your
daily activity inductive charging
completely sealed it requires no
alignment or expose contacts keeping
time to plus or minus 50 milliseconds we
have designed six different straps and a
mechanism that makes the straps easily
interchangeable and of course we knew
one size wouldn't for everyone so we've
also developed a smaller watch with
matching smaller straps we've actually
created three distinct collections Apple
watch the sport collection Apple watch
edition technology to be worn
to be truly personal this is the current
moon phase we scheduled our events on a
nice full moon so this will look great
here so we've created something called
glances if you just swipe up from the
bottom of the watch face and if I just
swipe horizontally I can see things like
where I'm located here at Flint Center
the current weather outside Nasdaq stock
boy quote and world time where I can see
music I'm currently playing on devices
around me we're using the taptic engine
to give you feedback on your wrist it's
just like somebody tapping you on the
wrist very gently and even if you're
sitting right next to someone they won't
be able to tell that you're getting
notified it's very subtle but you'll
field on your own wrist here's a
calendar invitation other notifications
here's one from Johnny we've actually
analyzed the text that's coming in and
picked out some things you might want to
just tap on and send back so we can do
Siri just by pressing the digital crown
here what movies are playing tonight in
Cupertino photos up here now though I
could use the digital crown to zoom
right in to photos and see which ones
I'd like to look at so let's tap on maps
here now while you're walking Apple
watch will give you taptic feedback on
each turn so you'll know whether it's
time to turn left or to turn right and
those feelings are different for each
direction so you can actually know
without even looking at your watch and
there are my friends when we're getting
hungry we can just tap each other and
we'll feel it on our wrist so I'll just
do him do the triple tap here for going
to lunch okay so we do this a lot that
means what's for lunch so I know how
much Jeff loves sushi we've also been
working to enable third-party developers
with something called watch kit you can
see it's using the same layout as the
original tweet but now it's much richer
with images and text it looks like the
Twitter brand and it has buttons that
you'd like to use to favorite or retweet
right on that message MLB lets you see
the current sports scores Honeywell lets
you control the temperature in your home
with a Lutron app you can control the
lighting and the scenes in your home
with one tab with a Nike app you can
challenge your friends to go for a run
and we just can't wait to see what
developers are going to create in this
great new platform health and fitness we
have two new applications in Apple watch
the first is the fitness app
monitors all of your activity and
movement throughout the day and the
second is the workout app allows you to
set specific goals for specific types of
workouts like cycling or running it uses
an accelerometer to measure your total
body movement it has a custom sensor
that can measure intensity by tracking
your heart rate and it uses the GPS and
Wi-Fi in your iPhone to track how far
you've moved with the goal of helping
you sit less move more and get some
exercise and it is so much more that we
don't have time to cover this morning
the list of features is a mile long
Apple watch requires the iPhone because
it's been designed to seamlessly work
together Apple pay will work with Apple
watch but we've also designed it so that
it will work with iPhone 5 iPhone 5c and
iPhone 5s Apple watch starts at only 349
dollars and it will be available early
next year we are so excited about Apple
watch and I hope you are as well you too
join us on stage and perform
Hey O's n master of hard and soft where
Tim Cook you would consider putting
songs of innocence out to over half a
billion people free in say five seconds

release of all time five four three two
