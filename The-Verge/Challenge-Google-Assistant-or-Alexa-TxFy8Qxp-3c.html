Google Assistant, and Alexa.
It's somewhat a different
format from what we usually do,
but don't worry, I'll be your narrator,
and help guide you through it.
Sorry about the audio, it is CES.
(lighthearted music)
- It's CES 2019, things are
winding down like they do,
and whenever things wind down,
you gotta start picking
winners, and losers.
This show is a really big
intelligent assistant fight,
and so it's obviously
gonna be Google versus,
(chuckles) well not pic
speed, but maybe Alexa,
and I don't know Shannon, I'm
looking at this thing here
and I think Google's
kinda got, run it away.
- I don't think so Dieter,
I think this is just a sign
you know, it's just Google
trying to make big show
but when you think about
Smart Home Assistance,
it's honestly obviously gonna be Alexa.
Like, Alexa's in like almost
every gadget out there.
- Okay, they're in every gadget out there,
but there's no hype.
So like you, (stammers)
you can just go out
and find every Alexa gadget,
and prove it I guess.
That is your job now, you're welcome.
- No, I don't think so.
(Dieter laughing)
That's like too many gadgets.
Let me just narrow it
down to like the coolest,
and weirdest Alexa gadgets,
how does that sound?
- Weirdest?
I think I could find weirder gadgets
that support the Google Assistant
than you can find weird
gadgets that support Alexa.
- That sounds like a bet,
that sounds like a challenge.
- Okay, what are the stakes?
- Pride, and the satisfaction of winning.
- (sighs) I do like being right.
Okay, one hour.
- Alright.
- Go.
- [Narrator] And our
competitors are on the way
to see who can find (stammers), oh wait.
- I think I went the wrong way.
- Yeah, I definitely went the wrong way.
Alright, you know what? This
is gonna be a piece of easy,
Google's got this huge booth right here.
I'm gonna be able to
find everything I need
and not have to go anywhere,
it's gonna be awesome.
- [Narrator] Dieter thinks he'll find most
of what he needs right
here at Google's booth.
You could see how confident he is
by how he's walking up the stairs.
Meanwhile, Shannon is
taking a different route.
- I'm gonna call a Lyft,
and hopefully they can pick us up here
even though the traffic is super bad
in Las Vegas right now.
- [Narrator] While Shannon
waits for her ride,
Dieter is close to
finding his first product.
- So everything is here,
and I think my opening entry,
the first thing we'll start
with is the Lenovo Smart Clock
'cause it's so small,
and cute, and little.
- [Narrator] Seems like
it's not that easy to find.
Looks like traffic wasn't
too big of an issue,
and Shannon made it to her destination.
- [Shannon] Hey they let us
through without bag check,
that's pretty good.
- [Narrator] But it looks
like Dieter is ahead.
- I have a whole wall of gadgets here,
and this little dude right
here is the Lenovo Smart Clock.
It is just itty bitty, and tiny,
and it's got little
volume buttons on the top.
It's like a little wedge lookin' dude,
and when the alarm goes off, it lights up,
and gets bright to wake
you up in the morning.
- [Narrator] Good one, Dieter.
Not super weird, but solid.
Let's check in with Shannon.
- So Ring is owned by Amazon,
and this doorbell works with Alexa.
It's the Ring Doorview Cam,
and it goes over your
peephole, it's pretty cool.
I think it's pretty cool,
I think I just won the competition.
(laughs) But I don't know.
- [Narrator] I'll be the judge of that.
(lighthearted electronic music)
- Really, Shannon?
You're comin' to me with a doorbell?
Come on, this right here,
this is a E ink screen.
It's a thing that you power
with a Google Assistant,
but it doesn't run the Google Assistant.
It's a new thing called
Google Assistant Connect,
and you could have it
show you the weather,
the calender, or whatever.
You can stick it onto your fridge,
and it's just a prototype for now
but you know, it's 3-D
printed, who doesn't love
3-D printed things?
Ha!
- [Narrator] Okay, that's better.
But it looks like Shannon
found something else
worth looking at.
- I've just found U By Moen's
shower that turns on with Alexa.
However like, Google Assistant
is coming later in the year,
so is Apple Home Kit,
I don't if that counts,
I mean, is that cheating?
What do you think?
Alexa, turn on my shower.
- [Narrator] The remote is cheating.
- Alexa, turn on the shower.
(lighthearted electronic music)
- Okay a shower, that's really good.
But you know what I have here?
An exhaust fan run in Android 8.
It is called the Hub
GE, and it does support
the Google Assistant,
(hums) and you can also like,
control the fan, or you can even
get a camera that shows your stove top
so you could do a video
call with somebody,
and they will see exactly
what it is you're cooking.
Check (claps) mate (claps).
- [Narrator] That's pretty impressive,
I've got to admit.
- I mean, I don't want to
get too cocky about this,
but I'm pretty sure I got it,
and I'm pretty Shannon headed over
to the Sands Convention
Center for her stuff.
So I'm gonna go over there,
and let her know that I won.
(lighthearted electronic music)
- [Narrator] But Shannon decides to wait
to reveal her final
item when Dieter arrives
at the Sands expo.
- So Shannon, I've got a exhaust fan
that goes over a stove
that's actually just
an Android 8.1 tablet that
supports Google Assistant.
Pretty sure I got this, what do you got?
- I don't think so, I've got a toilet.
- Shit, that's really good.
- Yeah.
- [Narrator] Well, there you have it.
The toilet helps Shannon
secure the victory.
Making next year will be weirder?
Thanks for tuning in.
- People used to read news on the toilet,
now the toilet can read news to you.
(Dieter groaning)
