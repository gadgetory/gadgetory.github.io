were looking at the blackberry 10 dev
alpha developer prototype this of course
is the device that rim is handing out to
all the developers here at the
blackberry jam conference and as you can
see it looks exactly like a miniature
playbook the industrial design is very
much the same the specs on it are also
virtually identical it has a 4 point 2
inch screen and it's running the
PlayBook 2.1 OS slightly modified to
support the api's and developer hooks
for playbook 10 or I'm sorry blackberry
10 but honestly there's no apps on here
by default is just the browser the
camera and a setup out in terms of
capabilities of hardware the only new
additions are the the mobile networking
it runs on hspa+ which in the menu bar
they call 4g which is hilarious and a
little bit sad and then the other
addition is NFC and we expect that we'll
be seeing a lot more to NFC and
blackberry 10 in the near future other
than that it's a very simple bare-bones
device it's simply meant for developers
to be able to load their apps and test
them for blackberry 10 however just like
the original playbook the developer
alpha device is able to run android apps
with the Android runtime and so you can
see here this developer has loaded up a
bunch of Android apps and we can take a
look at the performance here we'll load
up angry birds give it a moment to load
and it does take a bit to load here but
it is running on the Android runtime on
how to play work but get it going
so that's the blackberry dev alpha it's
never going to see consumer release it's
only for developers but it's pretty
powerful it's about the same specs as
the playbook and hopefully it'll get a
lot of developers to make blackberry 10
apps</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
