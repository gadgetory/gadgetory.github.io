don't have a screen the Virgin's live
gadget show we did a whole season the
show on Twitter and the biggest piece of
feedback we got was that you all wanted
the show to be here on YouTube so here
we are in YouTube we couldn't be more
excited to be here with you it did it
it's gonna be a big year for The Verge
on YouTube and the show is gonna be the
center of it all we're gonna play with
as many gadgets as we can we're gonna
have a screen up here I'm gonna be able
to read your comments in the chat we're
gonna answer your questions live every
week 4 p.m. on Tuesdays it's gonna be
super fun
I by the way I mean I put on the head of
the version it's a Paul you could still
use Twitter hashtag circuit breaker live
it's still very cool hashtags are still
the best cool activity to do we'll also
read those questions we are joined on
the show by a huge cast that's amazing
every week Ashley Carmen's here Jay cash
Marcus is here this week Sean o Cain is
gonna come on he's gonna show us what's
going on teach you guys new drones Dan
Seifert is going to join us we're gonna
talk about the Apple home pod which we
have it here in the studio we're gonna
talk to Siri
that's going to go about as well as you
expect we're gonna take all of your
questions live about the home pods to
start asking ready for those and then
Ashley's gonna join us again and we're
gonna talk about what's happening with a
digital instant cameras which are very
quietly like a hot controversial would
you chew a shoe would you see it the
birds that we have a bevy of experts
cornucopia of expertise the real
situation but first we're gonna get and
all that but first Ashley and Jake are
going to walk us through the news take
away hello
yeah so we are rapidly approaching
Samsung's phone season and the leaks are
starting the s9 has leaked this week
there should be so this is it looks just
like you would expect a galaxy device to
look like but hey this is a nice color
it's a lie
maybe and then also you'll notice the
fingerprint sensor is below the camera
as opposed to next to it which was a
huge complaint people had there was also
news today that this phone is going to
be priced more expensive than the s8
like right out of the gate and people
probably won't love that so this is what
we know so far as maybe what it looks
like and then also the plus has dual
vertically stacked cameras which you
don't see here but it's kind of like the
iPhone time what's really well to me is
that like a year ago
this design really stood out and now
this looks completely normal this is the
front of every single yeah exactly
doesn't want you anymore you're just
like oh yeah so full display I'm all
about Samsung doing weird interesting
colors though we cover every standard
color because we love them so much love
it
yesterday Intel out of nowhere basically
announced smart glasses they're called
vaunt we have an exclusive hands-on you
should go read eaters article of a big
video on it but the gist is that these
are smart glasses that look completely
normal so if you're thinking Google
glass these are kind of all the way in
the other direction rather than
interacting with them a bunch with
swipes and gestures and having a screen
in front of your face there's basically
nothing there is just some lasers that
shoot a little projection into your eye
and you don't even see it all the time
it's just in your peripheral vision
it'll show some notifications some
contextual information it's basically
just supposed to say out of the way so
that it's there when you want it but not
when you you know are actually talking
to people and trying to interact with
the rest of the world I think it's like
a really neat and interesting approach
and it sounds like they've learned a lot
of the lessons that you know Google did
not realize when it first did glass like
people don't want to wear a computer
other face yeah exactly so they
definitely still have a lot to prove but
they're supposed to come out with a
developer version by the end of the year
so yeah I'm definitely really interested
when people start using this and how
people interact with each other and
while they're I mean technically are
wearing a computer on their face like
how I'm gonna talk to you right now but
also be like silently watching my
Twitter feed oh you're gonna give you
full attention sometimes
um so iPhone 10 we all know it for its
notch and now Chinese phone
manufacturers are introducing a bunch of
notch knockoffs as we've started calling
them so this is the oukitel one you can
see there's the notch and then we have
another one that just came out as
welcome to Noah and ten also hesitant
hatch what's interesting about these is
that like the notch is great
we like the notch but you're not fully
like no one's going to see this and
think oh that's an iPhone pad like this
is not an iPhone 10 body also the screen
doesn't go all the way to the bottom you
have also the Android navigations I mean
it's just not fooling anyone but you
have a notch right like so androids not
optimized for this is like gonna be a
horrible way people have waited for
their favorite apps to be optimized when
the Android definitely is not going to
have those apps I know people like the
nachos very controversial I actually
think it is cool because it's like
instantly identifiable which i think is
what they're going for here but like
it's gonna it's pretty clear that this
is not great and iPhone yeah I really
like the not but I don't know if I like
it on the notch knockoffs yes
Microsoft last week dropped the price on
two of its surface laptops quite a bit
the surface book 2 went down by $300 the
surface laptop went down by 200 said
about 300 and 200 this is a free big
decrease the which is great because
gonna help get more people into the line
for them but the downside is that they
have more specs slower processor or less
storage I think that's an okay trade-off
in some cases but you know it's not
necessarily the best thing it's not like
they just dropped the price on the
current entry-level they made like a new
entry-level that's a bit cheaper
I might guess as to why this happens is
because the surface devices haven't been
like selling quite as well as really
well they were doing like surprisingly
well but when Microsoft announced their
earnings recently I think it was like a
1 percent year-over-year growth which is
probably why they're trying to get more
people in with these lower prices and
you get the fancy fabric totally the
nicely computers there for ya ok and
finally this week we saw
HP has decided that it's going to
introduce new smart assistant skills for
Alexa or Google home whichever so that
you can talk to your printer and
apparently shout at it to print you
sodoku Pires I don't know why it was
look there example it is really they
want you to just shout and say hey
printer or whatever your keyword is and
say hey printer print me this doctors
alright I know you know what you say to
a printer print the thing right you need
to have a document open like I don't
that's why I don't because you're always
out of computer creating a cloud service
for Sudoku puzzles like he has you know
it's not clear okay Jake it's really
just not clear but um yeah I figure
you're always out of computer anyways
looking at the document thinking okay
you know movie noises like they have
this printed let me just print yeah
instead you're gonna make wait this
would be a nice a print in set this
aside yeah Alexa the princess while
you're with your family the idea of her
strike that you're walking around your
kitchen and you're like I you know what
I forgot to bring that think whatever
good for you keep doing you alright so
we're gonna give it right back now to
Paul and you I Shaw know Kane is here
he'll respond in you little jittery just
watched a gigantic rocket take off from
Cape Canaveral yeah so Sean you strong
as a reporter on our transportation team
he's here to talk about drones but this
is true you also cover a bunch of space
with our Trebek space reporter Lauren
Groff who's at Cape magic she is she
just saw the thing go into this guy and
do its thing we were all watching that
stream right before the show stuff and
then the little ones landing it that's a
technical term so let's just talk about
we got we can't ignore it
yeah Sean you cover much tell us how
important Falcon Heavy was I mean if we
ever want to do more than we're already
doing in space we need bigger rockets to
do things that are more impressive than
the things we've been doing like rockets
so go to the moon go to Mars bring
heavier if we ever want to do like
Internet in space based on satellites we
need to have your lift rockets and so
you know SpaceX had a pretty clever
solution to this which was this sort of
multiple rockets strapped together
solution which we've seen before but
there
whole ideas they're gonna land them all
we know that two of the three landed we
had we were not sure about the one
that's supposed to land at sea yet but I
mean it was one of those things where
like no one was really totally sure it
was gonna survive the whole thing so I
mean the whole point the whole goal was
don't explode yeah the goal and as long
as it doesn't ruin the launchpad I'm
fine yeah and so it didn't so bonus
points is the yellow most Tesla yeah is
the payload which kind of looks like
this drone in space now whatever that's
crazy
my favorite part of this is the pause
asking sir oh they can't land the Tesla
on Mars right we don't want to
contaminate Mars there he said yesterday
on a press conference that there is a
tiny tiny chance that hits Mars which
he'll actually be in some deep water if
it does but it's not going to he's gonna
miss it by a lot he's just trying to
make a spectacle I'm ready to
contaminate Mars the first thing we
contaminate Mars which should not be
Elon Musk are super exciting
I was actually sad that was running into
or ship because I wanted to watch it but
all the timing worked out we got to
watch it and now we're here to talk
about drones other things that fly maybe
not quite as high the DJ I'm advocare it
just came out it just came out they
announced it two weeks ago
yeah maybe three put it on sale less
than a week later they've gotten really
good at this sort of like maybe some
rumors and stuff leaked but otherwise
like here's the thing it's available
next week like get ready are they I
think they really they're a company
that's really honed their sort of
product presence over the last couple
years and they've made really good
products this is sort of the latest and
greatest from them and it is if you're
familiar with the DJI lineup there's the
Navajo at the top we have right here on
both it's like the inspire I'm sorry I'm
like there's a whole of them more like
portable ones right the the ones that
are at $1,000 or less and so we've got
the Mavic Pro which is a little bit more
than a thousand the spark which is the
one they released a couple months ago
maybe even or I guess back in 2017 which
is a more approachable drone for people
who are just starting out and then now
this is the Mavic air and it sort of
slots in between those two but it also
kinda replaces the map
it's in many ways other than maybe
battery life and like a couple small
details it's basically this in this
package yeah it's pretty wide so what's
the point
so you guys line up is it's either the
simplest thing in the world or the most
complicated yeah this probably
complicated things a little bit this is
$7.99 you can get it for $9.99 with a
whole bunch of extra batteries and sort
of extra propellers and things like that
but you do get a lot 417 $7.99 this is
399 used to be 600 used to be 500 and
600 with all that extra stuff so this
one's really still the entry-level what
complicates things is if this is really
replacing this but they're still selling
this for more that's where it's a little
bit weird but this one folds up to be
this big yeah and that one folds out to
be small this folds up into a profile
that is yes even smaller than the spark
so the spark is obviously lighter I'm
showing you visions later this mark is
lighter than the Mavic air yeah and this
is the carrying case that comes in the
case is smaller than the case for my
Nintendo switch yeah that's ridiculous
I'm writing before DJI like win on this
tear but before the first map that came
out I bought a phantom before and that's
like this is the one this is the
consumer Richie Rich well my forthcoming
child is not going to college now but
she can look at my drone flying that's
but I thought that was like we've hit
the pinnacle this is a small and then GJ
I just went on this absolute terror
yeah with these smaller magic drones and
now this and then the sparking down the
air so what would in the last like year
and a half so which one do you buy so I
the the split for me is the same split I
think that our one of our videographers
and directors out west Viren who did the
review of the Mavic air I think he
elucidated it pretty well in his review
the split is if you're doing any kind of
professional work you know weddings
landscape photography things like that
you're probably still better off opting
for the phantom the Phantom for the
Phantom 4 Pro depending on there's a
couple different versions that's that's
work it's actually really good music
but if you're just a hobbyist or if
portability really really matters to you
the Medicare is for sure a little bit of
damage to the propellers but you can yes
you said it and and it's just it the
value really comes from the ability to
not be lugging around because if you've
ever seen anybody use the Phantom for
program for and you know this it's huge
and the box that you have to fit it in
because none of it folds up those big
landing legs and even this was like a
little bit heavy
you've always got this exposed whereas
the camera now is sort of tucked in here
on the Mavic air the Mavic air has the
same camera system as the Maverick Pro
so so the image quality is the same yeah
and the only benefit you really still
get with the Mavic Pro and the new
version of it the Maverick Pro platinum
is you get a few more extra minutes of
battery life this also works over RF
with the controller is opposed to Wi-Fi
which means the range is a little bit
longer than the Maverick air but I mean
the navikev those are trade-offs you
want to get slightly less range Jordan
on YouTube here sitting in the chat this
uses it's going out this uses Wi-Fi to
connect yes and you get a little bit
less range and people are playing at the
video signal to your phone or whatever
is less good I don't think that matters
as long as I didn't have as many it
doesn't matter especially because like
if I were to use it I would use it for
especially for photography and
videography more than just the fun of
flying it and that kind of stuff usually
really bothers me if like the video is
cutting out I didn't experience that
with this I didn't fly it too far away
because it's been really windy all
weekend here how did you end it actually
held up pretty well gussev like 25 no it
really didn't that was the weirdest
thing about it it if you were filming
straight through like trying to pull off
like kind of a smooth nuber anything
above 15 miles an hour was starting to
give you a little bit of trouble as far
as like you know it would correct and
you could see that and the footage is it
right the windows is just kind of go
with the flow it's there's a tolerance
right like if it gets if a gust comes at
some point you you can see it in the
footage in the way that it would
you know the gimbal which is trying to
hold it steady but all of a sudden just
sort of like an jump and like finally
give in yeah but it but it hold it
pretty well in the battery life I mean I
think when you're working with a max of
21 the differences of what you're gonna
get yeah how are you gonna go yeah
they're pretty small anything if you can
show this camera these so we asked TJ
about this too I think all of us have
asked about the Wi-Fi versus RF yeah so
these are actually the Wi-Fi antennas in
these lives yeah and the reason that at
least they told me I'm sure they told
you the same thing they can't fit the RF
components into a chassis too small yes
they do the customer of so they had to
go with this boosted Wi-Fi and
especially because this has seven
cameras on it you can see all the way
around it has cameras on like basically
every surface which means that it has
obstacle avoidance in every direction at
which they haven't had in these other
smaller drones before to the point that
it even has a mode where you can set it
to it's called a pass like forget what
it stands for right now but basically
instead of like what what this would do
if it saw something approaching it it
would just stop so it wouldn't crash
which is great but what this can do is
it with enough cameras on it it can
actually sort of plot out a path to get
around the obstacle so if you've set the
drone to sort of like follow a mountain
biker and like you just like let it go
and follow that path but all of a sudden
there's a tree that you didn't really
think was in the way but it is it can
move around that and it won't really
disturb that shot too much it'll keep
that person in focus just feels like
they're not holding anything back
they're not like well this is the
mid-tier we better make sure that it
doesn't eclipse this one they're just
like I think what we have technology
wise I think it was a bold move just
sort of just like up and essentially
kind of replaced this but it does sort
of pave the path for them to do
something new with this like thousand
dollar and up version that they have you
know I'd like they can maybe make the
Phantom for a little bit smaller now
or maybe they could do something even
crazier like forty minute battery life
in this form factor or something I know
right talk about these controllers yeah
they're real different so this is the
Mavic that's the magic bus controller
which has well you can see an integrated
screen in there to give you some basic
information but it's still meant for you
to plug your phone in who uses the
viewfinder what I really like about
this is such a small little detail but
they the joysticks on the pneumatic air
controller tuck right in here so that
when you pack it up like I'm a kind of
person that just like throws stuff in
his bag and like the objects suffer the
consequences whereas like here you can
take these off the end plug them in and
you're not having these like get mangled
up in your org like catch something else
in a bag and then you just take your
phone
yeah face I do you like this thing up
good right I mean we're here that's the
whole point of the show another thing to
know about the pneumatic air is that it
has some more advanced gesture controls
compared to the sparked the spark you
were able to let fly like off your your
hand and everything oh no Mavic air you
can actually take off from the ground so
if I was standing in front of this right
now I could hold my hand out it would
recognize that it would fly up and do
things like that and I will say I have
watched a lot of videos that people have
put online just for our own sanity we
here for this weather people watch I
have a NASCAR there is this a there's
this guy in in Texas now I turn the
remote on that probably willed there's
this guy in Texas who was just sort of
standing out in the middle of nowhere
and he was only able to get about I want
to say like a mile and a half orange and
there are advertising two and a half
miles of this so I do still think if if
you're someone who's flying if you're a
skilled pilot who's still flying very
far away you're probably not gonna want
to pop for the air but the air is really
it's like the perfect thing to like
always have it there ready yeah like
maybe if you're a pro you fly with your
you fly with your phantom but like this
is the thing that you always have ready
whenever you need it and terrified yeah
you should be totally goes it can
totally go worse than the Falcon Heavy
much because the Falcon have actually
flew the full size Matic you know
without guards guards aren't just like
lid it up and take
I'm just backing up a little bit all
right here we go I put out a lot of
bravery and confidence nice that's
awfully windy
so with this spark you to know it's loud
they haven't made it any quieter than
the Matic for a platinum the Matic pro
platinum has these new propellers that
are quieter 10 decibels so this is
definitely not quieter so it's smaller
which means it's discrete but like
people still know when you take off yeah
so there's us ok let's take a
oh and here's the thing I forgot to put
a memory card back in this but it has 8
gigs of internal storage now so
go in its fault
all right
now
yeah I think I'd turn on the gesture
recognizers bet I will say come back
I am so ready to run we'll just set it
down over there because it wasn't
backing up so we'll just land it over
there I will say it is as someone whose
phone a couple of these different drones
in the past it is like really easy to
fly like they've really smoothed out
sort of all the algorithms as far as
like how it balances itself out it has a
sport mode that does forty two and a
half miles an hour which is actually
terrifying I flew that around a field
and then I brought it back towards me
and the distance it needs to stop I
wasn't sort of ready for so it's like
the is that like you'll lose some of the
obstacle avoidance I think when it's far
out like I remember bringing it up to a
certain height and it would tell me that
it would lose some of that but yeah it's
it's otherwise relatively easy to fly
what it looks great from another company
to buy our big trader Ben popper dead
karma he wrote a thing over a year ago
almost yeah your and how it's a grip
this of its propellers to really the
only real competition is itself yes
point all the other ones don't really
compare the car the Karma was like I
don't know maybe in another generation
or two it could compete a bit even CEO
Nick Woodman of GoPro has admitted like
there's just no way that they were not
like vertically integrated enough to
like make something new as fast as a
company like DJ yeah yeah so these are
really this is like where you want to
look if you are looking to get into
drones I still think if you've never
flown one before sparks still the best
way to go it's cheapest it still does a
decent video at least for social yeah
maybe not for pro work but but the real
killer would be if you could fold those
legs it yeah that's the only thing is
like if you have a couple extra hundred
bucks to spare oh it's down on the
ground pretty nicely well yeah I can't
think of a better thing to take photos
of my new baby with everyone was
noticing that sound is incredible
we threatening yeah it's not always the
first I get a lot of social anxiety so I
went like all the way outside the city
to fly this thing and I set it down in a
park there was almost nobody around me
and then it fired up and I was like oh
god this is too much like everybody
knows that I'm flying this thing and
they just can't see it because it's
smaller exactly everyone wants to know
if the core booster landed I think you
probably so we're gonna let Sean go
we're gonna find out what's going on the
score booster let you know on the
livestream there but we're gonna take a
quick break we're gonna watch a little
bit of the home pod review to get
through some of the super nitty-gritty
technical details and then Dan c4 it's
going to be here we're gonna have
basically every smart speaker that we
can get our hands on plus the home pod
ask us your questions in the chat we're
ready to answer answer them right ask
Siri your questions let's watch this
video we read back
so this is the home pod the home pod is
Apple's answer to the Google home and
the Amazon echo and every other smart
speaker out there with a voice assistant
it's a $350 speaker that has Siri the
basic idea is pretty simple it's covered
in a weird spongy fabric there's a touch
display on top and it's surprisingly
heavy but the home pod is pretty limited
Siri just can't do as much as other
assistants and the only music service
you can control your voice is Apple
music if you're a Spotify person the
home pod is probably not for you and I
think Apple knows it's pretty limited
because all of the company's focus is on
sound quality the truth is most other
smart speakers sound crappy and home pod
sounds incredible we've been comparing
it to the new Amazon echo a bunch of
Sona speakers including the new Sona
Swan in the Play 5 the Google home and
the Google home acts and even Bluetooth
speakers like the UE mega boom
and it's just obviously better than all
of them the home pod isn't just one
speaker it's actually eight of them all
controlled by an a8 processor and tons
of custom software there are seven
tweeters that fire down and out from the
bottom and a single four inch woofer
pointing out of the top for low
frequencies there's also a total of
seven microphones six around the middle
for Siri and a seventh inside that
measures the location of that woofer so
Apple can precisely control the bass
when you first plug in the home pod and
start playing music it goes through a
series of steps that tune the speaker to
the room it's in first it uses the mics
to detect any walls nearby so it knows
how sound will bounce off of them second
it uses of seven tweeters to form a
virtual array of sound beams that are
assigned a direct and ambient sounds
like vocals and applause the ambient
channels are pointed at the walls to
reflect and the direct sounds are
pointed out at the listener sometime
during all of that it detects the walls
again
to refine the model of the rumensin then
it analyzes the difference between the
left and right channels of the music and
playing to figure out what sound should
go into what beams ambient or direct and
then it measures the position of the
subwoofer and the reflections of the
bass constantly as you're playing music
to make sure the bass doesn't overwhelm
the rest of the music
all of this happens at once within like
ten seconds if you move the home pod an
accelerometer inside detects motion and
it does it all over again in terms of
ideas I'm into a virtual array of sound
beams that points guitar solos at my
face is super high on the list go back
then see friends here hi
I'm doing well I've spent a lot of time
talking to Siri oh that's a fun time
it's all right so you have reviewed most
of the other smart speakers I just
reviewed the hum pod we just watched a
video I've had it for about a week now
Apple took me to they didn't take me
they invited me but you know I took
myself their own way as we always do but
why not Cupertino hung out with their
hardware VP hung out with their head
engineer for audio with Phil Schiller
walk through audio labs and some other
engineers got really deep in how the
home pod works you listen to a lot of
Hotel Co we listen to a lot of Hotel
California so the true experience the
video you just watched it I think what's
happening on the audio side of the home
pod is super impressive and cool I'm a
audio nerd I like have all kinds of
speakers in my house usually I don't
like love a lot of audio processing this
thing is doing so much computing to make
itself sound good all of the time that I
just the part where it has seven
speakers here so you think all seven
speakers are doing something different
those seven speakers are actually making
three virtual speakers and they're
firing back against the wall or out of
the front like all of that is so cool
there's a microphone inside that
measures the position of the subwoofer I
don't precisely control two bookshelf
speakers yeah a nice amp some sliders
yeah you need that graphic EQ yeah no I
don't even need a cue so we're just
gonna start going in on questions here
yeah first question everybody asked in
the chat is there a mute switch and the
answer is basically no so all the other
ones
the echo here is the echo is muted you
can see it's red the SONA swan you push
the button on top it mutes Google home
devices have switches here's what you
can do with the home pod which is not
necessarily great you can say hey Siri
stop listening and then Syria Syria and
there's no claim now it confirms it just
didn't work
hey Siri stop listening I can turn off
hey Siri but if I do you'll need to
press the top of the device to get my
attention is this what you want yes ok
I've turned off hey Siri that's off Wow
so now if you want to eat me like you do
now you gotta hold it down there you go
what's the weather I'll do it it's so
serious a lot if you want to turn it
actually do you need fall camp all
Schism if you want to turn that back on
you go into the home app and then you
force touch on home pod and then you
press details get rid of my slack
messages and then you go here and you
gotta click that back on the other thing
that I pointed out in the review video
everyone focused on Spotify will get
into Spotify in a second I think this is
actually the bigger problem with the
home pod right now the way it is
configured you just hit yes and all the
setup prompts the setup is super easy
let's blast through it it will just let
anyone read my texts seriously let me
see what my last text ok is it yeah you
say read my most recent text message hey
Siri read my most recent text message
it's from what I found your most recent
messages walt mossberg oh no that's
crazy that is
Bunker's right like anybody in your
house is relative and the gate is if
you're just on the same Wi-Fi network
yeah turn that off okay watch this I
think if you're in a dorm yeah and
you're on the dorm Wi-Fi in their home I
mean it's expensive but some college
students are gonna buy this you're the
dorm Wi-Fi and you leave your dorm room
in the dining hall someone can walk up
to your clothes store and like yell the
wake word and ask it to read your text
messages and it will just do it oh so
you just turn that so here's how you
turn it off this is a lot of steps so
this is the home pod settings sure
that's fine yeah you think it said
you're already in there because he
closed gone to the process yeah you it's
not there it's here in the compass
compass and you go here and if you code
you pick your house and you do that you
know I want to show you my email address
it's here
and you turn off there so it's like not
in the home pod settings it's in your
house settings would you that's logical
not sensible so this is a home device to
home kit device so those those that
those two things just those two little
configuration things where you don't
want anybody to roll up to it and read
your text and turning the mic on and off
require just they just require you to
operate your phone in a way that none of
these other devices really want you to
use your phone like the Alexa devices is
the oxide was horrible but get is
actively designed to make you not want
it almost feels intentionally so yeah
cuz they just want you to talk to Alexa
the home app is fine the Google just
once you talk to it whatever the home
pod to me is just directly connected to
your phone your individual phone on a
review I called it lonely and I think
that's like yeah it's just like that
part sense all right what else do people
want to know also Siri and then we just
have hey Siri hey Siri play some music
sure let's kick things off with planets
and stars my first coat sure that's
weird
hey Siri play Taylor Swift we're just
gonna do this we're just gonna deal with
the licensing issues sure here's a
personalized station of Taylor Swift
this is Chris favorites my favorite so
you can be like hey Siri who plays the
bass on this song I don't know who plays
that instrument for this band and that
is basically the Siri experience hey
Siri how much doesn't home pod weigh
everything you need to know about home
pots is on Apple's website that's
Calexico Alexa how much does a home pod
way how much is a home Wayne just like
what I said no we did this before right
Alexa how much does a home pod way home
Maude weighs 5.5 pounds Google has the
answer so it's just like it's it's Siri
it works as well as Siri works and it's
supposed to be able to tell you who's
playing on all the songs that you listen
to it's not we can't show you what it
sounds like you're like we're just not
set up for that in the studio if you
watch the video we set up a really fancy
binaural microphone puts the headphones
on played the same song through all the
speakers and in a pretty good location
my house and you can you can actually
hear a difference not like the
difference you really need to hear it in
person but the biggest question the
controversy of the morning is Spotify
because I said in the review it doesn't
work with Spotify in Jonathan Morrison
who's a good dude who I like and we
watched his videos you know the collabs
with us his video is like yes you can't
use it with Spotify here's the
difference I'm gonna explain this to
everybody you can airplay to this using
virtually any app on your phone that
supports airplay you push the button
it's on your phone and send it over over
airplay airplay supports some playback
commands so you can
play/pause next track previous track
it's a big fancy remote control but
because it does have buttons you can
just say next track back track it will
send that command to your phone over
airplay and that will pass to Spotify
okay so you get like yeah that's not
Spotify support it's not like running
Spotify it doesn't know it's Spotify
it's just sending these like yeah you
can't ask it what's the same YouTube
speaker has playback controls on the top
it will like lightly control the thing
it also does what you want it it's a
nice computer review it should just be
able you should just be able to set
Spotify as a default would say hey play
me a song absolutely and it's just
played from Spotify so there's this
limited support for playback controls on
any airplay app Spotify a title and or
what have you I think that is very
different than controlling Spotify it
sounds like what you're saying is that
this sounds great but it's a big dummy
but isn't that true of any truly great
Rock store the power cord in the chat
super nice but it's also permanently
attached which means that if you vacuum
it or your cat tears it or whatever you
have to go get the whole thing repaired
whereas virtually every other one of
these has a detachable power cord that
you can replace very easily yes which
just seems like a weird weird thing but
it is a very it might have a vacuum okay
here's the other big question I just
caught in the chat from ro was asking
chat here
can you play music on the Apple TV and
have it playing the home phone at the
same time so it's a $350 speaker it's
you know if you're a normal issue person
it's probably the best speaker you're
gonna own you probably wanna play your
TV out of it if you have an Apple TV you
can set the Apple TV to airplay to it
like any other airplay speaker that will
connection will last until you ask it to
play music then it will lose that
connection and then when you go to watch
the Apple TV again you have to go back
into settings and set its airplay again
are the settings in the home cap or no
they're on the Apple TV so every time
you watch something you got to make sure
connected to the home pod as an airplay
device which seems incredibly
inconvenient right you also if you have
an apple if you don't have an apple -
you can't use it as a TV speaker via
Apple TV and a Playstation you can't use
it as the PlayStation speaker just the
Apple TV so I don't think it's ready to
be a TV connected speaker unless
literally all you have in your life is
Apple products and you only use the
Apple TV and you're willing to deal with
that airplay that's my goal but you see
this is the best speaker on this table
or like one of the best speakers you've
ever heard it's one of the best figures
I've ever heard without a doubt it is I
mean like okay it is the best speaker on
this table okay I think Dan I think you
reviewed the home max I did yes and you
know the funny part is like any one of
these in a vacuum is going to sound
really good like the home max if you
don't compare to anything else that this
is a speaker you bought and you put in
your house you're probably gonna be
really happy with the way it sounds the
same for this so nice one sounds
excellent on its own these two are a
little different they you know they kind
of sound like garbage right away but
when you compare them ahead the head and
side by side the home pod basically
stands out from everything it's it fills
a room better it's got better bass
response without getting muddy
it just sounds more full and like there
are certain things that maybe this
honest one is a little clearer on
certain frequencies but overall most
people I would say like 99 out of 100 if
a no blind tests are gonna probably pick
the home pot as the one yeah so we the
whole max is very loud and very big but
it has this like weird scooped sound
which means that it has a very low
mid-range but like boosted bass boost
the trebles so it has this kind of weird
sound in the home app a lot of people
asking this the home app does have EQ
settings but the I agree at the end it
sounds like really boosted bass really
boosted treble you know what slider
isn't in the home apps EQ settings
this when you compare this to say like a
sona's play v which is roughly the same
size and the same price range and
everything this just sounds like it has
this like filter over the sound that's
like softening it and you lose a lot of
that clarity for some reason but like I
said if you never compare it I think
we're probably like reviewers are the
only ones who are gonna compare these
head-to-head if someone buys this and
puts in their house they're gonna
probably be really happy with it but you
know there are better options out there
so I think these are the two best
actually I really don't like the way the
hell max sounds that's my personal taste
it's all very subjective head-to-head
this sounds better than the Sonos but
again this sounds really good and it
lets you guys do you Spotify and lets
you control Spotify of Alexa so and it's
like a danger of the workplace here
and cenis is like a music platform so
you get all kinds of sound speakers if
in all kinds of rooms and Spotify Kinect
is on all kinds of devices and you're
the stereo pairing with this not yet and
airplay - is it out what airplay - comes
out sonís will support it and you'll be
able to tell this to light up a center
speaker over airplanes you'll also be
able to do multi room with this and
stereo pairing it's not all that stuff
that you can do with someone else today
but you can't do it what if we live in a
world we could use multiple of these
together you know it's fun you can you
will be able to do that and you can do
that with these - which is which is
funny you can and you can set a
multi-room with that it's a little
little hinky it's better if you want
multi room right now so nose is probably
the best system for doing that if people
in the chat are asking us about the
display on top so I think Apple has been
good maybe Chloe
leave it I wouldn't say needlessly baby
but vague about what's happening with
this speaker so you see it lights up
like that mmm that's not a screen that's
a bunch of multicolored LED is under
like a cloudy glass layer it's like a
hue bulb and it's just there to show you
it's active they can't actually display
anything precise on that screen they
told me it's not designed to display
text so you can't add interface elements
to that or anything and then when you do
play music white LEDs light up on the
sides here
so that's cool but that's all that's
really happening they're just a bunch of
lights it's also on top so if you're
across the room you can't see it easily
and stuff like that which is a little
frustrating all the other ones except
for the sonís one is very difficult to
see it's little light but there's Google
ones the echo devices you can see across
the room whether they've heard you or
infirmed or doing it so the question
people ask me are you gonna buy one I
buy everything like it's weird that I
don't want to buy this like I can't
figure out where it fits and customer
for this because you use Apple music if
you don't use up a music that's an
instant like non-starter you like goods
yeah like this thing sounds great and
I'm so enamored with what Apple did to
make it sound good I think it's just
such cool technology but all of the
series stuff all of the Apple music
restrictions all of that to me is just
like I don't I can't figure out where it
fits and for me to not figure out where
I can just like shove a gadget into my
life is like very strange just get rid
of one cantaloupe but then you run into
the problem of Siri which can't do like
two timers yeah okay last question
somebody asks is a fabric better on the
Google home or the home pod this is
really you have to go to an Apple store
and like squeeze this it's just not it's
not at all what you'd expect yeah I
don't think I don't think it's just like
like metal or plastic behind it so funny
story from my review of the home max I
had it up on my mantle it fell off my
mantel because it's actually very heavy
it's 12 pounds and I damaged the front
cover and it tears a little bit but this
is a this is not the the one that drops
but it is a plastic cover on that we're
running way over here I'm gonna answer
this question you cannot so you cannot
use this as a standalone you have to
have an iOS device yeah you can't just
buy it and set it up out of the box you
can't have an if you have Apple music on
Android you're like one of those five
people just sorry you like Apple but you
can't even set it up with a Mac right
you have to have it's iOS okay that's a
lot on speakers thank you so much for
your questions we're gonna watch a quick
video this is Matt Guerin and CES just
failing to have a smart suitcase
followed
and then we come back ash is gonna be
here we're gonna talk about some instant
cameras take a look at this we're still
years away from planes with modular
cabins completely see through walls or
trains with Hyperloop like speeds in the
mean time travel accessories companies
are selling us on a vision of future
travel in the form of smart luggage
these travel gear is supposed to make
things feel modern and secure but they
may cause more headache in their work
take the trend autonomous luggage these
suitcases the computer vision technology
built into them so they can recognize
the owner and automatically roll after
them as they're walking now conceptually
this is kind of neat if you're a
caretaker having both hands-free to tend
to your family members is useful
especially at a place as chaotic as an
airport or train station but in practice
the prototypes we still have a long way
to go take 90 funds puppy one suitcase
it legitimately ran away from me the
tech is pretty impressive it uses
segways auto balancing technology to
propel itself make smooth turns and ride
over bumps but it turns out it's a lot
more like a puppy obviously to throw at
a curve ball a company called forward X
makes a similar product called the CX
one this suitcase did an okay job
following me around but sometimes miss
turns and would bump right into me when
I stopped moving
it's hard to imagine that these bags
wouldn't plow into other people in the
same way in a more crowded area
basically it was more to babysit these
so-called smart bags and it was just
like my old dumb suitcase around not to
mention that some of these smart bags
could raise serious flags at TSA
checkpoints I know because it happened
to me back in 2016 with the first model
of the blue smart bag that had exposed
wiring and a non removable battery
given my experience I reached out to a
TSA to ask whether these new bags might
cause disruption at security checkpoints
but all they told us was that they'll
scan the bags as long as they're FAA
compliant and finally there's price
these things are not cheap with
crowdfunding projects for bags you can
ride an autonomous suitcase is going
between 1,100 to $1,500 it's great the
designers and engineers you're thinking
about making bags that make travelers
lives easier
especially for people with mobility
impairments but just like the hyper lutz
and flying cars of our time it looks
like we're still a few years away from
that vision of the future we're back all
of these speakers have magically
disappeared I'm here I'm good thanks for
having me I'm really happy that we don't
have to talk to avoid assistants anymore
you have brought us a new instant camera
you were on the show last season mm-hmm
to talk about instant camera market
that's developing and that's the Instax
which is like the I would say the
standard-bearer yeah so this was the new
I came on the show last season to talk
about this s q10 this was fuji films
square photos i can show you guys an
example this was the size which is just
square it's not a mini Instax like
they've previously made and it was it's
a digital camera as well as an instant
camera so you can take photos store them
on a micro SD edit them within the
camera this is a beautiful photo of the
office yeah do different things um it's
pretty simple and it was different for
that many people and these are like hot
sellers yeah I mean I know people love
them but they're cool cool so then what
is this this thing looks great okay so
at CES this year there's a fingerprint
Polaroid yeah it loves finger prints
Polaroid was like hey we can do square
too and so they introduced the Polaroid
pop and that's what this is and it's
sort of the same idea where it's a
digital camera as well as you can print
photos and these big square formats and
then you also can have a micro SD is you
can put these on your computer your
phone whatever share them an Instagram
and it is very bad like very bad I want
to show you guys though really quick if
I could do this so this is actually
where you load the paper yeah I thought
this is where printed as well and then
it prints at the top do you want me to
show you how to take a photo in here
okay
maybe I'll take a photo with Paul
yeah so you have to turn this alright
it's so slow it just now loaded like
it's seriously the slowest thing okay
there you are Paul
so wow like you can with hood you Tomy
can edit but this has all of the
terrible clipart stickers and things
like that so here we go a bunch of
clipart we'll just put a big question
mark right you
this is like the smartphone supply chain
is that people are able to do this stuff
and it's the buggiest software it's just
oh and this is like a akin ten year old
Android phone I can write here so I can
just write your name right so that white
border is just a lie in the sense of it
doesn't contain ink right so this is
doesn't contain the photo or the photo
right it's just it's just for looks like
here you have this hole this is this is
regular it's like a real pool yes this
is a real pole right you have this here
this is just dink paper which is he
activated ink and it's terrible really
but Zink is cheap it's less than a
dollar a print where is real prints are
expensive so I'm gonna put this out for
you Paul because I know you really
really want this God so we're gonna
print its gearing up the sound effects
are awesome I mean to me the whole point
of this show is that we bring on things
that look cool in pictures and renders
encounters yeah cuz I think it's cute
yeah pretty and then we turn them on in
their ten year old Android phones inside
that make horrible sounds and slowly so
one nifty feature which again no one you
want we all have smart phone okay anyway
you can record video on this too exactly
frames per second alright here you go
so the reveal such a great photo
it's pretty good I'm also gonna show you
guys there's a companion app of course
there is it's just dumb because you
don't need digital copies like Shawn I'm
actually review that sq so what does
that sound that's the that's what she
got it's so here's what my the insects
and the other cameras like that are
they're part of this wave where they're
like it's a little bit of a computer but
like really it's about physical objects
it's like kind of retro looking and then
they they like capture this huge market
right and then Polaroid got mad at them
because they're like wait that's what we
do yeah so Fuji phones been around for a
very long time and in between season one
and two right now
Fuji film and Polaroid are now in a
legal battle because Polaroid says that
Fuji film is infringing on its patents
Polaroid by the way is bankrupt and sold
all its intellectual property to the
document on the screen yes new eyes a
lawyer
Nilay lawyer thing I just want to point
out two things this is the lawsuit that
Fuji film this isn't Polaroid suing Fuji
is suing alright for being annoying so
the thing they said that they're
infringing on is this white border
Polaroid sized foodies I'm gonna hop to
the whiteboard the point of this is
Polaroid if you look at this it's not
even polar it anymore it's like a
holding company for trademarks and then
this is Fuji film saying its declaratory
judgment so they just going to the court
and they're like can you make Polaroid
go away which is incredible yeah they
say Polaroid just call them up was like
you always millions of dollars by the
way Polaroid was at one time a great
American yes the thing is
Fuji's has been a camera company they
know how to make cameras they made a
reasonably good camera that people
really like Polaroid is like like a
bunch of suits who like bought this
trademark and it seems like they just
went to Shenzhen and bought like garbage
parts like the worst parts if you look
at this screen I can't see this on
camera the screen is like you're so used
to your smartphone screen which is like
super tightly laminated
this is like six inches and so they're
just try cashing on this like craze of
the Polaroid brand
this is horrible Paul can I show you the
off button because this makes favorite
things it's so dumb
there we go yeah it's just a little
touch screen button also just so you're
aware you can also it also a very very
bad companion app I was editing a
beautiful photo blown up because you're
on the tablet yeah exactly
yes they vote for iOS or Android you can
see your gallery I made this picture of
hi I'm for him these are photos that
were taken on the camera you could yeah
better than that one oh it is this is a
20 megapixel camera but so bad it's so
bad this is only a 3 megapixel camera
but it's somehow better alright because
it's like yes so the how much is the
Fuji one cost - 80 - 80 and the film is
about more than a dollar print okay and
then the pop is 200 and the prints are
less than a dollar print and they look
like it and it look like it this is very
bad
this is not a touch screen on the Fuji
film by the way so I used to see these a
party it's just like constantly and then
they kind of trickled out do you think
this fad continues on yeah it's so fun
and we actually bought a bunch of
accessories like different frames and
like clips to hang things up I think
people just love that like why not yeah
well they love these white corners right
so then you we do is you take your phone
and you take a picture of this camera in
this photo right yeah because that's
what they're trying to get it here it's
like oh you want to share these photos
I'm on to but I was like no you
want to take a picture of the physical
photo and then share the picture of the
physical photo yeah cool things I know
everyone's hot for an update on the
central core we don't know if it's
landed on the drone ship yet we don't
know but they are alive there are now
live shots of the car in space which is
like yeah they're taking them with you
he mounted cameras in the car alright
we've just got a few minutes left
let's answer some of your questions a
lot of people still have home pod
questions that's like the main thing
people wanted what do you think of the
home perm what do I think of it I like
how squishy it is also I was shocked
when that was in a display on top not
this whole time I was like oh it's a
display are you Spotify person yeah so
it would never
would you ever switch my Spotify for
sound quality that's the do you have a
small speaker I use bluetooth what about
this though yeah we have to bring this
thing out earlier this is the iPod hi-fi
what come far we've come so this this
thing was my original like party jam
speaker cuz can you see this said aux-in
it's got a regular power cord and then
my dude so we would go to parties in
college and we'd stop CBS 2 by D so bad
[Laughter]
and then we plug our iPods into it it
was great this thing sounded incredible
as well Steve Jobs introduced us on
stage he's like I've only speaker
systems that cost more than you can
imagine this sounds better than all of
them it didn't it was like 700 hours or
the ridiculously expensive people are
asking if you can set an alarm to wake
you up with music on me and the answer I
believe is no it's the same as Siri
whatever you can do with your phone so
like you can pick a tone where are you
that I wonder a $6 we're at $1 six by
four print is cheap I don't think the
print the point is that they're cheap
you know in the market that's like one
of the cheapest right that's like as
cheapies you're gonna get for a print
right it's not gonna be cheaper than
that yeah a little less you want cheap
prints yeah I like walking price is
expensive because it's always for yeah
we just need we just need information
usually what if I like tangible things
though well is this tangible I want to
hold the photo
close to my heart every day what else we
got everyone is asking about privacy and
me on the home Potter Apple's better at
privacy than every other company because
they don't make their money and data
they make their money selling new things
which is another reason why not
supporting Spotify is confusing because
they're still selling you a home pod
yeah it's like like you're stealing but
yeah so they don't collect any data they
try not to send anything to the cloud
that they don't have to whereas
everything Amazon Google do runs in the
cloud so that that I think is if you are
interested in that most people I think
just happily trade away their privacy
like a moment's notice without thinking
about it but yeah Apple is generally
better at privacy things and they're
certainly not have no incentive to
collect a bunch of your personal data
they don't want it they're really good
at making sure they don't take it when
they don't need it should Apple make
deals with Spotify and who let sutter be
more flexible they already have a deal
with Hulu who is on the Apple TV I think
a good comparison for them about is
actually the Apple TV so the Apple TV is
Apple's thing mmm
they were on the iTunes Store they will
happily rent you movies they don't allow
anyone else to rent you movies on the
attitude on the Apple TV but YouTube's
on there who's on their YouTube TV is on
there now PlayStation TV is on there now
like there's a bunch of other TV
services on the Apple TV they do
everything except the one thing Apple
wants to do so you could make the
argument that they're they're more open
on the Apple TV I mean yeah it's true
they're more open on the Apple TV than
like the watch or the home pod they just
really need those subscribers for Apple
music is that what this is about
probably it's Apple makes like thousand
billion dollars every quarter the 30
million Apple music shows are not a
rounding error feel like in Apple's head
you'd just be sad if you were using an
inferior service like Spotify Apple
doesn't want you to be sad they wanted
you to be glad so they will force you
into their great service um then another
question is the thing on top of display
around this is si you you have a lot of
expectations about that thing because
you want it to be a dis I don't know
just should be a display yeah the fact
that it's just
lights is like what yeah there's a thing
where like points at you which i think
is the best feature yeah you hate that
oh you do like that because it's
responsive like when we didn't have time
for it before we put a stopwatch like
one of the big differences in all of
these is how quickly they respond the
home pot is not the winner is very slow
but you can speed up that feeling just
by like lighting up I think that light
is so important you need to see that I
think to know you're getting that
interaction sure to this person just
says I love Spotify huh like the green
color
I think Spotify his interface is
backwards no like it just doesn't let
you know what music is available to you
it's like would you like another
playlist another robot has made another
player one of your cooler friends is
listening to this music at this time my
phone what do you want out of a
second-generation nice if it could be
your home theater audio yeah so many
people have terrible TV audio or they
like buy a projector because projectors
are great right now hmm
but then running audio like yeah like
you you put your Apple TV and extra
projector and then you have to run audio
cables all the way to the front of your
room it's messed up I think so this is
like a cautionary tale we happily put
out a speaker eight years ago they're
like this is we want a piece of that
bose action right great and then they
were not committed to it they dropped it
you know that market ran away from them
if you want to do home pod and you're
like interested in the home you've gotta
like work in every room so if you look
at Amazon's lineup they make a little
one that make a big one on the screen
yeah so nice makes you know all kinds of
speakers and make amps to make just
little boxes that connect to your
existing Stewart like
they fit into all the rooms in your
house I'm like not everybody needs that
some people just take one speaker but
people want to watch on their TV people
wanna watch music and more than one or a
bit of time sometimes and like Apple has
not figured out they've not communicated
at least how they're gonna do all of
that so they have come up with a way
where I can read in Eli's text I think
use it is the lonely person makes is
accurate because it's like I use a
speaker for when friends come over my
friend's mom be like I won't play this
new song Bluetooth or whatever it is or
just inaudible and now it's like okay
you don't use Apple music hopefully you
have an iPhone yeah all right the best
the best version of this song is this
like kind of live version that's on
YouTube yeah yeah yeah I play music off
YouTube all the time yeah I will say
Ashley brothers point I there's a line
and this we had to end the show but
there was a line in an interview that
was like this is a product that seems
like it was designed for a very
demanding person who lives alone
entirely within Apple's ecosystem I kind
of meant it as a burn yeah at me that
