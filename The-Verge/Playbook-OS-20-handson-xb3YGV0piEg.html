we're here with Jeff GAD way the senior
product marketing manager for blackberry
playbook and we're going to show you a
quick tour of playbook OS two point oh
we've made the performance of bridge a
lot faster so whether it's accessing BBM
or say you're outside of Wi-Fi and you
still want to get access to your email
calendar contacts you can use bridge
right to get that wirelessly even if
you're outside of Wi-Fi that's a lot
faster then how is it different from
tethering so so tethering gives you kind
of unfettered data on your PlayBook in
every you know in every which way right
so if it's powering applications or you
know downloading music tethering is just
using your blackberry essentially as a
modem to the web yeah right whereas
bridge it's essentially giving you like
a big screen window into your blackberry
application so say I get an email from
Diane right and let's pretend it has a
web link in here right and I go you know
what I want to like enjoy this website
on my playbook I can hit menu and I can
say open link on GAD way right and what
it's going to do is open the appropriate
application on the playbook and then I
do a long press remote control remote
control so that gives me the ability to
use the touchscreen to fully remote
control the device that was really so do
you need a you need a device or the
touch screen no it works with devices
with track pads as well so you've got
you know the ability to to control the
device like that there's also a
presenter mode here so you can use it as
like a PowerPoint clicker for slides
right and then the last piece here like
you said if I go in here and say I've
got this plugged into my TV across the
room and I want to change the website I
can use the keyboard
to enter text really cool so the other
thing too I mean this is more of a
cosmetic thing but we've kind of changed
the way that os/2 lays out a little bit
so you've got a doc that you can
populate with stuff and it's just as
simple as you know dragging and dropping
things into the stock so say you want it
up roll up here you can just drop it up
here and with that we've changed the way
that you can organize content on the
home screen too so say I wanted to group
all my Angry Birds together I can just
you know angry i can create folders on
the home screen too but ok so you know
without any further ado we can jump into
the messages application so this is a
unified messages application for both
email and social networking and what's
really neat about that is that say i
wanted to send a direct twitter message
to somebody that I'm following I can do
that right from within the inbox I don't
have to launch the Twitter app to send a
Twitter message right it's it's a truly
unified and and consolidated messaging
experience that you can get a look at
reading from the message you can't make
a tweet like a nap mention this is like
pretty much just for messaging but any
new direct messages that you receive
will come in here and you can reply to
them within the within the app as well
and the last thing I'll show you in the
inbox or in the messaging application is
the way that we've incorporated
multitasking and this is something
that's pretty unique to play book so
instead of having a very siloed
messaging experience so say on other
platforms where you're in the inbox you
touch on an application or on a message
and you wanted to go back you have to
you know press the HOME key and it takes
you right back out you're actually able
to go in and say I want to compose a new
message I can go in i can start
composing you know hello rich text so
that was the other thing I was going to
show you I can go back to that message I
was just looking at and and reference it
one of the things that's really neat
about about contacts I'm going to start
here with the accounts setting I can go
in and I can add a bunch of accounts to
the playbook right so here I've got
linkedin and twitter set up and it's as
easy as going in
and selecting from a list right and
entering your credentials and once
you've done that it's going to pull in
not only your email accounts into the
messages but all of your contacts into
the contacts application and all of your
calendar info into the cup into the
calendar application so Greg's another
guy who works at rim and you'll see that
his contact card is comprised of three
different sources of information so the
playbook has intelligently gathered his
information from LinkedIn from his rim
corporate contact card as well as as
well as Twitter to populate one
consolidated contact card for Greg and
then the last piece is the is the
calendar right so in addition to all of
your standard kind of calendaring
features right you got your agenda view
your day view you know the ability to
here's our meeting here with the verge I
can take this I can drag it to another
time and then it will allow me to send
updates to other participants on that
meeting so it's really like a full
desktop calendaring solution right and
you can even layer your calendars you've
got a whole new virtual keyboard right
with with contextual predictive so hello
everyone yeah I think the best way to
the next few like you don't even need to
type right let's actually crazy it's
it's really really strong and for the
BlackBerry users out there we've
incorporated all those blackberry
keyboard shortcut I pin so like double
double tapping a spacebar to insert a
period and a capital and then all the
contractions so if I said can't see a
and T and a hit spacebar it's going to
automatically know that that's a
contraction right so just little little
kind of special things in there
