at the 2015 game developers conference
with the final version of valve steam
controller the steam machine idea has
been out for a while and we've seen
prototype controllers but this is
actually something that's a lot more
solid and is going to be coming out
finally in November one of the big
differences between this and a standard
just xbox controller is that instead of
a directional pad it's got this trackpad
here this has been smoothed out and it
works sort of a lot like an analog stick
now but you can set it with momentum and
it's a bit finer right now I'm playing
System Shock 2 which pretty much it
doesn't work with the controller and I'm
using this trackpad to track my motion
but I can also bring up a menu and I can
use this for the really fine
click-and-drag work of moving this thing
in the in my inventory it actually ends
up working pretty well although the
upshot to this is that you have to spend
a lot of time messing around with
bindings which seems to be something
that they've spent a lot of time putting
options into so there's just a
cornucopia of key binding options here
that are probably going to be fun but
for right now I mean that it's a little
bit hard to tell how well it's actually
going to work for things that you won't
be normally using a controller for it's
just a standard controller it's fairly
intuitive and it's in a lot of ways say
this is like the Xbox controller that
you would plug into your laptop or your
normal PC but it just has these sort of
extra options it's going to be out in
November for about $50 along with steam
link and all of the other stuff the
steam is showing off at GDC
