there's some rumor every time I tweet
about Paul then I like Paul is here he
said this thing of you somebody responds
to me with why are you talking about
Paul right isn't he supposed to be off
the internet yeah you can't exist right
yeah it's like yo works next to me i'm a
little thinner out I'd like toast I told
my I employed by fellow employees at the
verge I was like they're like I'll guess
I'll see you in a year I was like you
know what you I you could call me I can
call you so who wants my calls you yet
no so so Paul so you aren't you are off
the internet yeah how's it been it's
great I'm am crying a lot really yeah I
just right into my word processor one in
a corner yeah and I'd save it while
op-ed apartman you don't have to be in a
crime mail yeah buddy uh so but you
actually have been writing a lot I think
you've been writing more since you're
off the internet then you were before
you were off I have nothing to do I'm
very productive yes i'll write a feature
today no no even even finally reports
from the from the world of not having
the internet and and you actually you've
been doing videos and you did a video i
want to show this you did a video with
masi oka who as I mentioned was a hero
on hero my fit my absolute family I like
the horn rim glasses God oh yeah like is
alright but he's yeah he's a hero he's
over 850 this is a show on CBS yes it
Neil I was like it's still on the air
apparently it's super popular well
everything everything on CBS is popular
it's right yeah old people this thing I
change a channel I think this is a smart
TV that's right I'm CBS leave it alone
leave it there well she also worked at
ILM oh yeah he would he did special
effects for star yeah like the prequels
he was working on so just wrap your head
around this if you didn't know this the
guy who played here on heroes actually
worked on the special effects for the
first three the new three a star war he
was literally a programmer and then
became a star I'm created he did the
animated Anakin yeah that was a
synthetic character
right yeah I think it act like a
synthetic air yeah um why am I watching
a kid yeah anyhow you went to the museum
of what is it museum a moving image yeah
and queen in Queens yeah you with masi
oka and we have a video record of it
take a look at this I think you'll find
it very interesting hi I'm Paul at the
verge I am here in Queens at the Museum
of the moving image I'm gonna meet masi
oka from heroes he was hero and heroes
which should give you a clue about how
awesome he was in that show and he's
basically the best human being on the
planet earth so just no no big deal so
you work the ilm yeah can you bells
before heroes right before here how long
were you with ila oh well i would say
probably good ten years baby okay you
were involved with like during the
prequels mother whales and other people
as well yet what software what you're
making for them then well you or me our
main platform was Maya so I wrote a la
Maya plugin you know specific example
might be like we're both at chase's uh
in the asteroid sequence uh-huh so we
basically the production that said and
we need to be able to destroy this
asteroid in a million pieces or one give
the control which way everything goes
you know because an animator need to be
able to have all that fine control and
with you know went in in ilm within
visual effects you want to be able to do
it so that it's visually accurate when
that's not necessarily physically
accurate it has to be physically
accurate enough so there's a lot of
communication back and forth where they
want to make something look you just
have been made yeah I remember one shot
where we had to do breast enhancements
good yeah so say there was a shot of a
breast and the director wanted it bigger
so we had to like wow digitally enhanced
that sounds like really hard work
you and thank you right after ILM yeah
you got the job was here that's like why
you left right well actually what a
starter was I went to San Francisco was
their headquarters i was there and i
finished my first big show there on
perfect songs on there like two or three
years ok and I said you know I loved
working here I could I'm a life like I
could stay here so that meant that was a
sign for me to leave so I came down to
LA and you know I ran on money very
quickly right sounds like oh shit yeah I
got to do something about my financial
situation but their Island said you know
what if you're gonna look for jobs
elsewhere want you to stay working for
us you could tell occasion for us in
that way Wow so that was that was very
nice to them and then but I had to sign
up as contract saying if I didn't get a
recurring role on a pilot or a
supporting role in a film in my first
year in LA I would have to move back up
to San Francisco I feel like heroes was
this realization that you could do movie
level effects now on a TV show I was out
pretty big leap forward but I have to
think you know before that you know lost
did a great job of making come bringing
something cinematic okay yeah especially
when you tell a seer live show and it
goes that but with that always comes
budget you know I think right now we did
heroes you know we could do it on a
cheap I slightly cheaper budget and
forget you know it's gonna get better
and better do you have any of these
growing up I actually didn't have a lot
of the figures you know I only wanna how
does that dude at the Cape I don't even
know that it's great because there's all
these fans of that world you know and
and to have people who are so passionate
about it if it's also you know it's it's
upon the filmmakers you know my foreign
boss George you know he needs to take
care of that band yeah these days is
getting to a point that feel like she's
milking every cent possible which is uh
yeah I get it's a business you know
you know he's he was a great creator
when he created the first Star Wars you
know he create something revolutionary
if you see the original original Star
Wars yeah there's a lot of interesting
mistakes he saw all these mistakes when
he when he first created right so he had
Island do an entire pass at the movie
right and makes little changes so were
you there at the time yeah was there
like those projects like it just like
simple things like putting their badges
here here you know there's actually a
fan project to restore the original cut
cuz you can't buy in high definition at
original cuts of the movie so they're
like they're tried to undo you there
reverse engineering your work well i
think is you know is there's a reason
why i was a classic at that ham yeah i
think you need to embracing mistakes as
well yeah there's always gonna be
mistakes even this shoot right now like
i was wearing a watch now where you are
that everyone's gonna freak out do you
have action pictures of yourself well no
one made my action figure was like
really you know loosely made so the head
would always come on oh there's like oh
that's kind of a like a disc yeah I have
a confession i bought the first 2 c'n
the first two seasons and i saw the
first episode of the third i just i
walked away i totally understand okay
with that i think so i think the first
season of that show was absolute
brilliance even you know as a fan myself
i was a fan of the show yeah we were so
proud and everybody around the world you
know there was a phenomenal without
doubt i'm very proud of the work we get
for a seat do you do you think there's
something to that where you get a
backlash like with star wars because the
first season or the first movie was so
good and fans just expect that greatness
throughout and they get mad when that's
not met yes I mean it's a little bit
difficult at the same time that's our
job you know I think unique you take a
bold no choice make a bold choice in a
c50 and sometimes it works and sometimes
it did it did you play emulate a game I
play melee games yeah
I spent so much porters on like gauntlet
so I kind of like go back oh I played
some gauntlet that thing is designed it
makes so much money I realized that wow
I'm on each other mmm cute i love that
other players yet where do you see
yourself going you are direct uh yeah i
think ultimately i loved the wreck I
love the collaborative nature of behind
the scenes i also like being in front of
the camera so i think the rush directing
seems to be a natural kind of with
culminating all the experiences I've had
you've got sort of all angles of the
craft I try it you have a you think you
have a blind spot you got you all I have
so many blind spots I you know this life
this is a continuing education you can
always be learned I could be like nine
years old and I could still be learning
stuff you know that's what's kind of fun
I enjoy knowledge I i create a new stuff
i love exploration in is you know it's
constant learning something new every
game right that's cool thank you so much
no thank you
adorable first off
I am I need I need to go to this museum
it looks incredible on a fucker has an
arcade in it it has a whole arcade I am
so ignorant I don't and they also you
know that installation you probably saw
at the start of the video it's like a
whole wall of gifts actually didn't
interview with oh yeah yeah I get
curator is that why you went there so
you could see gifts may be very bossy is
that a separate trip you were there
twice no I did two shoots one day oh
that's how in the zone that's to call TV
magic uh web checking my phone video
magic right as they say not sure they
always say ya know the one thing cool
about it ma see you know he's so he
cares so much about like the whole
process of film now he's like pitching
anime to Hollywood hey anime shows he
wants to see adapted because he's just
so concerned that they're adapted right
and I just in Hollywood I have all I was
the place where you want to take when
you want something to be you know remain
true to its source material right
Hollywood yeah alright so in other news
moving along in other news i don't know
if you guys heard yahoo is in the news
first off yahoo is in the news yahoo
doctor i just got caught that's the
whole business let's just take that in
just you know so let that soak in for a
second I'm excited uh so they hired the
CEOs then with scott thompson scott
thompson so right that has made that up
Eddie how he's there for five buns and
then he got fired because he lied on his
resume about having a computer science
degree he's actually as an account he
has an accounting degree but he does not
have a computer science degree there's a
big kerfuffle that's a word and you
think you would check that they fired
him so so we were talking about it and
we and I said look everybody lies on
their resume right you've all lied on
your resume yeah he said this to an
audience of his employees yeah you have
you I mean I've law I lied there's no
way I should be running the verge I lied
about my I mean no eyes not I'm not
qualified I tell people I'm a doctor
there you go there's good I'm super lady
hey I'm dr. Patel I thought you were
gone
you're not a doctor they say all those
don't take those that's ecstasy he's
like this will make you feel a lot
better okay that's the thing there's
definitely nice to see joke on every
Oliver all right anyhow but we were like
let's find people and ask them if
they've lied let's see if people will
tell us if they've if they've lied on
their resume and Frank and specifically
what they've lied about Paul thought
that people would not go for it Paul was
dead wrong very wrong Neal I took to the
streets of New York the hot sweaty gross
sexy streets of New York we might have
different ways and any talked to people
and ever asked me everyone is like like
you know I don't usually lie but i'll
lie on my resume here's exactly what i
did take a look at this it's a
fascinating look into the minds and
hearts of average New Yorkers you ever
lied in your resume to get a job mmhmm
yeah absolutely right absolutely yeah I
wouldn't say I have lied maybe like
exaggerated responsibilities so on your
résumé right now it says you're fluent
portuguese in my day proficient do you
know one word in Portuguese seem is that
zamane yes yeah do you know how does he
know now okay do you notice him baby
it's almost just like if you don't do it
you're an idiot because you won't get
the job I lied about I'm having two
creeks oh my god what you know I think
the weirdest resume we ever received at
the verge is literally just the word
please I know that means parents sleep
at night so you're on your resume it
said you were manager yes yeah what were
you actually a chance no it was an exile
I'm a banker change but I'm actually
who's the man I got a checking account
we need some like suits we need to see
what the one percent thinks of lies
problem is none of them will talk to us
excuse me sir we're doing some
interviews now none of that fishery
we're doing an interview about lying in
resume his campaign yeah just wanting to
be involved with your thing alright
thanks no thanks no I appreciate it
excuse me sir for your boyfriend yeah hi
we'll talk to you next oh my god your
guy in a suit I've been waiting for a
guy this dude oh my god it's finally a
guy to shoot yeah it's a match if you
were hiring people and you came across
the resume with a yahoo email address on
it you feel it would you I've got a job
ended i'll be a little offended cuz
everyone uses gmail who who has yahoo or
like hotmail I had a hotmail account
before my gmail and everyone was like
that's only for like child predators
what's your main personally know I have
a hotmail account when they don't have a
gmail email address actually I judge
them so fresh people they don't have
gmail yeah I never use yahoo I told
somebody my email justice at a wall and
and the person at my job just kind of
look at me like do you still have a wall
like come on you got to get up on the
gmail now I'm gmail I'm pretty happy
with the head I'm a gmail guy where are
three things you would immediately do if
you're the CEO yahoo oh god I'm try pray
pray cry cry cry pray and then I would
call a big meeting to restrict you to
get of it my first movie would be the
quick second move will be to sell my
shares cuz that you wouldn't be
obstructed by that throw the we're going
to move to get out ultimately we're all
liars we all stretch the boundaries of
reality to construct a box that makes us
feel more comfortable but as I looked
inward today a universal truth revealed
itself to me no one gives a shit about
Yahoo
that was that was enlightening I seems
like you got it lightened there it was
very very strange yeah I uh I liked your
last line no one gives a shit about
Yahoo uh sure that's really touching
well don't the whole problem is that
Yahoo doesn't give a shit about yahoo
and that's it that's how this happened
it does seem like if they were just took
a little more care with the brand they
might not have hired the guy who likes
resume they like Scott what what it's
fine just hire does he have a computer
science degree so you have a close rate
does he have a computer all right I mean
absolutely aren't we all computer
scientists though uh on our resumes all
right uh we have so we won more news
item to talk about which is not really a
technology news item by the way it's on
I feel like I can't top that I almost
that's what I can this oh so did you see
this the social security office or
agency or whatever they call themselves
these days they they released
administration yeah that's what it is
it's the ministry of social status true
social security they released the most
popular baby names and Joshua's livid in
the office yeah I was screaming yeah I
mean is the natural like the names would
like the hot names are celebrity names
people are naming their there's like oh
it's a kid I'll name it after Adele or
Jaden yeah jayden is a popular name and
the rising star this year was a Mason
based on the child from the kardashian
show what does it called me like i have
no idea really you don't DVR the show
you're always talking about no I mean
I'm came as a goddess and an angel but
I've now watch her she had the
Kardashian child you were the one who
knew that Mason was there yeah I know of
course I follow Mason storrow but anyhow
so so so you know at the verge we we
you'd like to say that the technology
culture is becoming pop culture and so
we got to think in as we were want to do
in the offices and we thought if
celebrity names you know our kind of
moving into the mainstream then it's
surely some stuff from technology would
move into definitely leech into the
mainstreaming of of baby names
inevitable it's inevitable scientific
fact
basically and so we wanted to gaze into
the future and maybe think of some names
we might see in the upcoming years that
are I think we came up with some very
accurate I think these are these are
real names that are probably and we're
going to see because of the the how
technology is just becoming a part of
our lives everywhere it's everywhere so
let's take a look at a few of these
possible these future babies as i like
to call them why did I agree to this uh
here's our first baby uh yeah I handsome
beautiful baby who wouldn't want to have
this very uncomfortable childbirth with
the glasses on of course but what could
this child's name be in the future I'm
thinking probably something like I don't
know zai bored Topolsky that's good yeah
that looks good let's let's God why oh
let's take another look and an adorable
chocolate yes yes I know what you're
thinking what's this baby's name yeah
that's right it's Optimus epic Miller 4G
LTE touch to cut topics know where G how
to get in touch yeah and finally thank
thankfully who are these your friends
running my family through these adorable
adorable a name it's like a little
ethnic those doctors who
are they gonna lose computer scientist
uh these adorable children of course
Siri Patel yeah and her twin brother ITV
Patel watching launching this fall I can
I can guarantee that ITV patel will be
released within two years your fiancee I
think your fiancé Shay I shaking her
head no those are future baby names yeah
yes real future baby names okay you can
turn the tone off now okay we were we
were like straight waiting the research
there's like a couple Siri patel's out
there uh if you would like to apologize
not derailleur jokes Jerry Patel well
name real people try anyhow that was
horrific on many levels but uh okay so
we have an amazing interview that I want
to show you guys right now we flew out
to Los Angeles to talk to Damon Lindelof
as I mentioned he co-wrote prometheus
which is an alien prequel maybe you'll
find out in a second and he's one of the
guys behind loss which I know was a show
that everybody had a good feeling about
when it ended they liked the ending they
felt satisfied it had answered all other
questions and they walked away thinking
I'm glad I spent years and years of my
life I know that's how I thought
literally years in years watching and
waiting for the show to end anyhow we
had this amazing conversation with Damon
Lindelof so take a look it's very
enlightening
hey we're here at the Roosevelt Hotel in
Los Angeles I flew out from New York to
sit down with Damon Lindelof one of the
men behind lost a co screenwriter of
Prometheus and basically just an insane
genius so let's go have a chat so you're
busy man you've got a pretty major
project that's about to be revealed to
the world uh which one are you or be as
I got prometheus oh yeah should I is
there a sore something else that I
should know about there's a new you're
very busy guy there's it more there's
this disney movie 1952 that we just
announced brad bird is gonna direct but
we're not talking about what it is or
can you tell me a little about what it
is no you just give me an idea of the
plot it's a it's a it's about characters
who want something and there's other
characters trying to stop them you tell
me who forget starring in this film no
we don't have any I I would tell you but
there's no actors stana mated no I'm not
commenting Isaac's life check out in uh
happily is that true there's a happy
ending yes it's a Disney movie oh I mean
you know anything's possible in this day
and age it's 2012 it's a penis guarantee
even to even the movie 2012 has a happy
ending I've never seen it sanded I'm
sorry to hear that when you think about
a movie that's essentially about the end
of the world and it's john cusack vs the
end of the world like what's the ending
of that movie look like like how does
how does a had as one character beat the
end of the world can i riff on what I
think happens yet this is what this is
much more interesting probably than the
actual movie baby i think that give you
a hint John Cusack along with a small
band of survivors find some one spot on
the planet that's where we're gonna
start over yes and rebuild humanity the
way it should have been built the first
time around right without fossil fuels
uh yes more or less I got the idea I
would sort of amend like small band of
survivors to like four ginormous ark
loads of survivors who basically
represent the the lottery winners /
wealthy Oleg arcs of all societies and
the don't you happy ended yeah but that
these arcs do get to the the place that
you refer to yeah but it's all like rich
most of them are rich bastards john
cusack one of them he's a stockbroker
he's not a rich bastard his what if
memory serves his wife has married a
rich bat his ex-wife is married a rich
bass okay so it's kind of like or he
falls in or not he finds it he falls in
with like a Russian rich bastard this is
I'm sure why he's a giant Dada they've
tuned out now so you could say what
effort let's just write so so you don't
want to talk about you can't how about
1952 which has a happy ending correct
and stars no one yes but but that's good
but you can't talk about prometheus
which is a small film that you've done
an independent film you've done yes
Ridley Scott sure you are the co
screenwriter yeah a gentleman by the
name of John Speights wrote on the mood
wrote the first draft of the screenplay
for several first drafts he worked in
the movie for about a year and then I
came in after him so we didn't ever work
simultaneously kind of took what he had
and that's right exactly another place
so the movie a lot of the ideas are
actually the seeds are from ridley
directly absolutely because a aside from
its relationship to the original alien
which is a question iterations of that
question are the things that i've been
asked about the most i'm looking forward
to it at the end of the day when you're
working with Ridley Scott it's not about
me coming in and saying hey Ridley I've
got this great idea do you want to
direct it it's about him saying I want
to direct a movie in this universe
here's what I want it to be about here
are the ideas that excite me here are
the thematics that I'm interested in and
here are the character traits that I
want to demonstrate and it's it's a not
to reduce the process of screenwriting
but I feel like in film which is much
different than what i did in TV it is a
little bit like mad libs where my job is
essentially you know really saying
adjective now you know euphemism and
that's how the movie was made yeah
that's a and that exactly I'm sure he'll
be excited when to hear that you
describe the doing making processes mad
libs i but i but i do feel like I i have
great pride in my own lack of authorship
in the movie and I feel like if the
movie is a huge success it's all because
of release
Scott and if the movie is not a success
it's because I wasn't able to execute
his vision successfully and that's
that's the that's the feeling that I
have so let's talk about the connection
between aliens or alien or that universe
you're saying this is a different movie
but it is in I mean it's not a sequel to
it's a prequel if anything right you're
not even calling it that well I mean I
take exception to the fact that it that
it's called a prequel because and and I
know a lot of this sounds a lot like
that you have to get a slightly
defensive terrain but for me just as a
fanboy when I hear the word prequel that
doesn't get me excited like and the
reason that it doesn't get me excited
isn't because I have a negative
association with prequels we have to
think like what's contextualized that
word the first time that I heard that
word in any sort of public or social
setting was in reference to the fact
that George was going to do the first
three Star Wars movies and I was
enormously excited about that that aside
once you actually see what a prequel is
a prequel is by definition a march
towards the inevitable so while we know
that the guy is going to get the girl or
there's going to be a happy ending
there's certain story beats that you hit
the idea of saying I'm now just going to
watch this young boy turn into Darth
Vader you're leading me into the story
that i already know there's certain
things that i know can't happen like
nothing's going to happen to obi-wan
right because it's a prequel and i felt
it was really important that Prometheus
was not positioned as a prologue to
alien write that in fact if prometheus
were successful and there was a sequel
to it the sequel to prometheus would not
be alien I also felt like alien is as
close to a perfect movie as it gets and
I was very reluctant to engage in a
conversation that would somehow diminish
alien right like that if you saw if for
some reason Prometheus didn't succeed
creatively that when you went and
watched alien again you'd be like this
movie is now finished it tastes would be
soured in some ways why yeah why Bible I
bet that so all that by way of saying
that if you my hope is that if you see
prometheus
and you watch alien again there will be
certain things that were mysteries
before about alien that you have more
clarity on but not but but the mysteries
that made alien great are still
mysteries right and I've had a certain
degree of success and failure in mystery
resolution I feel some mysteries are
just much more engaging than their
resolution and I don't want to answer
those it's like ooh where is Amelia
Earhart she's rotting somewhere and the
bottom of like the ocean are you like
you're saying that's probably unless she
was abducted by aliens or you know or
she's living you know somewhere in you
know in France like 50 and hot end and
has discovered the Fountain of Youth
like but the reality is is the answer to
these mysteries are usually less
compelling than whatever our imagination
transposase onto them and so if there I
do think that we succeeded in if there's
a sequel to prometheus it's not about
the things that alien is about which is
eggs and facehuggers and chess bursters
and Xenomorphs right like that that not
only alien but then aliens they need to
go and live off on that tangent
prometheus is launching its servicing
that tangent it's saying here's an
explanation you'll understand the
context of maybe where some of those
things came from but it's much more
interested in going off in its own
direction and we're there a sequel to
prometheus it probably wouldn't need to
trade in any of those ideas so let me
let's just get nerdy for a second I'm
gonna get real specific I and as opposed
to what I look like here cuz you've been
for the last 20 minutes you're speaking
very broadly about the you know you're
kind of setting the stage for this but
yes but but it does seem to be taking
place in or on or around the beginning
of alien which is or or alien full stop
which is this large there's this large
alien craft they stumble upon I mean
that is it that seems to be in your in
prometheus let me just say like there
there was a two minute trailer out there
that people were like I can't wait to
see this movie and then there was a
three minute international child yeah
and that one extra minute of material is
the line that you cry
where people start to say you told me to
my right and i agree i think so the
trailer was gave away so my desire to
not tell you what is the relationship
between my hope is and again this is
frustrating to some but it's the space
in which i live which is the reason to
me that i loved inception was after
inception was over there was stuff for
me to fight about and discuss with my
friends as to what it meant what
happened what was a dream what was in a
dream like all those things that the
movie left in some sort of ambiguous
space and I no ambiguity is a very scary
word especially when you apply it to the
context of of the television that I've
done however I will continue to embrace
ambiguity because I find it really
interesting and I have a tremendous
amount of faith in the intelligence of
the audience most of them are much
smarter than I am and I will have an
intention but the idea of not spelling
it out entirely I will tell you right
now that this movie even when you go and
see it there is space to debate what the
relationship between this movie and
alien is we are not connecting the dots
for you we are giving you the requisite
information to make an impassioned an
impassioned discussion about it you will
know as a hell of a lot more than you
did before but it's not like this movie
ends with a derelict spacecraft full of
eggs crash landing on lv-426 which is
the derelict spacecraft that the
Nostromo happens upon at the beginning
of alien that's inevitability and it's
not interesting right yeah I guess my
question was there in the same universe
because there's been a debate with
people that this is an it's completely
separate right universe they are they
share the universe absolutely very early
on we started saying this is the
question that is not going to go away is
it a prequel what is it so is there a
way that we can start generating content
other than just the trailer then that
was the birth of what evolved into this
Peter Wayland TED talk it's hard to
watch that in any context and then make
the argument that these don't occupy the
same timeline yeah so so getting back to
the ambiguity point I think the danger
there and for what's frustrating for
people and I think that with lost I
think a lot of people feel this
is that it ambiguities can sometimes
come off as not like hey here's
something for discussion but you didn't
know sure I'm a person who watched lost
all the way through again and thought
the ending was extremely disappointed
okay disappointing because it felt like
if I felt like the prot there was a
promise of something much more and not
profound maybe not more moving certainly
not more moving in my opinion but
something smarter right and it felt like
it ended on this in this way that was
like well so what was the point uh-huh
do you does that now haunt you like that
kind of sense of people being of needing
the answer and not getting it and you
having to answer for it I think haunt
sort of implies like it's it's it's
something that creates a tremendous
amount of stress and sadness and fear
for me as much as it is something that I
accept as a part of the legacy of that
show is is is obnoxious and entitled as
the sounds i also have no regrets about
it if there was one regret that i had
there there were times over the course
of the show where in interviews i said
the answers are coming but if you i
challenge you to look at any interview
that i gave post the middle of season 3
which was the turning point when they
said you can we can now give you an end
date to the show because up until then
there was there was a degree of
improvisation that had to occur because
we didn't know how many of these things
we were going to do or how long we were
going to be around to be doing them once
we said there's going to be 48 episodes
left at that point a firm plan had to
come into motion then from that point on
I think that I started saying publicly
if you are watching the show for the
answers to your mysteries you're not
going to like the ending many shows have
come and gone that are very focused on
their mysteries and their mythologies
and their ambiguity and there is no were
seen in the history of genre than the
architect explaining to neo everything
that happened
matrix and I wasn't going to touch that
with a ten-foot pole that is a
particularly awful instance of over
explanation of like feeling like you owe
it to the audience right okay so we have
the architect and then we have lost and
the lost lost is not enough and the
architect is too much and somewhere in
between is just right and I'm going to
always be closer to loss than I am to
the architect because that is just not
interesting to me I've just been sitting
here listen you talk about it I realized
I wasn't disappointed with like with
lost not giving me answers at the end
what I was actually disappointed with
the answer gave which it felt like the
answer was all the things that just
happened didn't really mean anything
they kind of didn't happen that was that
might take away from me what do you mean
they didn't it was like all the things
that happened all these things that were
set up as you know you've got to stop
the man in black because x y&amp;amp;z sure uh
it didn't matter right holy because it
wasn't real yes it was well but not
really and it was like it was like a
shared fantasy him and it didn't seem
like there was like I mean what no so so
so the things that we're going on the
island were happening in the actual
world yes so they were happenin like our
timeline correct I mean yes I mean
there's no oceanic Airlines in our no no
I mean but but in the real world not in
it's like kind of like moment before
death fantasy world where everybody's
trying to find each other so they can go
to heaven no correct um so at the end of
the show the last frame of the show
Matthew Fox closes his eyes closes his
eye and dies you know that happened like
in our context of happening like that
happen that's all it's then from the
moment that he closed his eye all that
other stuff that we did in the in the
sixth season of the show the flash
sideways where nobody knows each other
and the plane never crashed that is
whatever your interpretation is I'm not
going to talk about what our intention
is but that's what you would define is
not having happened or happening but
everything that we ever showed you
anything that takes place on the island
and
aust happened you know absolutely one
hundred percent the plane crash those
people survived everything that you saw
throughout those six seasons like some
the whole struggle between good and bad
that's like a really meaningful thing
that actually occurred yes that would
have threatened the universe had not
been the Dharma Initiative Israel the
island is real all those Hurley right
now right now at this moment in time
Hurley and ban and with help some with
some help from Walt are actually running
things on the island maintaining it I do
feel like one of the things that we
always wanted to do and we're very
passionate about doing was exploring the
idea of purgatory both figuratively and
literally and this was so obvious to the
audience that within three or four
episodes of the of the first season of
the show they were like it's purgatory
right they're all dead and we kept
saying we swear to god they are not all
dead this is really happening but the
audience is telling us that they really
want some sort of clinical evaluation of
an afterlife right in purgatory is about
judgment and this show has never really
offered up what i would call christian
Judeo judgment in terms of there's a
deity it's always about self-judgment so
the idea of like and you know does Jack
think that he's worthy or Sawyer can
Sawyer forgive himself for his sins or
did Kate kill her stepfather justifiably
so I always felt like if the characters
can forgive themselves then they can
then then the show's over show is called
lost it's not because they're on an
island it's because they're lost anytime
you say to people what's lost about it
starts with like well there's this plane
crash and therefore they don't say like
well centuries and centuries ago in fact
millennia ago if they say that you go
like I'm out so I always just felt like
the the show that the ending that we
were shooting for was going to be one
that the dealt with sort of the
emotional reality of the characters and
gave some fundamental explanation for
why what did these people get out of
this plane crash right and the and the
answer is corny as it sounds was the one
that appealed to me the most which is
each other that's what they got if they
I didn't met each other and spent all
that time on the island then they would
never have been able to forgive
themselves for their past sins and break
through to some sort of level of self
awakening and forgiveness is it more
satisfying to you in some ways to work
on something like prometheus where you
have your like look I've got two hours
to deal with this thing there's not
going to be any filler I've got to tell
the story succinctly and answer
questions in a relatively short amount
of time yeah i mean it is very
satisfying to to do a movie that has a
beginning middle and end and you know
exactly what you're getting into when
you start the job television you don't
know what you're getting into you don't
know how many years it's going to be on
for you don't it's hubris to say I have
a plan for the entire second season of
the show because no one's even watching
it yet they have to like it for you to
get to that point so there you know and
I talked about this often so I won't
belabor the point but the two things
that sort of came up all the time during
lost where question number one are you
making it up as you go along and the
answer to that question is no like
that's what people want you to say no we
absolutely have a firm plan and there's
a binder over there and that's where our
plan is and we've got it and you're in
good hands mommy and daddy know where
we're going don't worry about you a map
that's question number one question
number two how much input does the
audience have and the answer to that
question is a lot we listen to you guys
all the time we want to know what you
like and what you don't like and we will
adjust accordingly the true those the
real answers they are not the real
answers the real answers I've given an
as politic as they may sound the real
answers are there is a plan and when the
plan doesn't work we change the plan and
the other answer is yes we really listen
to what you have to say but norm like
ninety-eight percent of the time we
agree with you before you've said it I
did learn lessons you know from Los that
I feel what rolled into Prometheus and
what's interesting about the original
alien is you can watch that movie and be
like I'm curious as to what what's the
story with that space jockey in this
derelict ship but that isn't important
the movie isn't telling you that that's
important the movie is
you that the thing that just jumped out
of the egg on that ship and is now stuck
to John Hurt's face that's important
that's what you're supposed to worry
about now and then and then the sequel
and so on and so forth but the idea that
prometheus now enters into a more and
maybe this is why Ridley and those guys
sought me out in the first place into
the movie is asking very specific
questions the characters are saying we
want answers to these questions some of
the answers they get some of the answers
they extrapolate and but then something
happens that leads the resolution of the
questions is secondary to their own
survival I think all of this stuff is
already endemic people don't want to see
Prometheus like a bunch of people
sitting around a table pondering the
meaning of life they want to see like
what happens when you open Pandora's box
like that's fundamental sci-fi
storytelling right is prometheus an
action movie and before you answer I
want to set this up a little bit it
seems like modern-day science fiction
cannot exist without it having an action
component and if you look at you know I
movie like 2001 I would not classify
it's it's not an action movie correct
something else yes so did you it is
prometheus an action movie or is it
something else I couldn't describe it as
an action movie anymore than I would
describe inception as an action movie
that being said once that fuse gets lit
it's a there there is a fair amount of
sort of scope and sizzle to it there's
much more of an action fuse on
prometheus than I think then I then I
then I think alien but i would say
aliens is an action movie yeah and
prometheus is much more if it feels a
lot more like alien than aliens to me in
terms of its storytelling it I think one
of the things that I've been hearing
both again in the reoccurring theme of
this interview you take the good with
the bad is the good side it's like this
feels a lot like the original alien like
because there's motifs in the original
alien there's an Android you're not
entirely sure you trust there's people
in cryosleep there's a there's a female
lead
there's clearly something happening to
these people that is reminiscent of
those ideas there's creeping around
through dark corridors with flashlights
like so people go this feels a lot like
alien and then there's other people who
are saying like this feels a lot like
alien I would rather have people say to
me for the rest of my career you screwed
up a Ridley Scott movie then not say
that to me because I'm like hey like I
got to be involved in a Ridley Scott I
got a screw over if this goes I fight
not only did I screw up a really Scott
movie I screwed up the first ridley
scott sci fi movie in 30 years like that
if that's not going to go on your
headstone then what should I think
that's a good place to edit demon thanks
so much my pleasure really awesome
thanks yeah
and
I know I know what you're thinking right
now you're thinking that was good but
I'd like to see a version of that
interview that's like three times as
long well I have some good news for you
that interview is like three times as
long as what we have here we had to cut
it down so now we're going to show you
the rest of it no I'm kidding uh but it
will be available when that when the new
show goes up we're going to do the full
length interview you guys can watch it's
it's it's pretty fascinating I think
it's a really a fascinating do to listen
to him to talk to him we're glad that we
got a chance to do it speaking of that's
a Segway by the way speaking of
fascinating interesting dudes I want to
bring out our next guest he's a really
smart very creative guy and frankly I'm
a little bit in love with him please
welcome welcome Marco Arment I works
right thank you thank you
yes nice weird like we're stepping up
the nerdiness we're going that we're
going yeah we're getting increasingly
nerdy at the end of the show we're just
going to be sitting you're coding is
that cool well as long as we put two big
top windows on the screen and one red
one green not too inside baseball all
right is that a coding thing I'm
confused to some people I'm totally
confused right now so Marco we're just
going to pretend that ever happened I
didn't get confused by that joke we're
just moving right along here Marco
you're an interesting man you are one of
the people who created tumblr yep which
as I said we've all used many many times
multiple times a day your bosses I'm
sorry and an insta paper which now
everybody it price has Instagram to you
every time they talk about it right
don't like you created integrand that's
awesome how's it feel to have a billion
dollars yeah I can you we buy actually I
heard a few of those yeah that was an
interesting day so I'm sure you did dude
congrats yeah uh so tell me i want to
put tumblr a little bit i mean tumblr
has become a phenomenon I mean everybody
uses it like every new site I see is
just a Tumblr site and it obviously it's
been great for the porn industry no I'm
sorry it hasn't been uh but for porn
users but but where when did that start
how did that start what was your role
just can you give me like a little bit
of background sure you know spice it up
sexy sexy stuff as sexiest two guys
writing code in an office for a couple
years that's very sad that's very sad
vibe so focused on sex right yeah I did
she has a little bit in love with you it
is late at night you know that's true um
so yeah so what where did that start it
started as me and David Karp David had a
consulting company just making websites
for people and one day we were between
clients for about two weeks and he said
hey I've had this idea I want to work on
it let's see what we can get done in the
next two weeks before we got into this
next project and that was tumblr and
that was late two thousand six and we
built the prototype and it took off we
kept iterating on it as we were doing
client work until eventually the client
work
to be dropped because we had to do this
thing full time yet tumblr work yeah so
so what was the idea was like I I mean
it's like this weird halfway place
between wordpress and Twitter you know
it's this kind of like was the idea like
blogging is just too complicated that
was basically it was that a lot of us
especially if you were a nerd playing
with the internet in 2006 chances are
you had started and abandoned a blog I
write a lot of people did yeah and the
problem is that the at the time what was
really the traditional WordPress movable
type style format is more like a
magazine column where it's a lot of work
you're writing these longer pieces lots
of paragraphs and throwing and images
and stuff every day or once a week or
least you got a you got to do as you
know it takes a lot of time yes and
every time conserve it right and and if
you're doing it as was like a little
side hobby and you only get like one or
two comments in a week and one of them
spam and the other ones telling you that
you're stupid it's kind of hard to keep
the motivation going to keep something
like that up so tumblr was created to to
lower the the friction to make
publishing online easy and to lower the
expectation that you had to produce this
giant magazine column every day because
in reality most people just wouldn't and
they would abandon it and with tumblr
that wasn't really an issue because what
the platform cultivated and expected was
much more sustainable because it was so
much easier right did you did you think
that I might know maybe I don't know the
answer to this but did you think it
would become this this kind of default
almost I mean that's what it's become
really well now when people start
something I mean it feels like they're
moved away from like all I'm gonna start
a wordpress blog too I'm just gonna
start a tumblr and I like I have seven
tumblers right and they're all like I
one day I was like I'm gonna do a
tumbler just of pictures of bags I like
why not cool right uh and i just started
it i did one i was gonna have film
trailer reviews i was just gonna do film
trailer reviews that's good i did like
six and now it's abandoned but it but
tumblr makes it so it's so easy did you
expect it would be this default or were
you like well just be an easier way to
do blog i knew that you know once we had
the product
at a usable stage pretty early on I knew
that people who used it we're going to
love it but I think what surprised me is
how much it took over outside of people
who used to be the ones blogging you
know bat in people who were blogging
almost mostly nerds you know now it's a
lot more people it's like normals it's
everybody there's nobody here probably
no sorry maybe baby who wandered in by
accident maybe yeah they have a tumblr
though we can agree or seven of them yes
that's right and one is about the one
it's about bags so so you you stopped
working at tumblr when 2010 and a 2010
so pretty recently yeah and so talk to
me about instapaper this is your next
big sure project what why did you where
did instapaper come from and how was it
were you sitting there one day you die
mean you were like bookmarking something
you're like there's got to be a better
way to do this basically yeah I mean
what happened was in in late two
thousand seven i got an iphone and I was
still working a tumblr and I was
commuting every day on the train not the
subway you know the suburb train like
you know nobody here knows about an
actual tray an actual current the the
LIRR or the metro north metro north
which leads up to what most people
consider farmland upstate even though
it's like 10 miles you live on a farm
pretty much no okay but everyone thinks
I do we'll keep that up yeah so you know
I had this long train commute and I
would be browsing the web at work like I
wasn't supposed to be doing but when
you're making a platform about browsing
the web it's really hard not to while
you're testing it so i was browsing the
web at work and I would find links to
read and I wouldn't have time to read
him as I was supposed to be working so I
I would want to save them and read them
sometime and the same time I was on the
train and I had this new iphone that had
this terrible edge connection and was
offline half the time for the ride and I
wanted to read things on the train but
by the time I got there the connection
was too slow to browse much to browse
around and I would have already gone
through RSS feeds digg which at the time
still mattered
you know I would have gone through all
these things and so it was like I was
burning through my cue when I couldn't
read it and when I could read it there
was nothing there so i made Instapaper
to bridge that gap to solve that problem
to be a just a temporary place just the
one click bookmark just save it I don't
want to tag it I don't want to like
categorize it and reference this forever
and a giant you know library of things
i've ever read it was just a temporary
like i haven't read this but i want to
you know save it until i have read it
and then get rid of it do you feel it's
the highest form of flattery that that
Apple has completely ripped you off oh
yeah i mean is that it is that weird for
you i'd be really upset if I mean
because you're you know you're just a
guy yes a guy living on a farm right and
here comes big bad apple and they're
just like oh hey we're gonna make this
other thing that does exactly what
Instapaper does that's gonna be default
in all of our browsers well it helped a
lot that they really did kind of a
half-baked job of it really it's
interesting do you think I did a
half-baked job I mean the first version
had pretty much the first version was
basically a bookmark folder right so you
know now and they're adding offline
support and mountain lion although I'm
not supposed to know that but I'm not
officially a Mac Developer so I'm
allowed to tell you that you're not at
your not a Mac Developer right right i
actually haven't seen mountain lion i'm
probably have seen more but i don't know
anything about it ah but it's but you're
but you're telling me that they're
adding offline yeah that's somebody on
Twitter told me they were adding offline
it assu I assume they're right that's
good we on the internet are oh you're
sure I'm sure of person like Wikipedia
always right uh-huh always right always
uh yeah but know it seems crazy to me
has it has it hurt as it her business
it's hard to tell my business is fine it
would that we feature was released a
year ago the main reading list feature
and then you know we'll see the summer
when they release the offline version of
it it's hard to tell i mean the reality
is that's only useful if you use safari
everywhere right and only about a third
of my customers do well you're using
mobile everybody's mobile safari right
but i think that the desktop sinking
part is very important I mean there are
a lot of people who will get and save
the links on their iOS devices right but
there's also a lot who were doing what
the way I originally made it which was
you save it on a computer and then you
go read on your device's later
so so on the topic of instapaper there's
been a lot of controversy about your if
I want to call it allegiance to iOS but
you you have not you won't make an
Android application let me just say I'm
going to say it bluntly yeah and you
even you even had this like challenge
which was somebody makes I want to make
sure I get this right it's like it's so
misunderstood sag oould Android
instapaper client you'll call it
Instapaper for Android and you'll split
the profits close it was if that what
rivela / that I was linking to made it
it wasn't it wasn't intended to be an
open challenge because i don't like
getting of a challenge the other one of
the use of paper of course for Andrew in
the design world spec work is considered
a very bad word which is the idea I'm
sorry designed so from getting this
wrong the idea is like you kind of put
out a call hey everyone do something you
know work for free and if we like your
thing we'll pick it and we'll pay you
yes you have a whole week people working
for free and most of them just get
nothing out of it I didn't want to do
that I thought that's why I didn't
intend for it to be like a hey everyone
try and whoever gets there first wins it
you know because I don't want people to
waste all their time so this guy didn't
do it I guess yeah it didn't happen what
about anybody else have you looked yeah
why don't you want to just make why why
don't you just make something for
android it means it is so I feel it is
it is in the market in a big way right
that's agreed I totally like literally
half of smart so our blackberries yeah
so you know I mean don't let's not be
don't give me that straw man argument of
course I mean it's a real platform it is
a real platform and it's big no question
but the thing is you know if you are in
the business of trying to get as many
users as possible something like
Instagram that actually makes sense to
spread to Android get as many users you
can usually it's for free some kind of
free service that makes sense tumblr has
to have an android app totally makes
sense but when you're in the business of
selling the app the majority events
papers revenue comes from the app sales
so I'm selling a five-dollar app on iOS
that's pretty expensive on Android
that's probably impossible and
i I don't I buy android apps all the
time and everyone just like you well I
mean there there are people buy an
android app perfect I'm there more
developers make it after a I'm sure
somewhere no I mean there are there
definitely are I've tell you i see i
know people with android phones at buy
apps of course okay i do yeah you know
April but you think that all the other
people who are going one go right for
the verge right I'd like no way I don't
need it well it's not all of them it's a
question of really just economics and
how to allocate limited resources which
is the most limited resource that I have
right now is my time and we every ones
most limited resource you know you I
only have this one awesome version of
the app that I'm really focused on if I
were to take time off and either either
either do an android app myself or pay
someone else a whole bunch of money to
do it that would significantly detract
from my ability to make the iOS app
great and now in the face of ever
increasing competition I can't afford to
let up I have to keep making the iOS app
awesome I mean you're competing with
Apple so you can't really screw it I'm
computing with everyone who doesn't
charge any money right pocket and would
readability yeah Evernote clearly thinks
pool what do you think graves balloon
thing well and which one which one do
you like the best out of all of your
competition I honestly I've seen very
few of them you might want to check them
out yeah I tell you something I mean it
all seriousness I've talked to people in
our industry there are other people that
like yeah I really check out the
competition jon rubinstein from palm
famously was like yeah i haven't really
seen an iphone well that went well yeah
that ever so my CJ this is my from one
man guy friend yeah I've seen the big
ones okay there's a whole bunch of
little ones I've seen the big ones and
are you are you gonna add do you think
you're gonna add features or try to
compete on any of the stuff like pocket
does a bunch of stuff at Instapaper
doesn't I mean it does some things on a
bun it does more things that it does um
no I you know I I highly value
originality and we have to distill have
to distinguish there was that awesome HP
Envy whatever that came out you know we
have to distinguish between usually HP
Envy whatever the you know the computer
they look exactly like a macbook yeah
that thing
yeah that's the a dhp macbook air yeah
you know we we have to distinguish with
originality you know the the problem of
simultaneous invention versus true
originality now it you know I I want to
be the original in many ways of what
ends paper does it is the original and I
I like Apple product as many of them are
very original not all of course but many
and you know I value at a lot i get a
lot of satisfaction out of that and so I
don't want to copy other people's
products or features if it's not
something obvious but I think if it is
something obvious like okay I have a
read later app and if you tap on a link
should it just open or should it offer
you an option to read that link later
you know like that's it once you're
building a read later app that's a
pretty obvious feature right and so if
someone else did that first and then I
copied it later I wouldn't really feel
bad about that so when I look at other
competitors features and you know if
some if a competitor does a feature
before me and I'm getting a lot of
pressure to add it I try to be original
as much as possible in the sense that if
I try to not just copy it directly I try
to you know only do things that only
copy things that I would have come upon
anyway right it that were obvious you're
walking a fine line there or or if I
can't do that if it's something that
someone else just made a really good
point and did this awesome feature there
never would have thought of it I'm like
I really have to implement that to stay
competitive I'll try to do it
differently I'll try to do it like in a
substantially different way somebody has
a grid you'll make like a wheel I had
the grid first okay no you're owning the
greatest way yeah I'll flip or beat
everybody uh you know I I try to be
original so even if I have to copy
someone else's feature i'll try to do it
my own way and so I respect other people
who do that same thing so like I see in
like the pc laptops base or the android
phones bays vs apple and you know other
people i like when android and when
crazy ppt manufacturers come up with
their own solutions to problems like I
respect that even if I don't like their
solution as much I have more respect for
that oh my god i want to have another
separate conversation just a
out like what you don't like about
Android cuz I mean I'm sure there's some
fascination see I haven't used it that
much well there's your problem I'm tired
android is not in my world it's not in
my attention span most days yeah I don't
spend that much time think about it
because thinking about iOS and the
website which even that I barely think
about thinking about the iOS app is a
full-time job right and staying
competitive on the iOS app is a
full-time job all right I'm gonna we
have to wrap unfortunately cuz i have a
bunch more things I want to talk to you
about but I quickly want to know just a
couple of I mean you're obviously very
focused you just talked about being
original and you obviously appreciate
beautiful design what are some apps what
are things that you use every day that
you're like I wish I could have made
this or I'm in awe of this or this is a
beautiful you know really smart design
that I love like what's something free i
madly just like to know well it is it
tough yeah instant i have a long answer
but if we don't time for a long answer
you know design my opinion of design is
very different from what most people my
opinion of design is you know quote
Steve Jobs how it works most people
think design is putting textures and
gradients on everything and so for me
apps that work really well or solve the
probably wealth to me that's great
design so I think a good example that is
Instagram it instagram took mobile it
was basically twitter for photos which
ends up being a really big deal what it
did facebook should have done that the
reason why they bought instagram is
because it freaked them out because it
attacked that one of the biggest things
people use facebook for in an area that
facebook was not doing very well in
addressing instagram solve that problem
so well and by the way the way to use
Instagram I'll give my secret to
everybody never use filters seriously
changes the app makes you a better
photographer unless you're terrible at
photography in which case you'd blend
but you know it but the purpose of the
of Instagram photos is not to look old
it's not to look like you took them took
them isn't it with an SLR and if you did
and import it that's kind of dirty don't
do that people do that I know it's right
they route they take pictures of DSLRs
and then import
hey check out this awesome picture I
took phil schiller did that did he yeah
and then he quit no wonder there he was
a i'm sure i've been shamed into quit it
