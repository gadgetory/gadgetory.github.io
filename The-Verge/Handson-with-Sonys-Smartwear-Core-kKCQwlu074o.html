verge and we were taking a look at the
smart where for just a new device from
Sony shipping in just a couple months
and it's basically you kind of like a
Fitbit you kind of put your pocket and
you can also put into a watch and what's
Sony's showing us here today so yes it's
a bunch of different options you can put
on the device itself is super light you
can't it can almost not feel it in your
hand it kind of disappears in the pocket
but it's got cool things like this
little light meter the lights up it also
charges by what appears to my own USB
sony says this has about a five-day
battery life but that could get
stretched out longer with software
updates it's also waterproof which is
kind of cool so this device will work
with any android phone with 4.3 or above
and bluetooth 4.0 sony says it's going
to cost less than 100 euros when it
ships in the first quarter of this year
it's come the US and Europe there are
also be kits you can buy for between 15
and 20 euros which will give you our
alternate options for watchbands and
like we said before you can also buy
your own custom stuff so again this is a
first quick look at sony's new core
accessory further smart wear collection
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
