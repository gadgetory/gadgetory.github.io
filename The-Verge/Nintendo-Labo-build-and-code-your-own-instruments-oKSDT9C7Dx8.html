oh my god I'm so nervous so this is
Nintendo lab oh it's a new DIY cardboard
accessory kit for the switch and it lets
you make things like a fishing rod or
motorcycle and it comes with its own
corresponding games for it currently
there's two kits on the market there's a
$70 variety kit which comes with five
separate games and there's $80 robot kit
which lets you suit up and punch a bunch
of skyscrapers so you might be asking
yourself why is this cardboard so
expensive aren't I just gonna play with
it once and be done with it and the
answer is no there's this thing called
toy con garage which is like a coding
platform that lets you remix like all
these different games and like basically
make whatever you want with it
Nintendo has actually been putting out
these trailers that show all the
different things you can do with toy con
garage
like full-on tank simulator or a little
device that feeds your pets and they
also showed a little bit of what looked
like a level band I thought this was
really cool and I wanted to try it out
for myself
so I thought of a really simple song I
could play which is Rainbow Connection
how hard could it be
and two days later I am now a shell of a
person let's start with the piano this
is one of the more interesting
complicated pieces of the variety kit
the build guide says it takes about
three hours to build but I think that's
factoring in time that it takes to make
with a child our production manager Meg
who is very much an adult took her about
half the time to make this so the
software makes it really easy to follow
along step by step to build your cart or
toy and one of the best parts is moving
around the camera you can zoom in zoom
out and it'll really help you visualize
the toy in a 3d space you can go
forwards and backwards if you miss a
step and it's really great for kids they
can take their time and learn exactly
what they're doing
if you look at the back here there's
actually little I are stickers place
them each key and when you press a note
it reveals itself to the infrared camera
on the back of the red controller which
you then stick in the back of the piano
like this and then you just put the keys
back in here press a note which will
then make a sound so there's also these
little IR knobs that you can add into
the piano and they each have their own
combination of IR stickers so depending
on which one you put in it'll change the
sound of the toy piano so here's one of
my favorites which is the old man voice
and here's another cute one cat sounds
so this isn't actually gonna like help
us make music but I thought it was
pretty fun so something that is going to
help us make music is this little lever
here which when you press it it changes
the octave or lets you bend the pitch of
a note like this and one of the biggest
challenges of making a lab old band was
choosing a song that was easy enough to
play so I decided to go with Rainbow
Connection which kind of happens mostly
on one octave except for this B note
that I need right here so to do that I'm
going to press this lever with the C
sharp to get a B
so that was a easy part now let's put
this aside to move on to the hard part
which was making the guitar and this had
not come with the variety kit we had to
go and make this on our own
our again our superstar meg she signed
this guitar and made it out of a bunch
of popsicle sticks and it's very much
the kind of DIY that Nintendo is
encouraging
I can imagine I'd be pretty fun to make
this with your kids or really fun for
adults who love arts and crafts this was
the fun part and this next part of
actually programming the chords broke me
so this is toy con garage and basically
how it works is with a series of notes
so let's start with an input which in
our case is a touch box and we're going
to connect that to an output which is
making a sound and you can customize
what kind of sound you want there's
different keys guitar sounds you can
customize how long you want the sound to
be played so I'm gonna go ahead connect
these boxes here and that's what happens
when you touch it so I want to make this
look a little bit more like a guitar and
what you can do is stretch out this
touch bar so it looks more like a string
and you can go ahead and copy these
notes here and then I'm just gonna
figure out exactly what notes are in a G
chord and you can also change the octave
of the keys so I need to make sure all
these octaves are correct for the chord
and I'm not a guitar player so I have to
look up no a G chord I'm doing this
right so actually I don't like that
guitar sound I'm gonna change it to an
acoustic guitar sound
so that was just one G chord and if you
want to play a song like Rainbow
Connection you have to program like six
or seven different chords and I just
want to show you guys what that looks
like on the screen because it was a
nightmare
basically I had to program different
buttons to play a different chord and I
was kind of like running out of space
here so you can see I like cheated a
little bit and made one touch bar play
like six different notes um yeah I took
every brain cell I have to learn how to
do this so this is the programming mode
and now we're gonna go to play mode
which clears the screen and lets you
play without moving any of the notes
around so if I press this button that
place and ecord this is a G chord and
that's a minor so I feel like I'm like
getting the hang of this but I really
think that I probably could have learned
to play a real guitar in the time it
took me to program this on the switch
one two three four
so making a song on the labo is just
scratching the surface of all the things
you can do with Twix on garage Nintendo
lab Oh isn't just about cardboard it's
an experience that's centered around
learning and whatever you decide to do
with it is up to you I decided to make a
song on the level I love it it's my baby
very proud of what I've done maybe like
overly proud but I'm sure like within a
few days the creative community is gonna
be able to come up with some pretty cool
things for it
