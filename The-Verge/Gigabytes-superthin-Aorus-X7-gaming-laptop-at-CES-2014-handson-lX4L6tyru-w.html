and this is the Auris x7 Horus is a new
gaming brand that's launching here at
the show from the same guys who make
gigabyte motherboards and graphics cards
the 17 inch laptop is a company's
flagship product and it is a suitably
ambitious project
unlike most gaming rigs it measures less
than an inch in thickness and is a
relatively spelled 6.4 pounds in weight
that's thanks to an all aluminum
construction plus a cooling system of
five heat pipes to fans and four vents
the x7 doesn't compromise in specs it
comes with two geforce gtx 765 m
graphics cards making in the first GTX
SLI laptop and Intel Haswell processor
up to 32 gigabytes of RAM and a variety
of storage options from a single 128
gigabyte SSD to motor drive options that
take you into terabyte territory
Morecambe eccentric additions include a
killer LAN networking card a backlit
keyboard with minimal latency and a
glass touchpad there's also two HDMI
ports and a mini DisplayPort which could
potentially use to output video to three
external monitors the 17.3 inch screen
is matte it has a 1920 by 1080
resolution it works together with a pair
of subwoofers and two tweeters to
establish the x7s credentials as an
audio-visual powerhouse though this is
still obviously a laptop don't expect
awesome sound I tried out the x7 with
Devil May Cry at 1080p with outro
graphic settings and it was a joy to
behold the display is attractive I
definitely prefer over glossy
alternatives and the frame rate was
buttery smooth started in 2000 $99 and
available at the end of February
euros x7 looks like a good start for
this new company it's certainly one of
the most reasonable looking gaming
laptops that we've seen yet
