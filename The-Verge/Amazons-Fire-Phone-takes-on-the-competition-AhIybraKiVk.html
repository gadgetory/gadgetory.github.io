addition to its hardware lineup in some
ways it's like any other smartphone it
has a 4.7 inch 720p display much like
the Moto X it has a Snapdragon 800
processor just like the HTC One it's 199
dollars on a two-year contract just like
the iphone and just about every other
smartphone on the market but amazon will
throw in a free year of prime it has a
13-megapixel camera which jeff bezos
compared to both the iphone 5s and the
samsung galaxy s5 on specs alone it's a
nice smartphone just like any other
smartphone and it's hardly top of the
line but the fire phone isn't just like
any other smartphone that's why everyone
in today's event got a copy of mr. pines
purple house bezos's favorite children's
book the fire phone is different from
every phone on the block and it's
different in some crazy ways obviously
the most talked about feature of the new
phone has to be its 3d interface amazon
calls a dynamic perspective and it
allows visuals on the display to have
more depth things don't really pop out
but rather move farther in thanks to
four front-facing cameras as well as a
motion sensor the fire phone can
constantly track a user's head and since
its depth in order to redraw images
quickly you can tilt the fire phone in
different directions to see more
information from apps play games resize
images scroll through websites without
using your fingertips and most
impressively move various layers of the
user interface around as though they
were physical objects in front of you
the fire phone also boasts an impressive
camera complete with a 13 megapixel
sensor fast f/2 aperture and optical
image stabilization the phone even has
its own dedicated camera button for
quick and easy access amazon also
expects users to take a lot of photos
that's why the company is offering
unlimited photo and video storage and
Amazon Cloud Drive for free while amazon
has stressed the sound quality of the
fire phone more often than not you'll
probably be using headphones that's why
the fire phone is paired with earbuds
that are supposedly tangle proof with
flat cables and magnetic buds that stick
together and yes it's got a mic and
buttons for playback control and volume
and if this really is the panacea of
tangle-free ear where well amazon will
sell them separately for 2499 no word on
how compatible they'll be with other
devices however the fire phone second
screen feature allows you to fling any
video you're watching from the
display to your Amazon fire TV it's a
clear counter to Apple's AirPlay and
another way to get people more invested
in amazon's hardware ecosystem meanwhile
Amazon's also brought its x-ray feature
from the kindle fire tablets into its
phone letting you click on an actor to
learn more about them from their IMDB
page by the way amazon also owns a TV
finally amazon's ASAP feature attempts
to predict what video you'll watch next
on prime instant and pre cashes them for
you so video plays immediately and
choose it Mayday is Amazon's way of
providing help through instant tech
support / video chat 24-7 from the
device itself Mayday was first
introduced late last year with the
kindle fire HDX it works on Wi-Fi and
cellular amazon is trying to create a
seamless experience for its products but
the infomercial like demo video
beforehand drove home one idea using a
phone is really really hard you're going
to need someone to hold your hand
according to AT&amp;amp;T Mobility CEO Ralph de
la vega made a customer service can
offer a quote warm handoff to 18 keith
technical support of course once you
fully enter 18 t's world all bets are
off but the feature that makes the phone
truly an Amazon phone is Firefly it's so
important that it even gets its own
button amazon is always focused on
making its devices a portal into its
online store now that the company has
its hands on your smartphone it's making
access to its story easier than ever
with one press the fire phone boots up
its camera to see what you're seeing and
listen to what you're listening to the
Firefly sees a barcode a button will pop
up allowing you to buy the item on
amazon a Firefly here's a song it'll
prompt you to check it out on Amazon
music or buy tickets on stubhub if
Firefly here's Game of Thrones it will
show you the show's IMDB entry and then
of course offer options to buy or rent
more episodes on Amazon the service
recognises 100 million items and
purchasing them happens with just a
simple tap but while the fire phone is
unique sometimes that isn't for the
better there's no Bluetooth Low Energy
support which means some wearables won't
work the fire phone runs on a fork
version of Android which means it
doesn't have google apps like Gmail and
it doesn't have the Android Play Store
Amazon zone App Store has over 240,000
apps but that's just a sliver of what
Android or iPhone app stores have as
with kindle fire and fire TV this phone
is first and foremost a portal to amazon
services and especially its store
remember every picture is one click away
for
being an online order with free two-day
shipping</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
