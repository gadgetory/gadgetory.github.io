reporting from CES and we're taking a
look at misfits newest wearable this is
called the misfit ray and the first
thing you're gonna notice about the Ray
if you're familiar with misfits other
activity trackers is that it doesn't
have a circular design this was misfits
first kind of tubular design here and it
was made this way so that it could sit
next to other devices on the wrist like
a wristwatch or a SmartWatch and
basically sit flush against it and you
wouldn't have to wear two things that
have a circular design or a larger
display on your wrist so this is really
meant to be kind of an accessory
activity tracker that's always been
misfits value proposition and now that
the company is a part of fossil they're
probably gonna be making a lot more
stuff that's in this Fame all right so
let's talk about what this thing
actually does like a lot of other misfit
trackers it will track your daily
activity levels it'll track your steps
it will track distances doesn't have GPS
but it uses an accelerometer to track
distances and it will track your sleep
shares all that data to Misfits mobile
app it also works with misfit link which
is Misfits separate app for basically
controlling a bunch of different stuff
in the home smart home products light
bulbs music that kind of thing and it
integrates with the IFFT app so that you
can basically program this thing to say
you tap it and you want it to do
something it will do that through the
IFFT and integration this little LED
light here is is a Misfits notification
system basically misfit doesn't use
displays and so this is the way that you
get notifications from your smartphone
it also tells you your activity levels
if you tap it
and they don't wanna flash this twice
you've maybe you're halfway to your
activity goal if you tap it and flashes
four times closer to your daily activity
goal and then it's basically programmed
to show you different colors for
different types of notifications battery
life is always a big thing with
wearables and misfits value proposition
has always been and we go long on
battery life they use coin cell
batteries
this has three button cell batteries
that should get you about six months the
misfit race ships in March of this year
and this version will cost $99 basically
a hundred dollars this is a sport band
it's a rubber band so it's a little bit
less fancy than a couple other models
you can also buy one with a leather band
for a hundred and twenty dollars so that
is the misfit ray in a lot of ways it's
kind of your standard commodity activity
tracker in terms of what it can do and
what it senses and all that stuff but
missed us trying to make something
that's a little bit more fashionable
than maybe some of the other activity
trackers on the market with the idea
that if it's not fashionable you're not
going to wear it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
