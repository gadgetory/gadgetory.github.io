we are looking at the samsung galaxy s
blaze 4g on t-mobile which is a device
that is the spittin image of a
blackberry bold 9790 it looks almost
identical to a blackberry from the back
but it is kind of a throwback Android
device its galaxy s device it's even got
an external microSD card slot but this
phone primarily exists as a showcase for
t-mobile's advanced hspa+ network which
is theoretically capable of downloading
a 42 megabits in my testing of course I
never came anywhere near that and
neither will you but I was getting you
know regularly you know 1415 down and
pushing around four megabits up which is
as good as I've ever seen on HSPA device
and I'm just really impressed with the
download speeds when I've got good t
mobile signal which unfortunately isn't
that often the screen is only 800 x 480
and it is a super amoled screen which
means it's a pentile matrix so text
isn't that Chris but color fidelity is
great the colors are really crisp and
vibrant really happy with that in terms
of performance it's actually a much
better than I expected it has a dual
core Qualcomm s3 processor clocked at
1.5 gigahertz and that is also another
change from the other galaxy s devices
from you know the year and a half ago
but you know as you can see here on the
web browser it actually manages to
scroll much better than I expected based
on just a you know dual core processor
really pleased with that and throughout
the device the snappiness was quite good
this unfortunately is running Android
2.3 point 6 not ice cream sandwich and
obviously I'm very displeased with that
it's also running Samsung's custom skin
the TouchWiz skin which you know it's
bright and colourful which matches with
this AMOLED screen but it's a little bit
garish to my tastes otherwise though I
don't really have any major complaints
about Samsung's skin it seems relatively
snappy doesn't seem to slow the phone
down however you start to run into
problems as you're seeing here with what
t-mobile has done with the device so
Samsung wanted to include
the software but it needed to make it
download so you had to go to unknown
sources it's just a terrible user
experience what's worse is that t-mobile
has laden this phone with just a huge
amount of crap where apps there's
antivirus apps there's two or three
different custom storefronts to download
apps there's custom t mobile apps for
tracking your family for a calendar and
a whole bunch of other junk that's mixed
in with actually good apps like Netflix
and Google Music and zinnia so it's a
pretty decent phone for 149 99 on
contract but all that crap software
makes it hard to recommend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
