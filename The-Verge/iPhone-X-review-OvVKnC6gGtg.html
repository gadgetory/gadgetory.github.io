every year we say the new iPhone is the
best iPhone but this really is the best
iPhone ever made now we've been waiting
for this phone for a long time now Apple
says it's complete reimagining of what
the iPhone can be and there's a lot of
major changes here Apple's gotten rid of
the home button there's no more
fingerprint sensor there's an OLED
screen the first on an Apple phone you
unlock it just by looking at it there's
all kinds of new gestures from
navigating there are some big bets here
on the future of the iPhone and a lot of
unanswered questions earlier this week
we published a video said send us your
questions you sent us a ton of those
questions and I think we can answer them
all in this review we got a lot of
questions about the design in the
display so let's start there first
there's the knotch but there it is
there's no getting around it there's no
point in pretending it's not there but
I'm gonna tell you that after a few days
it's fine it's not great but especially
in portrait you just learn to ignore it
it's a definitely annoying and landscape
though especially when you're watching
the video if you zoom the notch will
definitely cut into the side of what
you're watching and I don't love
browsing the web and landscape either
the notch is just right there this is a
phone designed to be used in portrait
you'll also notice the large black
border around the display which is
pretty polarizing a lot of people I show
the phone to hated it but I actually
think it makes the bright colors of the
display pump it's a very different
design decision than samsung curving the
screen to eliminate the bezel Apple's
highlighting what little bezels remain
Apple gave us the white and silver model
of the iPhone 10 to review and although
Apple says the band on the outside is
better than surgical grade stainless
steel mine already has scratches and
dings and all we've really done with it
is take photos and videos of it so I
wouldn't expect this phone to remain
flawless if you don't have a case aside
from the removal of the home button and
a larger screen the rest of the iPhone
10 looks a lot like the iPhone 8 there's
the mute switch and volume buttons on
the left the sleep/wake button on the
right and a glass back with a camera
bump the camera bump is huge
it's actually bigger than the bump on
the eight plus on a smaller body so
there's just no getting around it
Apple leaned into it and try to make it
a design element which you will either
love or hate it's kind of grown on me
though and
of course there's no headphone jack
which sucks on every single phone that
emits it so notch a side of the screen
is great
Apple is using a 5.8 inch samsung
manufactured OLED display which it says
a custom design for the iPhone 10 it's a
bigger number than the iPhone 8 plus is
5.5 inch display but it's a taller
thinner aspect ratio so it's actually
not as big and there's no tabs in Safari
or other plus iPhone features here it's
definitely more of a bigger iPhone 8
than a smaller 8 plus and that's exactly
what it feels like in your hand it's
like when Apple moved from the iPhone 4
to the 5 the display basically just got
taller in fact when you run apps that
aren't optimized to the iPhone 10 they
run with huge software vessels and the
whole thing just looks exactly like an
iPhone 8 to answer this question about
differences between Samsung's AMOLED and
LG's Peola and Apple's OLED these are
actually just marketing terms the
fundamental construction of OLED screens
is basically the same although there are
clear quality differences between them
and I have to say that the iPhone 10 is
at the top of the class when it comes to
quality I keep saying the iPhone LCD is
the best and most accurate phone screen
out there and the iPhone 10 looks just
as good if not better
it's way brighter it's super vibrant and
it basically looks like pixels directly
under your fingers it doesn't have a
crazy neon colors of Samsung phones iOS
just does better color management than
Android which is just starting to do it
and I think you can see it here the
display uses a diamond pentile pixel
layout which means every pixel on the
screen shares red green and blue sub
pixels with the other pixels around it
that's different than like the iPhone
LCD which has dedicated RGB sub pixels
for every pixel on the screen now a lot
of people don't like pentile screens and
to be honest I have not liked them in
the past either but you can't really
tell with the iPhone 10 unless you're
using a really tight macro lens which of
course we did Apple says it's doing a
bunch of custom anti-aliasing and
sub-pixel rendering to make this display
work better than other Samsung pentile
LEDs and honestly it shows the screen
really does just look great
looking at the iPhone 10 side-by-side
with the iPhone 8 i think the 10 is
noticeably cooler and it's a little bit
softer which I think it makes
slightly easier to read text especially
for a long time check this out though
turning on apples true tone color
calibration on both phones doesn't make
them look the same which it should
I asked Apple about this and they told
me the 10 has a tension alight sensor
and the 8 only has a four-channel sensor
so the 10 is more accurate I still think
it's pretty strange how different they
are though
the screen isn't perfect every OLED
screen shifts colors off axis and the
iPhone 10 is no exception
it definitely gets bluer if you tilt the
phone back and forth along either axis
but it's nothing like the pixel to excel
which goes blue if you just shift the
phone in your hand a little bit it's one
of those things that doesn't leave out
at you but you'll notice it if you're
looking for it a lot of you asked us
about burnin and I haven't seen it yet
but it's early so I asked Apple about it
and they told me that they've also done
a ton of work with the screen and the
operating system to limit burnin every
OLED screen eventually does suffer
burnin though so we're just going to
wait and see if the iPhone 10 really is
better than the competition by far the
most questions we got were about face ID
and I'm just gonna answer this one
upfront you don't have to use it you can
just leave it off and enter a passcode
but I think you're gonna want to use it
because most of the time it works great
it really does just work you look at
your phone it unlocks there are a couple
of times when it doesn't work just great
and you're gonna have to adjust to make
it work better but I don't think it's
actually that big of a deal you just
have to get used to the change you can
point a cheap camcorder with night
vision a face ID to see it working and
it's pretty awesome when you do the
iPhone 10 has an IR light adopt
projector and an IR camera all tucked
into that notch at the top of the screen
when you wake up the phone the IR light
goes off and if the IR camera sees a
face the dot projector flashes a pattern
of 30,000 dots the camera then takes a
2d photo which gets turned into a
mathematical depth model which is sent
to the secure Enclave on the a11 chip
and matched against the stored value and
if it matches you're in this all happens
really fast all of this means that face
ID works just fine in the dark it's
shining its own little IR flashlight on
you that little flashlight is the
blinking light a lot of you asked about
in our previous videos which you
actually can't see our camera sensors
just pick it up when you're using the
phone face 80 checks to see if you're
paying attention every so often which is
what blinks that IR
if you're not paying attention the phone
aggressively dims the screen and
eventually goes to sleep to save the
battery it's a neat trick now there are
some situations where it doesn't unlock
in our preview video I had some problems
walking around and bright sunlight and
under some fluorescent lights and a lot
of you pointed out that I was holding my
phone kind of far away from myself as I
walk around which is how I normally hold
my phone and it turns out you might be
right
I asked Apple about it and they said the
optimal distance for a face idea to work
is 25 to 50 centimeters or about 10 to
20 inches and that's a little bit closer
than I normally hold my thumb here I
actually have a measuring tape here
which is great and we can just take a
look so here's that here's twenties and
this is definitely a little bit closer
than where I normally hold the phone and
when I'm lying down in bed or on the
couch I actually hold my phone a little
bit closer than 10 inches normally and
face any struggles so you have to adjust
how you're gonna hold the phone where
you're holding the phone to make it work
better you also have to look at it
pretty directly which means unlocking
while the phone is sitting on a table is
out unless you look over the phone we
got a bunch of questions about face
eighty privacy but I don't think there's
much to be worried about there
face it II never really takes or stores
a photo of your face the regular front
camera is only used during setup so you
can see yourself the IR photo is just
used to generate the depth map that's
compared to the stored value and nothing
ever gets sent to Apple it's just a
bunch of numbers stored in the secure
part of the processor now obviously
every system can be hacked but you
shouldn't worry about a bunch of photos
of your face being sent to iCloud or
whatever it's just not how it's designed
if you weren't worried about touch ID
you probably shouldn't worry about face
I mean a lot of you also asked about how
fast face ID is and the answer is that
it varies most the time in normal
lighting conditions it's so fast
that it's almost like not having a
passcode on your phone you pick up the
phone swipe up and you're in just like
the old swipe to unlock days but other
times it takes a second again I think
that's mostly under different lighting
conditions it's basically the same
amount of irritation as a fingerprint
scanner sometimes your fingers are wet
and you have to enter the passcode and
sometimes the lights weird and you have
to move the phone closer to your face
and wait a second
fine the one thing I will add about face
ID is that it makes it way harder to
discreetly check the phone when you're
talking to someone I pulled out my
iPhone 8 and just put my thumb on the
sensor all the time to check a
notification with face ID you have to
really look at the phone which makes it
obvious you're not looking at the person
we're all just gonna have to get used to
this you can also use face ID for Apple
pay and it's pretty easy you just double
click the side button authenticate and
then hold the phone to the reader to me
it actually makes more sense than touch
ID because you're actively turning Apple
pay on instead of just waving your phone
at the card reader and hoping it works I
think it's pretty nice once you look at
that new screen and unlock the iPhone 10
with your face well you're using iOS
Apple told me they didn't want to make
any drastic changes the main iOS
experience because they thought the
removal of the home button was enough
you're gonna have to learn a whole bunch
of new gestures just to navigate this
phone we got a lot of questions about
those gestures too and once you get used
to swiping up to unlock the phone it's
easy to get used to swiping up to go
back to the home screen you have to
swipe from the bottom so if you're
playing temple run or something and you
swipe from the middle you're gonna be
fine
I haven't accidentally swiped to go home
yet if you want to switch apps you have
to swipe along the bottom of the screen
or swipe up and hold you'll get a little
haptic bump in the app switcher will
show up it took me a minute to figure
out how to do that move consistently and
a little bit longer to figure out how to
consistently use reach ability actually
lots of you asked about reach ability
which is the feature on iPhones that
brings the top of the screen down to
make one-handed usage easier I use it
all of the time on my 8 plus and it's
still here only now you swipe down about
halfway up the icon dock from the home
indicator I couldn't get this to work at
all and then something finally clicked
and I sort of figured it out but I'm
definitely still not perfect at it I
think it's just gonna take some time to
learn once you've brought the UI down
you can swipe on either top corner to
open a Notification Center or the
control center which is nice
I asked Apple Way Notification Center is
a sheet and Control Center is an overlay
and they told me that it's philosophical
Control Center is supposed to be an
always there widget and Notification
Center is supposed to be another screen
that slides down whatever it is I think
it looks really messy to have two
different interface patterns for the
same action at the top of the screen and
I really hope Apple just cleans it up
since there's no home button you open
Siri by holding
side button Siri is still Siri which
means it's still not great but there it
is you take a screenshot by holding the
top volume button in the side button
together and you turn the phone off by
holding either volume button in the side
button and then swiping to power off
it sounds complicated but it's pretty
easy to figure screen shots don't have
the knotch just a big blank space where
the notch is on the phone and that's a
pretty good metaphor for the screen in
general there's a lot of extra space at
the top and generally a lot of extra
space at the bottom which means the
usable area of apps is way closer to the
iPhone 8 than you'd expect
in fact apps that aren't optimized to
the iPhone 10 run with giant software
bezels that basically make the phone
look like an iPhone 8 you'll run into a
lot of unoptimized apps if you buy this
thing right away Gmail Google Calendar
Spotify and more all run with software
bezels apple says it's helping app
developers update and the tools make
updating for the 10 a lot easier than
the previous cycle for the iPhone 6 side
screens but we'll just see how it goes I
think a lot of big apps will update
quickly more will trickle out over the
next year and then there's just gonna be
lots to take forever Delta took like 2
years to update for the iPhone 6 let's
hurry that up people you won't find a
lot of big new ideas about iOS here and
if you spend a lot of time and
unoptimized apps for work like Google
Docs and Trello like I do it's a lot
like using an iPhone 8 I really want
Apple to make notifications more
powerful I would love to see some more
customizability on a home screen and I'd
love love to be able to set new default
apps for mail and web browsing I'd also
love for the overall design to be more
fun years after iOS 7 everything still
feels pretty stark and brutal compared
to the increasingly whimsical version of
Android that Google's putting on the
pixel you know it is fun though an emoji
we got a lot of questions and comments
about this too and I completely stand by
saying they're the best feature of the
iPhone 10 in the preview video they are
a joy they work great and everyone I
showed them to loves them an emoji work
by lighting up the true death IR camera
and dot projector but it's not nearly as
hardcore as face ID there's no depth map
or security stuff it's just motion
tracking 50 muscle groups on whatever
face it sees the only time it doesn't
work great is when you try to wink and
Apple told me they know about this and
suggested it might get better over time
whatever I love an emoji and I'm
afraid to say it in the form of this
talking the monkey now that we have the
iPhone 10 and the Google pixel - we're
gonna do a super in-depth camera
comparison video but here's what I can
tell you right now the iPhone 10 has
basically the same cameras as the iPhone
8 and the photos look almost exactly the
same and I tend to prefer the photos
from the pixel to the back of the iPhone
10 has two optically stabilized 12
megapixel cameras one with an F 1.8
wide-angle lens and the other with an F
2.4 telephoto that's an upgrade from the
8 Plus which has an F 2.8 non stabilized
telephoto lens that stabilized tele lens
is great these are probably the best
assume photos I've ever taken on a phone
the two rear cameras allow for portrait
mode which works as well as portrait
mode on the 8 plus and also supports
portrait lighting the front camera
supports portrait mode and portrait
lighting but Eiling is very good regular
photos from the iPhone 10 are fine and
some of them are even great but I think
the pixel 2 takes more evocative photos
with better contrast the iPhones dual
rear cameras definitely produce better
portrait mode photos in the pixel and
the pixel definitely produces better
portrait photos from the front camera
and I don't think the Samsung Galaxy
Note 8 holds a candle to either the
iPhone 10 of the pixel - all in all
these are both excellent cameras and it
really comes down to personal preference
and how much you value that zoom lens I
think I prefer the pixel twos cameras
which just seemed to produce absolute
winners more often but like I said we'll
be doing a deep dive video with these
cameras soon apple says the iPhone 10
should get 2 hours more battery life
than the iPhone 7 and while it's been
pretty hard to test this week while
we've been running the screen in cameras
Full Tilt for this video I've been
pretty impressed OLED screens generally
draw less power than LCDs and I got
great battery life with the iPhone 8
which shares the most the same
components as the 10 so just based on
what I've seen this week and based on
what I know from the iPhone 8 I would
expect to go about a full day with the
iPhone just like the iPhone 8 the iPhone
10 supports qi wireless charging which
means if you have a car like this BMW m5
50 you can just drop it on the pad and
will charge up while you go this car
also supports a wireless carplay it's
one of the first on the market to
support the new feature in iOS 11 which
lets you connect to carplay without
plugging in a cable so all you got to do
turn on the car you can drop it on the
pad down here
the wireless charging light is up in
just a second
carplay shows up that is the dream I've
been wanting that to happen in the car
since the first day I ever got a phone
it is so awesome when it works it works
great in this car I will say getting it
out of this spot sucks and BMW should
definitely work on that but I will take
it so that's the iPhone 10 it's a great
phone it's probably the best iPhone ever
made it's thin its powerful it's
beautiful it's full of really
interesting ideas well all these cameras
on a phone are supposed to do I think
the OLED display looks great but it's
still an iPhone it runs iOS 11 pretty
much the same as an iPhone 8 or even an
iPhone 7 serious still Siri
notifications are still pretty basic my
message is still a beautiful prison if
you know what you're getting into with
iOS 11 and you like it
you're probably gonna love the iPhone 10
so the most important question we got
was whether the iPhone 10 is worth $1000
it's the most expensive iPhone ever made
and I don't think there's an easy answer
to that question if you love iPhones and
you've got the money you should buy this
phone I think you're gonna be really
really happy but if you're on the fence
at all it might be worth waiting with
the iPhone 8 or the eight plus you'll
still get most of all the same features
and just won't get an emoji and you'll
get to wait out app developers
optimizing all their software for these
screens which is gonna take a while in a
couple of years every iPhone is gonna
look like the iPhone 10 and you'll be
able to jump right in in the meantime
the rest of us will be using an emoji
okay bunch more questions wouldn't red
gets them all is force touch till in the
iPhone 10 call 3d touch and yes can you
use two Bluetooth speakers at the same
time
Samsung that's to do it's part of
Bluetooth five Apple doesn't seem to
support it just keeping apps over the
homescreen make the OLED display burn in
faster why is their home screen open all
the time
lastly Howser do X iOS 11 has been
pretty janky in the past few years I
also live in a stolen car Jackie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
