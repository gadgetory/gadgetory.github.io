saying hello in Reverse this is first
I'm Josh Topolsky i'm ross miller and
this is first okay ya know that we
practical over and over and over again
you really enjoyed it this time I really
did gave you what you were looking for
it's a clear sign I haven't slept in two
it's obvious that you are having
problems anyhow this is a this is first
it's our last verse first last that is
it doesn't salute him I'll allow it this
morning but ultimately not does that
doesn't make any sense that's a clear
sign you're all sorry it's our last
first of CES this is a the show still
going on yes but it's really starting to
wind down a bit now tomorrow is the last
official day of CES right it's also a
half day really everyone still setting
down as soon as they can if we attempted
to do first tomorrow a forklift would
would actually finally yes truly drive
through the set it wouldn't it would no
longer be a joke video your doctor we've
been talking about that it sounds like
forklifts are going to drive to the
seven it would actually happy happening
cuz they be deconstructed but there's
still stuff talking about em we we
actually have a special guest today Paul
pew from frog design you guys probably
know you if you don't know frog design
by name you know frog design because
they are responsible for some of the
most infamous all right it's name is
designed in hardware and some really
great software as well stuff like the
next cube the Apple Snow White designs
anyhow we're gonna be talking about
design where it's going where it's gonna
be going in the next few years and so
that should be interesting and he's also
very close to me right now and I'm is
this cool this is an intro working for
you okay good you're 50 says but first
let's get to the head loss spread lies
but first we've had some headlines Ross
right so I've jam into it a lot of the
big news this week are live in news
today rather I did not come from CS
directly today Microsoft or yesterday
rather microsoft announced illumiroom
it's a project they're working on with
our good friend Andy Wilson bloomer
illumiroom not illumiroom not a loop is
I when I for somebody first said this to
me i thought it was related to the Lumia
but it's not know this out this is due
all right so basically what they do is
they have a kinect sensor that's
detecting basically mapping out where
your furniture is and from there it
knows accurately how you can basically
extend the screen vision with projector
Wow beyond the television this is insane
I've not seen this video yet I told
people told me about it yesterday this
is truly outrageous this is really
awesome no it's just actual footage I
mean I know they're doing some effect
their but is none of this stuff that's
not actual footage we're not we're not
until I sure yet they say this is actual
footage or really close to what its
gonna be like I'm sorry I have to leave
I've got to go they found me my people
need me well that were that or I'm a
hero okay the hero or the villain doors
our victim the clay out there something
looks like completely insane yes
detective so yeah our good friend andy
wilson who on the verge did a lot of
crazy projector stuff clearly he's still
done we saw any wilson he was projecting
onto my back and now he's projecting I
directly into my world yes that doesn't
uh anyway we don't we don't know how
accurate this video is just yet yeah
they're not showing it off here they
just wanted to announce it here is this
do you think this could be new new xbox
stuff like this is like a new you know
you saw connected now we've got this
next thing that is part of the next Xbox
experience it is and it isn't what I'm
interested in if it's actually sitting
to the screen the Kinect sensors gonna
have to be behind you looking at the TV
is that where it is it's it's behind you
know they have a connect in the living I
thought it's a connect facing forward
and then you've got the projector behind
you right but how is the how is the
kinect mapping the room that I can't see
um you know it's just really good it's
just that it has it got it finally got a
google maps app anyway we won't over
sure we will find out in April they're
doing a conference in Paris one person
laughter that okay yeah we have a what
else okay know what else this is
entirely not really to see us but I had
to talk about it arrested development is
coming back all 49 we do is coming back
we knew was coming back now we know how
many episodes in exists that women yeah
and we know that just like they did with
the other series it's all coming back at
one time yeah so Mitchell whore away the
entire thing all at once every so i can
literally just sit down for on a
saturday and just jam through it yeah
the day comes out oh my god everything
so this is gonna be netflix is going to
go down again what's gonna happen it's
gonna be like christmas the exact moment
no everybody's gonna hit play and then
they'll realize what they've made a
terrible mistake no it's interesting
because the you know we talked about how
TV is very good credit for that huh uh
I'm just moving on uh isn't cuz we
talked about how like um oh yeah no no I
don't think it'd take me okay I don't
know I I don't want to hurt your finger
point all right fourteen episodes um
there's something of a chronology to it
but mitchell hurwitz said a press tour
it doesn't have you watched an order
there's not so much consistency the only
character that's in every episode is
Jason Bateman's character otherwise
they're kind of self-contained with a
little bit of order if you want to watch
them that way see that makes me worried
really that makes me feel like they did
something I don't know geared for for
budgetary reasons or don't think budget
wasn't concerned netflix have been
pushing appointing a lot of money from a
not maybe they were gonna make a movie
or they not making the movie I don't
think they're making the movie unless
they're not talking about i think they
basically took the movie concept be put
in till I got arrested well is that it
was you know it had a fairly good
balance of serialized in episodic you
know there was a story right and that
evolved there's a story that of all I'm
worried that you know I would expect in
the next season that you would get to
see the evolution and maybe the
conclusion of some of those storylines
maybe I'm putting it maybe I invested
too much in the narrative I think your
recipe oh this isn't lost anything I
just want to know like I don't know what
does it have smoke monster which
ultimately in the hatch it's I think I
know sirs I know there was stuff there
but I think there's something else that
we didn't see it I need to know what it
is it's an illusion I am tired that I
was I'm so sorry so water so you're very
excited about that why I'm enjoying that
give me one thing
anyway the last story of the day is Hulu
and this comes from you actually this
comes your supersession lazy through
this argue the future to return of the
future yeah so you talked to by the way
so we did we did a super session
yesterday with Andy for cell from hulu
eric chang from Lytro walt mossberg and
neil i was on it and me so 33 angry
journalists and two poor guys who had to
talk to them and it was actually really
interested it was called argue the
future to return of the future but for
some reason right before we went on i
was convinced it was our subtitles
revenge of the future which i think is
actually better i got her name now that
i think of it i believe i pitched the
name revenge of the future and everybody
shot me down so you had you an actual
george lucas moment cuz it's like a
return attended exactly I know I now
know exactly how George Lucas feels in
every conceivable way except the part
where he's filthy stinking rich and can
own no no that large chunk of san
francisco and i also have known you felt
i also have a large ranch where i
produced films and in cool of graphics
that's nice anyway let's get to the
story uh so you talked to andy forssell
he's a senior vice president of hulu is
e the possible future president of hulu
I mean that's the that's the there's a
rumor going rumor that I mean he's got a
he's got a CEO swagger certainly you
know he's got I mean he's a really smart
guy I need that he's making
announcements that you would think a
president would make he was basically
saying we're we as a company i'm
reducing the number of ads this was
actually surprised we started talking
about it and i think i mentioned it i
made some joke about while I pay for
service and i also get ads and then Walt
said and you know I more ads lately and
I and I would agree one hundred percent
in fact i recently timed the ads and it
was almost the same amount of ads that
you would get on a standard viewing of a
show on television right which would be
you know then it's like well why don't i
just DVR you know some of these things
that have watch on it what I mean like
you don't think of course there's but
but so the heat said we actually we
added ads and we've reduced them in
January based on
user feedback right which is uh you know
new was news to me yeah and they also
said later that they're gonna gradually
reduce them more even more in the coming
months yeah so there should be one at
just be a six-minute out and it's gonna
be actually during the the show so next
time you try to watch I don't know
Project Runway oh no that's actually a
giant ad anyway I don't know what is
what if what if you'll watch the 30 rock
30 rock yeah before that goes off there
it's gonna be one in ten outside Detroit
sis is not leaving Laura but seven Neil
parks and recreation all right that's
right anyhow but I thought that was
interesting are you gonna throw that
it's somebody yeah I thought that was
really interesting point and we actually
have we have a clip we have a clip and
when we're done correct me if I'm wrong
but when we're done with the clip Paul
pew will be sitting here I will
materialize you're going to be you're
gonna be materialized only team and he's
going to materialize and we'll be
talking to him about where design is
headed which I'm excited about but but
take a look at this and we will be right
back the TV looks better than it has
ever looked before there is there are
more channels than ever do consumer our
consumers actually I know we talked
about cord cutters and that's a thing
and I think you talked to Ari Emanuel
and he he said there aren't cord cutters
and you use no but here's here's that if
I could just anticipate what I think you
shouldn't go everywhere I think I think
there are cord cutters here's one I
think there are fewer of them then we
might have expected for five years ago
because because the cable companies have
been good at holding on to what they
have yeah they've been good at holding
on to it and I think this whole rights
world Danny was talking about has hurt
the efforts to do better more integrated
over the top services that make the TV
more attractive and easier to use and
all that kind of stuff but I think
there's something that this is what I
was talking to Ari Emanuel about or
trying to talk to him about which was
there something called cable Nevers
right and this is the most dangerous
thing if I'm Brian Roberts Brian Roberts
that being the head of calm
yes I have I have two sons who were once
married ones not there they're both
around 30 my youngest son would go
without food before he wouldn't have
internet right he has to have internet
but he would never go without anything
to buy a cable subscription he doesn't
have a cable his entire case he never
would and he never will and I think that
that cord Nevers combined with even the
people who buy the cable thinking to
themselves this is secondary to what I
see on the internet or where I get
distributed online that is the biggest
danger of the cable entry and I think
that's why they're gonna be pushed to
make but luckily do you love you Lee
that you see more kind of like deal flow
because they know I mean that would be
well I guess I'd say I think the cable
satellite telco are having to pay more
close attention to consumers than ever
before and that's a good thing I mean
they're you eyes are slowly getting
better too slow but but slowly they're
better if you if you look three or four
years ago they're wildly better it's
still not enough I think I think they're
worried about that and I think they're
they know they're gonna have to do some
repackaging but they look at
multi-channel subs and they've hung in
around 100 million homes and it wavers a
little bit but it hasn't hasn't dropped
so they're all looking at the cord
Nevers they're all doing a bunch of
research but so far it hasn't hit the
bottom line and I don't think they're
going to anticipate that and start doing
things differently so i think it's gonna
be slow
our guest today is a guy that I've
actually want to talk to you for a while
we traded some emails uh he's he works
it to frog he is the hang on a second a
VP of creative software innovation is
that right that's something around there
welcome Paul Pia thanks for coming to
the show rabun appreciate you being up
this early oh yeah because it's it it's
happening to bed early dude do you
normally get up early early early early
riser yeah yeah so so frog I mentioned
this in the in the in the intro but frog
has been a company that historically has
just created some of the most innovative
and interesting designs I think I think
frog is really best on I mean you're a
software guy but when you think a frog
you do think of the hardware stuff Apple
to see Mac to next cube the snow white
design language which I think we have
some images of if you guys haven't seen
these you definitely should yeah here's
some of these are some rototiller putte
types of a phone here way before the
iphone obviously these are and these are
designed by a heart been a singer that's
right yeah and this stuff we actually
just ran some of these photos these are
prototypes these are obviously never
came to to the market but just some
really out there design me even now I
mean these are from when the eighties
right even now you look at you think
this is just wildly inventive but you
also worked on the nokia n9 that's right
for i worked on the n9 i think we got a
few shots of that as well and more
recently there it is and more recently
the sharp feel feel you act that's right
now we actually did a big piece of this
is only in Japan but it's a fully skin
full of full skin for Android that's
right guys pretty much touched
everything here so you know actually I
let's talk about that for a second what
is your take on I mean obviously you're
familiar with with the stock or Android
interface which I think has gotten
pretty good ya know pretty greedy i
think it's i think it's really good now
i mean the question i was always like
why why you go down this road like why
would om decide to customize it i think
that it's very difficult to distinguish
your handset in this market
if you go to the floor at the show it's
just overwhelming you know how did how
many handsets there are how little
differentiation there is we know they're
all slapped essentially I mean do you
think that consumers and maybe it's
different Japan and I certainly can't
speak for the japanese market but i do
you feel consumers go into a store and
they look at the the five android phones
and they do they are looking for the
software difference between them no well
a couple of these it's not five it's
like 15 right okay even like you go to
18 tea store or verizon store there's a
lot of handsets and they're all kind of
like shiny black hardware and you know
the like when you when you touch them
you're like that this experiences are
pretty similar right so like what's you
know if you either can compete on price
or you can present up something that's a
unique experience to them and and so
like I think android it meets you know
most of those needs but there are still
needs that users have we did research
that found you know that there was
opportunity to really do more with the
lock screen for example right and the
users would you know like respond to
that they connect to that those features
and then hopefully they decide to buy
that phone based on that and and it's
not so much about you know like what
Android wasn't doing from a platform
strategy or google strategy just really
trying to find those things that users
are going to see the say you know i want
that right i'd be really enthused around
that having that on my mama device I
Android is still not nearly as
approachable something like iOS I think
there is that for a consumer there is
that barrier right where you just don't
know everything that it does or you
don't know how to get it to do
everything you want it to do you know
and and so that makes sense to you I
just think it's a balance king Pope
sorry guys gonna say there's kind of an
interesting intersection I think with
that moment where we're with Android
it's still you know like it's it's still
difficult to distinguish the handsets
and I think also both the operators and
the device manufacturers are really
looking for opportunities to to be able
to shape that a no more that customer
experience so you see these new
platforms emerging like Tizen and abou
two and Mozilla OS and and some excuse
me Firefox OS x Mozilla that
to actually be more catered towards that
direction right any future do you think
you know and I know that you're focused
on software but is there a lacked as a
seem like you know maybe some of the
software differentiation is coming
because there is no real Hardware
differentiation I mean it feels like
everybody kind of pulling the same parts
off of a line somewhere and with their
slight tweaks right you know like I
think the cycle I mean it's sort of like
you can look at the the Android system
versus the iOS system we mean the Iowa
system kind of is normalized and their
innovation cycle we got a cadence that
you can almost predict the way it's
going to work out you know the name the
way they named the devices and why not
on Android it's you know like it's it's
the cycle is so much shorter and that
differentiation is you know so much more
difficult because of that it's a very
more reactionary and so I think that on
the software side you know there'll be
it's always going to be a balance
probably some handsets it will get
further ahead with customization and
they'll they may pay for that to some
degree because they'll have to there now
to some degree committed to that model
and you know like going back and forth
is the challenge I think so I said I
hate to cut you off i do i think what
you talk about this too or whatever but
we're at i did we only have a few
moments but we're at CES and we are
surrounded by these you know people
making attempts at new user experiences
you know we just saw this this new
microsoft thing which is obviously this
very immersive experience for a user
you've got all these new UI UX ideas
voice control and motion sense and we
saw a bunch of that stuff last year on
TVs where is this headed I mean
obviously we're now starting to get into
the the era of touch as a real part of
our computing lives and in fact probably
the almost all of the future of our at
least the main
in a focal point right for computing and
interaction so what what else is that
what's coming up next I mean what is you
know you're obviously here looking at
what all these people are doing does
anybody getting it right is what I said
anything's gonna actually yeah I mean I
think you know like I was looking at the
samsung voice control TVs and yeah like
I think it's we're making progress I
mean it's still really hard you know
like I think that these technologies are
they're very nascent in their in their
very immature but they're rapidly
evolving but i think it's when we bring
them together then I think they're gonna
be a lot stronger a voice on its own is
is solve some types of interaction
issues but when you add in gestures with
it it is actually much more powerful so
like the sort of a layered interaction
model is what we call it for the you
know the right voice control or the
right natural interface at the right
moment I is is where I think it's going
to be successful also just that the
devices are working together in a much
more holistic way and so it's not you're
not just dependent on on a single device
to make all those things work but that
they're the devices are much more aware
and and able to respond to each other so
I'm looking at how the environments are
around a mobile device are actually
going to start to respond to that device
and how much of that is is the ideas you
know happening and how much of it is our
sensors and our software the actual
hardware what can actually do getting
better I mean is this is it just a
perfect storm right now or or is it is
it that you know we didn't just simply
couldn't do this stuff I think we simply
couldn't do that's do a lot of this
stuff until just recently and I mean I
still think that a lot of the things
that we are imagining that we want to do
are still a few generations of both
processor battery life and things like
that still affect what what we imagine
that will want to be able to do with it
so but you know like the ideas here you
know like you start to see them you like
to start to imagine how they can be sort
of brought together and I mean that's
sort of like the CSS of two to three
years out hope you know that we're
starting rise to the roots of you know
like the big you know the big story here
is like definitely the 4k TVs and the
gigantic TVs I think even saw something
in
ktv like you of course they have to have
a date yeah the 16k you know like it but
like that stuff will start to normalize
and like we'll we'll be able to sort of
bend those big displays to do new things
when the price comes down and that's to
me that's really exciting so so I really
only have time for one more question
this one is kind of I don't know it's a
sort of a rest for you on the spot no
it's not a resident but what is there
something you think out of all the stuff
that we're seeing out of just the stuff
that you may be that you're working on
earth Inca God is there one trend or
type of interaction or type of interface
that we're going to see that you think
will rise above the rest oh no because I
think that I don't think there's one I
mean because it's all about context so
like what what interface is working at
that moment may not work at the next
time with your driving vs. walking it's
a completely different experience but
you know like I there's all those things
like there's a you know I tracking
that's a you know like really
interesting to me as a way to get to be
able to serve the right type of
information there's some interesting
things happening in the automotive space
around eye tracking like to that help
with safety but you but like when the
like I said when the environments become
more aware of what they're expecting us
to do they think the interactions are
going to be pretty amazing so right
alright well thank you so much for
joining us really really appreciate it
and we've got you'll want to check this
out I think you'll enjoy it we've got
some video David and Ross went to the
show floor to see to kind of give you
guys a look at what happens when you
start getting really really tired at CES
and worn down and delusional so check it
out let me see us as if he does this is
only three actually that's my third or
fourth to I didn't need to make a loop
around central hall every 15 feet is a
trash
my god there's nobody be able I don't
like it what is what I've never heard of
heights what does hi sins do ro you're
lost I literally never been more lost my
entire life whoa holy look at that
TV with the glasses on that's bananas
what's the last time you remember the
outside world weeks ago like July I
think I legitimately thought yesterday
was Sunday all day and then looked at my
calendar as I wait it's Tuesday oh
easel this is crazy town I want this so
bad I'm literally wearing through the
bottom of my shoes God this booth is
enormous washing machine or bust now
Furillo this is our best chance to see
like a washing machine what no no this
is not okay what is going on this is
hurting my brain
it's 220 watch
as people know what we look like we look
like two men who are deeply in love with
each other I'm actually happy here this
is like my happy face I mean you can
really tell it starts to wear where are
you down emotionally that's a I'm not
shocking look into into the mind of a
CES journalist yeah I'm not proud but I
wouldn't have it any other way yeah no I
like that I like that a lot and I'm glad
that you guys finally got to you know
really express yourselves on the show we
definitely fell asleep a few times
filming that really just like we were to
sit down and just stare something I like
cuz we're just filming shots like just
stare yeah stare at the sky playing
guitar start this couch cat Sarah this
fake dog yeah uh and they're doing these
back shots not just like you're already
tired I I litter already exact they'll
sleep standing up at least three times
yesterday that's insane um so this is
our I just want to say you know we gotta
wrap up here but this is our and this is
our final first of CES yes uh but what
an incredible uh what incredible four
days it's been it's feels like we've
been I have to say the show's really
matured I remember when we first had
down here it seems like only yesterday
and in fact it was the only four days
ago and technically if you think of all
three days has just been one day it's
one long it's been one long sleepless
day yes but uh really pretty crazy and
we've done do you know many videos we've
done at CES hundreds at this point yeah
it's been hundreds all right yeah I mean
that's the sheer volume I didn't say
everybody who's working on the video
team and putting this stuff together is
insane because i don't know i mean we
were we left last night late and the
video guys were sitting there just heads
down editing we did have this great
argument about how the long videos it
takes a little so long to do anything in
video because you got a process and edit
and there's so many pieces so i think
it's been incredible and I really I'm
glad that we've had some you know ton of
people watching absolutely and and I've
really enjoyed it i want to say I've
enjoyed my time uh
with you as a co-host arco are
co-hosting has been really special I'm
really gonna miss you Josh I'm gonna
miss you yeah because this is it's been
a good run no that's it that was a bad
shake can we get like it it's been a
good runs I've been it's more like it is
that we will just edit that impose any
what to we'll just make that seemed like
we had a smooth let's just let's just
keep this going to keep your shelf later
top shelf later today 90 on 90 merged
