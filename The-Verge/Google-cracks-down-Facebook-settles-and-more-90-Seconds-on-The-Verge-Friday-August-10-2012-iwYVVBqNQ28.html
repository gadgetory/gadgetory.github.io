walrus dan rubenstein from SB Nation and
it's time for 90 locally sourced
artisanal seconds on the verge Google is
set to begin punishing pirates and
search results starting next week the
search engine will down rank sites that
receive a high volume of copyright
infringement notices that means higher
results for Hulu and Spotify and lower
results for torrents and data lockers
like mega upload it's a clear concession
to the movie and music industries who
have long complained that Google
facilitates piracy and Google needs all
the Hollywood love it can get as it
tries to build an ecosystem around
Google Play hot on the heels of serving
Google which biggest fine ever the FTC
has settled its grievances with facebook
facebook will now prominently disclose
any information that might be shared
with third-parties and require users
express consent the company has also
agreed to 20 years of audits by a third
party in exchange for not having to
admit fault after yesterday's Google
fine was criticized for being
ineffective it's good to see the FTC
charge Facebook with absolutely nothing
and finally in news i care about
self-proclaimed legend Usain Bolt took a
break from winning the Olympic 200 meter
dash to dabble in a little bit of
professional photography in the
immediate aftermath of the race bolt
grabbed a Nikon d4 from Swedish
photographer Jimmy wickstrom and
proceeded to snap a first-hand account
of the moment wikstr√∂m newspaper has
posted up a few of bolts images
including our favorite of Jamaican
runner Yohan Blake doing his signature
beast pose which makes bolts victory a
true photo finish and that's it for
today's top stories tune in tomorrow for
the verge after hours</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
