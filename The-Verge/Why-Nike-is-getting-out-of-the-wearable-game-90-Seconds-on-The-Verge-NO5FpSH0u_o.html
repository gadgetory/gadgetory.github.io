wearable towel hit the showers FuelBand
i'm dan seifert and this is 90 seconds
on the verge on Friday Nike confirmed
reports that it is laying off a majority
of the employees in its hardware
division which makes a fuel band line of
fitness trackers as well as the nike+
sportwatch and other peripheral devices
cnet reports that as many as fifty five
people on Nike 70 person Hardware team
were laid off last Thursday the original
fuel band launched in 2012 to ecstatic
consumer demand the Nike was slow to
capitalize on that with few updates the
wearable with the release of products
like the Fitbit flex the FuelBand is no
longer the only player on the court
while Nikes announcement is surprising
as the FuelBand is considered one of the
better fitness trackers out there it
shows that maybe Nike sees a bigger
storm coming with last month's
announcement of Android wear google's
SmartWatch operating system and the
long-rumored apple SmartWatch possibly
coming soon Fitness companies are no
longer the only ones interested in
wearable devices Nike is not a
technology company and it knows that but
it seems perfectly fine playing
assistant coach to the bigger players
while Nike has stated that it will
continue to improve the FuelBand app as
well as continue selling and supporting
the device for the foreseeable future
the possibility of the company releasing
new hardware is slim moving forward Nike
will reportedly shift its focus to
fitness software which other hardware
makers can then integrate into their own
wearables the first wave of Fitness
wearables failed to gain mainstream
adoption however with Apple and Google
expected to step up to the plate the
next round and wearables is about to
begin for more on the Nike FuelBand
check out the verge coming up McDonald's
also announces its getting out of the
wearable game after declining sales of
its mcnugget pedometer people kept
eating it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
