we're here at Comic Con 2015 comic-con
is such a huge show there are games
there are movies there's old back issues
their toys is there actually any room
for new publishers who aren't selling
superheroes let's go talk to a few and
find out I sort of serve Annie shove
legs I don't do superhero comics and I
didn't do zombies or you know like I
think that people that want small press
sort of nowhere to go and I think that
you know people will surprise themselves
by coming through here and and and get
things sometimes couple years ago there
was a Glee like people were mad because
Glee fans were here come on some glee
fans will like something i do i'm sure
and that's just widening the audience
and that's better for everybody there's
like a small bit of our scene that's
here and that's you know that's who were
here for and also like a lot of the pop
culture parody stuff that we do is
pretty broad and pretty relatable so
there's gonna be like the person who
just came out of the Star Wars pandal or
is on their way to get an autograph from
like Lou Ferrigno who will stumble upon
our booth and be like oh this this thing
is really great that's one title scheme
conventions are like a solid seventy
percent of the revenue um and that can
be like Beck and that's actually like
going down year by year but that's about
average for pretty much every other
indie press we know they really rely on
doing like at least ten conventions a
year to like to keep paying for
production i would say have because i do
like a fair amount of conventions the
cost of the table keeps going up and
it's it's fine i'll outpace that i say
half is advertising half is ask so if i
make better than that and it's all great
and if I leave with like I'm gonna
I stopped by Oni booth I say hey how's
it going they're like oh you should do a
cover for us I guess I will here you
have the opportunity to meet animators
you know also publishing companies and
you know houses and stuff like that and
you know those contacts turn into things
from time to time if I can walk away
from a convention with gigs then yeah
it's also the best way of self
distributing your own work so if you
don't have the money to pay for tons of
advertising or pay a sales force to put
your stuff out then you know being right
here hand selling and showing off your
work is like the best way to do it to
make yourself look a little bit more
legit you've got to have a presence at
comic-con it's Mecca right like it's
just everything's here people may come
to comic-con for the games or the movies
but everyone here there's still in the
same mindset they're looking for
something cool and new and geeky and
these small publishers offer that in a
slightly different way if these people
weren't here they might never stumble
across it ultimately when people with
new interests are coming that's a good
thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
