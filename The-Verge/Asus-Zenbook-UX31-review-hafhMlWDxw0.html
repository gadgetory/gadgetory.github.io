this is the Asus Zenbook ux301 which
really means this is a Seuss's first
ultra book and the first thing you're
going to notice about this system is
obviously how strikingly similar it
looks to the MacBook Air at least from
its profile this is a very thin system
but it also tapers down just like the
air 2 point 11 inches it weighs two
point eight pounds it actually feels a
little heftier than that in hands the
other thing that I've really been
impressed with having reviewed the Acer
last week is how solid the hardware
feels it's made out of aluminum and the
top has this concentric circle pattern
as they're calling it you get a nice
aluminum palm rest and also a really
nice and solid keyboard deck there's no
flex to the keyboard but the keys are a
little bit shallow the biggest problem
with the hardware here is the touchpad
it can become really really flaky the
cursor can jump all over the screen and
sometimes it will actually launch
applications on its own I'm not really
sure how it does that it boots really
quickly thanks to the 128 gigabyte SSD
which allows the system to not only boot
in under 15 seconds but resume from
sleep in two seconds as well on top of
that the battery life is really good I
got about five hours and thirty minutes
on my battery rundown test but I also
have in real life have gotten closer to
6 or 6 and a half overall for $1,100 a
Suze has done a really nice job with the
Zen book the hardware is beautiful it
performs really great and the battery
life is really good but unfortunately
that touchpad issue is a pretty big
issue if you could live with that the
Zen book is actually a really good
laptop but if you can the air is still
the best choice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
