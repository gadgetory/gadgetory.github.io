scooter called the eco Rico m5 air let's
get some air
the m5 air can get you about eight to
ten to 15 miles of range really all
depends on the road you're on how fast
you're going things like that it has a
top speed of 20 miles an hour of it you
have to really go in a straight line to
hit that usually it hovers around 14 or
15 miles an hour that's plenty fast for
something like this
has regenerative braking so it'll feed
energy back into the batteries when you
get on that brake it also has a really
easy throttle to use it doesn't jump you
off the line and in fact you actually
have to give it a little kick to get
going before you can even get the
throttle engaged it also has a
suspension on it which makes it a little
easier to ride when the road is a little
bit bumpy it's not lights 35 pounds so
it's kind of tough to carry around but
it collapses from the handlebars down to
the stem and you can get it all folded
up or even back open in about five
seconds once you get used to it now all
of this is a sign of just how practical
electric rattles are becoming it's
something that we really saw here at CES
this year you're not necessarily going
to want to take an electric skateboard
with only six miles of range or ride a
swag tron to work every day but
something like the Eco Rico makes that
seem like a possibility and that's
really cool but for that to happen a
couple things have to change one is
price this thing's about $1,200 which is
where a lot of other electric
rattleballs are priced at right now it's
just still a little too expensive
another one is weight most of these are
still too heavy when you hop off and
break them down and have to carry them
around and then the last is battery life
in charging time this gives you a decent
range but it still takes you about three
to four hours to charge back up once
you've drained that battery but even
with all that in mind I had a lot of fun
using the Eco Rico to get from our hotel
to our work trailer all week and it's
something I could see myself using in my
daily life we're not quite there yet but
after this year's CES it feels like
we're closer than ever for more electric
rider bowls and everything else that we
covered this week head to the Virg calm
