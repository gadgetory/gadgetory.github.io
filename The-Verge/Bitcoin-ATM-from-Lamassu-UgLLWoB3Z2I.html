I'm here at CES with Zach Harvey who is
the CEO of Lama su incorporated we're
here with what's being called the
Bitcoin ATM but it's not exactly an ATM
what is it it's more of a Bitcoin
vending machine in a lot of ways but it
really depends what you consider an ATM
I mean if it's a Bitcoin ATM then maybe
it's a completely different creature
than an ATM a standard ATM because what
you want to get out of this machine is
Bitcoin that's that point of it so when
you go to a standard ATM you go and you
put in your debit card or bank card and
you want to get the cash and in our
machine you want to get rid of the cash
and you want it right so this machine I
can put US dollars in here and it will
give me Bitcoin right Wow exactly okay
so that this is crazy because one of the
problems with Bitcoin is how hard it is
to actually get your hands on some
Bitcoin would you say this is one of the
easiest ways to actually buy bit correct
well we designed it to be the easiest
way to get Bitcoin so we put a lot of
thought of how to make it as accessible
as possible make it as simple as
possible and we developed this machine
from from the ground up to make it super
simple so it really is three steps you
just scan in your QR code so the Machine
knows where to send the Bitcoin if you
put in your cash and you press send and
then they appear in your phone got it
and then three months later you're a
millionaire well yeah exactly that's
what to go on so far what is the price
of Bitcoin right now well right now the
price of Bitcoin is about 950 okay and
we're looking at this on the machine
here so right so when it says our
current Bitcoin prices this would be the
price of whatever the operator is
charging okay so the price and the
operator I Sofia he could be taking a
small percentage on top of that for the
convenience fee I see any operator is
the corner store board bodega or
wherever it is that has installed the
bitcoins machine just like an ATM bought
the Machine and installed it and then he
gets the cash and then he sends his
bitcoins or connects to an exchange for
him and you guys have actually sold
these they're placed how many have you
sold well we've sold over 130 so far and
they're just starting to go live so we
have one in Helsinki
Finland in a record store in a train in
the largest train station we have them
in Bratislava Slovakia Melbourne
Australia and then we're going to have a
bunch of them in Canada us Australia
I love Europe Japan China Korea Stan Wow
um right any in Vegas not that not yet
hopefully maybe the coin slot machine
would be better for Vegas maybe this
time next year yeah it'll be all around
here strip will be filled with Bitcoin
machines so pretty soon people will be
able to actually go to those machines in
those locations well they already are
wherever they're live people can just go
there but some of them are live already
right the ones in finland and slovakia
and australia are alive and in the
coming weeks a lot more will start going
live i think they'll really start
popping up kind of like mushrooms all
over and by spring when all of the 130
plus machines get out there that's when
it'll be really be exciting for us will
know that in in lots of major cities and
some less major cities people just be
able to go and get bitcoin immediately
anywhere at the mall exactly what we
have had some malls contact us okay so
that would be interesting in different
countries teens buying bitcoin well they
can I mean they can take their allowance
money and put in five bucks and use its
patents online I think that's a great
use of your Lowenstein's so let's talk
about the hardware a little bit how much
does this thing weigh well this thing
weighs about 110 pounds 45 kilos they're
made in Portugal so that's how they're
we measure them okay it's a lot heavier
than our prototype because our prototype
didn't have the interior vault okay and
once we install the interior ultimate
everything a lot heavier because that's
six millimeter armored Swedish steel
that we chose for for the protection of
the of the cache itself so that made the
machine a lot heavier we also made the
steel itself thicker on the machine so
that's a lot of stuff after we first
presented the machine in San Jose we
kind of went back to the drawing board
event and said
it's going to be installed everywhere we
have to make sure that these machines
are extremely robust that they're over
engineered for smash-and-grab group and
even basically as secures an ATM the
standard ATM would be and I think we
feel pretty comfortable about that right
now and San Jose that was the Bitcoin
conference in right it was Nate me okay
things happened really fast in a Bitcoin
world okay so this thing has been out
for a while but it's just now going live
right um well that was our prototype so
it wasn't actually out there yet we only
started accepting pre-orders in August
and that's when we had finished this
design so we we felt good about this
design we knew that we could manufacture
it in a timely manner that's when we
started accepting pre-orders that was in
August and we've already shipped out I
would say about fifteen and another
almost thirty are going out next week
cool and so the other thing that strikes
me about this is that it is it looks
nice like a lot of Bitcoin services and
products put designs secondary that's
just the nature of the community people
are a lot more engineering and not as
designing and this is like very sleek
looking and the the interface is nice
and you guys are actually still working
on the software you said you just push
an update for it right well right we're
always improving the software this is
still an early stage of the software and
there are always things to improve and
added functionality and new ideas that
we have that we really want to implement
so we're always changing that and it's
something that's really easy with this
machine to just either push updates or
have people download them and so as
Bitcoin gains more adoption I mean the
price has been going crazy it's been all
over the mainstream news it's been on
CNN CNBC you've probably done some
interviews I know you did with Bloomberg
News like mm-hmm
you've probably done interviews with
weddings right main networks um it seems
like usability is an important an
important thing to get right if it's
ever going to go to really be something
that most people use oh absolutely I
understand right and I think there are
some services that are doing a really
great job of that like bid pay that we
use that make it really easy for for
merchants to use Bitcoin and makes it
really easy for us to sign up armor to
the suppliers that we work with a coin
we pay ninety percent of our suppliers
with Bitcoin right and we do that
because using
hey we just signed them up all to bitpay
they're like I don't know Bitcoin is
it's like unless your Fitbit paid bid
pay is a service that makes it
incredibly easy for a merchant to accept
Bitcoin without having to deal with it
if he doesn't want to and then if he
wants to only deal with 10% of it like
that 10% in Bitcoin and 90% directly and
encash to his bank account you can do
that as well so even people that are a
little concerned about Bitcoin or
holding it or don't know where to store
it if we tell them listen we really
prefer to pay with Bitcoin but it will
go directly to your bank account
and they're you know it's hard for them
to say no to that when they pay less
than wires or credit cards we even
signed up the manufacturer of our bill
validators which are a huge publicly
traded company in Japan and we signed
them up to bid pay and that that makes
life a lot easier for us because we
could just pay everyone in Bitcoin right
and we accept our mission our machine
using good pay for Bitcoin great um so
in order to do a demonstration we
convinced our director editor John Logue
marcinho to invest $2 in this exciting
new virtual currency maybe we should say
what bitcoin is to you what's your
favorite way of explaining Bitcoin I
have my own way which I repeat in every
single one of my articles but how do you
explain it
well I think the easiest way to explain
it for people in two words is internet
money because people kind of understand
that you know when they had letters back
in the day and you had to write them on
paper and put them in an envelope and
send them out that was and now you have
emails and it's just Internet kind of
letters that it's immediate and the same
thing with Bitcoin it's you kind of get
rid of all the the middlemen and
everything around and it just makes it
really simple to send money anywhere
from one person to another there you go
all right so John is going to invest two
dollars in Bitcoin and so can you walk
us through that we also have his phone
here can you walk us through the Bitcoin
ATM machine yes
all right thank you so the first thing
is we press Start and we scan in the
Bitcoin address to the machine and now
we have his address here mm-hmm which
now everyone can send him money
great we're doing two dollars one day so
how many how many bitcoins is it so this
is 2.0 seven million Bitcoin okay that's
how much you're going to get for your
crew two dollars at the current rate of
nine five 4.76 right but that's going to
double by the end of next week so I'll
have four dollars and whatever ready if
you'd like you can send the bitcoins
okay I'm sending bitcoins John all right
it says your bitcoins are on their way
and how long does this usually take that
that's done it's done all right if you
want to verify it you can go to back to
the phone do you see a little green
thing that says yep it says receiving
2.0 six nine nine nine milli BTC
that's it they're on their way I'm gonna
show that great alright well that was
the bitcoin machine also commonly called
the Bitcoin ATM machine thank you so
much for stopping by all right thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
