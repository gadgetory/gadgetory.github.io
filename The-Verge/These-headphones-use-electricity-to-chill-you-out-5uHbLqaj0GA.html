and I'm holding the Nirvana this is a
prototype
it is a entertainment device it's a
gadget you plug your headphones into it
and then you plug its special headphones
into it and this blue wires going into
my left ear and it is sending electrical
signals which are supposed to stimulate
my vagus nerve which then are supposed
to you know show me out so I've been
using it now for ten minutes or so and
gotta say I feel a little bit chill the
basic feeling of it is you put it in
your left ear because that's the side of
your body that has a connected your
heart so it safely and it sends these
little electrical impulses they feel
like little tiny little stings in your
ear canal and the idea is it can help
with pain management also just chill you
out a little bit they get stronger or
weaker depending on the intensity of the
music but this is not a medical device
and marketing as a medical device
although they may do some clinical files
on this specific device later I mean
just my perspective that was weird
max do I do I look high right now
alright so now that I've used a Nirvana
it's been about 30 minutes I used it for
about 20 minutes
I felt lightheaded and I don't know why
I think there's a real question which is
is it just a placebo I tell you what is
not a placebo is the stinging in your
ear it's like like stick a 9-volt
battery on your tongue but imagine that
in your ear so there's two headphones
one is blue one is black the blue one
goes in your left ear that's where the
signals are black one is just music it
goes in your right ear if you swap them
then these electrical signals are
stimulating the vagus nerve on your
right side which by the way is connected
to your heart and you don't want to be
doing crazy electrical things to a nerve
that's got a beeline right to your heart
but I'll tell you what I'm not gonna use
one on IndieGoGo sorry guys it's
launching on IndieGoGo on March 15th and
it's gonna retail when they start
shipping at $2.99 although if you back
it on IndieGoGo you might be able to get
it for a little bit less</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
