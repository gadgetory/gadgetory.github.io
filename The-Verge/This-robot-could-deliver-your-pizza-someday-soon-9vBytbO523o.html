pizza instead of a person bringing it to
your house
a robot brought it to your house it's
closer than you think
this is the starship it's made by a
company called starship technologies
which is founded by some of the
cofounders of Skype
it's a self-driving delivery robot and
the plan is to get it in the hands of
small businesses all around the world so
that they have a low-cost delivery
option now we've heard a lot about the
future of delivery lately Google's got a
patent on self-driving delivery trucks
Amazon has been testing its drones but
this has made more for local delivery
something more in the two-mile range as
the top speed of 4 miles an hour and it
uses cameras in the front and in the
sides for collision avoidance so that
when it's going down the sidewalk it
won't run into people it'll actually
stop and in some cases move out of the
way so that people can get by it and it
can continue on its way
so it's flashy and ideas a delivery
drone but it seems a lot safer now this
is just a prototype and starship
technologies have only driven at about
700 miles so far but they're already
going into limited production on 12 more
models and they plan to drive 20,000
more miles in the next six months
starting in the UK and then bringing it
to the US can also carry more than a
drone can right now - this thing can fit
about 20 pounds worth of stuff in it
which starship says it about the weight
of two grocery bags but what's really
awesome about this idea is that it can
play a big part in what's bound to be a
revolution in how we send and receive
stuff all around the world that all
sounds great but starship technologies
is gonna have to do a lot more testing
before we get there and they're gonna
have to have infer come a lot of
regulatory hurdles just like Google and
Amazon are trying to overcome right now
so until then this robot is just a dream
and you're stuck with your regular pizza
