here CES with Black &amp;amp; Decker's smart
tech which is a smart battery so we made
fun of smartphone devices a little bit
at the birds here because often they
just aren't that useful but this is
actually kind of me and fairly simple
design what it is is a battery that's
compatible with any kind of Black &amp;amp;
Decker or power tool that uses the 20
volt battery and once you plug it in
it'll pair with a smartphone and you can
control it using it out so there are
parts of this app are a little bit more
like what we usually mean when we say
smart device which is to say they're not
quite as useful one of them is projects
which we'll just load a series of
projects from the Black &amp;amp; Decker website
like how to build a bookcase now it'll
load it and it's you know probably
helpful but it's also the kind of thing
that you could probably just look up on
your own the same goes for the messages
which will give you notifications on
things like projects and I think and
give you some kind of notifications on
whether your battery is getting low or
other features but this seems like it's
not quite something black &amp;amp; decker's
figured out the other major thing you
can do this lock this which essentially
just means disabling the battery so I'm
going to lock this right now it's
successfully locked and nothing happens
when I pull this trigger
now I'm gonna unlock it and it's working
again now the obvious question is what
happens if you lose your phone and the
answer is just that you repair it with
another phone and then you can unlock it
let me be the coolest feature here is
that this is also an external battery
pack you can plug a USB cable in and use
it to power your phone or your tablet or
anything else that could be charged with
say mo see if you want to buy these
these are going to come out in early
summer and they'll cost $69 again this
is black and decker smart tech if you
want to see other cool stuff from CES
