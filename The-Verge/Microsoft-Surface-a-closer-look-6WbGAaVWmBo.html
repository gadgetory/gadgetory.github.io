are backstage after Microsoft's la event
they're very secretive event where they
announced the surface which is not a
huge table but a tablet actually a
family of tablets an Intel version and
an ARM version that'll run Windows RT
and we've had a chance to play around
with them we've had a chance to talk to
people here it's an interesting product
for Microsoft we talked to Steve Ballmer
CEO and and he kind of made it sound
like he wasn't they weren't just getting
into this to trump the competition or to
compete with their partners which
they're actually doing now they kind of
wanted to spark a little excitement
maybe or light the fire under their
partners to say hey you got to do
something really special and really
unique for Windows 8 it's a crowded
market they are brand new doing a tablet
so it'll be interesting to see how that
goes but they definitely didn't make it
seem like they wanted to sell the most
but they want to do something that was
special that fit with the release of
Windows 8 they wouldn't talk about price
it wouldnt talk about release date they
say they're going to be competitive
we're hearing probably around the
holiday season for the RT version which
makes sense because that's when Windows
8 is supposed to be out and you know all
in all I think it's actually a pretty
interesting product I mean it does a lot
of stuff that the ipad doesn't do it
does a lot of stuff that Android tablets
don't do and most importantly for me it
actually is somewhat nice looking and
has colorful accessories which almost
nobody would seems to want to do they've
got these cool new keyboards one is a
tactile keyboard one is a pressure
sensitive touch keyboard they snap on
like the smart cover for the ipad and
they're actually really attractive and
according to everybody here they work
really well so we haven't really used
one day to day obviously yet but we will
do that soon and as soon as we do you
guys will be the first to know</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
