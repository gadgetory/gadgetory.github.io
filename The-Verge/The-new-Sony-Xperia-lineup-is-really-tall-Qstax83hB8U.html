This is an iPhone 10.
Look how much taller this is, it's insane.
(upbeat techno music)
Hey it's Chaim with The
Verge, and we're here
with Sony's new phones they're
announcing at MWC 2019,
and this year, Sony's going tall.
(upbeat techno music)
This is the Xperia 1 which
is Sony's new flagship,
and the thing that's in
common across all the phones
that Sony's announcing
this year is that they all
the 21 by 9 aspect ratio screen,
which is just really really tall.
The idea is that you can fit
more content on your screen
than you ever could before,
and it's just a really
interesting approach,
especially when you look at
basically every other flagship,
which has just been
like bezles and notches,
it's a different approach.
Sony's announcing three
phones at the show this year,
there's the Xperia 1,
which is the flagship,
and then there's the Xperia
10 and the Xperia 10 Plus.
All three phones have the 21 by 9 screen.
The Xperia 10 is a 6 inch phone.
The Xperia 10 Plus is a 6.5 inch.
And while they're not quite
as impressive as the Xperia 1,
the design's a little cheaper,
it has a plastic back instead of glass,
the specs are lower, Snapdragon
600 series processors,
they're still impressive just
from the sheer size of the screen.
While we haven't actually
been able to really play
with the Xperia 1,
we have been able to
use the Xperia 10 Plus,
and you can really fit a
lot of content on here.
There's really no way to get around it,
this is a really tall phone.
I mean, I have pretty
big hands and reaching
the top of the screen is
still a bit of a stretch.
Sony does have this cool one-handed mode
where you can double-tap the home button,
and it literally just
shrinks the display down
into a smaller functional version,
so it turns your big phone
into like a little mini phone
living on your big phone.
You can adjust how big this preview goes,
so if you want it really small you can,
if you got a little bit bigger
hands you can make it bigger.
One of the things that Sony's
really pushing with this
is vertical multitasking
so you can have two things,
not necessarily side by
side but top and bottom,
and the screen is so
tall you can kinda just
have your directions up in
the top corner of the map
while you say, text someone,
or a YouTube video playing while
you're actually doing work.
(upbeat music with snapping)
The Xperia 1 has a 4K OLED HDR display,
which Sony says is the
first for any smart phone.
It's a 6.5 inch screen,
and while there's no notch,
again it is this giant,
tall 21 by 9 display.
It almost feels like
you're holding a TV remote
instead of a phone.
In keeping that the Xperia 1
is the Sony's new flagship,
Sony's been packing it
with all the top specs.
There's the new Snapdragon 855 processor,
six gigabytes of RAM, 128
gigabytes of onboard storage,
USB-C, it's water resistant.
Sony's using a new triple
camera on the Xperia 1,
which is the first time
Sony's put three cameras
on one phone like this.
There's a 26 millimeter wide lens,
a 52 millimeter telephoto, and
a 16 millimeter super wide.
It's a similar approach that we've seen
from other manufacturers that
have had multiple cameras
to offer different kinds of
lenses, to get different shots,
but we'll have to see
how it works in practice
before we make any judgements.
The Xperia 1 also does
have a fingerprint sensor
like Sony's previous phones,
it is built into the
power button on the side,
which other phones Sony had
released up until the XZ3
didn't have, so again good to see here.
There is no in-display fingerprint sensor,
which we have seen on some other flagships
out of MWC this year, but
we'll take what we can get.
Sony's really putting out all the stops.
They really want this to look
and feel like a flagship phone
among anything else in the market.
There is some weird stuff though,
because a lot of content
just isn't mastered
for a screen this tall, so YouTube videos,
some of them are going to have black bars,
and while Sony says that
it is working with partners
like Netflix, Amazon Prime,
and games like Fortnite and Asphalt Racing
to make sure their content
will look great on that phone,
not everything might look
outstanding when it does launch.
There's still a lot of
details about these phones
that we don't know, and
Sony will be releasing more
at MWC and as we get closer to release.
The Xperia 1 will be out
sometime later this spring,
the Xperia 10 and 10 Plus
will be out on March 18th.
Prices have yet to be announced,
but they're tall, they're really tall.
I can't emphasize this enough,
and if you've been
looking for a tall phone,
this might be it.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
