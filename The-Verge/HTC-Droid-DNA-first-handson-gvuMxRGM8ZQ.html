here i am taking a look at the HTC droid
DNA for Verizon Wireless the highlight
feature here is its new 5-inch 1080p
display it's a super lcd3 unit so it's
got really vibrant colors and great
viewing angles and a pixel density of
440 PPI it's definitely one of the
sharpest displays we've ever seen and
it's very very impressive we've been
saying for a long time that the One X
has the best screen on any mobile device
and it feels like this might even beat
that otherwise you've got a standard
slab style design what is remarkable is
how thin and light this is it's about
nine point seven millimeters thin but
it's got a tapered design here that
really minimizes the thickness at the
edges and it only weighs about 138 grams
so it really feels very light in your
hands underneath it's powered by
Qualcomm's quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro
processor it's clock at 1.5 gigahertz
and it has two gigabytes of RAM seems to
be very snappy and responsive here it's
pushing around android 4.1 jelly bean
with HTC Sense 4 plus interface without
really any issues no lag that we can see
everything seems to load very quickly
the interface is very very snappy the
interface itself is very similar to
sense forward that we've seen before
with a couple of minor updates and
tweaks for Android 4.1 on the back we've
got an 8 megapixel camera with LED flash
this is equipped with HTC's full image
sense chip and services so it's got the
ability to record 1080p video and shoot
full mega stills while you're recording
inside here is a 20 20 milliamp hour
battery and then on the front is a 2
megapixel camera with a wide-angle lens
that's been borrowed over from the HTC
8x Windows Phone device Verizon's going
to be offering this on November 21st for
199 with a new two-year contract but you
can place your pre-order starting today
