verge and we're taking a look at the
latest version of android this is the
first preview of Android M it came out
today we saw it at Google's i/o keynote
and now you can install it on your own
Nexus 5 and X 0 6 or your Nexus 9 and
once you swipe up from there this
basically looks the same as it always
has there's a new wallpaper that's the
only new wallpaper so far so if you're
hoping for more than that you'll have to
wait for some updates in the future it's
a nice one at least volume controls are
far simpler now so if I just toggle them
down I can actually just tap up here NEC
controls for the system level your
alarms notifications things like that so
it's a lot less confusing than it was in
android 5.0 lollipop so that's simpler
the apt or is also much different now it
scrolls up and down vertically as
opposed to horizontally and you've got a
list of your recent apps up here at the
top so those are easy to access and you
can also search for stuff which should
be helpful if you have a lot of stuff on
your phone and you can easily find the
apps you want so that's new so one of
the big folks is today on stage was app
permissions Google wants to make it much
more simpler and much more
straightforward to turn off things that
you don't want to have to have access to
your contacts your calendar photos stuff
like that so now you can actually go
into app info and tap on permissions and
turn off these things one by one if you
don't want facebook to see your photos
or your location you can turn those off
there's warning that could cause
problems for you apps are made to work
with these features so turn them off
might cause issues but you have the
option how to just toggle those off
whenever you want to so unfortunately
some of the big things showing onstage
aren't actually in this first version so
now on tap which is the new feature that
actually scans your screen and pulls up
google now cards that are useful that's
not here yet so you can see I've
searched for chipotle and chrome if I
hold down the Google now button it's not
going to do too much for me just yet so
hopefully that'll come soon some kind of
update to the preview bills but right
now you can't use it just yet which is
unfortunate it seems very cool and one
of the big new features of Android M and
there aren't too many
and so the same thing goes for tap and
pay you can't use Android pay just yet
if you go to the tap and pay many you
there's nothing here the old version of
Google Wallet is still in the store so
they still haven't launched Android pay
just yet so you can't pay for things in
a store yet that will probably come out
closer to Android and when it actually
launches to everyone they're seeing in
q3 of this year so again this is just
our first look at the new version of
Android it's got a long way to go before
it actually comes out it's all phones
Google still hasn't gotten lollipop on
many phones to begin with it's not about
ten percent right now so there aren't
too many deep changes here new useful
features but stuff like fingerprints
don't work yet because there's no
fingerprint sensor in the nexus 6 so
that'll have to wait for hardware to
come out and so for right now it's very
early look at what's new and hopefully
more is going to come along pretty soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
