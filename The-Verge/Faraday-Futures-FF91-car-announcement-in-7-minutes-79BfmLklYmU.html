privilege to be here this evening with
you we have so much to share and you in
for quite a special show we have to flip
the auto road industry back on its head
break it down or build it up the way it
should have been in the first place
independent of fossil fuels what we're
creating is more than a car it's more
than just a car a car that drives you
the car that parts itself an intelligent
entity that opens doors adjust the
temperature load your music or your
movies or your email all the things that
you never thought a car could do and
we'll call this first of these new
species the ff9 one one of the coolest
things we have been working on a third
day is intelligent self parking or its
rivals valet imagine you have a very
important meeting to go to and you are
running late you rush to the office but
parking lot looks cool you don't have
10-15 minutes to look for an open space
wouldn't it be great at this point you
can just come out of the car bring your
phone out activate self parking and the
vehicle starts driving itself and looks
for a parking spot comfort parking and
then when it's done send your message
back that it's done parking and we'll
wait for your next command now we are
going to send somebody out in the
parking lot to move the vehicle at the
parking spot number three and then
hopefully our car can find the parking
spot and Parks itself oh there you go
okay all right
okay there you go and let's see what
happens
car's not moving oh it's moving already
okay there we go all right at this point
all the sensors are fired up and they
are really busy collecting all kinds of
data and looking for a parking spot so
each other to make a one turn all right
I think I'm Korra feels a little fancy
tonight and wants to show off a little
by backing into the spot all right let's
see how how well it does
okay three-point turn yeah real defense
here all right let's see it's almost
done almost ah and then it's done watch
this that marta is gonna be down it's
all
ah touched uh
we leveraged the world's highest energy
density battery cell we put them
together in a proprietary design to
create the most compact and potent
battery pack in the entire industry
the ff9 one can achieve in excess of 378
miles of adjusted EPA range how much
power are we talking about 1,050
horsepower but why tell you this it's
fast when we could just show you about
we bring those cars out right now right
here for a live exhibition all right
Bentley been tagged
this is a Ferrari 488 GTB
the Tesla Model X in P 100 D that's the
bottle s coming out but you might be
wondering is the ff9 one quicker than
the current fastest production TV in the
world
let's see tonight let's get the F f91
out here and see what it can do
alright let's put our hands together but
the new fastest production Eevee in the
world take about the large interior
space measures 151 cubic feet by
eliminating the need for a gas
powertrain the FFF gains valuable space
that traditional vehicles don't have and
our 22 inch arrow logic wheels transform
their shape kinetically creating a more
ideal and aerodynamic form the arrival
interface enables keyless entry with its
facial facial recognition camera and can
be used to activate the driverless valet
without any further delay I'd like to
introduce ff9 one
I would like you to send the car onto
center stage in the way that you would
do if you arrived home one evening and
ready to send the car to the garage so
using the auto valet park just press the
button and it will find its way to the
garage Oh
what
oh okay it seems like it's a little bit
too lazy tonight
so thank you thank you everybody thank
you and good night I think we have the
Ferrari oh yeah I can hear it there
sounds nice
so the Ferrari this is a Ferrari 488 GTB</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
