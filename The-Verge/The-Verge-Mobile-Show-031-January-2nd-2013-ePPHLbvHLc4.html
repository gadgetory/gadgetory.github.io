actually Peter I have a boy life I don't
actually know that we're live I think we
are at the moment no it says honor well
yeah it says that for me all the time
whether we're on air or not which by the
way is not confidence-inspiring at all
are we not on the air yeah we're on the
air I'm Hugh in chat says that we're
live okay so he claims yeah um i-i've a
bone to pick with you dieter because two
weeks ago I last program you closed it
what I teasing a Christmas Day show I
did and you didn't i wish i was only
party to broadcast on christmas day
where were you Haley tidy you called my
bluff you called my bluff I actually was
not ready to broadcast on Christmas Day
I was hoping you just accept my
admonishment move not move on but you
did I was I was in magnolia arkansas and
i was ready to go was there internet
there yeah is it like satellite internet
is it that that weird standard cable
internet it wasn't super good but it
worked interesting what kind of what
kind of cell service did you have their
terrible 18t is the worst and i had to
spend a significant portion of the
holiday in a place where there was just
0 service but verizon has LT either
which is insane that is insane you know
like every once in a while we get that
that list of new verizon LTE markets
yeah they're they're like 16 cities that
you've never heard of that's that's a
perfect example yeah so we're going to
get started but i do want to warn
everybody that at any moment during the
Virgin Mobile show Dan could just uh
without wanting to or meaning to turn
into like dubstep damn of just be
talking and he'll end up riff raff it's
pretty awesome yeah it's amazing but
yeah it's fully unintentional so don't
take offense if that the type of thing
offends you so this is our last podcast
before the consumer electronics show
which starts next week and I'm basically
not sleeping I'm sick to my stomach I'm
throwing up every few hours I way I have
to room with you the first night we r
there and I'm not having any of this if
you're puking I'm all sleeping in a car
or whatever Chris I've been growing my
hair out specifically so that you could
hold it back remember that quote until
the day I die but uh but what's crazy is
like the biggest news mobile news uh
might have already happened and it
didn't happen at CES the reasons lads
not here is that he was at the launch
event for boot to OS which has been
announced they're aiming for i want to
say was it early 2014 yeah early 2014
and it's based on the android kernel and
uses i think android drivers so it
should be relatively easy to support
android phones over to it if they want
to take advantage of existing hardware
yeah but but dieter you know what else
uses the android kernel and android
drivers open or less yes I was yeah
anyway it doesn't run so well yeah well
what's funny we were talking about this
before we got started that we've got a
wound to OS and we've got sailfish from
yalla and we've got uh what's what am I
missing okay I guess fire five fire and
Firefox OS all sort of like showing off
their junk on like the Galaxy Nexus yeah
which is great I mean that that's that's
actually a really promising son they're
able to use off-the-shelf hardware and
do really important and cool and unique
things with it because none of these
guys are going to at launch you're going
to have the volume or the momentum or
the money to commission really cool
hardware independently and in some cases
their structure doesn't even lend itself
to that sort of thing so the ability to
do that is very important and i'm sure
all of these will run beautifully on the
HTC hd2 no there's
already a project of a boon to running
on the hd2 right there's a thread on XDA
uh that is like wait open call for beta
testers we gotta build on the phone
version already like like not the
desktop version of ubuntu book you're a
four-eyed it Renza windows RT to right
and that yeah yeah that happened with we
were maybe gonna talk about it briefly
but ya know the hd2 is running windows
RT that's amazing yay love it this is
the phone it'll not dad ever died yeah
you'll just never die it's the it's the
mobile equivalent of the cockroach it'll
survive nuclear war it'll survive all
these platform battles even if HTC god
forbid goes out of business the hd2 will
soldier on for decades to come it's
gonna be a beautiful thing they should
just like they should just keep making
it honestly they should just like go
back to the factory and do another run
you know about some first generation
snapdragon processor i agree i'd buy one
I'm just shocked you doing a little one
chris i don't actually I never did I use
you know I had to I had to give mine up
I was it a review unit uh was a company
in it at my former employer oh and I did
I don't steal from the company it's just
a good policy yeah when did you start
that policy now he's just he's doubling
stuff in these drawers in preparation
for we were fleeing to Costa Rica check
out these virgin a pile of Nexus 7 so
anyway Ubuntu are you guys excited about
this is this something that would
seriously consider using and if so why
would you consider it over something
like Firefox OS well okay so a couple of
things 1 i'm relatively excited for it
because i'm always excited for new ideas
and how to use a phone and i'm excited
for it because it's a phone UI that
doesn't talk down everything via
gestures and like there's like you swipe
up from different parts of the screen to
do different things and you swipe over
from the left and there's a little peek
thing look at your apps that you sleep
over more to get the home screen and you
swipe from the right to switch apps
and so it could be a confusing mess but
it could actually work and so I'm
excited to try that but what's really
interesting to me is like looking at the
response on the verge of people that are
excited it is getting way more attention
and way more interest than I ever ever
would have guessed a phone OS from
ubuntu would like it's really crazy
actually yeah what about you then uh you
know III I hear what deters saying but
I'm not nearly as optimistic about it as
it seems that dieter is I and I feel the
same way about Firefox OS like there I'm
sure that these like they're going to
bring some great ideas to the table and
there's going to do some really cool
things on the mobile platform yourself
but as far as being like something that
I could use on a day-to-day basis I
don't I don't know if I could see it
happening uh just not not with what I
saw in the early demos yet and based on
our very way you think I mean here's
here's the thing i need to preface this
by disclosing that my girlfriend works
for mozilla and does does work with the
firefox OS but i think the difference
between this and the firefox OS is one
the UI looks way better and two I
trusted 12 to put on a product that's
how do I put this not really kind of
crap like what I've seen Firefox OS so
far has not been inspiring and they're
you know they're targeting the low end
and it's just like yeah right ubuntu
might actually be like an interesting
thing from echo and they know I'm native
apps and like they they said in their
little fake keynote which actually by
the way did you guys watch this like
little like keynote for the internet
thing I know I know it's like a 20
minute thing it's not it's not like
fully like juju fake keynote like he
starts out by saying this is like a
keynote for the internet it's you know a
guy standing in front of you know a
white background and so it's fine but
it's still there was still a little
moment of like and anyway he said that
they've got partnerships did it have
canned laughter that's not a guard ships
already set up with Grandpa chip
graphics cards makers graphics people
and so that to me that's sort of that's
a dog whistle for NVIDIA will it support
comp is is
is what I want to know what can I make
the like apps like explode in fireballs
and and jiggly windows because you know
that's what you do with you Bunty right
jiggly windows I like um yeah I mean it
bear in mind and to your point that you
know they have a year until they have
been planning on getting to one point oh
so that's that's something to keep in
mind it just I mean it bothers me a
little bit that we have all of these
these interesting projects that are led
by really talented and smart people even
including open webOS and and and you
know there isn't any room for well
debatably there's not any room for even
a single one of these two commercially
succeed let alone four or five however
many that are going on right now so so
it'd be nice to see some consolidation
in in this field but I know there are
some egos involved and well you know
different even just ideas a leader is
worth some some sense of like
cross-platform development that actually
creates apset don't suck yeah honestly
like these are all based on the Android
kernel or somehow related linux it would
be really great if you know we could
have a good way to make native or native
speed apps for all these things that are
good and you know I went on a tweet
rampage on new year's day and my new
year's resolution for web apps was I was
going to continue to be disappointed
with their performance for the entire
year and I don't think that it's there
but I mean we've got we got Tyson yeah
tyson i forgot haizen stalefish ubuntu a
open webOS I'm already forgetting one
again fire 555 Fox blackberry over there
you know they're trying to be the third
place windows phone over there so it's
not so good is it's like the difference
between entrench players and there's a
DS and all of them are like desperate to
build an app ecosystem and none nobody
thinks that any of them have a really
good chance of doing it right
yeah I mean boom it is if I don't know I
had a pop I give up by the way dieter I
would just like to say that I find that
hilarious that you you prefaced your
your-your-your discussion on mozilla
versus you come tonight by saying my
girlfriend works for Mozilla and then
you proceeded to trash sighs like normal
you would expect it to go the other way
where you would be like Oh firefox was
great but no you you took the other no I
but I mean here's the thing though like
I believe I believe in the principles of
firefox office I believe that it's
possible to make web apps that are kind
of native but also web-based I want that
to happen I wanted it to have a webos
and I'm somebody in the chat asked us to
quit talking about OS that's fair I want
that to happen with blackberry OS
they've got a really good html5 engine
for running html5 apps but you know to
date it's just not there and I don't
have a whole I mean you know facebook is
they finally released a native version
of facebook for android which is
terrible by the way you know like an
okay so bad it's it times out all the
time like i have a decent pantalla
connection your timing is from it it
constantly says I've no connection
whether i'm on Wi-Fi or wireless or
cellular or whatever it constantly says
it i have to kill the app and then
reopen it just to refresh the timeline
yeah drives me nuts it's terrible it's
really bad and then still I mean on top
of all this that you know we just got
done saying they're all these players in
and you know an arena that has room for
maybe one player and rumors are still
persisting that just like they've been
persisting for the past three or four
years that Facebook is eventually going
to get into this game and amazon and
amazon that's right well these dams
that'll be android-based right like in a
row android apps yes but then you get
into the whole debate of you know what
does it mean for something to be running
android right because it will obviously
be their flavor of Android and and who
knows what theyre curated apps because
it's only gonna be apps that you could
get through amazon yeah right right and
i'm sure google will not be including
Amazon
phone activations in their official
activations numbers I predicted 2013
somebody from Chrome's could be like
screw it or making a chrome phone what
the hell great does that look a little
pirate flag up in their cubicle we're
doing it I'd buy chrome phone I I think
they'll yeah you'd also buy a Chromebook
I would look the Chromebook is well
that's a whole different discussion but
it's it's a device that is near and dear
to my heart and anyone who doesn't own
one is doing it wrong anyway yeah um I
don't know what else to say I mean it
you know we'll have to wait and see if
any of these are gonna be successful is
pacific Lee with a boon to I just you
know I want to try it hopefully they'll
have something at CES that I could play
with and see if it's you know actually
compelling and good it did look really
laggy um which but again it's super
early right they they probably don't
have graphics acceleration yet and
they're you know they're running it on
old hardware in the first place so by
the time 20 I mean they have a full year
of runway to not only resolve that
through software optimization but also
to get better hardware the pipeline to
so yeah that should hopefully fingers
crossed worked itself out then again I'm
using a nexus 4 which you know even
today like it we keep saying that the
next generation of process is going to
finally eliminate all traces of leg from
Android and it never happens oh so we'll
see um well actually yeah i mean i was
maybe going to have us talk about this
you know the stuff that we talked about
in our year in review but let's let's
actually just since you brought up the
nexus 4 let's jump into CES and i'm mike
in my head the connection here is i am
not using the nexus 4 at CES i'm not
using the iphone well i have them both
in my bag but i am planning on galaxy s
three as I main phone at CES I think
that's a really like shrewd move on your
part I support it yes as in like you
know
well I mean it basically came down to
this I needed Android for gmail and I
prefer the way Android multi tasks for
IRC which is how we communicate with
each other and I needed a phone that I
could depend on the battery life either
through replacing the battery you're
having a super long battery life I'm on
AT&amp;amp;T I want LTE is a backup solution for
tethering just in case mm-hmm not that I
think 18 TLT he's gonna be worth a damn
I see yes and I get that it's not that
like oh I smart of me to pick the gs3
it's more like what else is there for me
to go with given those constraints I
feel like this is going to be the first
year at CES we're both verizon's and 18
tease LTE networks will be fully loaded
you know what I mean I'm gonna be I'm
gonna use the wimax the whole time yeah
you have yeah they're the only problem
with it is that there are definitely
parts of both lvcc and definitely the
Venetian yeah you cannot get a signal no
so that's always a consideration but but
that we're in the weeds uh the the yeah
i'm looking forward to seeing how those
networks perform and i'm also looking
forward to see to seeing whether the
HSPA network kind of starts to get a
little more usable yeah because every
everybody is on lte-capable phone now
the thing is is that none of those guys
are using volte so I don't know what
that means for the loading of the
network and also there's bad call
considerations and I'm assuming that
both HSPA and LTE signals are both using
the same backhaul so who knows we won't
know until we get there what do you get
but once you guys going to use so I've
got my iphone 5 on ATT so i'm going to
run into the same LTE problem i'm
bringing my nexus 4 but i really don't
think i'll end up using it I think my
sims going to stay in the iphone 5 just
because no LTE but then i've got a
backup a razr maxx HD on verizon so
that'll be my backup connection /
battery with my iphone goes down and
then as a last resort i also have a note
too that's coming with me so
I just scrounged up the biggest battery
devices that is fine yeah i'm taking i'm
taking a nexus 4 on with an 18 t sim in
it i'm taking a note to a verizon note 2
and i'll probably take some Windows
Phone device either an 8x or an 8 22
yeah maybe I'll bring I still have the
920 review unit we all bring that Tommy
tom is bringing 29 20s bethel the notes
no shortage of 920 is in Vegas so I've
been the reason I bring this up I mean
this might be really you know why do I
care what phone you guys are bringing to
CES but like for us this is like when
it's go time when you need to depend on
a phone when you need it to be rock
solid and last forever and be awesome
and save your life like these are the
phones that were picking yeah and it's
interesting the reason that we're
picking them like I would not use a
razor maxx HD as my everyday phone just
because the screen is terrible I'm not a
fan of the hardware the cameras kind of
lousy but when at the place thing like
CES or any trade show for that matter my
number one priority is battery life and
I can put up with a slightly lousy
screen I don't plan on taking a lot of
pictures as long as the phone is powered
on and has a signal that's like the most
important thing for me so signal is good
signal is definitely I remember I was at
the I think it was two years ago at CES
I was at the tmobile press conference uh
where I met Carly and they tease the the
3d LG tablet when you said currently a
thought you talked about teasing
something else oh no no dieter get your
mind firmly out of the gutter uh wait
did I say T I didn't say tease Carly did
I is it just move on yeah and everything
was failing I I had a I had an 18 key
hot spot I had a verizon hot spot on me
neither one of those were working i came
member if it was just like the signals
were saturated or I didn't get a signal
there what the deal was end up tethering
to a tmobile phone that I had on me that
was the only thing that worked which was
great and very you know it's like very
poetic that I was at the tmobile press
conference the only thing that worked
was my tmobile phone so you just you
just don't know you know I mean like and
you know CES covers so much ground
between the convention center itself and
the satellite events at other hotels
that you definitely cannot go there with
one form of connectivity it's a recipe
for disaster I tweeted about this I've
put it the forums but if you haven't uh
whether you're going to see us or not if
you're using a mac and you use an
android phone there's an app called
horrendous hor NDIS and it is amazing it
uses let you use Android stock tethering
us over USB stuff it's a basically a
driver for the mac and that tethering
over USB stopped working I think with
Android fours when they switch to our
NDIS and they basically like they had to
pick a tethering solution for you know
technically and Windows support it and
they're like well we kind of go with
what most confused so they use that but
so the Mac has this thing it seems to
just work and it's great and you don't
have you don't have to install extra
software it just you plug it in you turn
on USB tethering and voila have yeah it
works great so and i will say that i'm a
much bigger fan of tethering over a USB
connection then oh yeah a Wi-Fi hotspot
for a variety of reasons mostly being
battery life and interference but
interference is the one that most people
don't think of as being an issue but CES
it's huge as you yeah so here I'll drop
a link into chat we'll make sure to put
it in the show notes too and while I am
looking that up can somebody start
talking about they're expecting it CS so
we've gotten quite a few weeks of Sony's
rumored devices and I think you know we
haven't heard anything from as far as
leaks from Samsung there was a minor
rumor that hit today the HTC might
announce something and then obviously we
haven't heard anything from Motorola so
for those three manufacturers we haven't
heard anything but we have seen this
device a couple of times now the Sony
5-inch 1080p display smartphone tablet
hi
whatever you want to call it these days
that is allegedly going to be debuting
at CES and that might be the big mobile
news and then we've got a couple of
things from huawei and ZTE also with big
screens 1080p displays a quad-core
processors so I mean they'll kind of be
interesting last year or sony announced
um the ion at CES and that was kind of
their big deal which didn't turn out to
be a hugely successful product or even a
decent product well they also announced
the they also announced the Xperia S
there right yeah which which was the
more interesting device visually but was
you know it in the u.s. it didn't really
have any relevance because it came to
eighteen t is the ion but the the the
ion didn't have that cool transparent I
think the ion was a completely different
device the ion supported LTE had a
different hardware design and chassis I
mean it was like my name is like I only
have been a different processor yeah
well it did because I had to support LTE
so it had the snap s3 Snapdragon which
is I can't stand that ship oh I've chip
rage against it it had uh I don't really
want to go into all the bad things with
the ion because at those like one of the
worst devices of 2012 but hopefully this
new experience z ZL that's supposedly
going to come this year will be much
better regional we will have a better
screen it's going to allegedly have a
much higher resolution but hopefully it
also has better color and better viewing
angles and stuff something that every
single Sony screen i saw in 2012 had
terrible viewing angles and just kind of
like washed out colors and even though
they had high resolution for the time
that 720p displays they just were not as
especially if you put it next like a 1x
or but dances but dan you're forgetting
about Bravia Engine bravia engine and
reality display an innate magic yeah
yeah I guess maybe my better judgment I
am hopeful for Sony I mean we've talked
a few times about them making the right
moves in like supporting
open source and custom roms and there
was even that project that was briefly a
hosted by google and now i think sony
has taken it up about getting AOSP on a
sony device so you know if they can sort
of nail the industrial design and not
let AT&amp;amp;T ruin it and get something close
to the stock software how they're like
you know I would be really interested in
that like they they still have a shot at
my heart so I mean I Sony always comes
out with like they're the first one of
the first manufacturers usually to have
a high-end spec like a 12 megapixel
camera and you know they're one of they
were one of the first on the market with
the 720p display or well they weren't
the first they were a couple late on
that but the the high res camera you
know that the dual-core processors back
then but it was like even with all those
high-end specs that I would like
normally drool over and I was really
excited to see like just the whole sum
of its parts just have not come to get
out any Sony device out of use so yeah
hopefully they get that right and not
only the design but the hardware
execution where it's like you know it
works that is reliable and has good
quality and that's that's where they've
missed in my experience and I still
think I know that this is kind of like a
shattered dream now thanks to the Xperia
Play but I do still think that there is
room for synergy between the aleena good
to me yes there is there's no room
there's aa by the way Dan I hope you saw
the picture of you as Skrillex I'm
looking right now ok oh god no but I do
think so dieter imagine imagine and
Xperia Play executed correctly uh-huh oh
and I mean correctly I know no futzing
around the real deal like man I can
imagine a car designed by Homer Simpson
and it sounds amazing but in execution
it would be terrible no no dude look
the the Vita looked at the Vita from
what it is is a great gaming device the
problem is that dedicated mobile gaming
is a dead segment and Sony and Nintendo
are going to find that out more and more
and more over the next few years so they
can take the magic that they've that
they've you know funneled into the the
PSP and the veto over the past 10 years
and and and we channel that energy into
mobile i think that there's still
something very cool that they can do but
they need to approach it very
differently than they approached the
Xperia Play I mean and then they did
almost nothing right with the Xperia for
whatever happened to HTC being Pia
PlayStation Certified yeah what does it
happen them that is a good question that
happen at e3 right ah I don't know thats
hanging out with the open handset
alliance yeah the end of the upgrade
thing whatever that was called yeah
they're they're off partying in lands of
yeah unknown origins uh so did we
mention huawei and its 6.1 inch thing we
haven't there something like is like
Bruce if they're gonna yeah so I hit so
CES you know typically HTC has been
taking marble Congress lately samsung
does it whenever seems like every big
trade show Samsung's deal is yeah we're
not going to be there like they have to
set out a press release saying no the
galaxy s insert number here will not be
announced at insert tradeshow here we
clear CES has never been a huge deal for
mobile like writing but Sony's always
trying to do a little bit of something
there alongside everything else that
they do at CES and now it looks like
maybe like Khloe's trying to get some
attention there i mean i remember at
Mobile World Congress last year like
they promised that they were going to be
huge and they were going to be number
three on the planet don't know that they
managed a lot off numb but I could see
Huawei trying to be like well nobody
else is at CES we're going to put out
something ridiculous and maybe see if we
can get some attention and a 6.1 inch
phone is I think the definition
they're gonna happen Lee get eclipsed by
the 6.3 inch note you know I mean
seriously is good is gonna be a matter
of weeks before samsung teases well come
up with some like you know almost clever
teaser campaign that isn't actually
clever but almost is yeah you know and
then something about like filling the
biggest gap in their lineup and then you
know it's absurd like a so i have the
note 2 with me right here and people
keep tweeting at me you know when I
tweet about the note 2 they're like oh
used it for a few weeks and then you'll
be like how did I ever use something
smaller no you're wrong that's
completely absurd i I've had this
sitting on my desk and I touch it once
or twice a day just you know to remind
myself of how ridiculous it is um and I
could not get used to this thing and I
you know stepping up to 6.3 it's just I
mean I can't even imagine like it dieter
I know you and I were talking about this
before and they mention it on the show
to that the the problem with the note 2
is that you need to handle it like a
tablet not like a phone right because
it's too big to you know it's just big
enough so that like if you try to handle
it with one hand like you would a phone
you will drop it and it will break
because it weighs like 3 pounds since
that because it has a massive battery oh
yeah yeah stepping up to 6.3 it's just
going to be a complete recipe for
disaster and they're they're no longer
going to be able to do that you know
kind of uh you know wishy-washy is it
phone is it a tablet they're just gonna
have to be like look we made a tablet
that you can hold up to your face like
you know that they won't be able to beat
around the bush anymore we made a tablet
that runs phone software right and then
I I hope that somebody I'm not looking
at at our chat but I hope that somebody
is posting the jif of David Pierce
holding the pad from the good space if
ever a time is right for that jackets
right now so I'm really like I I can't
find it and for some reason it Phil
Dickinson that Android Central if you're
listening you need to find this picture
for me like the very first picture of a
person holding up
7 inch tablet to their head as like what
is going on with this was me with the
original Galaxy Tab and I can't find it
now it makes me really a nap so you're
saying that you set the precedent I did
and I you know was like so why are we
talking about oh the 6.1 inch quad I
phoned yeah you know is why we going to
get any traction in the US but it's just
like what are they racing toward like
what kind of insane pissing contest is
this like like what is what is the end
game you can't just keep making making
phones bigger like at what point does it
say okay we you know we maxed out do
they say that do they just keep going
until finally they realize that they're
up to seven inches and then they have to
they have to like co-brand their 7-inch
tablets just really it really makes me
mad they really grinds your gears huh
yes it grinds my gears deal with it you
know it's funny when i was using an
iphone 5 for a while I got so used to
the size and shape of that phone that
when I first picked up a Galaxy Nexus
after a couple weeks using an iPhone 5
is like holy crap how did I ever use
this this is oh it was a big the the
image has been founded chat bye-bye quu
but is it time-stamped if it's not I
mean who knows you could have taken it
yesterday dude no way knowing anyway not
with that haircut I look like 10 years
younger in this image man if if you're
watching or listening to the podcast
right now here must be really really
excreted now turn right now fine um yes
like anything else I'll see yes I mean I
mean I'm sure I'm sure that I my guess
is that ZTE will do something I don't
know what uh but yeah ZT will probably
do something motorola for as long as i
can remember
you doing something they've already said
that there they've like confirm that
there no oh right yeah yeah yeah the
Grand X yep yeah and Motorola
historically has always had very boring
presences at major trade shows I
remember in the early days of engadget
motorola had this weird thing where if
you like if you wandered into their
booth and start taking pictures of the
phones that are out on display yes they
would get all up in your face and like
send security over it was insane yeah
that's like I'm taking pic I'm taking a
picture of a razor that's been out for
six months settle down bro I'm dieter
I'm glad to know what it wasn't just me
oh it was I was I I assume that it was
just me because I figured all they would
never do that to Chrissy no they as far
as I know they detect every 10 and then
I had to explain what's going on and
like you know I did explain what what a
website was and you publish news to a
website but but so anyway that's my
point motorola typically doesn't do
things of importance anthea shows they
have a big booth a big pretty booth
usually there's just nothing new or
interesting there so I mean a lot of the
a lot of the manufacturers tend to leave
CES to the carriers and you know so
motorola might not announce something
but verizon might announce something
like the droid bionic which will look
totally different ten months later when
it gets you as well HTC always did that
like the evo 4g the evo 3d the whatever
the I guess the last evo was at the last
see ctia but they like they like giving
that sort of sprint was I don't see yes
the evo was out at CTA now I'm ctia I
was just the 4g LTE evo yeah never mind
no I meant the Evo's the previous the
wimax Eva uh the first evo 4g i think
was CES look god hey used to be a CES
like they'd have like some random know a
nice phone and you go and like you'd
like they have it like literally in a
drawer like I'd roll up and be like I
want to see your Windows Phones HP may
be like yeah where are they a lot of
drawers like oh here's
I think that the evo 4g was ctia yet was
it was ctia all right disregard yep so
it has a palm pre at CES to remember
yeah so the pole I want to talk about
the palm pre just because we were
talking about how we were told we have
to stop talking about webos we're
talking about the palm pre okay because
uh we're just talked about how it's a
motorola is at CES would like you know
don't don't look at that razor the wrong
way but like when Paul announced the the
pre like it was the weirdest thing ever
24 for you because they wouldn't let
anyone touch it like they took they like
hurried a couple people often to like a
back room to like hate to show it off
and then they wouldn't let you like
touch it or and this went on for like
six months until they release the thing
so a motorola is not alone in kind of
those easily well so there's this great
um this great piece on a website called
the verge where we we talked about like
the the the backstory behind the
creation of palm pre and I can't
remember the author that piece but it
was it was really well right I don't
think it was any more and and and
there's actually some discussion on the
lead up to that and how they they they
didn't allow journalists to touch the
phone I highly recommend you you read
the piece if you haven't it was it was
one of pockets 10 most pocketed pieces
of 2012 again not sure who the author is
anyway probably cuz I was way too long I
have that coming um yeah that's I think
that that manufactures have learned the
lesson that they shouldn't do that it's
because it's very hostile not just to
the media but then in turn to the
readers who want you know who are trying
to devour as much information on these
unreleased devices that they can so
that's this mobile at CES maybe we'll be
surprised by something but like
Microsoft thought not even gonna have a
booth there writing no no that they're
gonna have a presence but it's going to
be entirely off floor so yeah we'll see
what happens you know you know what
dieter we should probably spend a really
long time right now talking about
blackberry so so r it will rain heavily
yes yes ah they usually do yeah ah but I
don't think that they're going to be
showing off blackberry 10 devices they
may have some dev alphas devices sitting
out baby i want to say that they did at
at the last show i was at mobile can't
remember yeah but if they put out if
they put out a CES booth with just a
bunch of bolds people would like looking
the kiosks here you know Terry audacity
of them to have a booth at CES I just
have a bunch of 9900 d yeah so what's
insane to me is like just how thoroughly
all of them like the the z10 and what's
the other what's the keyboard wagga
dental x 10 by the way terrible names
like you don't know straight to Z and X
like I'm sorry I take the exam like this
crappy home security camera yes exactly
um like like everything about them there
have been videos and pictures and it's
like why what else what like they might
as well put them out of the booth at CES
because we've seen everything except
what you know that what apps are gonna
have I think that's the one thing that's
left is they can they're gonna announce
like what they'll do ecosystem they're
gonna have apps are gonna have their
gonna have whatever apps they write
that's how that's quite cool facebook
twitter foursquare yeah yeah pretty much
uh yeah i mean i don't know i guess i'm
looking for i mean like the gestures the
way they've implemented gestures in
blackberry 10 is just interesting enough
so that like i'm really interested in
trying it yeah but but the hardware does
not look that interesting
and this one this pretty keyboard thing
like you know you know me I love the
idea of going back to a trio form factor
candy jelly yo dude heck yeah Oh even
with innovations like SwiftKey and the
gesture keyboard for Calvin you would
still prefer a physical keyboard I think
I would or at least I would it would it
would be in the running it would still
like me I think I'm over that hump I'm
so much faster with a virtual keyboard
so the reason I like having the physical
keyboard isn't just typing speed and
accuracy it's also a getting crap done
speed and accuracy because if there's a
physical keyboard there you can just
start typing what it is you want to do I
can if I want to call Danna da enter
enough call again if I want to open up
you know a nap or whatever I can just
fit it and open it as you can see me I'm
doing it I'm really excited about
holding this in my hand but this
courtney one does not look very high-end
relative to what the non-core d1 does
and i'm hoping these adjusted r /
devices yeah the specs are gonna be
basically the same right yeah but I just
like you know like looking at the back
of it just I don't know they're very
boring looking devices i mean it's it's
obvious in there that they're still
trying to appeal to you know like the
classical blackberry user which is a
shrinking market when you consider that
a lot of these guys have long since
moved to iphones yeah and and so you
know torsten Heinz has been talking
about the fact that their you know their
market is now split into two pieces
they're attacking the the you know the
hardware side and then they're also
attacking the the BYOD movement which i
think is more of a movement now it is
now rapidly becoming the norm yeah and
and that that makes rims hardware much
less relevant and if they make devices
that look like this that's just going to
speed that push into irrelevance I think
yeah and I mean the thing to remember
about rim is that you know we just had
their their their last quarterly results
and it was literally the first time that
their subscriber base went down so we've
been talking about rim like going off a
cliff but there the graph of their
subscriber base has been going up this
whole time this whole past two years
we've been complaining about rim not not
you know knowing what they're doing and
not developing an OS and habla like it's
still been going up so it's just now
that they're finally having people by
eyes in I mean yes its internationally
and in the u.s. totally for market the
thing is it's going up but their their
revenues and their products I've been
like the opposite so I mean they could
always boast about big numbers but the
the financial results were were lining
up with it right yeah um by the way Tom
our own tom warren is trolling me on
Twitter right now and he's uh he's
asking me to keep pushing you on on rim
theatre he doesn't want to talk about
anything else just just I've you know
what else is there I want to try the hub
I want to see if the mall there
multitasking paradigm actually works um
and you know I don't know it's I'm I'm
you're you're gonna be talking to me in
March about you're making fun of me for
having you know give it a real try for a
month and what was wrong with me it's
really going to come down to whether
gmail works with it or not if gmail
doesn't work with it I mean it's it's
gonna be a non-starter for virtually all
of us but well it's gonna be it's gonna
be I map right that's hopefully a
working I map I mean because that's
better than what you get with gmail like
blackberry 7 yeah glad to say like reg
my ultimate role the ultimate troll I'll
be that by my 10 doesn't do two-way sync
with Jesus gmail an imap actually isn't
that good on even an iphone like there's
like I know Rene Ritchie a time or I'm
talk about all my old people uh
complains all the time about problems
that he has I haven't used gmail and I'm
app on an iphone have a long time but I
what I did I was you know there are
errors and timeouts and weirdness so uh
it's not ideal either yeah yeah it's
it's going to be very time een the
classic question that I keep coming back
to is how do they grow their market
segments with these devices because if
you look at you know yeah I hate to keep
making the comparison with Windows Phone
but you look at what Windows Phone is
done
between 7 7.5 and 8 and their inability
to grow market share significantly with
quite frankly what has become a very
good product and and you know it is so
so I keep asking myself if blackberry 10
comes to market it turns out to be a
just an absolutely fantastic almost
flawless operating system on very good
hardware even then does it matter I
don't know at best I think that they can
sell into their existing subscriber base
and like I said before that's a that's a
base that's shrinking and a base that
eat like even if you bring this updated
hardware to the table and it's great I
still don't know if it'll save well you
know the problem is they can sell they
can sell into their existing subscriber
base that's actually not a like that's a
more complicated statement than it seems
on its its face because they can sell
into their existing high-end subscriber
base that's you know there's hardly
anybody there anymore yeah well it's
their subscriber base is you know low
end and teenagers and messengers and
whatever else internationally and I'm
charming an email from the room PR
person telling me I'm wrong about that
but it certainly seems to be the case
and they're gonna keep selling those
blackberry 7 phones for I think it was
then you say like another two years
they're going to coexist which is like
busy yeah they aren't going away right
away so like selling into their existing
subscriber base they can always sell
into a small fraction of it initially em
there they need to expand that fraction
really really quickly yeah maybe
long-term the best play for them
assuming they're around this long is to
is to kind of employ the Apple model
where they keep the generation 1 like
very 10 devices around them those
becomes low-end devices when they
introduced the new the new model yeah I
think that that'll be difficult for them
once they talk to carriers because
carriers will want something newer don't
want something customized and things
happen and I mean the reason apples been
able to do that is because of the hard
hand that it's been able to to hold the
carriers back from demanding everything
so yeah yeah but if they are able to
pull it off it certainly seems like a
smart idea as far as to move the
blackberry 10 devices download it right
so it's gonna be really short mobile
show I think cuz we've got places to go
and people to see and things to do but
there is one last thing I definitely
want to talk about and that's this
report out of the wall street journal
that Google and Motorola are building an
x-phone and part of me wants to be like
well yes of course they are like okay so
what would the only interesting thing
there is that maybe they're trying to do
something different and more than just
putting out you know something like a
Nexus device but well the the first the
very first point I'd like to make here
is that the The Wall Street Journal and
I think this is frankly been
underreported and we heard it's much to
blame for that as anybody but but the
wall street journal basically got their
last nexus rumor wrong they said in
spring of 2012 that that a variety of
Nexus phones would be released in the
fall time frame and that that didn't
happen so well we don't have we had two
tablets on the phone yeah yeah fair
enough but I correct me if i'm wrong i
think the original Wall Street Journal
report said phones yeah I think you're
different manufacturers so uh so you
know that my first thing is that I you
know we can't take this wall street
journal report as gospel you know we can
we can certainly put a lot more weight
on it than we can on some other sources
but but it's still open to
interpretation you know it so still
could be you know some guy heard from
some guy who heard from some guy who has
a friend who's an employee at the
company and you know game a telephone
happens and and really this it just
turns out to be another high-end
motorola device that's coming out later
this year there's nothing else that's
special about it so just temper you know
remember a pessimist is never
disappointed as i like to say so so so
temper your enthusiasm and hope for the
best but what if I what if a pessimist
like ends up like going into a
restaurant getting a really awesome
burrito and it's like it's so good that
they're disappointed in their their
pessimism they wish they had spent
looking forward no no no the way that
would play out is it go in the
restaurant they'd say this this burrito
is gonna suck and then they eat him
they're like wow that was actually
really good and then there was only
surprised and then they'd be
disappointed in himself being a
pessimist that I didn't take it that far
I didn't think about that that you're
right that is a problem I don't know
what to do about it though uh you know
like so like they're saying bendable
screens and ceramics around the table
they might include gesture recognition
software I mean I want to say that I
don't know if we'll ever see a bendable
screen phone in in our lifetime because
it feels like we've been told the
bendable screens have been coming for I
don't know well so i'm gonna show
something to you again sure yeah yeah
yeah but but they're not so I mean
people are conflating the promise that
these manufacturers and everyone else in
the world is conflating what they mean
by bendable like when they're talking
about like a flexible or bendable
display what they really mean is that
it's mounted in some way in the phone so
that it's it doesn't shatter Riley give
you if you drop like it's not like oh I
can I can bend my phone like silly putty
like a we and we see we've seen concepts
like that in the past I think Nokia had
one a few years ago but it's it's
literally just like a block of of you
know bendable plastic that they're like
a a phone in the future might look like
this um and and no one has really given
me a compelling reason why phone should
be able to bend like that what we've
seen some really cool things where like
you know they're talking about putting
like wearable computers on soldiers
wrists so that they can have moving naps
like you know just by looking at their
at their arm I'd like to do that on my
wrist yeah well yeah but but you look
like a the problem is that you look like
a complete dork and at that point you
might as well just upgrade to google
glass like if you're willing to look
like that much of a dork just go whole
hog so so yeah there you know I I don't
think that the dream of a if it's really
anyone's dream of having a fully
bendable phone is anytime soon if ever
and think about all the thing all the
time if I had a fully available phone I
can keep it in my back pocket or it
could be a resurrection of the foot
yeah you can keep it in your back pocket
eater but then you you you pull it out
and it would be like bendy and it would
be here I prefer my phones vente just a
little bit a little bit of you know like
can you imagine like holding a phone
like this it's like a true thing on one
side I all I know is my phone is around
here is here the phone isn't on room
until I can take it out and throw it
against the wall and it sticks that's
when you know that it's right really
what Chris is asking is do you want a
flaccid phone and your wife dude is
going anything you had to go for the
other thing uh well in you know I look I
don't put a pass Samsung to develop a
flaccid phone because they're there
other that bait you know they have the
R&amp;amp;D capabilities certainly they own the
display it wouldn't it wouldn't be flat
so much as flaccid an S flaccid phone ya
know that they have everything they need
to pursue that development pads i think
what i'm saying is that they're going to
find that consumer demand for something
like that is virtually zero think about
like like 3d displays right on on mobile
I mean heck on regular TV is much less
mobile but the EVO 3d fell flat on its
face yeah I hope TC isn't listening to
this Cherie and uh and that is showing
no signs of coming back I remember like
18t came out with like 13 I can t
remember the name of it there's number L
I owned one thrill 4g QP you owned it
you own an LG Thrill that's that's i did
on what it was stolen that's great I'm
gonna hold that over your head and I
believe that's the ultimate troll that
someone stole a throw for Jeannie and
has to live with that now goaltimate
anti-theft device is ID so so yeah I
mean there's there's lots of evidence to
indicate that despite all the focus
grouping in the world and all the
research in the world manufacturers can
still go down entirely incorrect fat and
flaccid phones might be another one
those paths TC heard every word you said
just the fact that he's in our chat now
nice nice nice ITC I hope you're
enjoying your evo 3d remember when
remember when 20c scooped the those
those concepts of the vtc making the the
evo 4g LTE 3d then and the phone got got
canned and it here's how I think it
played out I think that TC saw that and
scooped and put it on the site and then
HTC or sprint read the comments on that
post yeah yeah TC don't worry man we're
gonna get your new phone soon oh man
sorry I remember TC gave me a very good
explanation as to why he bought that
when he did it head-on extra camera uh
yeah I believe its reasoning at the time
was that when he bought it he needed a
new phone it was the best phone on spray
as far as specs wise and when I think
back to it he's like right which is
insane but yes the you send it when in
reality how it actually played out his
TC wife and his friend and he's like
what what phone has the most cameras
they were like hearing it cameras is not
enough yeah I need a minimum of three
did you know that android phone name
generator calm exists yeah yessum pure
just like this yeah this is great this
is amazing ah it works really well too
they all sound legit a shirt droid neo
prime e 3d I I believe that was a real
phone this is amazing the same song
mytouch vibrat v thanks terraria Optimus
x 24 g + g 1 and we broke it it's now
giving me a bad gateway oh really we
broke it already it can't be right we
thought I got a kick oh wow alright
we're back Oh sony ericsson captivate
slides e 4g excited i can tell you
definitively that the version wobble
show is outside
too much traffic 280 site right you you
know how old this is by the fact that it
doesn't have LTE anywhere like none of
these have LTE in their name this needs
to be updated for 2013 so uh that's all
I want to talk about unless you guys
have something I'm gonna wrap a show we
should wrap soon I yeah I think we
should but we should we should tell we
should let our listeners know not to
worry there will be programming next
week live from big yes and plenty of
programming yes so much programming that
you're gonna be like oh my gosh this is
too much programming you're going to go
ground we're going to program we're
gonna reach out through the internet and
tell you what to do yeah so there's
little you know those little bottles of
5-hour energy you'll be slamming those
four weeks traits just to keep up with
all the programming we're throwing at
you this fire hose at programming yeah
anyway so we may do a little show we may
not we'll see but there'll be plenty of
other video to ingest yes and so stay
tuned for that madness in the meantime
if you wanna get hold of us you can we
are virgin mobile show at the verge calm
I believe the email addresses give it a
try see what happens you could leave a
comment on this post when it goes up and
you could follow us on Twitter all
together we're a dirge i met back on
chris's etsy power dan is at DC seifert
with an e I Vlad who is not here is that
glad say Bob if you haven't checked out
his hands on of the new blue to phone OS
you really should because it's awesome
ah you got to try it night in that's
worth looking at thanks for watching
