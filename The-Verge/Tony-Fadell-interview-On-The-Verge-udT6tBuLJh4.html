incredibly smart really good-looking and
has I think some very interesting
stories to tell so please welcome Tony
Fadell we got you simply got you some
water
whoa we're gonna watch out boys and
that's broken this is our thing we keep
saying we're gonna replace it but it's
more fun to just leave it and also way
cheaper yeah Tony Tony thank you for
joining us you're a fascinating dude
you've done a lot guess I mean you're
doing more stuff and I want to talk
about some of it here so I didn't do as
much before the Internet I actually
worked before the Internet what did you
do what did you do I was a great
engineer you should talk to Paul about
this so what did you do actually slept
better before the internet did you yeah
because you didn't get emails every
every five seconds yeah anyway did you
ever wake up in a panic in the middle of
the night thinking that you need to like
check your email absolutely yeah I did
the same thing right I refer to as the
editors nap but I guess you might have a
different name for it
insane it is it is insane he no little
you got to sleep better
you actually could have a weekend there
was not this flow rush of information
like Oh what do I need to buy now at
2:00 in the morning
I'm pretty just or to go out to the
forest and you know chop some trees down
and I don't know what do people do I
I had to do that back in the day yeah
you could actually go into the garage
and like saw some wood and build
something so so you weren't exactly in a
garage but you were at Apple a little
while ago and you were at Apple during
and we bunch of new stuff that we're
gonna talk about but I want to talk
about this a little bit you were at
Apple during a particularly exciting
time I mean it's always exciting at
Apple it's yeah they were they had some
dark years and they came out of the
darkness and you were there for like
that portion right exactly you were
involved in Rhian volved in the original
iPod absolutely worked on that I I
presented the original model right to
Steve did you yes you were like here's
what we should do I was a common for six
weeks was the wheel there I was a
contract for six weeks I presented the
the business and the
product you know a Styrofoam form and in
that meeting we signed off on it and and
when went ahead with it and you went you
started working at Apple building that
yeah just a few weeks later I joined the
company and and so who's responsible for
the wheel was it you so the response
floor wheel was actually a Phil Schiller
really Schiller Schiller was the best
very smart guy great guy he is a genius
hates Instagram now though apparently so
so but so you worked on the iPod you
worked on a bunch of iPods it was 18
generations so iPod Nano just about
every one iPod touch iPod touch iPod
clash of all shuffle classic the video
iPod the photo I had on is there a mini
nano the mini yeah the fat mini is the
mini the fat one yeah oh no that's fat
nano nano right right and then a dough
got really skinny right exactly like
weird is good it's yeah the only one I
really didn't do was the the one that
touched nano that's out now oh yeah the
one that's like basically every wants
making a watch exactly
and but you also worked on the iPhone
yes the first three generations so you
were there for the inception the
creation of the original iPhone
absolutely and how did that so how did
that go like how where did that come
from was that we did Steve you'll run
into the engineers I don't know where he
would run into did he run anywhere
probably not did he did walk in
somewhere and see what one asked yeah I
want to make this thing here's what it
looks like what was it and it was there
was all kinds of different just Stations
of it actually did three different types
of iPhones
there was a ipod plus phone and then
there was the iPhone and then there was
the next generation iPhone man that's
the one that actually shipped did he
have a keyboard none of them that was
there ever there was never a virtual
keyboard yeah but like there was never
version of like a QWERTY never really it
wasn't it was it even discussed well it
was definitely discussed it was it was a
heated topic really yeah absolutely
were there people that were before it
and people that were against it
absolutely you for it or against it I
had known a lot about touchscreens and
I've given my 15 years of the time and
so I was skeptical I wanted to try it
first so you really got a hardware guy
you were like let's do a hardware
keyboard no I was just I want to try it
I want it to work because it made sense
that you wanted a full screen you didn't
just want a little keyboard what the
biggest problem with the the
iPod plus phone was that we had a little
screen and we had this hardware wheel
and we were literally like we were
making an iPod and iPod making calls
exactly that seems like it would be kind
of not intuitive well you could make the
old dial well yeah I know a perfect
recreation of a phone that hasn't been
made in 50 years sometimes you have to
try things to throw it away yeah and so
but so you were there for that for the
original iPhone the
3G and 3GS that's right and then you
bail you're like ugh I hate making all
these wonderful successful products no
no I actually I hate all this money
Apple money that after the first year I
actually met my wife at Apple and we
were there for nine years and we were
running and working so hard and we had
two little ones a one in a two year old
is that common is there a lot of romance
on the Apple Campus yeah a lotta Lotta
hooking up yeah absolutely really real I
have some interesting started real nasty
stuff orgies or he's on the I never
heard of those but maybe my wife did she
was head of HR you are in trouble right
now okay and my apologies to your wife
first weird story anyhow but so you left
Apple in what year was 2000 and fish
aliy 2010 okay so not that long ago and
then you were like okay I can finally
make a thermostat did you ever picture
30 cuz did your go in there and say guys
we got to build a thermostat no really
not look like Steve I did not put this
over the next wave man no thermostat the
first person I pitch was my wife and she
went what she was like the IBI guy what
well it's got it's got a wheel kind of
it does you know absolute so okay so you
went into business you and you were like
I want to make a thermostat what was the
what was the was the desire behind that
like where where did that come from well
really I was I was with my wife
designing a next generation home a green
home and a connected home a fully
connected home I we were starting this
design before the iPhone came out and
before the iPad came out so I knew I
knew that those things were coming and
so I was saying when you have a device
in your hand all the time your interface
to the world how does the world around
you change is that is that illegal if
you know the product is coming to bill
the product based on it was just for me
and my wife oh you're like I just
doesn't gonna build one we know we were
just building a house okay
building okay so you were like the iPad
is coming and we said okay well how is
this house gonna change when you have
this interface right and so we went
through every single system lights and
all these different things and at the
end of the day I was going well I want
to control your thermostat because this
is in Lake Tahoe and you want to change
it because it's very expensive to heat
and cool the house right and so I wanted
to change it from anywhere so I was
looking all over the internet for
something couldn't find anything and I
just said like wife but they boy if I
connected thermostats at Home Depot
have you tried them Honeywell makes a
great Wi-Fi product not that I know of a
really tremendous do they not
not that I know I don't know I'm not
really I honestly don't know that much
about thermostats I'll be honest with
you before you came along I know I did
before you before nest existed I don't
think anybody in our industry thought
about thermostats I mean maybe if you
had to replace one you're like oh better
call someone to replace this thermos
exactly you did it maybe like every 20
years data everywhere you know my house
are like painted over you can't even see
the numbers on them isn't that actually
it's a common thing and and most people
forget that $1500 a year is what you
spend that thermostat controls so you're
like why is something so
underappreciated that costs so much
money and uses so much energy so you
said you were thinking about you know
holding these devices and wanting to
control them why not just make a box a
simple box and have the control always
be on an iPhone there oh that's what a
lot of people have said to me and you
know what I say and they go oh why
doesn't the the cell phone just you know
when you go away from your house it just
shuts this the house down so great and
then you you know when you drive up it
turns out again well typically the
people you talk to you bring up those
ideas they don't have a family they
don't have kids they don't have people
who are in the house so he goes like
does everybody have to have a cell phone
how does this all work right so you have
to think about the one that you want the
kids messing with the thermostat though
that's always a disaster they're gonna
turn it way up turn it wait and gotta
teach him rip it off the wall you got to
teach him the nest cannot be ripped off
the wall though can it it's actually I
don't know maybe it can't afford one and
then they were sold out when I tried to
buy one and this but now we have one
actually have some in stock so let's
talk about the nest explain to me
it's got a circular control it's kind of
it's it's got a dot these guys these
guys probably know but let's just go
through let's go through this did the
steps what does it do well in the net
the nest is as simply a round dial and
99.9% of the time all you want to do is
turn up or down the the thermostat right
do you just want to make it cooler or
warmer so very simply you just have a
ring and that's it and it's got a
display on it and it's got a display on
it it's a color display and it just
gives you the current temperature and it
shows you the target temperature and
that's about it it gives you a little
leaf on it to show you when you've
actually selected a temperature that's
more energy efficient than than you
typically than you typically select and
if you have more than one in your house
they can talk to each other they talk to
each other and there can control it
anywhere from anywhere in the world from
a iPad and iPhone and Android phone are
the apps or is it just like a it's a
it's an app or there's a web browser a
web browser app for any Safari or Chrome
or and ie and so just hardware startups
are really hard I mean that's my
understanding it's very difficult to be
it is small company making hardware it's
hard to give them finance yeah and it's
hard to find the talent because most of
that hardware talent has moved offshore
right most people don't design hardware
so what are the how does that work I
mean how do you how do you go to you
know from thinking of this thing to
actually go in and I mean you don't have
to give me every step but I mean the
obviously had to pitch this to to people
with money and say I want to make a
thermostat didn't work where people
resistant to this idea I mean was it
seemed to me like you would go we got
the money in less than 24 hours really
yeah well I've been in the valley over
20 years I've been doing hardware for
over 25 years I've been doing connected
services for over 15 years so basically
it's nice to have a hopefully a good
track maybe the freakin iPod ok give me
money and I'll deliver so so you did so
you did deliver you sold a ton of these
how many did you know how many you sold
I guess you would know how many we've
sold a lot we are a number we are not
sharing numbers but we are breaking all
of our what are our targets where we're
breaking busting through people are
freaking out over this thermistor we
sold five months of inventory in 72
hours in the first time you five months
of inventory we thought we were going to
than the store three weeks later we
didn't open for five more months because
we had so much demand and now finally
the store is open for all comers that is
insane
pret there brother mr. Herman you must
feel pretty good it's great what the
first day when we actually at our launch
party we just invited a bunch of friends
we had 500 to 800 people celebrating a
thermostat you now can you can you can
like do whatever you want to anybody and
just remind them of how well the nest
sold and they'll just let you do it you
can be like I'm gonna steal your car I
created the nest get out of my face you
know we did it we did a little bit of
leaving I'm leaving dinner in the middle
of dinner I don't care what you say Tony
Fedele made the nest right you do that I
would uh no not really
I'd like walk into people's houses and
like knock a face off it they would say
oh you probably thought well I created
the nest so that slowdown in 72 hours
don't get me what have you done you
don't do that that'd be my first thing
that I do sold through but you see the
back in stock now they're in so I can go
by once you can go to Best Buy and buy
one you can go to an Eskimo Pie and
they're what's through $250 $249 49 49
I'm sorry and most of them are actually
it's not viable to sell for 250 mm-hmm
why not just say 250 well it's not -
$49.99 it's - 49
okay it's a full dollar safe it's a full
day it is a mental thing though isn't it
I mean people really do you know there's
like that 199 is the sweet spot 99 is
the sweet spot - 49 it's like its kind
of premium but it's not - 50 is it no
but no it's not - 50 right so so you've
attracted a lot of attention for nest
the nest what do you call it we call it
the Nest Learning Thermostat you really
every time you talk about it we call it
the best kind of a mouthful and does it
does learn it I could absolutely learn
it sees your patterns your habits your
the temperatures of the house and well
the first thing is 10% of thermostats
installed there's 250 million
thermostats in the US only 10% of those
or any are programmed to save any energy
because it's so difficult to program
right and so literally when we now have
data that shows all of our nest
customers actually by it's by learning
have 99 99 percent of them have us
schedules that they've actually save
energy do you know how much energy
they're saving yeah we've seen it early
we've seen anywhere between 10% and 60
percent on average is about 20 to 25
percent because they they literally just
track your habits when you wake up you
turn into one temperature when you when
you go away another temperature when you
go to sleep a different temperature so
we just learn those patterns and then we
just play them back and then you share
that data to Facebook someday your NASA
be like check out this new Zynga game
it's a perfect display for like playing
Tempest do that something should happen
is there any opportunity of a game of
Tempest on the Ness cuz I that would be
like I'm buying one no question and then
I would be like oh I got it's cold in
here and that I'm taking what it's later
taking you know my wife would be like
what are you doing level level 18 and
tempest got in my face I do I do get
stuck do you do this I mean are you a
tinkerer I get stuck doing things where
I'm like got to go do this and I pick up
a phone for a second and then I'm just
like yeah you're lost own out for a loss
or absolutely so anyhow as I said the
nests attract a lot of attention some of
them were very heavy but a lot of it
very positive oh here it comes a lot of
a lot of people excited about it yes
very excited some people are heated some
people forgive the pun some people get
worked up about it little hot under the
collar honey well you've been you've
been sued by honey well yes we have for
for patent infringement yes seven patent
said seven pad seven pads and now
Honeywell has been around for a thousand
years where I was born the honey was
been around a long time
manaman and really do you know a lot of
companies that make thermostats but I
have Honeywell thermostats in my house
there aren't I know there are other
common sorry well then I snuck up and
over and they're old and they've got the
dial and I can't see them like I guess
it's on so they're suing the crap out of
you how does that make you feel
validated you know you know look we're
we're new guys on the scene we think
we're doing something really important
and they feel threatened
i its appear so yeah it appears so
because they didn't call us they didn't
say hey hey let's work this out man to
man they didn't want to settle they
weren't like you know what we see you
guys are doing some things that look
similar maybe we can try to sit down
let's talk and I didn't want to do that
they don't want to do that they just
wanted to publicly address it address it
in a court of law
okay and and how do you think you're
gonna fair in this well we just issued
our response and actually you guys post
it on the website we did it very much we
did post it I don't with me six page I
think response did we put us the whole
response yes well we're we like to be
thorough and neither Neela is a lawyer
so anything that's remotely legal he's
like strict like salivating and you know
that's like his take his jacket on say I
got to go to work he like clears his
desk that actually happens do you think
I'm kidding it's a little frightening
but but so so you're gonna you're gonna
go to corner on this over this well
that's what they want to do we'd rather
not but right but you can but you think
that you've got it you got a chance to
defend yourself welcome to win you know
when we looked at it all seven patents
they were clearly invalid and what we've
said was a baseless and and and did you
say they're worse than a patent troll I
have a case is that you're so well yeah
let me let me describe what if you look
at yeah damn right damn right I said
they're worse than a Tony Fadell I
created the nest knock over a vase yeah
just go for it no literally if you look
at IP protection out there you see
things like Apple suing HTC and that is
all about innovation but apples saying
let's play fair and then you look at
somebody like Microsoft and you saw what
they souling patents and all these other
things they treat it as a business but
once again they're treating innovation
is something that is good to have
we just want they want to get paid for
it they're it's a business if you look
at you know even classic patent trolls
they want inner innovation to thrive and
exist out there and so why do they want
that because they have some patents they
would like to get paid for theirs as
well in all three cases they want
innovation to thrive and be a great
thing in our case these guys want to
stay the status quo they want to be
number one and they want to use
basically crap patents against us
to try to intimidate us in
market intimidate our channel and
intimidate our customers they're not
they do not win an innovation to thrive
they're not like let's find a way to
work this out no they're like we're
gonna see you out they just threw it
into court they never called us right so
to me that means who would call you the
CEO he was here use the rotary phone
I've never Honeywell I wish you would
have called me I'm Honeywell dammit I
don't know really
Honeywell he's actually allied signal oh
he's allied signal and he changed his
name to Honeywell woody brought
Honeywell we're talking bout this
backstage that Honeywell was Honeywell
and then they were bought by a company
called allied signal courage by the way
sounds like a total totally nefarious
like you allied signal is not something
you want to deal with but then they went
they became Honeywell yeah they move
their headquarters from Minneapolis over
to New Jersey and they Jersey and they
change their name they're going to die
okay
they're gonna say guys your house and
you're dead man it was wonderful knowing
you all right sir z-boys so you're gonna
go you're gonna go you're gonna fight
this we have to well I know you have to
we have to and we are we have the best
in the business we actually have the
person who was next to me for getting
basically sued at Apple every every week
chip Lawton who joined the team he was
the head of the chief patent counsel at
Apple does now joined our team he is now
part of us he was been advising us for a
year Honeywell is going down Apple
doesn't screw around and I'm sure this
guy doesn't chip is off so I'm sure
you've got a pretty good shot well you
know we're gonna be tracking it
obviously I mean we're fans of
innovation I think this I mean you know
for for our readers and even for the
editors at the site it's this patent
stuff is like it's almost it just seems
to be overtaking the industry I mean the
fact that we're reporting you know 25%
30% of our stuff and I feel like we're
reporting on people arguing about ideas
right and it's it's a pretty it's it's a
pretty crazy point in our industry I
mean does it does it scare you do you
feel like innovation is being stifled I
mean I it looks like innovation is being
stifled I think that it it is being
stifled in the smaller companies in the
larger companies what they're really
doing is they're just fighting about
markets
and trying to make sure they get either
get paid or keep them out of the market
you know it makes them innovate
differently so it does put everybody on
- to think twice about what they're
doing and and how they're doing it but
and it does enrich the lawyers
absolutely enriches the lawyers good
time to be a lawyer it's ok it's a very
good time for you not just didn't
silicon but anywhere because you'll get
sued in the Court of Texas and the court
of right well I mean yet but but there
are a lot of there's a lot of Silicon
Valley lawyer there's active right
absolutely and you know they're loving
it and now you've got one we have we
have a great set of lawyers ok so so
you're doing the thermostat you're gonna
fight Honeywell you take Honeywell down
you're gonna you're gonna ruin you're
gonna ruin Honeywell I'm quoting you
those are your words I can say that and
I we're going to put Honeywell in the
ground so help Tony Fadell you said
those words they're a very big company
so what's after the thermostat is there
an is there a nest is there is something
beyond that the thermostat is well right
now right now we actually ship 2.0 of
our software and so we are continuing on
best
it's a tempest exactly actually putting
in more energy efficiency into the the
thermostat just be as software upgrades
that happen in the background but next
week we're actually going to announce an
energy report that comes with your your
thermosets so each month you get a kind
of a history of what you've done and how
you can save more that's personal but
but it makes sense though you've got
these things on the walls they're
connected they can talk to each other
home automation is a place that seems
like a likely area or a good area for
you to go examine you've consider I mean
home automation to me I have a new house
it's I think all the time like I just
wish there was some like the nest seems
like this very self-contained sensible
beautiful system for doing something
then happens in the house that you don't
think about that much is that a place
you might go I mean there's a lot you
can do in a house if you got things
talking to each other have you thought
about that oh we think about it all the
time I have my Rd house that you know I
go through and and a lot of times my
wife doesn't like what I do the house
would I automate it so I learned through
what are you doing to the house yes yes
I can't just give anything strobe lights
turning beds turning beds yeah boy
you're just in a lot of trouble tonight
so is that so you would get something
you consider we're looking at all the
things but frankly you know it's we're
still small we're still trying to get
enough production out for everyone we're
still trying to get to other countries
Nestor in all 50 states we've actually
seen them light up in Canada all across
Europe in Saudi Arabia and Japan so
we're still just trying to people are
there buying the states and then taking
them out all around the world so we
still just have to build our market
there's a huge appetite for this for
huge for thermostat there's billions of
things that possibly guessed this well
when you look at it thermostats 10
million or sold a year in the US 10
million Honeywell thermostats and your
to Bob and you're about to change that
yeah well we hope you are changing it
all right Tony thank you so much for
joining us really appreciate it right
now everyone and you gotta you gotta you
have to come back you got to come back
either when you're in the thick of it
with Honeywell you probably bill say
anything then but but when you win you
come back and talk about it thank so
much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
