security push here in San Francisco the
company held a hardware event to show
off a whole bunch of new products
including two new cameras and a whole
new home security system so in this
first product they announced today is a
update to their outdoor security camera
so this is called the nest cam IQ
outdoor essentially it's an upgraded
version of the original nest cam outdoor
that came out a couple years ago
although this one now packs the
technology from the IQ indoor camera
that came out back in May this camera is
now water resistant up to IP 66 which is
better than the original cameras IP 65
it's got a better field of view so it
can see kind of the full front doorstep
you know people who are really tall or
even if there are packages on the ground
it's got a built-in HTR so that if there
are lighting changes going on with
different weather effects or if
somebody's kind of blocking the Sun
it'll it'll still be able to see what's
in front of it so the original nest cam
outdoor needed the nest aware
subscription service to be able to tell
you when there are people walking in
front of it now this camera can do it on
its own and neces including that feature
for free
so if you're already a nest aware
subscriber or you're looking for a more
robust motion or person tracking system
this camera could do some pretty neat
stuff it makes you subnets sister
company Google's based net software it
can learn over time to recognize people
who come up to your door whether that's
family members friends the mailman and
then it will be able to send you alerts
telling you who that person is before
you even have to look at the camera
unlike the previous outdoor camera nests
made this one actually plugs in into
your house and into a wall outlet which
is for some people a little bit more
reassuring that they don't don't worry
about having something plugged in
outside so nest is still selling the
original nest cam outdoor for 199
dollars this one will ship in November
for three hundred and forty nine dollars
if you want to have that nest aware
subscription service that gives you the
facial recognition and a few other new
features that will cost you ten dollars
a month or five dollars after that for
every new device you add to it so if you
already have nest aware and you want to
add this
to your current system it'll be five
dollars more a month the nest cam IQ
outdoor isn't the only camera neces
announcing today they have a second one
called nest hello and as you might guess
this one is a doorbell camera it has a
camera up here a 1080p camera and has a
microphone and a speaker down here on
the bottom and this touch sensitive
doorbell ring like all of nest products
this one kind of syncs with the app you
get alerts when people walk up to the
camera and you get alerts when the
doorbell is rung it's the widest field
of view of any nest cam that they make
it's a hundred and sixty degree field of
youth it also has HDR one cool thing
that scalo does is called a quick
actions so effectively if somebody's at
your door they ring the doorbell or you
get the the person alert that shows that
somebody is standing in front of your
door you can then pick from a quick list
of actions and even automated voice
prompts so well then go down to the nest
hello and communicate with the person
standing in front of your door
another feature nessus building is the
brought up guys tentatively called warm
welcome and that's gonna be a glow that
shows up on the light whenever it
detects somebody walking up at night
that way you kind of acts as a welcome
to you if you live there or it also acts
as a deterrent in case somebody thinks
they can walk up to your door and they
see the light they think they're being
watched they they get out of there
so unlike the other camera nest is
announcing today this one does not come
out in November
that's just shipping this one in the
first quarter of 2018 we don't yet know
how much it will cost nests big message
here at it's Hardware event is that they
want to add more security features and
more security products so the central
focus of Messick here is the nest guard
so this device it plugs into the wall
connects over Wi-Fi and it sits near
your front door essentially this is
where the alarm will go off if anyone
enters your home now there are three
ways you can turn that alarm off you can
either use one of these key fobs here by
tapping it right here on the nest guard
you can of course give these key fobs to
friends and family they even have time
limits on them so you can set the time
limits in a mobile app that determines
when these key fobs can be used to turn
the alarm off you can remotely
turn the alarm off using this mobile app
or you can now put in a key code here
there are no numbers
this version of the device but it will
have numbers in the final product Nessa
secure also has a remote arming system
so say you leave the house or say the
last person who's leaves the house your
your son your daughter and they forget
to arm the system somehow the mobile app
will send a notification to you asking
you to remotely arm the system if it
doesn't detect anyone's phone in the
home so necess whole secure system has a
few other gadgets going on besides the
guard and besides the key fob these
little devices here are called nest
detect these are essentially motion
detection systems and they detect when
doors are open or closed so this device
here it sticks right up near the jamb of
the door and it pairs with one of these
smaller devices here and they
communicate using magnetism so
essentially if this device detects that
this one has moved so if a door is
opening or if a window is opening
they will then trigger the alarm one
thing to mention about the nest detect
is that it has a quiet open button so
say you want to get up really early and
you want to go for a jog just like that
you don't want to basically set off the
alarm and go through that whole process
press this button here and it'll
basically briefly disarm and then rearm
the security system
one last hardware product and this
family is called a nest connect so this
is just a booster for all the other
devices and then in the event you have a
large house and you're worried about the
signal basically reaching all the
different devices the reason this is
important is because nest has made a
secure system modular meaning you can
add you can add on new key fobs you can
add on new detects you can add on as
many as you like basically they all
they're all sold separately and you can
create an entire system where every
window or door at least the ones you're
worried about have these motion
detection and door opening and closing
systems hooked up to them one thing to
mention is that in the event of a storm
or in case your Wi-Fi goes out you're
probably wondering like how do I get in
my home so Nest has a t-mobile backup
option or you can pay for they also have
a professional home monitoring service
called monney that will effectively
alert law enforcement if the alarm goes
off if you want to opt in step through
the cell backup from t-mobile it's gonna
cost you five dollars a month or $50 a
year Nest hasn't announced
singing after the the third-party
partnership with money Nesta selling the
whole secure system miss November for
four hundred and ninety nine dollars if
you want to add on new gadgets in this
family an extra nested tech will cost
$59 and an extra key fob will cost $25

single product Nest announced today
