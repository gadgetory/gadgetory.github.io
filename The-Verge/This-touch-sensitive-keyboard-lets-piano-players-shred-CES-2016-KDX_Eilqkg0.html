CES 2016 and we are here talking with
Roland Lam he is the CEO he is the
founder and he is the inventor of the
Seaboard which is really crazy looking
keyboard we actually saw it I think
about a year ago but now we're seeing
the new one the Seaboard rise a smaller
version so what was the impetus for
making this like what where it kind of
went into the idea well it fundamentally
came from jealousy because I you know as
a keyboard player like a jazz pianist
and I really loved music and going out
gigging and stuff but when it came up
time for like the guitar solo or the sax
solo I was like why can't I do that on
the piano you know if you can bend all
the notes and you can kind of like milk
all the sound out of each note and
really add depth of expression and you
just can't do that on the keyboard
the Seaboard has five dimensions of
touch so the piano you get one dimension
of touch and that was a big deal 400
years ago when the piano was invented
when you say dimension like just like
how hard you're hitting in there well
yeah in the case of the piano it's how
you strike the key okay allows you to
control soft to loud like the pianoforte
the name of it came from that dimension
because harpsichords and organs you
couldn't control that like you just
turned on or off the note but in the
case of the piano you could use how you
would strike it so the C word can do
exactly the same thing based on how you
strike these key ways you have I tried
that not at all
so start out with by striking the key
okay that I can handle exactly now after
you've struck I know you're like this is
amazing right I I cannot believe what
I'm seeing before me after you struck
you have to strike the key
you can you know where you can see down
here you can glide up and down like this
you're able to basically glide left to
right you can also control it by sliding
up and down I see that the key so you
break a note and you can move up and
down vertically as well and what is that
actually doing well this is changing the
sound
she's the different ways you move all
changed different sound primers and
actually I just I just turned it on here
so you can each of these parameters or
dimensions you can turn on or off so if
you want to play it just like a keyboard
you can but if you want to have all of
these other dimensions you can turn them
on and what's really great about that is
like let's say if you want to play a
guitar sound you it's all about bending
the notes right if you play a sax ound
it's more about how you press in
so this is the Seaboard rise this is the
you know this is what the dollars yep
and it comes with a software called
equator which allows you to map a lot of
these different sounds to all the
dimensions of touch but then just
recently in December we released an app
as well so you could control this
seaboard vise with your laptop but also
the sound engine could be in your phone
it's a pretty powerful app and it's
partly because we spent so many years
developing the Seaboard and the 3d touch
technology within the seaboard and the
sound engine that we could then easily
apply it to like the new 3d touch API
within the iPhone if you want more
videos like this not as musically
inclined maybe but for got to do is
about more CES news you can take it on
the verge comm and subscribe to our
YouTube channel and if you get like a
million subscribers for this we're just
gonna hire Marco make them do anything
go so I'll be youtube.com slash the
verge thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
