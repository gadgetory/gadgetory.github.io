between planes and threats controlled
from the ground has seen one more by now
you may have heard stories of drones
flying where they shouldn't you don't
want to try to do that like near an
airport or over a crowded stadium or
even above a wildfire drones are growing
in popularity but to some people they're
also an uncontrollable nuisance
this is supposed to change that
this is arrow scope
it's Chinese drone maker DJ eyes new
solution for detecting rogue drones it
looks like your standard Pelican case
but packed inside this box are antennas
processors a crystal sky display and
specialized software that lets you see
and identify drones flying overhead
provided they're within a few miles and
this is just running Google Maps so
you're layering your own information on
top of Google yes that's right if you
click in on a drone you'll actually see
the historical information of where it's
been flying near by you so for example
if we're a sensitive facility
and I see a drone just flying circles
out in the background that's not a
problem
but if I see something playing straight
towards me high-speed that's something I
want all want to investigate right DJI
is aiming this new product at public
safety officials thank airports prisons
railways and disaster sites basically
places where drones flying overhead
could be problematic so we went and
talked to one of these officials nick
martino is an operation specialist at
the ventura county department of
airports where he and his team have been
beta testing an arab scope prototype
since early october first one was great
it just had some glitches the second one
a lot more stable and the range is a
little better which is great because we
can really protect that five-mile
airspace bubble Martino also flies
drones himself he uses them for tower
inspections and to monitor wildlife at
Camarillo Airport it's still restricted
airspace but in this case the airport
ops team has gotten drone approval from
the FAA so when he's not flying drones
he's looking out for them I joined him
on one of his patrols around the airport
with the Aero scope box which he calls
the gizmos
you avoid any testing aircraft and
sitting with types of inspections air
4/7 how many alien life-forms have you
spotted out here with this thing alright
just two yeah I think there's a bigger
concern that we're colluding with Russia
right now so that's the most common no
idea that the heliports exist so if you
zoom out we should see an icon yeah
and we'll wait for it to get a bearing
you get a lock there he is so we have an
active drone but I do see a gmail and
that's an opportunity for us you're
relying on someone seeing that either
right
we got a hit yeah we have an inspire
that looks like Port Hueneme
so now what we can do is we can
essentially send them a friendly email
introducing ourselves in the airport and
hopefully engaged what does the email
usually say the airport doesn't approve
or deny any FAA or any UAS operations
but here's the proper method to getting
approval to flying within you know the
restricted airspace aero scope works by
picking up the communication that's
happening between the drone and the
drone controller it decodes the
information in the signal and then it
displays the telemetry and drone data on
the Aero scope screen the drones flight
path only appears in the map when the
drone is powered on or in the air once
the drone is powered off it goes away on
the map a narrow scope only tracks DJI
drones at least for now but the history
of the flight is still stored on the box
and you can still see a pilot's email do
you think this makes DJI customers
nervous
I think the vast majority of users want
to operate safely and responsibly what
happens if a law-enforcement agency
sees a drone flying in restricted
airspace finds the operator can they
ticket them at that point I mean what
happens to the drone operator on earth
it will depend on the situation and the
local rules and regulations but at
minimum it starts a conversation or an
investigation path so that if there is
some sort of penalty that needs to be
put in place law enforcement and
regulation regulators have that tool at
their disposal Harry also pointed out
that unless a drone has been registered
you won't see the pilots email on the
box and he emphasized that DJI solution
is a localized one not a networked one
unlike say our cellphone networks so
it's probably worth taking a quick step
back and looking at why this drone
detection tech has to exist in the first
place the TLDR version is that
innovation has outpaced regulation
drones are growing in popularity almost
3 million personal and commercial drones
are expected to be produced in 2017
according to a report from research firm
Gartner which is nearly 40% more than in
2016 but despite their growth the rules
around drones are still super confusing
don't fly above 400 feet don't fly close
to airports don't fly over people or
beyond visual line of sight or a fly at
night so those are some of the key
fundamental ideas terms of airspace
that's there's no question the FAA
controls that space but then what you
actually do on particular property that
can be interpreted to be a local
decision where things start getting more
complicated is when you start applying
in areas with restricted airspace which
is why dozens of companies and agencies
have been testing drone detection
systems including the FAA itself a
couple years ago the FAA started
partnering with agencies like the
Department of Homeland Security and
technology providers like khaki to test
drone detection at airports you know
right now we just kind of have a Wild
West situation of just everybody just
does whatever they want and there's no
real enforcement mechanism which you
know that the date the biggest danger I
think is that you'll end up with a
situation where during this phase in
which we don't have quite the right
level of regulations or
fools or systems and the infrastructure
the danger is that something bad happens
during this period of time that then
kind of sours the public's opinion of
drones in general that's Grant Jordan
he's the CEO of Sky safe a SAN
diego-based drone control start-up
that's working with the military to keep
unwanted drones away but sky safe
doesn't just track drones
it also intercepts them and Jordan says
that's what the real regulatory battle
could be about hacking drones to take
them down when they truly are dangerous
okay so taking down drones might look
cool but there is a catch intercepting
drones for the most part is illegal even
if it's with a roll of toilet paper
according to the FAA certain drone
detection and mitigation capabilities
are restricted by title 18 USC and other
applicable US federal laws most federal
agencies as well as state and local
entities and private parties are subject
to these laws some federal agencies have
specific legal authority exempting them
from these laws but yeah for the most
part illegal and so one of the things is
that if if this is a commercial UAS and
it's registered commercially and you're
intercepting a registered drone are you
intercepting a registered aircraft and
that's a big question right now in the
industry and I think that coordination
between the local government and the
federal government they'll continue and
we'll get a clearer picture on that
Christine I hope that's technology that
your team is working on how to remotely
control a drone i from our perspective
we think that any technology that
develops in that space is gonna need to
answer some very fundamental questions
one is about the legal issue and more
importantly also about a safety issue so
a lot of the implementations and then
thinking around taking control of the
drone we believe whether it's a forced
landing or even causing a crash it
causes a significant safety concern
so whatever solution is developed would
have to address those two questions
what does safety really mean when it
comes to drones the answer probably lies
somewhere between sending a friendly
email to a drone operator and shooting
one down from the sky yourself most
drone makers and even some safety
officials like nick martino will say
that the bad eggs are few and far
between that most pilots want to fly
responsibly and just need a little more
education there's no doubt that the
industry is stuck in somewhat of a
holding pattern while it waits for
important policy decisions to be made in
the meantime companies like DJI are
using drone detection to learn more
about how people are using drones and
that information might be the most
valuable part of all of us
exactly four times
beep-beep-beep beep-beep-beep did you
consider using the AOL dial-up sound
that's definitely loud and obnoxious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
