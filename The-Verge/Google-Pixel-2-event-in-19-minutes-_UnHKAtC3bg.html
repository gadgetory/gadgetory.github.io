joining us we've been working hard
continuing our shift from a mobile-first
to an AI first world we are rethinking
all our core products and working hard
to solve user problems by applying
machine learning and AI we design for
the spaces our product live in and we
take inspiration from the materials and
colors that people already use to make
their home more warm and inviting with
that we are introducing mini the newest
member of the Google home family for the
four LED lights under the fabric are
there when you need them
lighting up to show you that it hears
you or it's thinking and you can control
it by touch give the fabric a quick tap
to pause your music adjust the volume or
talk to your assistant we embrace mini
circular shape to project 360 degrees
sound so it's really crisp no matter
where you stand in the room and if you
want bigger sound you can easily connect
mini to any chromecast built-in speaker
wirelessly we created mini in three
beautiful colors coral chalk and
charcoal mini will retail for just $49
in the US and it's going to be available
for pre-order online starting today and
in stores starting October 19th from
major retailers we're also really happy
to announce that mini is coming to all
seven Google home countries you know
making it more thoughtful home it's just
one way to help make our joyful hectic
family lives a little easier it'd be
hard to gather the household together
for those family moments like dinner
time or movie night we're launching a
new feature called broadcast just say
hey Google broadcast it's time to leave
for school got it broadcasting now the
assistant will broadcast a message to
all the other Google home devices in my
house it's really great parents are
going to love this feature
it's kids are gonna hate this feature
okay finally I have one more exciting
edition to share that's coming to the
Google home family
say hello to max our biggest and best
sound at Google home ever
just like the pixel reimagine the camera
will do the same with sound with a
combination of great hardware and
software powered by Google's machine
learning capabilities the first thing
you'll notice is how we obsessed over
the base its 24.5 which will first have
22 millimeters of excursion an extremely
high range for their size that means
these Wolfers can move a lot of air only
max to really hit those low frequencies
it's one of 20 times more powerful than
Google home so they'll fill any room in
your house with amazing audio to sound
great the speaker needs to adjust to you
and your home so today we're announcing
smart sound a new audio experience
powered by Google's AI it allows max to
adapt to you your environment your
context your preferences so for example
if you set up a speaker near wall on a
shelf in a corner fairly common places
it can dramatically change the sound
balance of the speaker to make the music
sound muddy and the vocals lose clarity
well with smart sound we automatically
tune the speaker to correct for this
effect using a machine learning model
trained with thousands of different room
configurations and over time smart sound
will automatically adapt the sound to
fit your context lowering the volume in
the morning raising the volume when the
dishwasher is running or just adjusting
the tuning bass the type of media you're
listening to whether it be music
podcasts or news and Google home max is
designed to be incredibly versatile and
fit naturally in your home you can stand
it up vertically place it horizontally
its base magnetically pops into place so
when you change Max's orientation there
aren't any rubber feet where they don't
need to be Google home max will be
available starting December for $399 and
it'll come in two colors chalk and
charcoal now edition launched in the US
with more countries coming early next
year
meet Google pixel books the high
performance Chromebook
pixal book is the thinnest lightest
laptop we've ever made at just around 10
millimeters thin and a kilogram light
the 12 point 3 inch touchscreen display
is gorgeously high resolution with
vibrant colors deep blacks and enough
brightness to use outside even on a
sunny day we developed an extremely thin
keyboard that's comfortable to use with
soft touch keys and a backlit design
that helps you work from anywhere with
Intel Core i5 and i7 processors pixel
book packs a punch it offers plenty of
RAM to handle your multitasking needs
and gives you up to 512 gigs of storage
the long lasting battery provides up to
10 hours of use from a single charge and
plugging in for just 15 minutes gives
you 2 hours of battery life you can even
use your pixel book charger with your
pixel phone and in moments when you
don't have access to Wi-Fi pixel book is
smart enough to automatically connect
through your pixel phone we call this
instant tethering we're also excite
announce that pixel book is the first
laptop with the Google assistant
built-in so pixel book has a key that
puts the power of the assistant right at
your fingertips
letting you type your requests and when
you're using your pixel book as a tablet
it's easiest to show your assistant what
you need help with on your screen that's
why we created the new pixel book pen
just hold the Pens button and circle an
image or text on the screen and the
assistant will take action when you're
browsing through a blog and discover a
new musician you can circle their photo
and the assistant will give you more
information about them the pen is also
handy for moments when it feels more
natural to write draw or take notes like
when you're using your pixel book as a
tablet the experience using a pen should
be like writing on paper to bring that
experience to life we partnered with the
engineers at Wacom and together we build
the
this most responsive stylist experience
ever with just 10 milliseconds of
latency 60 degrees of angular awareness
and 2000 levels of pressure sensitivity
pixel book fully supports Google Play so
popular smartphone apps are now
available on a laptop in fact it's never
been easier to put the final touches on
your favorite photos in Adobe Lightroom
and then post them straight to Instagram
pixel book starts at $9.99 and the pixel
book pen is $99 both products will be
available in the US Canada and the UK on
the Google store and over a thousand
retail locations including Best Buy
pre-orders start today and they'll be in
stores beginning October 31st today
we're proud to introduce the Google
pixel to designed for you with the best
of Google built in we've created the new
pixel in two sizes a 5 inch and the 6
inch XL pixel two's front-facing stereo
speakers are precision tuned to deliver
the perfect balance of volume clarity
and frequency response if you prefer
headphones use your existing analog
headphones with the included adapter or
your digital USBC headphones for the
highest resolution audio all the way to
year years or avoid cables altogether
with your upgraded Bluetooth 5.0 support
and high five codecs the smaller 5-inch
pixel tube features a full HD OLED
display pixel 2 comes in three colors
kind of blue just black and clearly
white the six stage pixel two XL was
designed with innovative P OLED display
technology we elegantly curved the glass
to bring the display to the edges for a
full screen immersive viewing experience
the screen supports 18 by 9 qhd+
resolution with over 4.1 million pixels
which equals 538 pixels per inch for
amazing detail and we've optimized the
displays on both phones for virtual
reality
they're both daydream ready the pixel to
excel comes in two colors just black and
the stylish ly simple black and white
feel free to choose whichever size pixel
you prefer because you'll get the same
great experience on both we don't
set-aside better features for the larger
device both devices are ip67 water and
dust resistant and have an all-day
battery the charge is super fast you get
up to seven hours of charge in just 15
minutes we've also made it faster and
easier to get to the Google assistant on
pixel 2 with a new feature called active
edge just give your pixel a quick
squeeze where your hand naturally holds
the phone and ask for whatever you need
here's a quick demo I just I just
squeeze the phone take a selfie one hand
no buttons help me out front row the
pixel 2 has a 12 megapixel F 1.8
aperture rear camera with optical image
stabilization this year we've increased
the dynamic range and improved texture
and sharpness and combined with a new
autofocus mechanism an optical image
stabilization to reduce blur from shaky
hands you get amazing shots every time
like this and this pixel too also brings
you portrait mode but we're implementing
it a little bit differently other smart
phones do this by combining the images
from two cameras pixel to does portrait
mode with just one camera and machine
learning what's unique about pixel 2 is
that it can generate a true depth map
with a single lens so you get beautiful
portrait shots without needing a second
camera
the way this works is that the pixel to
camera includes a dual pixel sensor
technology this means that each pixel in
an image contains a right and a left
view the difference in perspective from
those pixels combined with machine
learning models trained on almost a
million photos means that this works on
really hard cases like a busy colorful
background and yes this does work with
objects too and there's more portrait
mode doesn't just work on the main
camera because of the quality of
Google's computational photography with
a single camera you can also take
portrait selfies through the front
camera on both the pixel 2 and the pixel
2 XL the pixel 2 takes amazing videos -
we're applying optical image
stabilization simultaneously with video
stabilization at the same time during
video recording on a pixel - the OIS
Hardware actively correct shake
artifacts while at the same time the
software based video stabilization uses
intelligent frame look ahead to
stabilize the overall video the pixel 2
camera also supports a feature called
motion photos for the photos you take
your pixel captures up to 3 seconds of
video behind the scenes removing
uninteresting motion and applying our
unique fuse video stabilization
technology to the results so to recap
the smart and simple pixel 2 has
everything you'd expect from a
smartphone and some things you might not
we're also making it easier than ever to
switch to pixel most new pixel users
will be able to transfer their stuff
from their old phone in less than 10
minutes including all of your photos
apps and even your iMessages pixel -
with its 5-inch cinematic display starts
at six hundred and forty nine dollars
for the 64 gigabyte version the pixel to
excel has a six inch fullscreen p OLED
display and starts at eight hundred and
forty nine dollars both phones will be

of your new phone and the Google

US we've also been working on some new
products to make your pixel to

great sound delivering clear highs and
deep bass controlling your music is

pixel buds with your pixel two you get
instant access to the Google assistant

your assistant to play music send a text
or give walking directions all while
keeping your phone in your pocket it can
also alert you to new notifications and
read your messages pixel buds work great
with pixel they even give you access to
a new real-time translation experience
it's an incredible application of Google
Translate powered by machine learning
that's like having a purse
translator by your side Isabelle is
going to speak Swedish into her pixel
buds and I'll hear the English
translation out of pixel two's front
speakers and then I'll respond in
English and show here the Swedish

november for $159 and pre-orders begin
today we have one more product to show
you how do you capture those fleeting
spontaneous moments while letting
yourself be part of the moment so we've
been working on that and I'm really
excited to share an entirely new type of
camera that works with your pixel we
call it Google clips and this first
edition is specifically designed with
parents and pet owners in mind so you'll
capture more of those spontaneous smiles
first steps and first tricks now clips
has all the things you would expect from
a great camera a high performance lens a
powerful image sensor it has a shutter
button but that's not what this camera
is all about we reimagine this camera
from the inside out to build a camera
that takes photos for you so you can
enjoy the moment and instantly get shots
you couldn't get before when you're
behind a camera you look for people you
care about
you look for smiles you look for that
moment your dog starts chasing her tail
clips does all of that for you turn it
on and it captures the moment so you can
be in the moment and because the
software is at the core of the camera
it's gonna get smarter over time clips
is tiny it weighs almost nothing so you
can easily toss it into your pocket and
it's a hands-free camera so you can get
these amazing new perspectives on your
experience and get yourself in the shot
by attaching clips to almost anything or
setting it down it looks like a camera
and it has an indicator light so
everyone knows what the device does it
looks for stable clear shots of people
you know and you help the camera learn
who's important to you and finally all
the machine learning happens on the
device itself so just like any
point-and-shoot nothing leaves your
device until you decide to save and
share it so here's some clips I've
captured with my family at home now as
you can see it's not just photos that
clips is taking taking little snippets
that capture the whole moment we call
those of course Clips you can save them
as a motion photo or choose any frame to
save as a high resolution still clips
will be coming soon and selling for $249
