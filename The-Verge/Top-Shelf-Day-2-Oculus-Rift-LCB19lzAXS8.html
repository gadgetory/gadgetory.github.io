of top shelf our show about all the
gadgets and weird things and robots and
spiders that we found here at CES show
floors open so we have all kinds of
stuff to talk about I'm here with my
co-host
Nilay Patel hello this this shows on
about conspiracy theories it's also
mostly about conspiracy theories I feel
like I have really wild hair today so my
hobo effect is like do you have like
extra conspiracies now yes you got some
sleep last night DOS I did I slept on
you had more time to think about
conspiracy drank beer until I passed
down yes I wander the streets of Vegas
that's good then I fell asleep on the
ground I mean it's like that's Vegas
that's oh you're supposed to do Vegas
that's good yeah my cab drivers I get in
and they're like where you gonna end up
tonight that's not always their first
question really that's a weird I'm gonna
be in bed cuz I have to work tomorrow
I Drive this Ferrari time to sleep right
sorry so we have all kinds of crazy
stuff today so you know floors open
there are what is it a hundred and fifty
thousand people here now yeah a hundred
fifty six thousand I think is the number
three and a half million square feet is
just absurd I'm trying as hard as I can
million of those square feet are the
Sony and Samsung booths that might
actually be true like I don't believe
they have like competing armies yeah
yeah that's actually more like competing
video demonstrations of nothing
competing 4k Taylor Swift okay so a
bunch big stories saying yeah including
more gaming stuff I feel like this isn't
supposed to be me showing out if you're
kind of a gaming show yeah so there's
this thing called the razor edge we saw
it last year we saw last year called the
razor project Fiona but now it is back
again it's the edge it's an actual it's
kind of a tablet it's kind of also it
isn't it's a really thick giant you saw
the video there it's a really thick
giant Windows 8 tablet but that's not
primarily how they want you to use it
right they want you to dock it into this
place they should move looking thing
it's this double this double move
looking thing and there's a keyboard
dock as well in this hole and it's so
it's games right it's games and Windows
and yeah it's running Ivy Bridge it's
x86 it's full Windows 8 you can run all
your games like this with these move
controllers but it's incredibly
expensive yeah so it's it's it's a
thousand dollars just for the thing
itself and then there's a the gamepad
dock which is the thing with the two
controllers on the side is 250 more
dollars and then there's a docking
station which is 100 more dollars so
this thing is like it's it's no joke
so $1,500 later you have not quite a
gaming PC basically but you do have the
respect and admiration of your friends
because you are insane do you do you
understand suppose you put especially
after seeing like the Nvidia yeah
project shield which seems really kind
of tight and put together and like well
thought-out this just doesn't well the
Razer comes out every every year TS
Razer has something black curse right
cuz they're like a peripheral maker
right that's what they primarily do
they're like regular nutso Mouse this
keyboard lights up right and they're for
gamers that's not Razer to German knife
on the buttons instead of like letters
right and I think they want they want
the respect right so they come out with
stuff and so it eventually comes out
right I mean they put out a laptop right
with like a lot of keys yeah the the
razor blade which is the same kind of
thing it's this incredibly high-end
product that most people can't afford
and most people never even eating this
we're like someone's like damnit guys we
can't always make puns with our product
names
I hope not that it genuinely oh because
they're running at the razor's edge is
like that's enough oh the rusty razor
there it is that's the one that's gonna
be their smartphones next to the gaming
smartphone for us Tyrion with the huge
guy yeah I mean it's yeah it's fine I
mean look they it is gaming show there's
stuff coming out yeah there's a lot of
interesting tablets man there are so it
one in particular well not really
this isn't interesting as much as it's
crazy so Panasonic yeah came out this
morning they had the opening keynote
this morning on a show floor and use it
to release a 20 inch 4k tablet which
kind of sounds crazier than it actually
is
the resolution is 38 40 by 25 60 yeah
which ends up being lower pixel density
than save the iPad right but it's still
20 inches it's right okay
right well so it's a but I feel that I
just sounds awesome but just wow
your vertical Heights it pixel density
mechanics how is your pixel density
tight is it tight I'm glad I'm sorry so
everyone watching this the one thing I
do think is cool is that they're kind of
billing this for artists and
photographers and it has a stylus input
which I actually kind of makes a ton of
sense it's window it's full one is a
there's an arm or x86 I believe it's x86
so it's like a it's basically she's a
really nice PC that you can take at work
and I think there is a market for like
Pro photographers we're all using iPads
now they have insane bonkers workflows
yeah somebody what a photographer
actually sent me a like a flowchart of
how they get pictures from like their
mark to on an iPad it has a real yeah so
like there's a big market for this at
time I will say this 4k is a marketing
term at the CES getting tossed around
far too much and like a 4k tablet is
really just like you can go buy a dumb
monitor that has effective 4k resolution
shit right now and it's like $500 check
it's just that's like the term everybody
wants to you got it yeah
and speaking of 4k Panasonic also had a
4k OLED TV which was basically the same
thing as Sony released last night yeah
and it's just this like hilarious back
and forth well yeah but Sony Panasonic I
mean they all have the same panel
suppliers so it's like the panel
suppliers have done something and all
the big companies have productized it in
some way
yeah but like all the TVs are truly it's
like so if you went to a car show and
everyone was like showing off
convertible that could maybe fly and
like they all have the same bad idea the
same time right it's coming it's just
never gonna happen
yeah same day and you probably can't
afford of anyone right yeah so we're
going story the thing I actually think
is a lot cooler is Intel perceptual
computing it's called it's basically
connect yeah and we're seeing a ton of
these demos here where there's you know
you're using your hands and you're doing
all kinds of different motions as
opposed to using just attract that and a
keyboard and we've seen like I literally
have a video this is Sean Hollister I
think but I have a video of me doing
exactly the same thing with leap motion
and there's a company here called point
grab and so this is like this is a thing
actually dignity
I'm sorry it's my fault but this is a
thing and I feel like especially if
Intel is getting on board like Intel can
just brute force this kind of technology
into every winner they could if you make
you put it in a platform I mean that's
and this is gonna sound like a really
weird compares to make but that's what
they did with Wi-Fi right they said
Wi-Fi as part of Centrino and then the
next year all the laptops had Wi-Fi
right and it was they was driven by the
platform this little creative do the key
that they're making is like whatever
they made it connect you're not gonna
put on your laptop like this but the
next generation laptops I will say that
Intel is here trying desperately to
prove that they're relevant yeah I mean
I think until like they they've lost
mobile I think we can fairly safely say
that they're they kind of have an
insurmountable deficit now I mean
they're gonna in mobile like there are
no Qualcomm party exactly that exactly
but no I think and so they have to so it
seems like if they're if they're gonna
you know double down on PCs so to speak
right they they have to go kind of way
ahead of the game and try to it's
exactly you're saying like they have to
say we're innovative we're still doing
cool stuff we still matter and I don't
know if this is how you get there I
don't think it is what I'm waving the
laptop is the right way to go but I will
say that there is an insane portion of
it we talked about a little bit
yesterday there's an insane push of this
whole show to put sensors on everything
and connect the sensors to some sort of
centralized computing device and that's
this it's just they're just it's just
Wilder sensors it's instead of knowing
how far you've walked the computer will
like look at your face and know how much
you've cried I have to say that the
terror is becoming the tech is becoming
amazing like you can tell the difference
and they're crying a lot this year I'm
worried about you tears and pixel
density like a Nilay Patel story but the
tag is getting a lot better I have to
say it's like you can tell the
difference between your fingers and if
you have something in your fingers it
can tell that that's there and then your
fingers and it's really it's awesome
like I would I have no particular
practical interesting but it's my
computer knows what's in my fingers
exactly fair so the the other thing
which happened just a few minutes ago
which I actually think it's hysterical
as back to TVs which you know it's a TV
show that's where it's see yes so
Samsung and LG within like two hours of
each other yeah both announced the
world's first curved OLED TV they both
use the phrase world's first yeah it was
a curved it's the exactly we're
describing like they all have the same
panels it's the same
you know they had the same thing and
clearly their development process was
absolutely identical but they both
release the same thing and it sounds it
sounds like it's wild I haven't seen
either one in person yet but our folks
who have say it's gorgeous and like
actually seems well all the TVs are
always gorgeous right and putting them
in wacky shapes is like actually one of
the promises of the technology they just
nobody can make up well so why here's
why why do I want a curved TV convince
me you seem like you're kind of into the
idea so you can stand closer to it in it
so really view also the idea is that I
can like turn around and get four inches
away from my my TV and still see it
that's cool I'm excited they might as
well be in this this stuff is like they
might as well make a triangle let's just
go for it dude just come on make a
triangle tea facility like it 4k has a
Content problem stuff that takes
advantage of being curved is like the
worst content problem yeah okay yeah but
it's giving you a hug well so these are
they're just showing off their let's
show off I mean and they won't this sort
of the big tech comes to phones
they'll make Samsung has always been
doing curves right displays for phones I
think that makes more sense there but I
agree
I mean it's Samsung's whole thing it
seems like both of the companies are
like what crazy tech demo can we show
off that'll never be a protege that'll
never be a real product but look at what
we can do yeah and I was even have to
photo CES I guess yes but so it's like
80% of the fun of seeing 80% yeah I
think I've seen a price and release date
for like one thing it's a guess so far
even I was Senate right man yeah yeah
yeah so well speaking of your content
problem thing Sony should talk about
Sony happened last night we should so
first of all you were at Sony you went
how was the event I was really good you
know you know Howard Stringer is like a
bombastic presenter so he gave the Sony
chance for a long time yeah and he just
doesn't he never cared about anything
was trying to represent her cause a
little more direct
he's great he's just not it's not the
spectacle of the stringer it's not we're
gonna have Will Smith dry in a car on a
stage which actually happen there's
Taylor Swift did not play you would she
were kind of sad about I was sad about
but you know I think that's actually not
necessarily cause is very open with I've
been CEO for nine months I need to
revitalize my deal
of Sony and they were they very much
kept on pushing Sony's the only brand
you have an emotional reaction to which
is like maybe I think that's true from
like people my age right I don't know
that's true for younger people I don't
think they might have a Playstation up
they probably have an Xbox so they have
a lot of work to do is a little bit less
respectable but the products are
actually interesting so that's the
Xperia Z so yeah so this is kind of the
flagship new product from Sony five
inches
1080p which seems to be like the new
sort of standard for a flagship phone
yeah and I really like it it's a
beautiful fun I will say it's hilarious
it has a glass back it's like the entire
industry in the lesson from apples like
that you don't will shatter immediately
but you know it's very nice it's a
really tight package I actually like the
software it's not stock obviously right
but Sony's always assured as long as
when it comes to this lock screen is
sweet when it comes to interest rate is
always done a good job
it's this weird kind of it's not broke
in effect it like shatters the screen
and I really like it service but it's
awesome yes it's cool it's just neat and
yeah it's good to see something
different happening in logic yeah well
so and I mean so there's all kinds of
cool stuff it's got a 13 megapixel
camera and Android 4.1 but you wanted to
do this I do I'm happy about this and
you can do that which is fun I mean
that's awesome yeah it's it's silly I
don't know why you need to do that well
so I have to say like this morning so I
was I was brushing my teeth this morning
this actually happened I was brushing my
teeth and like was running water over my
toothbrush and like a little tiny bit
splashed off and got onto the screen of
my phone which is sitting assisting and
I had like a 15 minute long panic attack
that my phone was broken forever you're
weird
it's just it's what I it's what I'm used
to with all of my electronics that like
if anything ever gets wet it's probably
broken forever and I'm screwed yeah but
so I think I mean I just like the idea
and it doesn't seem to have like maybe
let me say one worse yes it does in one
specific stupid way the headphone jack
is under a flap on this phone so to get
put headphones into it you got to open
this dinky little door that seals the
headphone jack away from water and that
is at what cost man
at what price must we pay so you can
brush your teeth over a phone yep come
on so so Sony had this and another phone
and a bunch of other stuff but one of
the as with everybody the big thing they
talked about was 4k and so Josh Topolsky
art editor chief we may have heard of
sat down with Kaz Hirai after the event
and had a bunch of questions for him
about 4k specifically Oh
so obviously the TV's are gonna be
available the big question that
everybody has the stuff we see our
readers talking about the debate we have
amongst our writers is you got the TV
how do you get the content right and you
talked yesterday about distribution
you're going to be the first distributor
of 4k content where how do you how do I
get it where is it coming from is it on
a disk is it am i downloading it how if
I'm a consumer and I get my TV in the
spring when where and how do I get
native 4k content onto the ball great
questions and you know we're going to be
announcing details I know as we get into
the spring timeframe right and really
make some announcements to make sure
that you know the customers when they're
buying their 4k televisions from Sony
they understand you know how they're
going to get the access to write the
variety of content right but right now
you've got an 84-inch we have an 8:40
and there's a sort of a server set up
yes where you can essentially you're
getting it's a hard drive it's very
loaded caught for a person that's not
your plan for the future system or
distribution plan that we have right
strategy so obviously it's not just
limited to X number of movies or other
titles right may be pre-loaded right but
in fact making sure that you know
consumers can access new and additional
content as they become available right
but you don't see that as physical
medium I mean I don't it's not going to
be native 4k discs there's not going to
be a standard that it ultimately I think
that you know as the industry evolves 4k
the industry may decide that a disc
format might be something that the
consumers are looking for but at this
point
before we get in
- is that something that is that we were
looking for distribution you are you
looking at that as a real possibility
that you think they'll be a standard I
think the industry needs to make sure
that we come up with certain standards
because again you know we want to make
sure that it's not just movie content or
the programming content but as we
announced yesterday you know we want to
make sure that we are also providing
customers with the ability to go out
with their 4k camcorders right for
example and that's not that has to be
based on a platform so that you know the
the material that you take on your
camcorder is playable not just on Sony
right 4k monitors but everybody else on
your cousins - it's gonna work yes
that's interoperability that we write
guaranteed so Sony's talked a lot about
4k and they have this kind of unique
story for what they can offer
but you've talked to cats right - yeah
and you got kind of a different answer
for what they're doing with 4k well the
vibe I get is that so I talk to calves
right after Kino and we do you the
question it they announced a world's
first 4k digital distribution service
right and which actually did seem to be
true unlike all the other worlds what
they just don't know what it looks like
right and so it's like how are you gonna
do it is like we're gonna figure it out
and you know right now there's shipping
people like a PC like he said to Josh
and then to Josh she's saying we're not
ruling out anything
maybe we'll have discs you know maybe
you'll download stuff overnight so Sony
has the content they have the products
right and they are desperately riffing
on ways to connect the two right and the
thing and Paul wrote a great piece that
the the thing is that it can't just be
Sony building a connection between
content and devices it's got to be the
entire industry coming up with a set of
standards because I think the consumer
expectation is that you can buy it to
achieve a TV and a ps4 and watch 4k
stuff well the expectation is that it's
gonna be what blu-ray was then what DVD
I mean in that like this is what you
watch and all you to just find a thing
to watch it on and you can watch the
same exact that's what I think that's
not only just good for consumers I think
it's actually good for the industry but
isn't that mean how could that not
happen I mean it seems to me that it's
it has to happen that way like every
company has to be aware of the fact
that's what I think I think I think if
you're Sony
you're aware of it and this is what this
will cost said to me last night
actually he didn't quite said Josh which
was it should be that way our service
should work on the TVs but for now it's
a differentiator
so for Sony because they have you know
they make the movies and then ya can put
them on the TVs they're gonna say well
these only work on our TVs well they can
I mean the read between the lines there
is they can make sure you don't buy a
Samsung TV right because making sure
these I want to watch won't work right
and making sure you don't buy a Samsung
TV is critically important for Sony
right and I think they're gonna export
but that sucks for us right well so but
then there's like the the hopeful pieces
of it or like it's Samsung's booth today
we saw Netflix streaming in four way and
there were little like artifact T issues
but whatever it's 4k and that's awesome
and it seems like that's you know that
gives me hope that it might actually
work and eventually Saudis gonna have to
realize that not everybody owns a Sony
TV and they really like it if you'd
watch Sony movies on your not Sony TV
look watching the spider-man on my Sony
TV is the only thing I want to do just
by 4k doesn't matter how much it costs
me I mean there's there's a lot to
connect I mean Sony's the only one if
you go to Samsung or LG or Toshiba what
they're talking about is upscaling 1080p
if you go to Sony they're talking about
making native 4k right and distributing
it to some house and at least that's a
step one is I guess that's true and but
it's because they make the cameras and
they make the movies yeah and they make
the TVs so it's like Sony is like well
we don't have to go anywhere else to do
more stuff but they can't be the lone
holdout
I don't yeah I don't know and I guess
eventually it'll shake out and we're
just sort of screwed until then I just
won't buy a 4k TV and so I'm definitely
my 4k there you're gonna buy the the
crazy ezel next you've got it for 400
thousand times TV is like the most
beautiful thing it's yes next year in it
when they are like two grand or so I
brought you think it'll catch on yeah
you
all right fair enough so we have one
more thing to talk about and it's
actually the coolest thing we have to
talk about by far it's called the oculus
rift it's a virtual reality thing it's
also like the greatest name ever and
make the Ingram one of our news writers
went and got to take a look at this
thing so let's take a look at that hi
this is Nathan with The Verge we're here
at oculus and we're taking a look at the
rift this is their virtual reality
headset and the piece of hardware we've
got right here is the developer kit
which is shipping out to Kickstarter
backers at the end of March and it's
pretty simple
what you see here strap goes around your
head and there's two lenses here that
you look through for the 3d virtual
reality experience and the total
resolution of the screen is 1280 by 800
each eye receives 640 by 800 input you
know the resolution doesn't sound is
impressive as some of the high res
screens you see today but we've been
assured that once you put it on you're
not even going to notice that we'll find
out soon so that's basically all there
is to the prototype hardware here
there's a box right here the control box
this hooks into your PC it's got a DVI
port HDMI USB and power and that's about
all there is from a hardware perspective
but we're really looking forward to
checking out is the software and how it
works once you put it on so we saw this
video and we're like super into this
idea and Nia and I were both like we
have to try this immediately so we
actually brought some of the folks from
oculus VR here this is Palmer Luckey the
founder and so Palmer tell us like what
what is this thing that we're looking at
here so this is a prototype of the
oculus rift Developer Kit it's basically
a virtual reality headset with an
extremely wide field of view and
ultra-low latency head tracking so that
it actually makes you feel like you're
inside of the game so what's like what
give me an idea of how kind of how this
changes like especially for gaming how
this changes how you play games well
that's one of the things reason we're
putting out a Developer Kit you know so
people can mess around with it and tell
us how they think it's gonna change it
but um one thing for certain no no pay
attention what one thing that is going
to change for certain is that
is that games it's not just about maybe
having a task-oriented game where it's
complete tasks complete tasks complete
tasks and that's where your enjoyment
comes from one cool thing about VR if
you actually feel like you're inside of
space and that's okay you can at you
actually feel like you're inside of the
space and that's huge for immersion so
many games that have replaced immersion
with you know trying to accomplish goals
now it's actually about being inside of
the game and just being there might
topple on its own it might not be enough
but it's yeah it'll be something you
don't across America who want nothing
more than just be lost and like the
marathon spaceship yeah no much in it or
amnesia or something like that I have it
right so it's what I got faced really
bad yes all right all right so take this
hold up to your face move it up and down
until it's in the sweet spot okay okay
oh God
you done pretty good Oh God oh come on
in a spaceship you good I'm all right so
tell me tell me what we're seeing so
what this is back here is this is a
stereo stereo can you still see it no my
foot just hit this thing oh we're back
yeah I swear I had a heart attack all
right I'm about so what so what this is
this is a stereoscopic 3d image it's pre
warped you can see to work for our fish
basically they're fisheye lenses yes
this is our unity integration so unity
is a great engine we also have Unreal
Engine integration and code so you can
put in the other engines but this is
unity right here this is just a small
space station it's a tech done well you
can't really do much in it but you can
do a few things so we're just looking
around as this is like somewhat Neil
eyes two eyes are seeing yes what what
you're seeing behind here is what he can
see just for people noticing you know
trying to analyze latency or anything
the input on this TV has quite a bit of
latency so it's actually not lagging
nearly okay I'm wearing this thing I
mean as I'm talking it's moving up and
down and on the image is moving up and
down black which is crazy like it knows
it knows it's on my face all right so so
what you're gonna do is look all the way
up this isn't yeah look all the way up
now also show like try touching your ear
to your shoulder the tilt your head okay
so that that's something that you can't
do in a normal in a normal game you
don't get any roll effects
can I go someone yes you can go so
here's the controller the right Stickle
movie alright so take it easy try to use
the your head more than you're using
right bums stop looking at this fan and
I can like track that whoa dude okay I
know that be looking a fan is not
awesome for you but it is super trippy
from me so you can go like downriver
this is whoa God so I'm not good at
video games I don't know if that's
obvious to everyone this is awesome what
some stuff oh god oh god oh god there's
a camper I'm gonna I'm gonna throw up
from watching you doing I mean I will
say like this is ridiculous like it I
don't like 3d things I usually get a
headache and hate myself but this is
legitimately like awesome 3d so like
virtually feels like I'm in this room
yeah up to those sparks try looking into
the middle action feel like there that's
what further walk further there you go
no no I'm on fire
no this is awesome like I I don't you
can probably see this on the screen
behind me but this feels like these are
falling on me which ah and it actually
feels like those pipes are actually
running by your head yeah I mean yeah I
know these pipes I'm pointing nothing
are you that's that's the level of
immersion then god I gotta copy he was
just trying to pop into place yeah no
that's a level and then I feel like I
can point at things when I'm wearing
this I mean I also feel like I'm
chaotically moving her out of space
there you are chaotically moving I might
have to say here's my moving one at a
time this is like drunk Neil and
especially I want you to know if I could
move my body like this in my real life
this is what I would do
haha oh my god I'm dancing it's like
you're the flash have you ever seen me
on a dance floor at a nightclub on drugs
it's it looks very see it actually looks
like I'm wearing a headset Oh God
whoa yeah there's a joke okay that was
really awesome that looks like I was
gonna hit my head like I stopped because
that is about head height you're me in
that that is very uncomfortable well
that's one of the cool things about VR
is you actually notice the sense of
scale in the environment alone yeah I
mean this is like I'm I'm like inches
away from this I want it
that's where hello again I like to point
out but for the average of you are with
this looks like you're amazing
no I see stupidly yep oh my god hello
dude can I go to medieval village oh hey
now all right this is ridiculous so so
now he's in a completely entirely
different place in just a few seconds
yes but I'm also just doing this dance
try to use one thumb good time No so one
last you use one thumb when you can use
two well use your head instead of the
thumb tomorrow doing that yes so tell me
where are we in the process of this
becoming like I think I can buy and play
games with so you know we're shipping
developer kits in two months for $300
because he shot is a Kickstarter yeah
was this yes so we started as a
Kickstarter raise two and a half million
dollars to ship developer kits as far as
when everyone's going to be able to do
this that really depends on the feedback
that we get from developers you know
we're putting these out there so that we
can hear what you know from people like
him and say these are the improvements
that we want to see this is what we
really need and then we can deliver that
in a consumer version so I can't like
Piron things know so well right now all
you have is rotational tracking our
trackers currently a gyroscope and
accelerometer accelerometer and a
magnetometer so it's only netting you
basically rotational tracking and also
if you roll your head we have it on a
neck model so it knows your head can
only move in a certain way so you get a
little bit of position there but if
you're doing this you're not going to
get anything I don't know what if I lean
forward and lean backwards I don't get
anything that's something that we're
working on for the consumer version it's
it's basically a must-have kind of
feature to keep players from getting
disoriented to really
can app that feel of immersion I'm gonna
take the controller one more time and
I'm gonna put you in a medieval village
because you wanted to be there yes so
we've got what other kinds of like
movements and stuff can you program into
this what else have you tested and
thought about doing movements in terms
of what your head can do or just other
things that means I could be doing right
so one of the things that we're looking
into doing is integrating different
kinds of motion controllers so that you
know we think it'd be really cool in a
future version to be able to see your
hands or to be able to hold a weapon and
actually move it around in a real space
or track your whole body and those are
all things that works better right
okay so the thing I can't do in 3d is
like I can't look around this thing
exactly you don't have any positional
tracking right now which you know you
probably missed it cuz you were thrown
so enthralled but we've it that's one of
the things that we'll be in a consumer
leaving the village ah I look like a
bird so I'm producer just said to my ear
I look like I'm so excited that's
exactly correct I do like a terrifying
blind bird that might kill you it
anymore I mean oh God one interesting
thing you know right well that this
isn't a next-gen controller it's just a
gamepad because it's a tested you know
interface it's good for developers to
use for programming and so what when you
say developers are you talking to gaming
companies or like Indies people or like
oil so I mean I come from the indie
community you know the hacker enthusiast
community I think that there's gonna be
some really amazing stuff that comes out
of Indies and small studios that are
just building stuff from the ground up I
mean I'm just I'm excited about like
coming up to this building and looking
up to see what it is instead of like
having to like run away and look at the
sign is like very different like it's a
very it feels like I'm in this medieval
village I would like I mean if I could
just sit on this rock and maybe get some
wine and some cheese it's a very
relaxing just sit and drink someone real
real life wine and cheese and yeah VR
village I in a lake it's a little pond
oh god I could just sit here for hours
but there will be triple-a titles that
that'll be really interesting but I
think that the most interesting thing
overall will be Indies who build games
for VR from the ground up because like
the iPhone the best games are not the
you know ports of first-person shooters
there the one that use touchscreen
analog sticks they're the ones that were
designed with the hardware and right
it's the same thing for probably the Wii
where there's some games that used it
maybe a gimmicky fashion
shoehorned in yeah Nintendo first party
titles most people would agree they
utilize motion controls in a really good
way I think it's gonna be the same way
for VR people are gonna have to make
games that are designed with virtual
reality in mind I don't know how to get
out of that pun
so you it's a one it's your as a one-way
ticket at which at which point do i
trowe i which one does the headset alert
me that my lungs are rapidly filling
with water
oh I'm out of the pod why did it there
you go
so when can you give us an idea of like
the timeline of all this you're shipping
out to developers in two months
and so we're shipping out to developers
in two months we're already working on
prototypes of the next-generation
consumer version we're not going to ship
it until we have time to get feedback
from developers but it's not going to be
one of those things that never shows up
or takes years and years it's going to
be in the relatively relatively near
future fair enough well thank you so
much for coming out and showing thank
you for having me if only Friday
unbelievable gifts that we're about to
see of nilai Batali's two guys doing
this away from my head so alright that's
awesome keep laying that's cool I'm
gonna stay hold on you'll be fine
oh god let's make sure his eyes are
bloodshot are you good yeah I'm good
this is it worse out here you'd rather
go back I mean there was very relaxed
yeah I found a way I laughing is this
gonna be the new massage chairs where
you go and you get like chairs who
though when you put it on the medieval
village for a while yeah I would say
about taking that off and coming back to
this space actually felt like returning
to this space as opposed to like turning
your TV I'm not looking at a screen
anymore and that's what it's all about
being inside the game yeah cool well
thank you again thank you thank you so
much for anything that is thank you that
is our show we'll be back tomorrow we
have all kinds of other stuff we have
first tomorrow morning with all the
other stuff that's going on in the world
of CES there's a lot of it we have a ton
of videos all over our site of crazy
gadgets and people and interviews and
check all of that out and we'll be back
tomorrow at 3 o'clock but until then I
leave you with what is almost definitely
the best video this is definitely the
best thing we've ever done in our lives
