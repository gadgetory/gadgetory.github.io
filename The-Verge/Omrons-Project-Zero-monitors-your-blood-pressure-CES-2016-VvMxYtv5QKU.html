and we're looking at Omron's project
zero wrists blood pressure monitor so
the interesting thing to note about on
Ron's monitor is that while it is a
wearable you know familiar form factor
what you see with Fitbit and stuff like
that it's a it's more intended to be a
medical device than a sort of casual
wearable that you would use to track
your steps or to monitor your physical
activity on Ron's intent is to make it
easier for people to monitor their blood
pressure on a daily basis and to
integrate that activity into their lives
in addition to this wrist monitor
there's also an upper arm monitor that
performs the same function so it's
really quite simple to use all you need
to do is turn it on with the center
button and if I were wearing this on my
wrist I would flip it over and press
here to start engaging the blood
pressure monitoring I was wearing it
earlier and as I was wearing it and it
was taking my blood pressure you know I
could feel it palpably inflating and
then I could feel that decompression
same thing that you would feel if you
were you know at a drugstore and you
were testing out the stores blood
pressure monitor is the exact same kind
of motion and then what you can do is
once your results have been recorded you
can send them to your phone to an app
that you have via bluetooth pairing so
that's pretty convenient in terms of
monitoring Omron isn't looking to you
know gamify blood pressure monitoring in
any way or make any sort of diagnosis
it's just intended to be a tool that
makes it easier for you to keep track of
your blood pressure on a day-to-day
basis if it's something you're
struggling with and to monitor that
condition so yeah this is on Ron's
project zero in terms of availability
we're looking at somewhere near the end
of 2016 at a price point somewhere
around two hundred dollars that's it so
thanks for tuning in make sure to keep
it locked to the Verge's youtube channel

going on during CES</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
