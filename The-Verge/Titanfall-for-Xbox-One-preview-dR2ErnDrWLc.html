I'm dealing with the verge and this is
titanfall when we talk about this new
generation of gaming this is the title
that comes up in every conversation it's
arguably the first true next-gen game
for Xbox one the one that was in all the
console launch commercials even though
it wouldn't come out for months it's
most next-gen feature is the way
titanfall blends multiplayer and
single-player games the demo we tried
was mostly standard kill-or-be-killed
multiplayer but titanfall is designed to
add some cinematics and AI directions to
make the game feel more like a campaign
even when you're playing with other
people the developers think your xbox
one is always going to be online and
connected and the game takes full
advantage at its core titanfall is a
team-based first-person shooter set
sometime in the future essentially it's
about pilots and Titans hyper agile
human soldiers and the giant mech suits
they can climb in and out it's like
David and Goliath if David had a jetpack
and was a parkour expert and Goliath
used a shoulder-mounted rocket launcher
it isn't as one side as you might think
though from the point of view of a Titan
pilots are very small and out in a open
their cannon fodder but every pilot has
a jetpack that lets him run on walls and
free run quickly through dense buildings
pilots can attack from any angle change
direction midair and each one has a
rocket launcher or some other anti Titan
with the extra freedom and control is
actually a little jarring at first but
it very quickly becomes second nature
the important thing though is that
you'll never be stuck playing either a
Titan or a pilot for very long every few
minutes faster if you play well players
can call in a Titan from the sky and
start wreaking chaotic havoc with
cannons and missiles like most modern
shooters you can customize the weapons
and equipment for both pilot and Titan
more options become available as you
level up and more weapon modifications
unlock as you play a lot of the
customization feels like Call of Duty
and for good reason titanfall is the
first game from respawn entertainment a
company founded by former heads of the
studio that created call of duty and
shepherded it through modern warfare 2
really most of the game isn't exactly
breaking new ground but where titanfall
excels is creating a sense of scale and
balance it never feels too unwieldy
controlling a huge Titan or too erratic
running around
is a much smaller foot soldier even
though the whole world is climbing the
game is designed to keep you constantly
engaged even when your team is getting
crushed there's chance at redemption by
ejecting from your Titan or heading to
the evac point titanfall is due out
March 11th for Xbox one and PC an xbox
360 version from outside developer Blue
Point is due out two weeks later
Microsoft really needs this game to be
the next halo the killer app that makes
people go out and buy an xbox one we've
only spent a few hours playing a
multiplayer demo but it really looks
like this game might meet that goal it
looks incredible it feels fresh and with
simple controls and forgiving a.m. it's
surprisingly easy to pick up and play
but still there's a lot of titanfall
left for us to play a lot of the world
left to discover and a lot of things to
blow up from the cockpit of a giant
machine
