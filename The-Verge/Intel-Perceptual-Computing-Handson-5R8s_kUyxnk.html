I'm here at the Intel booth taking a
look at the perceptual computing SDK
right here is portal to a game that
$0.06 is modified to use as creative 3d
camera actually to control the entire
game with your hand I can move with fine
motor control this cube around I can
push it into the laser beam and drag it
around to burn up these robots and drop
cube right there on the button to
complete a puzzle you can pull your hand
in and out to move things around as I'll
show you in a moment here you can tilt
your hand just a little bit at a time to
rotate things that your object that
you're holding with fine motor control
push them deep into the screen and solve
puzzles that way it's not the most
responsive motion control we've ever
used but it's not bad at all great for a
prototype and it's a lot of fun to play
and here's a more detailed demonstration
of how that works I can put my entire
hand into a scene intel is tracking fine
articulation of fingers here I can
waggle each and any one of my fingers in
turn and they'll change on the screen in
real time because Intel's tracking
individual joints with this demo here
that it developed internally mind you
you can do some very very weird things
if you come up the wrong way some
disembodied hands I've seen a variety of
times here
but as long as it's got a good image of
where your entire hand is it can track
each and every fine motion even if you
do it slowly wiggle it just a little bit
at a time
that's pretty impressive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
