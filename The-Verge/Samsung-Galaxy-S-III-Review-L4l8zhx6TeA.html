the Samsung Galaxy s3 the
third-generation Samsung's flagship
Galaxy S Android line like his
predecessors the galaxy s3 comes with a
super-long spec sheet highlighted by 1.4
gigahertz quad core Exynos processor a
4.8 inch Super AMOLED display with HD
resolution and a very generous 2,100
milliamp hour battery
physically the s3 is close to the first
generation Galaxy S than a second moving
to a more rounded look and restoring the
glossy plastic back cover of the
original it also borrows a neat trick
from the Galaxy Nexus in heaven and
disguised status LED light the power
button is still mounted on the side
samsung hallmark which I approve of
though the Android 4.0 of software keys
are replaced by samsung standard
combination of two capacitive keys a
month ago home button these actually
work surprisingly well and were still
often needs a dedicated menu button
which Samson provides and the most
asking menu is accessible by holding
down the home key I find Samsung's
implementation hit the most intuitive
for among all Android 4.0 devices
including the Galaxy Nexus for most
people will compare the galaxy s3
against however will be HTC's One X
which is the same screen resolution is
nearly identical in size and also has a
quad core version HDS biggest advantage
is in display technology where the One X
offers far better white balance than the
blue tinted Galaxy S free although
Samson is clearly the performance
champion running our usual Suites and
benchmarks revealed the galaxy s3 to be
the most powerful phone particularly in
terms of graphics that we've tested yet
those capabilities have put to good use
by the camera which produces
crystal-clear images and is also among
the best we've seen
Samsung adds a burst shot mode to the
galaxy s3 much like HD does with one
series although samsung's camera
software is in the hole far less
polished and HTC's a neat addition from
Samsung is a new picture in picture mode
video which allows you to playback a
movie while you still using the phone
opinions will be divided by the
aesthetic differences between the One X
and the Galaxy s3 but Samsung definitely
wins on a software front the new nature
UX version of TouchWiz is the least
offensive Android skin I've tested yet
partially because the phone is so
blindingly fast it makes the user
experience extremely smooth the app
drawer on the Galaxy is free reminds me
of some third-party launchers which is a
good thing in terms of how clean and
tidy it is plus it also lets you hide
applications that you don't want to see
the slide down notifications menu also
includes media playback controls and set
of ten toggles which gets white between
for quick access
speaking of media playback the galaxy s3
is easily capable of handling 1080p
video does resolution at which records
after all and comes with a neat little
trick allowing you to pull video by
putting your palm on top the display the
support of Samsung's comprehensive suite
of motion controls which also include
picking up the phone to dial the number
of someone you're texting all swiping a
palm across the screen to capture a
screen shot smart stay is another
edition from Samsung using the
front-facing camera to detect if you
still look into the screen and keeping
it on although the doesn't work terribly
well in the dark browning of the Samsung
extras is s voice which you can consider
a Siri for Samsung Android phones like
Apple's voice assistant the utility of
this app is still very limited overall
Samsung has made a huge effort to
enhance a software suite and some of the
additions are neat but none of them
could be considered unique selling
points for this device the things that
will get people on board at the
excellent processor on camera plus the
extra large battery the HTC One X still
holds the advantage for me in having the
best smartphone this brand market
wherever the Garcias free offers a lot
of compelling reasons to look samsung's
way as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
