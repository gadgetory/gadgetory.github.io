the LG spectrum it's a new one hundred
ninety nine dollar verizon phone but
we've seen two phones like it before
there's the optimus LTE in europe and
the nitro HD also on AT&amp;amp;T and this is
just a variant of both of those phones
it has the same 720p IPS display which
is really great it's got super accurate
colors and it's really bright and just
looks really good it's one of the best
features of the phone there's a 1.5
gigahertz processor inside along with a
gig of ram and 4 gigabytes of internal
storage the phone in general works
really well it's really snappy
everything happens pretty much instantly
there's the occasional delay when you
hit the home button or you're swiping
between home screens but that's pretty
normal for any Android phone and it's
certainly not worse here than anywhere
else one of the things that LG is
promoting about the spectrum is its
integration with ESPN scorecenter app
the apps available for all android
phones but it comes pre-loaded on the
spectrum and for the first time it'll
actually stream 720p video so you can
get highlights and game footage and all
kinds of stuff all in 720p it actually
looks really good i don't know if you
buy a phone based on it but it's a
really nice feature to have for sports
fans other than the screen the its
connectivity to verizon's LTE network is
probably the phone's best feature it's
super fast and works really well it's
not quite as good as what we got on the
Nitro where we got up to 60 megabits of
download speed but it works really
quickly and really fast we got about 17
to 18 megabits download speed on
verizon's LTE and it's a much more
widespread network so that's the good
stuff but unfortunately there's a fair
amount of things we didn't love about
the spectrum the primary thing is the
software it has the same UI skin as the
as the Nitro and LG just kind of
unnecessarily customized basically
everything about the phone the app
drawer is by default broken up into
these kind of nebulous categories and it
makes it really hard to find anything
you want or if you put it you can make
it a list and it worse things difficult
it's just hard to scroll through and
find what you're looking for especially
since there's a lot of bloatware you'll
do a lot of scrolling to try
find any app that you're looking for on
the phone there's also it's got this
blue on blue color scheme that just
doesn't look very good and it doesn't
really hurt the performance of the phone
but it just kind of makes it ugly the
browser performance fortunately is
actually really good LG didn't do much
to customize the look of it but it
actually works really well holding it
next to a Galaxy Nexus say it actually
Scrolls a little smoother and even the
small text is easy to read because of
the really good display the other big
problem is just the build quality of the
phone it looks a lot like the nitro HD
or the optimus LTE but it's built a
little differently instead of the super
textured back that some of the other
phones have it's got this really glossy
back which is one really prone to
fingerprints and to just looks and feels
really bad in the hand it feels kind of
slimy and slippery and it's just hard to
hold on to I was constantly like wiping
my hands on my pants because I feel like
I was sweating but it's the phone is
just not nice to hold and it's also got
all of its ports and Jack's crammed up
at the top it's got the same super
breakable piece of plastic up at the top
that you should just snap off as soon as
you buy the phone it's also got three
capacitive android buttons instead of
four they combined the search and menu
buttons into one so if you long press
you get search and if you press it short
you get menu and it's also got for some
reason this funny silver border around
the home button which makes it look like
a physical button even though it isn't
and it's just kind of an odd look and
almost makes the phone look like it's a
knockoff of an actual android phone in
general it works you know like you'd
expect any Android phone to its call
quality is pretty solid it's actually
better than the night show or the
optimus LTE but the the one problem is
with the speakerphone and the speaker is
not that loud anyway and it's also on
the back the speaker's placed kind of
right where you want to put your hand so
and you just can't hear when you're
holding the phone on speaker phone but
if you move it away the speaker phone
works fine if a little quiet there are
two cameras on the spectrum there's an
eight megapixel camera on the back and a
1.3 megapixel one on the front and the
front is exactly what you'd expect it's
fine for video chat but not much else
the back is
to it has a nice tap to focus feature
like some of the samsung and motorola
phones we've seen and it's also really
fast it focuses and takes shots much
quicker than a lot of smart phones out
there it also shoots 1080p and 720p
video which is again pretty fast overall
the spectrum is a lot like the nitro HD
which we gave a good score in spite of
its bad software because it was a really
well-built phone but unfortunately on
verizon LTE and a 720p display don't
really set you apart and the poor build
quality and the bad software again just
don't make the spectrum a particularly
appealing device especially when there's
the droid razr or the HTC Rezound or the
Galaxy Nexus all available there's just
no real reason to buy the spectrum even
at a hundred ninety-nine dollars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
