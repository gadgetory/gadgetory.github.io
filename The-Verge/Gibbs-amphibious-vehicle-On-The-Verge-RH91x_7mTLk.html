it's not really I wouldn't describe this
as news you we got PR for something
called a phibian can you explain what a
phibian is to this to these people it's
a truck that's also a boat could you be
more descriptive it's a it's a boat it's
also a truck would you describe it as a
yacht that's also a pickup yes like a
hiccup hiccup yeah that's well yeah okay
so so little break is a transformer of a
sort
it is a transformer it's very strange
but very exciting and you went and did
video there we we hung out there for a
day you hung out with the phibian for a
day yeah are you let's watch this video
I I'm very interested to see exactly how
this works
hey guys it's Eli with the Virg I'm here
with the Gibbs phibian which is a very
large truck that is also a boat I'm not
kidding the wheels flip off the end of
the water and this thing can blaze
around like 40 miles an hour it can also
go 80 miles an hour on land there's two
250 horsepower engines inside it's crazy
and we're going to take it for a ride
let's go just jack it to being
compatible it's just quite a look and
I'm going with right now I have to say
come to my car that's a boat my truck
fits a yacht it is a very large truck
that is also a boat as far as I can tell
it's actually not a truck and it's not a
boat it's an amphibian and it's not just
any amphibian it's a high speed and fit
so can you go 80 miles an hour
flip the wheels and go 40 miles an hour
in the water you can in a James Bond
film but you never like taking it off
like a hell laws of nature and physics
might like difficult not so you gotta
live you only live once
goodbye land land is for suckers Oh in
the water all of my dreams are coming
true my yacht that's a speedster
that's a button that flips out the
wheels now we're a boat the design has
been specifically generated with the
geometry to enable you to have normal
Road vehicle handling on road but when
you get into the water the geometry
enables the whole wheel to be retracted
much the same as an aircraft will gets
retracted I mean what I really want to
do is drive the thing let's be honest I
want to go out - so where are the
buttons for sailing the missiles
what's a wildest thing a customer's
asked for so far there's quite a few
wild things I mean a lot of them are
things that we can't talk about
so basically we're saying is somebody
has put weapons on the back of your boat
nobody has put a weapon on the back of
this no one's for a weapon I mean I'm
not carrying today
I don't know what I feel right now
the home the office
and I can also take this meatball
a back-up plan and drive over 80 miles
an hour
you say that makes me pretty happy
although that happiness is somewhat
tempered by the fact that I can't shoot
anything
you can really add explosion to this mix
like any login song that'd be awesome
not danger zone now be triangles oh yeah
stop there's very strange very odd i I
don't understand that the guy was kind
of giving you the runaround but I just
want to know based on your technical
expertise of car boats
I'm an expert now I pay the one for ten
give it you know the max speed of 80
miles per hour
yeah a large enough ramp I like where
you're going hit it full speed but could
it convert into a boat in time to land
and continue going given a ramp is
adequate sighs yeah
the time and most importantly the skill
all right like I need like Patel at the
wheel I would definitely think that
Neela I think you think that's a
sentient operator a yoke up operator
yeah
of extraordinarily extraordinary
capability right but you could do even
here nem that's a yes okay great</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
