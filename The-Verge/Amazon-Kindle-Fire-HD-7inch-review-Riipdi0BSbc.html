we're taking a look at the new Kindle
Fire HD the 7-inch version looking at
the design of this obviously the Fire HD
7 has a 7 inch display it's a 1280 by
800 screen it's one of the nicest
screens I've seen maybe the nicest next
to the new iPad display it's got pretty
decent pixel density and the colors are
just really vibrant the blacks are
really deep and Amazon went on about the
reflectiveness here about how they've
sort of treated this to be anti glare
but it still feels fairly fairly heavy
on glare to me so it's not like a big
improvement in that department it's got
a camera right here underneath the bezel
for Skype conversations which is an app
that works quite well on here actually
the bezel is a little bit bigger clearly
they want to give you some purchase for
your for your thumbs and it's gotten you
know generally a nice design it feels
very much like an iPad or a touchpad and
it's got like the rounded corners and
you go around back soft touch material
on the back there's a thin strip of
plastic right here which houses dual
driver speakers the website describes
these as room filling sound but the
website is high-end drunk because they
just sound like kind of tinny laptop
speakers but they do sound loud and they
are in stereo and they don't distort so
when you're holding this device in
landscape like this you actually do get
a pretty good stereo field but it's not
like stereo that you might get out of an
actual stereo one other thing worth
really pointing out on the hardware is
the placement of the power button the
power sleep button and the volume
rockers the power button is sometimes
nearly impossible to locate when you're
using the device it's completely
embedded in the side of the device and
you can barely feel where it's located
which makes it kind of a pain in the ass
to use and the volume rocker suffers
from the same problem inside it's got a
1.2 gigahertz dual-core TI OMAP CPU it's
got power VR graphics a gig of ram this
version has 16 gigs of storage that make
a 32 gig as well it has bluetooth no gps
chip no NFC if you're worried about that
sort of
it's relatively bare-bones it doesn't
have a light sensor and accelerometer
and a gyroscope in general performance
was really good game performance was I
would say excellent
I was playing dead space on it which is
one of my tablet go twos and I thought
performance was very good as has been
pretty well documented this is running
Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich but
Amazon has stripped away pretty much all
of the defining features of that version
of Android it's really in some ways
works to its advantage because it
streamlines a lot of stuff and I think
in other ways it creates confusion about
how to navigate and consistency issues
in terms of the navigation of the device
additionally Amazon software the layer
they've added to Android is not that
smooth and can be kind of sluggish and
laggy and a little bit buggy so the
experience is simplified but in that
simplified experience it's not always
perfect for instance in places like the
keyboard I think that whatever Amazon is
doing has been a detriment to the
functionality of the keyboard not an
improvement it feels sluggish presses on
it seem to take longer and it's just not
a comfortable typing experience here you
can see the lockscreen which currently
has ads on it or in fact there are ads
all over the device there's a way you
can opt out apparently for $15 I have
clearly not opted out as you can see
you're treated to a variety of different
advertisements when you lock and unlock
the device so this is the basic home
screen I get the feeling that that
Amazon kind of wants you to hold it in
landscape instead of portrait though
there's certainly a lot of stuff you do
on this importer for instance book
reading here's portrait mode now
something interesting about portrait
mode you'll notice that down here in the
corner is an ad and as you scroll
through your content this could be your
apps or books or anything else you have
on the device it'll suggest other things
that customers have bought and that it
wants you to buy down below here now
when you opt out this little ad goes
away and the lockscreen ads go away but
these days so it's kind of constantly
recommending things for you to buy which
some people may not feel super psyched
about
this is a comic I was reading this is of
course purchased through Amazon and you
can see that there's navigation that
appears and dissapears
which I actually find a little annoying
because it makes getting around that
much more difficult they put the home
button on the left side here the back
button in the middle which doesn't make
any sense to me and they've got this
little favorites button which can you
can arrange with your own apps it's not
exactly multitasking but it can kind of
stand in for multitasking but it doesn't
show you what you've recently used
recently used apps are shown here on the
home screen it can be apps it can be
music you've listened to it can be
webpage as you visited books you've read
movies you've been watching so one of
the really notable pieces of the puzzle
here is Amazon's ecosystem it is just
fantastic it is really one of the only
ecosystems maybe the only at this point
that can take on what Apple is doing and
it actually goes beyond what Apple
offers and in some way bests it
particularly with the prime offerings
you get a bundle of great content that
you don't have to pay for you've got a
flat fee you pay your subscription price
once a year and you get access to
tremendous stuff and that's something
that not even Apple or Microsoft can
offer at this point so it is a really
compelling reason to take a look at this
device especially if you feel like
that's going to be the focus of your use
one of the nice things that Amazon is
doing is whisper sync which they're now
kind of bringing to every service that
they offer for movies what it means is
that you're able to start watching
something on the device or elsewhere and
then pick it up when you pick up your
tablet or when you move to your living
room and it's a pretty cool I have to
say it's it's pretty cool and it shows
how big their ecosystem really is
because you can do this on roku on your
xbox on other devices like smartphones
so it really is kind of a system
spanning ecosystem that they're showing
off and and it works nicely it works
well you know they've been doing the
same thing for books where you can sync
your books across devices they brought
it to movies the other things they've
brought is x-ray right now it's
basically just cast list from IMDB
they're also doing this in books it
shows you character mentions and
you click on the characters you get a
bio about that character and some other
information
so right now x-ray isn't that useful but
I think it's it's foreseeable that in
the future Amazon will expand what x-ray
actually does whether it's related
content or even perhaps being able to
purchase things that you see in a movie
or items that are mentioned in a book
the idea of dissecting what the content
is and what's inside of it seems pretty
powerful but right now it's it's I'd say
a little bit of a sideshow one thing
that's interesting about the AppStore is
that there are a lot of games here not
very much productivity software the
stuff that is available I wouldn't say
is necessarily the cream of the crop you
know I think Amazon wants to push the
App Store really hard but in comparison
to what it's offered for something like
the Nexus 7 it's a much smaller
selection and I would say that the
quality of the selection is is not
nearly as good so in all the fire is
actually a really excellent tablet for
200 bucks and it's mostly excellent
because of the Amazon connections the
offerings in terms of content are
fantastic I mean they really show the
breadth and depth of Amazon's ecosystem
and they are really valuable as far as
I'm concerned the problem is as a tablet
that does anything other than consume
Amazon's content or can be used to shop
for Amazon stuff it sort of falls flat
the the app selection isn't as good as
something like the Nexus 7 the user
interface in my opinion isn't as good as
something like the Nexus 7 or the iPad
which is of course in a different price
class but this is a question about
whether you want a device that is for
lean back casual experiences or a device
that can do more than just those casual
experiences so if you're a user that's
looking for a more full-featured
experience a more full tablet experience
something like what the iPad can provide
you know I would say you want to look at
the Nexus 7 there's just a lot more you
can do with it it just seems a lot more
capable to me if however you just want
something to take with you on trips to
watch content to read books to check out
magazines there is really no better
choice in the price range for 199 bucks
you get a pretty incredible package and
when it's coupled with Prime it really
is an excellent choice
or the casual tablet user</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
