about interviewing fell that day and
seeing Sony on that day was that they
did not talk about the ps4 wishes I
think arguably the most important
product that they have it's the key to
this like big ecosystem network effect
where you get the ps4 and all of the
promises that they've made about it or
true then you will want to buy more sony
products because it is the center of
that experience we should get into the
ps4 but to do so we've brought Justin
McElroy polygons managing editor to talk
to us he has probably more violent
disagreements with both me and me life
that's possible so Justin what do you
think is Sony it's only gonna win this
console race this time it's a little
early to make those kinds of calls we
don't even know what uh Microsoft is is
working with if indeed they release any
console at all there's been no news that
would be great if Microsoft is like now
that we're out this was fun we quit yeah
man ps4 mystery box we can't compete
with that listen we got zune we got Bing
got a lot of profit centers we are cool
we're golden it's over and we're games
for us yeah but so what did you think
about this this Sony event and they
really did kind of build a ps4 as not
only a gaming platform but like the
center of this whole universe and
ecosystem that Sony is really trying to
build I don't know it doesn't seem like
a broad-reaching strategy for me to try
to make it the set I I mean have we not
gotten past that point I mean are we not
past that white whale of like the the
interconnected set-top box that does
everything and yeah I don't I don't
think I think people want more for lack
of a better term fiddle enos that
provides you know I think people are
always gonna have their own devices and
they're not going to want a walled
garden where there's features or they're
missing out on cuz they're not using a
certain Sony device so um I think it's
gonna be hard for it to be too uh
valuable to have that sort of
integration without excluding people who
are missing out but it's the market for
just a pure game device there I mean
aren't they gonna get crushed by the
ipad in like kids like parents buying
our kids at 329 dollar I've had many
instead of a four-hundred-dollar ps4 I'm
not sure that the metaphor is
necessarily there for a an iPad versus a
gaming console like I I think that um
it's the same metaphorical leap is like
why would you want an ipad when you
already have an iphone I mean it that's
the Gulf we're talking about um I don't
think so i think the leap I think the
metaphor is money what are you gonna
spend your three hundred dollars on and
I think for a lot of parents are gonna
say a lot thing has games the games for
that thing cost three dollars but the
iphone has games and they're still
selling I think that's crushing the
console market too i think that i think
that's a tidal wave of problems for Sony
right I think that people still want to
play a game with a controller in a box
that is that you put disk into and I
think that metaphor is not going away I
can absolutely see I mean like I think
the future the end game I think for
video games is a phone in your pocket
that connects to a controller that rests
on your living room the phone pushes
video to your TV or your you know your
your receiver or what have you the
controller communicates with the phone
in your pocket like I think that's the
that that's the future as far as I'm
concerned I don't think we get there
this generation I think we've got at
least one more console generation in the
way that we've come to think of it and
for me as someone who puts video games
above other forms of of tech just
because my you know my career and my the
what we saw for the ps4 event was super
encouraging from that front I mean to
your point about software they didn't
hit the box very hard it wasn't a
presentation about technical
specifications the person you had doing
the thrust the presentation with mark
cerny who's like a video game guy I mean
dude made marble madness you know crash
bandicoot he's worked on basically every
major Sony gaming franchise for like you
know 20 years so to me the message that
I got is that there they note that
they're putting that
first they're putting software first at
least that was the message i got from
Cerny being the lead architect and the
sort of spokesperson they're pushing
their butts oh but that sounds like the
ps4 will be this like silo game
experience I mean this is the other part
of my argument is it Sony isn't
integrating its stuff together so you
know sony has a music service that like
may or may not like show up on the ps4
right they are gonna they have a bunch
of tablets and computers so like Mary
not work with the ps4 why wouldn't they
want why would they want to build a
siloed experience for games when they
keep saying they're gonna integrate
across the entire company what's the I
mean I guess I don't see what the value
of that like what it what it what is the
Lizzie experience that that is not there
I guess is what I don't understand like
the ps4 and really the xbox 360 also for
Microsoft are kind of the gateway drug
into these ecosystems right rah so in
the same way that like the ipod touch is
what gets you into apple I feel like
Sony kind of like you said they have the
music service they have they'll sell me
videos they like they should be able to
move all my stuff around and let me use
all of my things on my various devices
and Microsoft is being smart with
SmartGlass and stuff like that there try
and well right there they seem to get it
I don't know if they're taking all of
the steps they need to but they seem to
get it but it seems to me that Justin I
kind of think you're right in the sense
that Sony the games were going to be
what sell the ps4 but I think Sony could
make the ps4 what sells its other
devices the ps4 to be what sells Sony
right right and I for that and so what
well actually what I'm very cute more
furious asked us Austin is do you think
the games are there to sell the ps4 I
mean I went to that event I didn't see a
bunch of like awesome games I saw a lot
of explosions I saw a lot of ideas about
games that I've seen before and I can
find myself wondering like is am I gonna
buy this because the explosions are
better or am I gonna buy this because it
has new kinds of interesting games I
want to pray so I guess if I had a
problem it was the fact that like I
didn't see a lot of you know experiences
that I wasn't that are not currently
getting on my current console so yeah I
mean absolutely if they had a failing it
was like I didn't see that um
that moment that was like I have to own
the system I mean obviously I will have
but but you know what it's also going to
be harder this generation I think maybe
even harder than any other generation
before because in the when you go from
ps2 to ps3 or xbox Xbox 360 you're
really making this leap in the high
definition and like you it is not going
to be that sort of jump like they're not
going to be able to do that graphically
um so it's not going to have the impact
impact there um I'm really hopeful for
e3 I'm hopeful that we're gonna see some
really interesting like gaming
experiences that you can't get anywhere
else because I mean I agree with you the
number of sequels was like really
upsetting I mean there are these big
studios that like I I would love to see
what else they could do sucker punch for
example yeah rather than like another
infamous game okay I mean I'm sure
that'll be that'll be really good but
I'm you know I you kind of think of a
new consoles like the place where these
developers get to stretch their legs you
know and not make another Killzone game
boy you know was another what was funny
about that event was they kept on saying
things like and we're proud to announce
that kill zone 25 will come to the
PlayStation as our garrulous is it gonna
go like is hey we're bringing it to the
genesis what are you why are you so
proud of yourself I forget who said it
but someone said that um Killzone fans
are so our Sony's a analogy for the
Canadian girlfriend no no you guys you
good if she was here that she's really
gorgeous okay I think you saw so to show
exactly enough they enough to get people
talking enough of these features that
are almost gonna be accepted in the next
generation like obviously they that we
have to have these features and they're
going to look like innovators when
microsoft also has these features i mean
they're gonna look like oh yeah we've
also got a you know a safe state or
streaming or whatever and it'll look
like it's gonna gets the opportunity to
look like they came up with it so Justin
do you think have we seen enough to be
excited are you excited about what's
he's up to do you think they're moving
in the right direction or are we still
in kind of wait-and-see mode until you
three absolute at listen if I had if I
had seen um the same sort of arrogance I
saw on display when the ps3 launched I
would you know I would be sizing up for
coffin but I I think that what you saw
at this event was someone who is knows
they have market share to reclaim that
that has someone out front like mark
Cerny that communicates like hey we care
about games we want your business you
know we want to draw people in Sony
right now looks like for the video game
perspective looks like a company that
that has it is is ready for a fight and
like I don't know I don't know where
that where that leaves Microsoft um in a
fight and if I got a terrible fight yeah
they will have a fight I mean sony look
like a company that's saying the right
things that understands the message that
they needed to send to reconnect with
people that hopefully has learned from
the sort of like almost um you know
bullheaded nature the ps3 that is sort
of pushes forward and expects users to
deal with the multiple weaknesses that
that system had five six seven years ago
and continues to have to this very day
alright Justin McElroy thank you very
much we really appreciate it but an
exquisite pleasure having me thank you
so much oh that's such a pleasure to be
here the pleasure there was pleasure all
around so it's enough
