World Congress 2016 in Barcelona and
this is the jhemini five this is
probably one of the latest android
flagship devices to be introduced here
at the show but it might of him who have
to wait because it has all the specs
just like all the other flagships
android m snapdragon 820 processor from
Qualcomm the pro version even has four
gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes of
storage built in but when we look at it
right now this is the non pro it has
free gigabytes of RAM but keeps pretty
much all all the rest of the specs and
the really impressive thing about this
gemiini five is the price so this device
launching in March first though I should
be one of the first time dragon eight to
eight devices that you can actually buy
if available in China for price those
somewhere around two hundred sixty
dollars and the pro version with a
ceramic 3d ceramic back will cost
something like 350 360 dollars so as
usual Fujiyama it packs in all the specs
but keeps a price really low also Jeremy
has spent a long time designing this
device they say it took them two years
to make it happen and it has a very
efficient design on the front it has
almost no bezels on the left and right
sides a minimal footprint it has a 5.1
5-inch display because Xiaomi also uses
new power efficient LED lights it has a
sony IM x29 8 camera sensor inside 16
megapixels is one of the first to
feature it and the camera works really
quickly we can't speak to the quality of
it just yet but you can do all the usual
of things report 4k video and all of
that fun stuff
also for jami a new thing this is the
first device to have a home button which
also integrates a fingerprint sensor
over on the front so as a first
impression with this device I'm kind of
loving it it's really compact it's
really comfortable in the hand
jeremy has gone to town with the whole
3d bag design the regular model has boss
it's available in black white and gold
as a dual tone flash to go with a 16
megapixel camera with Xiaomi also makes
big deal out of the fact that it's
perfectly flush with a device so there's
no camera bump here Jeremy didn't
mention this but yes it does have USBC
like most of the latest flagships has a
little speaker down here the bottom as
well and it features the latest version
of MIUI
version 7 which is built on top of
android marshmallow it stands up right
there with the galaxy s7 and the LG g5
in terms of specs and seemingly
performance in it seems to be really
smooth really fast so this is Jamie's
big debut here at Mobile World Congress
2016 it says it will be available first
in China as I say for very attractive
price then India and other markets as
the company but MBC is a global show so
we might see this device in some markets
that hasn't been in before
