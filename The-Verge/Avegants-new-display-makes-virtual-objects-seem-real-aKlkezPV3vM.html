that replaces our smartphones in recent
years mixed reality headsets and
so-called smart glasses have been
promising to give us an interactive
experience right in front of our eyes
instead of having to stare down at our
phones but the glasses and headsets that
have come out have either been awkward
or have found a niche firmly in the
enterprise market which is what a
company called avacado
can change this is a mixed reality
headset it's called mixed reality
because you can still see the physical
world around you but you're also seeing
digital objects laid over the real world
and this is a Baggins newest headset
prototype the one that the company is
built to show hardware partners what it
can do specifically with light fields
displays now like microsoft hololens the
Ovid on headset shows digital objects
that appear to be floating in space
unlike hololens this headset prototype
is tethered to a PC running unity this
is the optics engine that we have this
is what you know creates the entire
image this has our retinal imaging
technology the same technology we've
used previously in the glyph so we're
using micro mirror technology to project
images to your retina and also inside of
this we've incorporated our new light
field
optics in here we're simultaneously
sending you multiple focal points so
that means is we're not actually
tracking your eyes so as you can even do
this with a single eye so if we close
one eye you can feel the focus change
with a single eye between the two points
so what can you do with something like
the avocado headset well I needed the
solar system and saw the room around me
transformed into a giant fish tank the
experience was partly enabled by camera
tracking systems placed either in the
corners of the room or directly on the
headset I also tried a couple of apps
that have been shown in promotional
videos but haven't been experienced by
many people in real life before one app
was a beating human heart and it was
originally made for Holland and another
app let me hold digital objects right in
the palm of my hand
Rhyno Oh syringe oh that were creepy oh
it's going into my hand oh oh I have a
syringe it's stuck in my hand this is
bizarre okay so in order to get a sense
of what abakan is trying to do it helps
to understand how light-filled
technology works and it comes down to
how we perceive depth if you hold
something up in front of your face for
example what you're seeing is the light
that bounces off its surface and passes
into your eyes from multiple angles your
brain combines the 2d image from each
eye and uses visual cues like the
rotation and focus of your eyes to
create a sense of depth you'll also
notice that you can really easily shift
your focus from the thing that's right
in front of your face to this stuff it's
in the background when you start looking
at digital images through smart glasses
or mixed reality headsets
you're usually seeing a flat 2d image
with a fixed focal point and when you've
got a display meshed right up against
your face it just doesn't feel natural
by using light-filled optics and it's
headset or what abakan calls its
multifocal plane approach avec on says
it's essentially cutting up the images
in front of you into different focal
planes and sending that light into your
eyes so when you go to look at different
digital objects it's supposed to
replicate the way your eyes would
naturally focus without a headset on so
right now isn't looking at you're in
focus but the arcade game behind you is
not but if I were to keep moving my eyes
back and forth they're sort of naturally
adjusting and you're saying that when
someone wears a Navigon headsets that
your technology lets that happen sort of
naturally doesn't feel like you're
straining your eyes that's right so when
you tried the light field technology you
should not only feel more realistic you
also should feel a lot more comfortable
and natural for your eyes there are some
elements of avocadoes technology that
the company declined to talk about like
the number of planes it uses in this
multifocal plane approach and exactly
how it's creating this continuous focal
experience one industry expert pointed
out to me that terms like light fields
and Holograms can be a little overused
technically speaking the best way to
look at these kinds of solutions is to
sir them a practical approximation of an
analog light field display right now
abakan seems confident that its
technology is superior to at least some
of its competitors out there although
it's hard to say how it stacks up to
other companies that are holding their
tech pretty close to the vest so how is
that different for what something like
Holland's there are fixed focus right so
the image that you see is fixed at a
certain distance now they try to use
like stereoscopic 3d effects to make
your eyes converge at different angles
to give you a sense of 3d but they're
not really changing the focus of that
image and that's okay when things are
generally farther away but that whole
display and experience breaks down the
second then you get within about a meter
so we think about like if I want to hold
an object in my hand if I want to have a
face-to-face conversation with a virtual
person you actually really can't do any
of those things unless you have a
light-filled display unless you solve
those focused problems how does it
compare to what magic bleep is doing we
don't know exactly what mathematically
maybe maybe you guys have a better idea
sure you've read a lot about it
certainly I mean we can just see what's
in the news we don't know exactly what
they're doing but at least from what's
public I would say that we both believe
that light field is a critical part of
the experience you might have heard of
magic leaf by now it's a super secretive
company in Florida that has raised more
than a billion dollars to date to
finance its digital light field
technology I reached out to magic leap
and not surprisingly the company didn't
want to share specific details on their
technology but one thing that magic leap
has said is that they're building what
you might call a full stack solution
they're building the computing system
the headset the software they're even
working with content creators avec on
splat for now isn't to build a product
it's going to ship directly to consumers
but to partner with other hardware
companies who will use avocado optics in
their own headsets this could come as
soon as 2018 avec on says but it could
take longer to get to the consumer
market but when that happened they
believe there's a very real chance that
something like this could replace the
smartphone as we know it we always knew
that as things are moving to mobile
devices like phones and tablets that the
next evolution with that was going to
this this idea of the ambient computer
something that can put on like
we're and suddenly I'm surrounded by
these experiences and not limited to the
screens that we can fit in our pockets
or fit in our bags so do you really
envision a world in which people are
just walking around wearing air classes
all the time even if they're not
currently people who wear glasses or
something on their face I actually do I
think the smartphone as we know today
will get replaced by smart glasses and
once the industry overcomes some of the
challenges that still exist today to
make the devices much lighter and less
bulky I think yes people will be wearing
those glasses for an extended period of
time this is the thing that a lot of
technologists are talking about right
now what's the next big thing
beyond smartphones is there a thing
beyond mobile or will we all be staring
at the glass rectangles in our hands for
many more years to come if we really are
approaching a post mobile world and avec
on is trying to position itself at the
forefront of this and while a lot of
headsets so far haven't really caught on
with the mass market avec on thinks
there's a time in the very near future
when these things are just like
eyeglasses that you just carry them in
your pocket and slip them on instead of
staring at your smartphone it's a bold
idea of a computing future and it's
going to take a lot more than optics to
make it work things like apps and
content that make people want to wear
displays on their faces it might be a
future that we're not quite ready for
but it might also be one that's
happening anyway you must never get
tired of looking at people
you know it's the typical look you sit
there he's very quiet jaws always open a
little bit just like you saw for the
first time what's funny is I actually
can't hear you at all right I just see
