with the huawei mate book X Pro now
there are two really interesting and
cool things about this laptop and I
promise you that I will tell you them
but first we're gonna get through the
boring things there is a USB port there
are two USB seaports inside there are
Core i5 or i7 8th gen processors there's
a MX 150 discrete GPU from Nvidia it
pretty much looks a lot like a MacBook
Pro it even has the same weird cursor
keys and speaker layout and it even
comes in Space Gray so make of that what
you will but there are some cool things
about it number one just look at the
screen I mean the bezels on this thing
are absolutely tiny Huawei says the
screen to body ratio is 91% which is
higher than any laptop I've ever heard
of even on the bottom it's a very very
small bezel which is something where a
lot of laptop makers slip up and since
there is no giant bezel on the bottom
you may be wondering where is the webcam
well that brings me to point number two
where do you think it is it's actually
it's actually here it's hidden in this
key and if I press the key it pops up
that's your webcam now I'm just gonna
say straight up that this is not a great
angle for a webcam I am looking at the
camera mode here so when I'm sitting in
a natural position I have a great view
of my chest and my shoulders and like
maybe the bottom of my chin so you kind
of need to
like maybe you can make it work if
you're in business class like this fake
plane but I think if you're well if
you're using a web web camera an economy
playing I'm not sure what you're doing
in the first place but it's not gonna
work in a lot of situation is what I'm
is what I'm saying
but yeah it's if nothing else it is a
neat design like because it looks you
would have no idea that there was a
webcam in here it's perfectly integrated
into the function wrote keys and it's a
neat solution not sure how practical is
but it's a neat solution so yeah this is
looking like a pretty solid laptop
overall it feels good the build quality
is very solid the design is a little
less derivative when you close it
because it has this whole witch thing
going on the keyboard is pretty good the
trebles not super high but I think you
could get used to it same with the
trackpad which is very big and pretty
responsive screen is great like it's
beyond the bezels it's a 3,000 by 2,000
resolution so that's that's super high
and it makes it a three point three by
two aspect ratio which is the same as
what you would get on a surface device
so no complaints there yeah we'll be
spending more time with this laptop in
at the very near future I will expect it
is coming out in q2 around the world and
we only had European pricing right now
but it's going for 1499 euros for the
lowest model this guy is filming you
burn he's being weird get away
I don't know maybe
anyway we good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
