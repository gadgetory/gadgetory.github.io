at Aoife in Berlin and we're looking at
Philips newest 4k oh LED TV now this is
Phillips first LED TV they've ever put
out it's 55 inch 4k we've got high
dynamic range in here scheduled to come
out sometime in the fourth quarter of
next year but we're not just lecture on
pricing runs Android TV as well as I
mentioned before this is an oh le d-- TV
which means that you will get a deeper
blacks and kind of a deeper contrast
between the colors than you do with LCD
now the reason you get this is because
each pixel in the TV is individually
illuminated that means when you want to
show the darker colors you just turn the
backlighting off of the pixels
completely rather than have the sort of
ambient backlighting that you get with
LCD however that does mean that it's a
more expensive set so as well as oh le D
this TV comes with Philips Ambilight
technology this has been around for a I
think a decade or so and basically it's
these lights you see at the side and the
top of the TV here now the colors that
come out from those correspond to the
video image that is on the TV Philips
says it gives you a more immersive
experience and kind of just improves
your general TV watching is it actually
worth it I don't know but you know it
gives that the TV an extra something
anyway these TVs here also have Philips
Ambilight technology they're not olee D
like the new one the 55 inch but it's
still pretty impressive and look what
happens when I do this for more news in
the video from ether check out</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
