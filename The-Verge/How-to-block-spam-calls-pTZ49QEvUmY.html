Verge's gadget show where we talk about
gadgets circuits breaking those how to
break the circuit
I am Nilay Patel this is Ashley Carmen
there's Paul Miller hello we have a lot
going on the show today as you know
there's an Apple event today in Chicago
which I think Ashley and I both claim is
our hometown I'm from Chicago I just
claimed it visited Chicago
Jeter bone was there dancing for Zahra
Lauren good was there our video right
Rebecca was there we're gonna call
dieter he's in Chicago with the new iPad
he's threatened to unbox it live on this
show so we'll see if that happens so
we're talking about the iPad for a while
then we're gonna play with some
ridiculously expensive audio gear which
as you know is my favorite shake a
stronger is gonna join us where and talk
about some new moment lenses came out
today we have for that phone maybe we
can make a hole and then Chris Walsh is
gonna tell us how to block spam calls
from iphone so lots going on we should
just begin let's see if we can get a
hold of one mr deburr bone live from
Chicago awesome this delay is great I'm
talking to you on an iPad pro cuz my
other attempts to get Hotel Wi-Fi
working in here were a fiasco hi
perfect so tell us why this event today
what happened oh you don't want you
don't to see me actually do a real
unboxing live on the air I'll tell ya
make him wait for it okay
so it was that Lane tech prep school
which is a very very large very I don't
know Ivy League look in school in
Chicago and you know standard Apple
event you roll in any like waiting
waiting area and then you go into the
auditorium and the auditorium was crazy
because we were packed in real tight and
Lauren who said next to me was sitting
that
to to high-school reporters who were
there to like report for their school
newspaper which was amazing and then
there was a keynote which was I don't
know I mean have you guys watched it yet
or were you just sort of following along
the live blog
where's following along we had this show
yeah it was pretty standard Apple fare
except it was clear that they their
agenda at this keynote was not launching
this new iPad like they they have this
new iPad they wanted to talk about it
they want to tell us about it it's like
the biggest news that consumers will
care about but what they actually wanted
to do is spend the entire time making
the case that the iPad is better for
education than Chromebooks without
having without talking about Chromebooks
unless they absolutely had to and so
they just kept on coming back over and
over and over again like here's a
teacher and their kid made a video
here's a teacher and a kid in their
classroom made an audio report here's a
teacher and that person made a video
just non-stop back to back here all the
things that the iPad can do that a
Chromebook definitely cannot do and also
subtle reminder you can actually set up
multiple accounts on an iPad even though
nobody knows how to do it and it can
only happen in classrooms but we promise
it's easy they didn't mention that you'd
have to have like champ or some other
MDM to do it but like they like they've
got all this stuff that you can do that
has been around for a couple of years
but nobody really knows about yeah and
then we left and went to the hands-on
area where they were showing like a our
demos and like Tim Cook walked around
followed just mobbed by children who
wanted to be next to Tim Cook and get
selfies with him that was amazing
check out her Instagram story today
Lauren good got him for like five
seconds on her Instagram story and and
then we we rolled out so like the whole
thing was an hour long the the labs we
like showed us how to set up the mobile
device management enterprise software
where it's like empower the devices and
we left yeah so let's see let's see this
thing you got it okay so I have turned
it on there's the box it looks like an
iPad but special for you I did not take
off the plastic yet I just no lastic so
you get the beautiful
it's so good sound right there it's
really nice right and I want to compare
it to the iPad pro for you but I cannot
because I'm using it to talk to you but
here it is and it looks like an iPad
don't it yeah they didn't change the
design of this thing at all from what I
can tell right not a single tiny bit
it's still like the single speaker on
the bottom or you know speakers on the
bottom there's nothing on the top still
has a headphone jack
there is no smart connector on the
bottom which is a real point of
contention in my opinion and but the
main new stuff is it has a new processor
and it also now supports the Apple
pencil so yeah yay and then it also
supports that new Logitech crayon which
is the the new $50 version of the stylus
that is really fascinating because it I
don't have one but it doesn't use
bluetooth it uses some other mysterious
wireless thing so it's as accurate and
it supports tilting but it doesn't
support pressure and that and you can
use that with any of these new iPads
right there's some question about
whether the gradient will work with the
iPad pros I do not believe that it will
but I don't know the only iPads that
Logica lists are this new sixth
generation iPad yeah and then again I
just got to tell you it's an iPad yeah
and the logitech also put out a case for
this thing which you haven't seen it yes
go look at it online the logitech case
turns the ipad it straight up into a
surface like no doubt about it
it has a kickstand the keyboard folds
out you can it adds a smart connector to
it right it plugs in over lightning and
then the case has this yeah like its own
proprietary and you can click off the
keyboard I played that a little bit it
is just I said you don't to buy it
because the thing is like I kid you not
like this thick it's just gigantic it's
super rugged it has it like a lightning
port instead of being in the middle is
like down here and then the whole flight
the keyboard runs through the lightning
connector and then the lightning pass
through runs through the other thing
it's very it's a very confusing product
but great for schools I guess because
like I challenge anybody just destroy an
iPad when it's inside this thing yeah do
guys think the stylist announcement
stylist worse more important than the
actual iPad announcement I wish I could
say yes except that this stylus is not
available for consumers to purchase it's
only available to schools and what it's
compatible with oh the up I mean I don't
know I guess like it's it's nice that
this is now that all the iPads except
for the iPad Mini which still
mysteriously exists in Apple Store I'll
support the pencil but I mean I don't
know it's just an iPad and then you know
I call it cheaper but it's like cheaper
relative to the other iPads but it's
it's still the same essentially the same
price it's 329 or you can use Paul's
crazy hack to go get it for a little bit
less and claim you're signed with how do
you yeah I up how do you buy something
with the education discount if you're
like a homeschool parent or a qualifying
student or faculty and I found out that
yes buy something on the Apple Education
store and then sometimes they'll check
[Laughter]
yeah so you've got an iPad pro oh this
supports the pencil which is the most
obvious feature of the iPad pro even
though there's other stuff yeah right
the iPad pro actually has a ten point
five inch screen it's got four speakers
got faster processor but the pencil is
what most people think about would you
use this yeah so here's the funny thing
about that
it feels silly to say I'd spend an extra
$700 for this but the thing that I use
them most of my iPad pro is not the
pencil it's the smart connector it's a
keyboard because I really even though
it's like a weird fidgety thing Apple's
smart Keyboard Case is really thin and
really good and really accurate and it
doesn't have any of that funneling with
Bluetooth connections and so I loved it
and so it to me like if they had put a
smart connector on this thing it'd be no
contest like by this don't even bother
with the
at pro unless you like understand how to
make iPads do amazing things but it
doesn't so like it's a little bit harder
call you know I I have to push this a
little bit more to see how much better
performs in the last iPad for
multitasking and stuff the last iPad was
fine for that but it would occasionally
like slow down and start it a little bit
whereas the iPad pro I can basically do
whatever I want whenever I want and it's
really fast yeah like there's just
there's nothing here that's like wildly
interesting like I think I can do a are
better because of the processor but like
I can't show it on the video but the the
air gap on the screen is really
prevalent and noticeable it's the kind
of thing that I noticed that now that
I've been using an iPad pro but if you
never use anything other than standard
iPads you won't notice the air gap but
it's definitely there we had some
questions in the chat but I asked it oh
great that's here let me know that's the
question question Apple address at any
time like the fact that a lot of school
work involves writing with just think
about the math of the iPad versus the
crumple because you kept saying they
kept coming after the Chromebook a
Chromebook for education under 50 bucks
it is a it has the form factor you want
this is like 300 bucks plus a pencil
plus a keyboard like you're suddenly
just radically getting into like $500
territory mm-hmm instantly do they
address any of that pricing cuz that
that was the stuff I saw in Twitter is
like this is great but it adds up so
fast they addressed the pricing in a few
different ways one that including a
smart genetic connector I think came
down to pricing it would have cost more
money to like redo the thing to put a
smart connector on it to they just kept
coming back to like yeah like a
Chromebook is cheaper but you know you
can't do in a Chromebook you can't make
a Clips video right you can't annotate a
document directly you can't have a
classroom full of Chromebooks and then
the teachers up there with their iPad
and the teacher can see in real time
what every single a student is doing on
their iPad and then like go creep on a
student screen on their iPad in
real time and be like Billy I see what
you're doing let's put that on the Apple
TV and then hit a button and have
Billy's iPad automatically airplay to
the Apple TV in the classroom you can do
some really bunker stuff with a
classroom software so yeah like I think
the the price thing they they I don't
think they fully addressed it enough I
don't think they addressed like the
management stuff enough but a lot of
what they wanted to accomplish today was
reading people on what you can do as an
iPad in the classroom but like their
argument for the price thing is you know
what spend a little bit more and then
these kids can actually make stuff with
an iPad that actually matches who they
are in their generation and not just
typing in documents yeah which we I have
one question for you it's really nerdy
but Devon is in the chat asking the new
iPad doesn't have promotion and the iPad
pro has promotion which is 120 Hertz
refresh rate so you asked well the new
iPad slow refresh rate ruin the
experience of using a stylus that's a
little crayon I mean I haven't done a
ton of writing with it
but I'm gonna say this this doesn't feel
ruined to me okay here we go can you see
that lag there well we're on skype
there's no lag okay I imagine if you
know you were really really I don't know
a pixel peeper as they say
you might notice it or if you're doing
something really pro with like a photo
app and you like really needed to stay
up with you it's possible but my hunch
is that for the vast majority of people
won't be a noticeable difference yeah
alright for the next few days and see ya
well thank you so much for joining us
we're actually gonna run dancey fruits
of it hands-on from the event so you get
a better look at the hardware and we're
gonna come back and we're gonna play
with some very very expensive audio
equipment which just makes me so happy
so check out this video we are back hey
this is Dan Siebert with the merge and
we are here in a heist
in Chicago and what we're looking at is
the new iPad from Apple now this is
available to both consumers and students
it replaces the old nine point seven
inch iPad so this has a nine point seven
inch screen and there's a couple of new
features with it internally it's got the
Apple a 10x processor and then it has
support for the Apple pencil which I'll
talk about in a minute but otherwise it
is basically the same iPad that we've
become familiar with over the past
couple of years again it's a nine point
seven inch screen it has touch ID on the
home button here you got sneaker on the
bottom of course your lightning port
front facing camera rear facing camera
of course this model is an LTE equipped
one so it's got the panel here and of
course your Apple logo very
straightforward there's nothing really
new in terms of the design here it is
very much an iPad but it is a little bit
faster than the one that was released
last year thanks to that new processor
and then of course the big new thing
especially for consumers and educators
alike is the support for the Apple
pencil this is the first time that the
Apple pencil has worked with an iPad
outside of the pro line so you can use
the pencil of course to navigate things
but one of the things that they've been
showing off here is new iWork suite and
one of the new ones is keynote here you
can create presentations and draw and
animate them with the pencil so even if
you are creating a presentation and you
make a drawing on there you can actually
let's get to my drawing this is I
apologize it's really bad but there's my
plant growing up out of the soil there
which I drew with the pencil just a
couple of minutes ago so of course and
then it'll close it works with all of
the other Apple pencil supported apps so
you can use it to take notes you can use
it to draw you can use it with any other
app that's uses the Apple pencil the
pencil is not included in it however it
does cost $99 extra which hasn't changed
it's not Mitchell surprise
it looks like an iPad it feels like an
iPad it acts like an iPad it is very
much very much an iPad it's nice to have
the faster processor it's gonna be a
little bit snappier than last year's
model of course the support for the
Apple pencil is great I really would
have liked to have seen this
our connector here a lot of the demos
that Apple showed off during its
presentation we're showing off things
that were you were creating for classes
and things like that
and they require a lot of typing that
logitech is making a case for this which
is like a rugged keyboard case which
will sell separately but it would've
been great to have the smart connector
because then you can use a smart
keyboard which is a lot slimmer and
easier to use with the iPad but
otherwise you know it's an iPad that's
really all there is to say about it it's
going to be available at the same price
as the last year's model its $329 for
consumers $299 for educators to get a
little bit of a discount and somebody
available this week so he's free to say
it's an iPad it's an iPad it's like very
much there's like like gta's hands on
just texted me and said I've run out of
things to say it's okay we'll have more
from the iPad both there's tons on the
verge comm obviously Dan's videos on
YouTube go check all that stuff hat if
you were interested the iPad trust me
over lots more time but I want to talk
about something so we on the show have
speakers a lot mostly because all those
speakers but also because there's so
much happening with smart speakers via
the home pod on the show it's on us on
the show we've got every variety of
Alexa and Google home device what's
really interesting to me is those are
consumer brands and they're like
accessible environment best buy they're
marketed to like regular people but
there's also all these crazy high-end
brands that know this is happening to
them
like they have to address they have to
compete they can't just keep making tube
amps or whatever they do and they're
they're doing it too so there's company
name which is from UK they make a really
high-end audio they have a sparkling
like a patient for making things that
sound good they just up and sent us some
of their dear this is true they just
reached out and said we're making
streamers too
you want to send them to you so we have
two of them let's start with this cube
so this is the name Muzo cube oh good
cube is spelled QB just take a guess
this is an all-in-one speaker I have the
but don't look yes yes guess I must just
think upstream what we're learning is a
shame in my experience like like
high-end audio gear everything looks
starts at around a thousand it goes up
to 20,000 or 80,000 right so but if
they're probably put streaming stuff in
there so I that's it's high okay on that
scale this is reasonable this is one
thousand three hundred and fifty dollars
nice anything see here you have to
Spotify light lit up on top it's a
Spotify connect device it has maybe the
nicest volume knob ever on the top the
LED weight that's not just touch it's an
actual physical physical huge physical
knob it's got this huge heatsink on the
back it's got an Ethernet port case
you're that kind of person is got
optical out you can stick a flash drive
in it see the front here so that uses
this app which is names app I will tell
you this app is not great so they built
their whole own app a whole own app okay
so you can use Spotify and tell you
what's going on we can just turn on like
the radio you can see it switched to
internet radio could change well you
want some good so this is like a $1300
all-in-one streaming device that
competes with so knows that competes
with all the other stuff it does not
have a microphone in it sounds good
it sounds great it's huge it has a light
on the front would you spend $30 on this
no Neal I know but I mean people value
high-end audio like Vlad who listens to
headphones all day long would probably
appreciate this yeah
all right so to me this is just like one
of those things where you I mean
obviously a super-high-end
da sees a 24-bit 96k
and it's worse than all the streaming
services yes it has title support it has
Spotify support you can airplay to it
you can chromecast to it you can it has
bluetooth app tech support it has like
15 digital like nice sounds great and
it's got optical how could you put like
connect it to more speakers or is it
really just this one is for this so this
is this is $1,300 here now let's look at
this other looks cool too so this is the
nine unity atom you can see the front
it's got a big LCD on the front you know
CD is hilariously not a touchscreen it
sort of tells you what's going on so I
can get some music of course remember
the days of course we lost it well I'm
just trying to wait oh it's showing
numbers
what does 63 mean so we've got a USB key
plugged into the back here so now I can
press the source button which is
incredible just like the good old days
you can hit play and Spotify let's see
if it does something I think this one
might have lost its Wi-Fi connection
well we had it under the table this is
what circuit breakers all of that so
yeah that's what I want but it's not
screen but you can't use your just this
one just this one bluetooth nothing like
a blue cheese fair answer you're
breaking oh look they misspelled analog
they're British they can't help it you
know it's not seeing this USB I think is
the problem the USB key is startling ly
hot anyway well we're trying to make
this work what I'll say about this one
$3,000 it does not contain speakers but
it's an amplifier it's an amplifier so
we they sent us
very expensive multiple thousand dollar
speak I want they didn't tell the
speakers are not they don't make them so
didn't tell us but they're also very
expensive speakers they were very nice
in the phone they said we feel that
these pair the best with this because
here's my let me tell you my ideal audio
setup yeah is in my house right now yeah
I have an echo dot and I am the aux jack
from that go dot going to a nice not
amazing but nice amplifier which goes to
a pair of pair of monitors kind of like
this but way cheaper
yeah and that works and that's like a
total probably like a for a $300 setup
yeah I'm just wondering if we've gotten
complacent with like audio quality at
this point because I know when I was got
into records when I was younger and my
dad like decked it out bought nice
speakers amplifier everything and now
I'm just like oh I'll just buy a
Bluetooth speaker and place music like I
don't worry about a whole set up but
maybe I'm missing out on an experience
there I don't want the cute is way way
way better sounded like a capsule
speaker how big is your bluetooth
speaker oh it's old and not big and then
even if you have like a big speaker a
lot of times you can tell especially
when you like listen to the side by side
like even if you a lot of people will
let even if they have a nice home
theater equipment they'll listen to
music through it and the home theater
equipment really isn't designed for
music specifically I I don't know if
this is a real music term or sound term
but I find it it has like a slow
response so like snappy or so yeah yeah
it's kind of like sluggish on that but
so when you have a really nice dedicated
music listening me life produces
knowledge of music clearly I don't know
this is the most expensive NPR listening
this is all I got I'll see if this works
there we go this thing is fighting the
Wi-Fi oh yeah what is this auto-tune to
the room that's a question it does not
auto-tune to the room you are meant to
calibrate it your so
because people buy expensive stuff on a
calibrate their own things really what
it is is incredibly high-end digital
analog converter incredibly high-end
amps incredibly high-end everything and
you know if you have your own digital
sources if you like have a huge flat
collection do you yeah if you want to
reproduce that stuff is high you know
high quality as possible
you buy this $3,000 thing I read some
like audio file reviews of it yeah so
they did a good job I really like this I
think this is the only thing that I
truly what's funny is people well don't
leave it on 70 these little features now
I think I'm with Ashley I think that
history of consumer audio is that people
take convenience and price like
inexpensiveness every opportunity for
sure so I wonder how many people are
actually to buy this I wonder how many
people actually have flat collections I
think even streaming spotify and extreme
to this like you're not sending a signal
in is any good hit you but so let's say
like home pod i don't want to be like
all the Apple people and like I want the
more expensive better thing and at home
pod is this something that you might
recommend is somebody or is the only
audio files need apply yeah the main
thing that we got about the home pod was
of course you can use it with Spotify
you'll just use that play for Siri but
alright well if that is how you intend
to live your life mm-hmm
then like this is actually a competitor
right it's like you can argue about the
design but it has a much different
design it's obviously a statement piece
that Spotify connects you're not doing
that weird airplay round trip and it
just randomly will start playing NPR use
devices for you yeah glad your cable
circuit breaker today well I point is I
think it's very interesting what's
happening consumer side I think it's
really interesting to see how the
traditional companies are
attacking the same problem because at
the end of the day it's still just
streaming music over Wi-Fi and like I
don't can you think of who in your life
would buy this thing I actually do feel
like I know one person but that it's
music just keep it simple and then I'll
buy like vintage ham some things all
right oh yeah I did another a little all
show-within-a-show thing I realized that
I had been well first off I'm scared
than me I was going to lose his job to
robots and so I want to keep the
technical education and then also I
realized that every time I like would go
around the virtual office I was asking
everybody for their knowledge but I
should be sharing some of my own
knowledge yeah so I did a thing about
the command line do you ever use the
command line no not the verge newsletter
it's part of your computer
the black screen the black screen yes
right you use the command line
are we talking about feet walk the
newsletter gosh no I don't use the
command line use the command line yes to
root Android phones would you say you're
scared yes
hey Jake candor told me you were afraid
of the command line that's true I've
asked a lot of people the officers
they're afraid all of them said they're
not afraid at all serious so I figured
you were the one that needed this little
lesson look you don't know what a
command line is don't even worry about
it right but if you want to use the
command line and you find yourself on
this like blank screen should i if
you're like doing programming stuff I
mean it underpins so much of what all of
our computers as a nerd I feel like I
should I just always feel like I'm gonna
break something I think that's a common
fear you can break you can destroy
everything everything this is the most
powerful part of the computer because
some people want to actually use their
computers instead of how their computer
to them like babies
Wow yeah squiggly means you're in your
home directory all right so I'm gonna
PWD that stands for print working
directory this is a good thing right
when you get into a prompt like what am
I where am i oh it's a PWD tells you
where you are current working directory
so if I want to go to route Racine
you're supposed be careful work isn't it
yeah but you can look right so now this
is the route of the whole computer like
these are just like like like the the
URLs and why would I navigate literally
anything this way visual
like because cuz you're trying to get
some work done and this looks more
accurate but it looks and feels more
hackery let me tell you you told me that
there were certain things you should
never take oh yeah okay so I've got this
folder right I want to get rid of it it
says don't delete me but I don't even
care
RM is removed right okay and then I'll
say so that's like basically the verb or
the command I'm gonna run and now what
do I want to remove I want to remove
don't delete now I try that says cannot
remove that it's a directory okay so -
are deletes things recursively so it
says I want to delete that and
everything that's everything inside of
it no it's gone right now here's the
great thing if you do RM - R then F for
force then slash remember our root
directory yes what is the command line
do at that point you have a command line
anymore it's supposed to warn you
modern operating systems enough people
have been bamboozled then yeah I kind of
want to do it here we go Wow
it is dangerous to operate recursively
no preserve route to override this
failsafe the other thing you should go
yeah the other thing is you need to have
admin privileges now my current user
that I'm working on is an admin so don't
always need to do this but you if you're
a pseudo yeah that's in all the jokes
yes pseudo means give me I'm gonna have
the privileges of the root computer user
the most powerful computer user when I
run this command so something that a
regular boring user might not be able to
do mmm the root user can do everything
if I want to take away one thing from
this yeah what should it be
okay watch out for sudo watch out for Sh
watch out for RM there's a good you know
SH means you're gonna run a script sudo
means you're gonna do something as a
root user bara means you're gonna remove
something okay those are some red flags
when you're copying paste from the
internet as far as day to day use I do a
lot of LS and a lot of PWD and a lot of
oh this one took me forever to learn I
want to get back a folder CD dot dot AJ
this still seems more complicated than
just it's great it's great thank you
thank you for this lesson and these
warnings we just live Street Dan command
learning is a reward
I haven't waived my computer single time
since that video all right
well Paul we're just gonna keep
themselves oh yeah I have to say our
previous segment the unity atom might
have been the most catastrophic a lot of
impure that was actually a really good
demonstration of what it's like to get a
die and audio yeah so I I could know
everything is a little bit more broken
yeah but you know who is good at making
computers high-end British audio I spent
weekends wiring up like even just
mid-range audio segments you know what
it's a blast yeah you just gotta accept
that you're in for you know some
frustration also I will say if you
really want to get into it emotionally
let's check out the forums mmm there
they are both supportive and very
aggressive places anyway Jake we have
you have no product audio quipment yeah
so I've been super interested in all the
different lenses you can add on to your
iPhone or other phones to improve
photography or video stuff and
coincidentally enough
moment which is probably the company
best known for these add-on lenses has
some new announcements today and one
thing particularly they have is really
cool they have their first anamorphic
lens and so you can see it is this right
here it looks square and yeah it gets
you this big super wide image on an
iPhone you get those beautiful lens
streaks that anamorphic lens they're
known for so you're not familiar with
anamorphic lenses this is what a lot of
big blockbuster movies are shot with and
so you'll probably recognize this kind
of look even if you haven't heard the
terminology and this is just something
that isn't really available at a
consumer level because anamorphic lenses
are really expensive they're also kind
of a pain to work with so I'm gonna go
into the normal camera app to show you
this this is what it looks like normally
I'm sorry you can't see with new light
but you look extremely squeezed right
now so I'll show you Paul like you see
it's squeezed and so you need to go into
another app that is able to be squeezed
the image so now we have this extremely
cinematic version of nilai this
beautiful shadow this what kind of good
yeah this nice streaking light it looks
really great so they just announced this
today if you're like I don't necessarily
know why you'd want to film something
that cinematic with your phone but I
guess the idea is you've already
invested seven hundred to a thousand
dollars in your phone why buy a DSLR
yeah this lens is lots like sorta Briggs
unsane just came out shot entirely on a
phone yeah I this is a thing that's been
happening so we covered a few years ago
the film tangerine we shot entirely on
an iPhone 5s they actually use an older
animal for lens adapter not for a moment
for another company and then you just
said unsane from Steven Soderbergh just
came out admittedly our film critic
Tasha Robinson said it was not good to
laugh but you know the takeaway is that
serious big professional directors think
these are valuable tools I think they're
easy to use in that you don't have to
you know deal with a huge camera rig and
this is something that I think is
shakily great for vloggers or people who
are just starting out and so we kind of
also want to look at the other options
that were out there maybe you don't
necessarily want to spend a ton or you
know how exactly you can kid this out so
we have a whole line of moment stuff
here moments lenses are about 80 to 90
dollars each and you also need one of
moments cases to get started with them
because they have this eat little men
lens mount that make sure you position
the lens properly on top of the camera
lens yeah and they're cool they just
take your existing camera lens for this
I looking on top of it you have these
extra wide lenses you have macro lenses
fish eyes you're sort of limited on
image quality by how good your original
camera is but you can definitely get
these cool effects so here is the fish
eye it looks fish ie okay sure does and
it's fun what I wanted to know though
was I don't necessarily want to spend a
hundred dollars I'm like a giant lens so
you're sure like cheapo stuff on Amazon
I got these three pack of lenses for
twelve dollars that was this I might
have lost one of those lenses yeah so if
this is 200 in one if you screw this off
its a macro I gotta tell you the macro a
hundred percent doesn't work yeah
officially does though and you just clip
this on to your phone which is yes so
super casual fisheye lens yeah so the
bad thing about the clip is like you can
easily miss position this right right
but also this was twelve dollars and
this is kind of fun so if you're
thinking about getting started with this
stuff if you're not sure if you want to
really invest hundreds of dollars I
would totally recommend buying just like
a total I think I also sort of dared our
producer to buy this extremely goofy
iPhone lens case that has six lenses on
it it's called the switch six it's
fantastic though so fantastic in the
yeah doesn't mean that it exists
most of the lenses are bad okay I would
say that most of them are unusable but I
love the look of it
so it's really neat because you have
access to eight different lenses while
using it so you got the normal iPhone
lens exposed and we have this beautiful
little guide here that goes over and
using magnets
I'll show you this using magnets clicks
into place one click to click it click
the readout so we got two X we got 2x
telephoto 120 your wide-angle 20x macro
with 10x macro a two-point X telephoto
and a official so here's what I know
about the iPhone 10 though mmm this is a
true what I don't know is its passcode
yes ok so if you just open the camera
app here mmm
and you switch it so we'll put on one of
these lenses and you switch it I'm
putting my finger over the other ones
right mm-hmm
you can see I covered the One X lens
right like half the time it worked that
time this was a big issue for me when I
was testing these because I did not
realize that it behaved this way yeah
like half the time it was faking yeah
and like you can't actually tell so you
have to use another app right yes so if
you see I'm warming right I've got my
finger over the way but they're like
blinks to make it pretend like it yeah
yeah and then that time it went to the
real lens and then sometimes it just
does yep yeah so like 9 out of 10 times
it does not actually switch the
telephoto lens so if you're using
something like this you need to download
a third-party app that is going to let
you actually switch lenses yeah can I
show you my favorite third-party oh yeah
okay so my favorite third-party hat for
the for someone I use all the time it's
called a ride and it has not led it has
two features that I love one is the use
of the taptic engine so when you see a
yellow dot yep when you when you wind it
up it clicks
so you feel it and then when you do it
like this you rotate it it clicks again
when it lines up which is cool and then
it has this insane feature mm-hmm upon
the take picture of you so I can see the
depth map I can turn it on there's the
depth map of the room it's terrifying
yes that's great nightmare yeah so take
a picture Paul beep and then I don't
know what this is for or why this
happens I don't know thank you
wait a-are mm-hmm
that's gonna move around okay figured it
out hopefully you have enough light this
work and now bizarrely okay so you guys
oh it's very confusing
I'm not entirely sure what it's for
really really great it's great it's
insane hey light is five bucks mm-hmm
it's the app I use when I want to
actually make sure it switches the
lenses tons of manual control I think
it's like if you invest in this stuff is
very important to upgrade from the stock
camera apps right yes none of this stuff
is you're not the stock camera app is
just hopelessly confused
and you don't have a lot of options for
setting exposure and stuff whereas you
can really lock things in yeah here you
know trying to make a film in need to
control light and stuff so I actually
took a bunch of photos with these
outside to show you how moments lens is
compared to the standard iPhone lens and
compared to these cheapo lenses I'm
gonna go over here and show you some of
these because there's a really big
difference between the cheap stuff and
with the iPhone can do so first just to
give you an example this is what comes
out of the iPhones telephoto and so when
you add on a telephoto lens like moment
what you get is much much further you
can see a really big distinction here
where you go from this to like pretty
pretty tight on that building so that's
really nice and there's actually a
pretty bright image it's not perfectly
sharp but it looks relatively good and I
gotta tell you it is far superior than
what you would get out of this
whatever the switch six I don't remember
if I kept that in this slideshow or not
but yeah this is this is the switch six
or whatever it's called this is
completely out of focus this is what I
was just don't use so next up we have
the fish eyes so this is the fish eye
from a switch six I think that's totally
fun and usable so that case was
thirty-five dollars this is a really fun
effect you have this been getting on the
outside yeah it's cool and this is what
you get from the clip-on again you know
the vignette but it's nice and bright
it's you know it's there it works but
this is what you get from moments fish I
you have the full image it's not as
strong but you do have that curving so I
think it's much much nicer photos yeah
it's a lot more usable in a lot of ways
so I think it's clear that moments
lenses are superior again whether you
need to spend a hundred dollars on an
iPhone lenses is maybe another question
but they're definitely doing more so
here's another one Paul you told me
liked macro lenses so I really love
moments macro because it actually is a
shade on it that helps you figure out
exactly how far away to position the
lens from the of your treasure shoot so
right here we have a close-up of a notch
on a tree and so I just put the lens and
right up against it and you get this
really cool thing and I want you to
notice there's this depth right here
along this thing is popping out cuz
we're gonna show you the next one I want
to know how will the would look if I
just zoomed in on the iPhone and this is
what you get it's super flat it's the
there really is a big difference by
going to a macro lens and just in case
you're curious don't ever buy a cheap
macro lens because it looks like this
all I could get in focus this is
terrible so yeah that that's the
difference between the lenses there
really is a big distinction if you want
to spend a lot
and one of the other things we're
talking about is you can really get out
your phone and build a filmmaking or a
vlogging rig if you wanted to using all
of these accessories so aside for the
magnet of these extra lenses you can
also get a mic like this this is from
sure you can buy an Apple stores this is
recommended by our audio engineer Andrew
Marino he said it's a stereo mic it's
really good for collecting you know just
field recordings it would be nice of
your recording somebody's guitar you can
also go into the app and dial in the
recording patterns that you want so you
can use it for recording people's voices
on interviews this would be better if it
was not attached to that case
unfortunately is it it's good questions
is a new case oh yeah I did enjoy with
this so it's another new moment promised
is that was another new moment product
this is their first battery case for the
iPhone 10 which is gonna be helpful if
you're going to be shooting all day it
is a big but it has a two stage shutter
button which is cool I really like the
kind of speckled look on it this whole
look right here is out of control not
even started
so you're outside your bright sunlight
you need to cut down something like how
about an ND filter well if we're gonna
slap that on alright alright we're not
done yet
it's my fault I assure you this is wild
like the fact that we're using this is
the basis of a full camera reyga's you
know we were sharing the Apple event
today
mmm when I go to those events like we
still bring dslr's like everyone around
us
iPhones these kinds of microphones and
moment lenses it is amazing how many
other professional journalists have
completely moved over to this stuff
absolutely yeah it was the Vlad went to
the Auto Show shot a bunch yeah
beautiful cars with a pixel art we're
gonna say goodbye to Jake bye Jake take
your questions
Chris Walsh is gonna join us and we're
going to talk about blocking some calls
there with a live person swap right now
yeah so Massey exercise is doing me
wrong this is food at some point people
still go up to get a decent camera I
truly believe this is true
I just bought a DSLR I'm shocked a new
Nikon 500 I'm shocked at how much better
those photos are than my camera photos
but what I'll say is the thing is huge
right get a good photo out of it takes a
lot of work like you have to know you
can't you cannot just put that thing in
Auto and go for it I also think it's
like a different mode of being I
remember my little brother is a really
good photographer and it's just cuz he
keeps on taking pictures and people are
like way more casual about taking
pictures with phones but when you have a
digital SLR you have to kind of be an
agro you have to be a person that like
look I like taking photos I'm gonna take
a lot of photos and it can't just be as
casual as it is with the phone but if
you do you you can get really good yeah
really good all right and then someone
says Marcus says somebody shot a movie
now film that is what we're just talking
about Steven Soderbergh just shot unsane
completely on iPhones
he was so hype about those on the 7s
I believe so he was super hype erotic a
lot of interviews even us we were saying
this completely changed how I thought
about filmmaking I can get phones and
place a camera
Tasha watch the movie movie the
storytelling movies one thing but she
kept pointing out this movie looks bad
no because you can't get the dynamic
range you have to light differently for
phones I think it's it's interesting to
see how where that goes okay Chris Welch
is here those well how's it going
everybody it's going so we do a circuit
breaker I believe we have a voicemail
yes so I am here to tell you how to
prevent spam calls and robo calls and
this is one that I saved on my voicemail
just one that's we have just received a
notification regarding your tax filing
from the headquarters which will get
expired in next 24 working hours and
once it get expired after that you will
be taken under custody by the local
phones they might actually fall for it
on YouTube but they do fall for it and
that's the whole point of this like they
have such little overhead to make
thousands and millions of calls actually
so the stats are there between two and
three billion robo calls and spam calls
in the US alone
every single month and that's gotten
people so upset that they've complained
to the FTC over 375,000 times every
month so this is a really bad crisis at
this point it seems only over these last
couple of years to have just gotten out
of control there are some ways to kind
of fight against it
none are perfect by any means but to
help you out quite a bit yeah you wrote
a whole article yeah so we've got a
how-to this is already our most read how
to have all times so everybody is very
interested in how to well how do you to
stop annoying robo calls yes and they
are rather so your first line of defense
is if you buy a phone from Samsung or
Google they have built-in spam
protections so when somebody calls you
you'll see a message just like this the
whole screen turns a shade of red and it
just kind of tells you makes it very
clear don't pick up this is built in the
same sis is built into the unlocked
Samsung phone city if you buy one from a
carrier this feature is turned off no
it's because they partnered with a
company called hire and they actually
run one of the apps we're gonna talk
about in a bit that's where it comes
from and Google that's the same thing
with a pixel as well so you can use that
on any network and the phone turns red
just tells you not to pick up makes it
pretty easy okay and so the second line
of Defense's say you've got an iPhone
maybe you don't have too many spam calls
coming in you want to block them one by
one just go into your settings you just
hit the little I button over here to the
right of a phone number and hit block
but that's only good for one phone
number at a time and these numbers
change every day till you run me through
that again you just want to hit the
little blue icon here go to any number
and it block this caller and then those
won't come through anymore
that's pretty ineffective when you're
talking about numbers that change every
day like I get five or six daily okay
and so it doesn't do you much good
so the carrier's have their own ways of
trying to help you out here let's see
we're gonna start out AT&amp;amp;T has one
called call protect
that's free so these don't work on the
back end of the network so when somebody
calls you it'll just say and this is
spam or spam likely or
scam likely calls me five ten times a
day yeah yeah so that's 18 G call
protects that's free some of them charge
like Sprint and Verizon charging between
two and three dollars per month so they
up charge you to prevent you from being
annoyed and so t-mobile actually is the
best one I would say because they have
two products one is called spam ID and
one is called spam block spam IDs turned
on for everybody so if you're on
t-mobile and you ever see spam likely
pop up and somebody calls you
that's that future working spam block is
something you can actually turn on by
dialing star a few numbers and then
that'll actually stop some of the
scamming numbers wrong by default it's
on by default
yeah scam IDs on by default scam block
you've got to turn on yourself because
you might miss some calls that he would
have wanted for t-mobile you would just
go to skip likely go on yeah I just
missed six minutes ago so you just want
to dial wait Paul put it here this is a
personal device I got to make sure okay
a scam likely wait what scam block is
what you want is you want texting dial
dial so you've got stoned
six six two pound six six two oh yeah
call it yeah hit dial I'm not you turn
on the future way so now whenever
t-mobile senses that a scam callers
calling you it'll it'll stop those calls
from comes insert your requests enable
scam blocking is being processed
please wait a few minutes for scam
blocking to begin and then I could
disable that again yeah
so the carrier's have all their products
they want to sell you one and then there
are third parties so the FCC and FTC
have realized they need some help and
trying to like combat this issues
they've brought in app developers and we
have two examples here one is this
company called nomogram well they
actually want to contest done by the FTC
we're trying to help out against Robo
callers and so you install this app and
you put in your phone number
and once its installed these apps are a
wall between you and the scammer so
they've got these huge black lists of
numbers that they'll block from ever
reaching you in the first place but if
calls do come through you'll see a
message like this like we'll just set up
a test Robo call and we can be just
using their phone on YouTube or
something else and then when the number
comes up you'll see it's a scam and so
you won't answer so the iPhone more
recently actually did make this possible
so um this is another app called Robo
killer and so for the iPhone you
actually go into your phone settings
once you have it installed and you
actually have to turn on access to these
apps because they are serving as your
caller ID so they're getting ready right
in the way between the you and scammers
but once you toggle that on you just
flip a switch and that's the same kind
of thing as the scam block will just
stop calls from getting through so these
apps they cost between three years four
dollars a month yeah these are monthly
fees so there's no trial is how you call
robot there's a free trial you can see
how well it works none of them work
perfectly because more and more of these
scammers they spoof numbers from your
local area code so it looks like just
like your number is calling you they're
trying to trick you make it think you've
got a family member calling or some
other kind of really really evil way of
getting to you something so yeah so then
there are the old ways if you want to
try and stop spammers and anybody else
you should join the FTC's Do Not Call
Registry that's somewhat effective I
mean these companies who call you up
with a robot voice they don't really
care about the Do Not Call list so it's
not for them obviously we're in a moment
of privacy right now Massa gens hat says
the thing about these apps is they will
know all of your inbound numbers yeah so
it's like you know your carrier already
knows it might as well have them step in
the way that a third-party app now a man
named Robo killer so they ask you to
contacts you can say no they say the
only one your contacts so those numbers
on the whitelist and there won't be
blocked compared to everybody else but
yeah join the Do Not Call Registry and
what's right wiped out isn't supposed to
be illegal like why are we in a place
where there was all this fuss about this
stuff robo calls me illegal yep and do
not call
all this stuff and it's getting worse to
the point where I'm installing
ridiculous apps and carriers are
charging you monthly things like what
happened like why is it getting worse
they're just so hard to catch and it's
so easy to put these people to do I mean
there's no overhead to call thousands
and millions of people and once one
person falls for a scam and hands over
money then that was all worth it so they
FCC and the FTC and FCC are trying that
so I'm trying to stop it but most of
these people are overseas so they can't
really do much to actually shut them
down the FCC wants to find people two
hundred million dollars which protect
yourself and I'm saying to you we're way
over time we got to wrap it up for this
week sir gregor lives Tuesdays at four
