this is the Galaxy Note 3 slimmer faster
and nicer looking than last year's note
to the note 3 pretty much improves
everything about the device and will
really appeal the fans of smartphones
bigger than your hands the display has
been upgraded to a new 5.7 inch 1080p
AMOLED panel which looks great despite
our usual reservations with AMOLED it
works outdoors has great viewing angles
and is very vibrant and colorful even
though the screen is bigger this year
last year's Note 2 had a 5.5 inch
display the note 3 is no bigger than the
note 2 and in many ways is actually
easier to handle don't get me wrong
though this is still a two handed
smartphone the design of the note 3
echos the galaxy s4 right down to the
fake metal looking plastic band that
wraps around the phone things differ
when you flip the note 3 over however as
Samsung's ubiquitous glossy plastic has
been replaced with a much nicer textured
finish as a result the note 3 feels much
nicer to handle than previous Samsung
devices it's still not as nice as say
the HTC One or iPhone 5s and we can
really do without the cheesy fake
stitching on it elsewhere Samsung has
pretty much upgraded everything else
compared to the note 2 the three has the
galaxy s4 is 13 megapixel camera a new
Snapdragon s 800 processor with 3
gigabytes of RAM that absolutely screams
a slightly bigger 3200 milliamp hour
battery and Android 4.3 jelly bean out
of the box of course it wouldn't be a
note without a stylus and the note 3 is
a slightly improved s-pen over the note
2 the biggest new feature is the air
command which automatically launches
when you pull the pen out of its socket
or can be invoked by hovering over the
screen and pushing the S pen's button
from there you can jump right into a
note launch a search capture a
screenshot or even launch a mini app in
a window handwriting recognition is
quick and accurate for the most part and
actually gives the s-pen a functional
use for a lot of things Samsung's
TouchWiz interface is more or less the
same on the note 3 as it is on the
galaxy s4 but the major Edition is the
new my magazine feature powered by
Flipboard my magazine is invoked with a
swipe up from the bottom of the screen
it's Samsung's clear answer to HTC
blinkfeed but it's less in-your-face
content can be imported from a variety
of sources including social networks and
the interface is fast and responsive but
it never really felt like more than a
tacked on feature and it isn't really
integrated well into the overall system
honestly I'd be surprised
many users make it a regular part of
their daily routine overall the note 3
is an improvement over the note 2 in
almost every respect it's faster feels
and looks nicer and has some really
useful software tweaks if you're a fan
of the note liner devices there's no
reason that you won't like the note 3
and the improvements made to it might
even win over some converts at $300 and
available for most carriers this month
the Galaxy Note 3 remains the oversized
smartphone to beat</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
