been a drum machine addict for 16 years
and I have zero days sober and I am kind
of freaking out right now and this is
the verge in 1980 the Japanese
electronics company Rowland released the
tr-808 rhythm composer for a long time
people thought the only way to make
dance music was with this machine the
noises that came from the analog
circuitry inside made people go insane
on the dance floor but Roland stopped
making the 808 after just a few years in
the mid 80s you can buy one on eBay now
for around three grand or used one of
thousands of hardware or software
indicators they all work pretty good but
they've been you know just copycats
paper rings wax figurines tumble ODEs to
a classic until now this is the tr-8 the
first true spiritual successor to the
tr-808 but it's all digital and it has
something to say to all the haters
Roland developed a totally new modeling
language called analog circuit behavior
to faithfully recreate the big sounds of
transistors and diodes that made the
tr-808 so famous I am sitting here
listening to it with my own ears and I
can tell you this is not some marketing
BS this is indistinguishable from that
1980 kick actually wait a second I can
tell the difference this kick sounds
better than the original yeah I said it
and this one only costs 500 bucks
eat it eBay
thirty four years later the company
responsible for creating a generation of
analog drum machine fetishists is
killing off any reason to still be a
fetishist it's like when they remastered
Seinfeld in HD
no one scoffed fidelity and bought a
bunch of old VHS is in protest to be
real with you though the kick drum
wasn't the reason I became a drum
machine addict the funnest and most
awesome part of using an old 808 is how
simple it is to create beats with a 16-7
first the TR 8 doesn't just sound like a
champ we've got this visceral tactile
experience with all the
straightforwardness and get done
mentality of ass ancestor so with a big
old truckload of intuitive new control
features and they give really fun to
make music on we took a short break to
sit down and friend and Ryan from
rolling to talk about workflow it's
amazing to see people actually say wow
there's no LED screen how great that is
you know there was a time when of course
everybody wanted a screen on everything
you know computers are great for you
know that's the primary place people are
making music is is in computers but
there is a certain level of non
immediacy
I guess the lack of immediacy when
you're going using these everything you
kind of have to think about um if you
want to add a step or or glitch
something a lot of times it's a process
you have to go through in that amount of
time an idea can become lost or it could
become just not worth the effort
or you might not try it or experiment
having you know one-to-one knobs and
knob that always does one thing you're
just reaching up and being able to play
things fit just different stuff comes
out and I think almost anybody no matter
how into computers and plugins you are
you put them in front of something like
this and they'll do things that they
wouldn't do in a virtual representation
so let's go in and hear that classic
tr-808 sound coming out of the TR a kick
drum right here
snare drum right there bringing the
Tom's rimshot
Handclap clothes hat open hat crash
cymbal and the ride that's all I had to
do to make a kind of sick beat if I do
say so myself
but that's not all lowland is updating
to the 21st century meet the new era
family this is the TV 3 the VT 3 and a
system one spiritual successors to the
TV 303 baseline machine the VP 330
vocoder and the sh-101 synthesizer they
may not have been as famous as their 808
Big Brother but they are every bit as
important in shaping the sound of
electronic music listen up yalll since
all this crazy software started coming
out and when I say crazy software I
really mean Ableton Live it's been kind
of hard for me I mean how am I supposed
to crank out epic dance jams on the same
machine I used to watch porn and like do
gchat and spreadsheets on I just loved
boxes you know what I mean they're my
little buddies they don't make me feel
like I'm at a goddamn office trying to
be productive I mean you can't do your
taxes on a Stratocaster and you
shouldn't get with them on a damn drum
machine neither
as sick as that analog circuit behavior
modeling maybe or as heavy as the kick
on the tr-8 sounds rolling nose it
really only needs to manufacture one
thing to turn on an entire new
generation of habits</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
