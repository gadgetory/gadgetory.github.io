allowed to touch it.
It is the Samsung Galaxy Fold.
It is a $1,980 folding
phone and we've been waiting
to touch it for a long time,
and I came into this room
thinking that this was
basically just a concept device
and not a thing that
regular people should buy.
But now that I'm starting to use it,
I'm starting to change my mind.
(upbeat music)
So the basic idea of the
Galaxy Fold is obviously
you have a nice big beautiful
screen on the inside.
And if you don't want to
have it open, you can use
this slightly smaller screen on the front.
And we don't usually get to
talk about the physicality
of phones anymore because
they're all black slabs,
but we really do here.
So you can see, you open it
up, it's got this flexible
plastic screen and if you really look,
you can see a crease, but when
you're looking straight on,
it's not too bad, you
only see it at an angle.
And you can always feel it when
you run your finger over it,
but really it's not too bad.
And you can also use it sort
of folded like this if you want
which feels a little bit
more comfortable to hold
especially if you're on
a subway or something.
But it has a nice snap to
it, it feels really solid,
and it doesn't feel like
you're gonna break it.
Now Samsung chose to put
the screen on the inside
and that helps protect it.
But it does mean that you
have a little bit of a gap
when it's folded, and so you can kind
of see down the barrel there.
So all that's great, but you
can't get around the fact
that this is, when it's folded
up, a kind of a weird shape.
It's a very tall phone, it's
sort of like a, I don't know,
it's like a baton.
Here it is compared to my Galaxy S10,
so you can see it is quite a bit taller
and of course quite a bit thicker.
Now because it's so tall and so thick,
you can fit it in a pocket,
but really only if you
got really big pockets
or maybe if you have like
a suit coat pocket or
a purse or something.
The way the screen works is
that it's basically plastic.
Samsung did a bunch of interesting
things to make this work.
They have a new special adhesive
that holds the screens
together that's more flexible.
And it could be more prone to scratches
but because it's on the
inside of the phone,
hopefully that'll be a little
bit less likely to happen.
The other thing to note about the screen,
is there is this pretty
large notch over here.
And there's a couple of reasons for that.
One is they got the cameras
and then like the proximity
sensors and everything else up there.
Two is unlike on the S10,
they couldn't fit those
other sensors behind the
screen, because this is
a new kind of screen technology,
which is one of the reasons
you've got this big notch over here.
To wrap up the stuff that's
maybe less interesting
than the screen, there are buttons, so,
you have a fingerprint
sensor here on the side,
and this doubles as a
Bixby button actually,
not the power button, cause
the power button's right there,
and then of course you've
got volume buttons.
In terms of cameras, do you like cameras,
because we've got one selfie
camera in the front here,
two more inside it, and then on the back,
we have a regular camera, a wide angle,
and a telephoto camera.
A total of six cameras if you count
the RGB dove camera inside of it.
Now last, and I guess for
some people, maybe least,
there is the screen on
the front of the phone.
Now this looks really small
on this big baton like phone,
but it's actually a 4.6
inch screen which is only
a little bit smaller than an iPhone 6,
although it looks taller because
that's measured diagonally.
Anyway, it does everything that you
would expect an Android phone to do.
It's basically just like a
regular ol' Android phone
on the front, and then
when you open it up,
it's the full size one.
What's interesting though is
the home screen on this one
is a separate layout and
a separate home screen
than on the home screen on the inside.
So you get two different HAP layouts.
So that's all great, but how
does this thing actually work?
Well, let's say you have an
app that supports what Samsung
calls app continuity.
So I've got Google maps
here up on the outside,
and then when I open it (clicks tongue).
It opens up, bang, right on the inside.
If the app doesn't support app continuity,
it may have some black bars here,
but if you open it up
natively inside of the phone,
it won't have those black bars.
So this is cool, you've got
your nice full screen app,
but if you want more than one app,
what you do is you slide
over from the right,
sort of like the old iPad system,
and then you can select a second app.
So we've got Chrom open there,
we'll open up Google maps,
and that opens up into a split screen
that you can then, if you
want, resize like that.
And then if you want
a third app, you slide
that thing over again,
and open up the third app,
and then it shows up down there,
and so you can have up to
three apps open at a time.
You can even do some really wild stuff.
Like if you tap those blue bars,
you can put stuff into like
a pop-over window, so now I've
got a pop-over window there,
and then I'll open up, I
don't know, the calculator,
the third app, and now
I've got four windows.
And you can really go nuts
with this thing if you want to.
But that's maybe a little bit much.
So when you watch a video,
normally on YouTube here,
you can see there's a notch up there,
but then if you wanna go
full screen, and watch it,
you do notice that that
notch is right there
in the YouTube video, and
there's no way to like
pinch in and out of it.
So that's a little bit annoying,
but it's not the worst thing in the world.
Alright so let's talk specs.
On the inside this thing
is not all that far off
from say the Galaxy S10 Plus.
It has a Snap Dragon 855
processor, it's got 12 gigs of RAM,
it's got 512 gigs of storage.
In terms of battery,
it is 4,380 milliamps,
although of course that's
split between a battery here
and a battery here.
Don't know how long that battery
life will actually give us,
but it is pretty big, 4,300,
so that should last a while.
So on the outside again
it's a 4.3 inch screen,
it's HD plus, it's a fine screen.
The inside, which is the screen
you're really interested in,
is 7.3 inches, and it's very
very close to a four by three
aspect ratio and it's 20.48 by 16.36,
so that's QXGA plus in
terms of its resolution.
So the Galaxy Fold is
shipping on April 26th,
it's available for pre-order
now, and again that price
is $1,980, and that number
is weird but apparently
it's divisible so you know how
much you're paying per month.
And like I said, at the
top, my overall impression
is that this thing is
actually a lot more usable
and a lot less prototype-y
than I expected.
The hinge feels solid, I'm not
super annoyed by the crease,
I think that it's fairly ignorable,
and you get this nice
thing that is pretty big
and easy to hold.
Easier to hold than I expected,
and then when you fold
it up, you've got this.
I just wish that, you know,
I could fit it in my pocket.
Hey everybody, thank you
so much for watching.
We're gonna have so much
more about the Galaxy Fold,
because there's just so
much more to talk about.
There's the notch, there's the cameras,
there's a whole thing.
So keep it locked in the Verge,
we'll have a full review
for you very soon.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
