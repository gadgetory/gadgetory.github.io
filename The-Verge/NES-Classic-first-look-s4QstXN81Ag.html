with Nintendo's new NES classic it's
Nintendo's throwback to the original 80s
and yes it has 30 different games
everything from the original Mario
Donkey Kong Zelda Metroid all built
right in super easy to set up with an
HDMI cable and it's super wonderful to
use the whole thing is just really has
this wonderful retro aesthetic to it the
menus are our pixel art and there's just
this level of polish to the whole thing
the little floating save icons remember
that you need to save everything is just
super fast to start up and quit have
some of the stuff that's like really
nice is there's these filters that you
can apply that will either stretch the
screen to try and fit more stuff on
there for an HD display because you know
widescreen there's a CRT filter to make
it look like the original CRT TV from
back in the 80s and you can have it
pixel perfect which cuts down a little
on the widescreen resolution that gives
you pixel perfect rendering of what it
would have looked like with an NES one
of the other nice things about it is
there's some new features that
Nintendo's added that the original NES
didn't have you can suspend games at any
point now saw resume them which is
really useful for some longer games like
Mario or Zelda where you may not
necessarily want to sit down and play
through the whole thing in one shot I
mean the whole thing is just it's really
just delightful to use and opening up
the game just immediately takes you back
to the NES era the games look perfect
they play perfect it's the same
controller there's no lag the ports are
all excellent and compared to something
like an emulator where there's a fair
degree of setup and getting to dig up to
your TV this is just literally just plug
and play one of the other nice things
about the controller is the controller
hooks up to a Wii Remote with the same
adapter that the Wii Remote uses so if
you have a Wii or Wii U and you want to
play Virtual Console games it's just the
same adapter plugs right into the bottom
of the Wii Remote it does support
two-player games so if you want to play
something like Galaga two-player with
someone playing the second ship that's
totally possible
quitting out games is just as simple as
hitting the reset button on the front
and once you've exited a game you can
just save it and drive back in it any
time the NES classic costs 15
99 additional controllers for the MAS
classic are $9.99
and it goes on sale November 11</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
