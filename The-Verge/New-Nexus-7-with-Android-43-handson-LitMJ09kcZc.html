and this is the new Nexus 7 google has
just announced it's been off and rumored
and it's you know a 7-inch android
tablet what's new here is that it is a
little bit thinner and just a little bit
lighter than the previous Nexus in the
wording is horizontal in the back
there's a camera on the back as well
that's five megapixels but the big show
here is that the new screen is 1920
pixels by 1200 pixels full 1080p very
chris google says it's the highest pixel
density of any tablet and i don't know
if they're right but it definitely looks
really good there's really solid viewing
angles and as you can see this is a
newly set of tablet here so i'm just
getting in so i can take a look at it
the it's got a new processor as well it
is a Snapdragon s4 pro it's got two gigs
of ram instead of the one that was on
the previous device so it should be able
to run more apps at a time and hopefully
not bogged down like the last Nexus did
the other thing that google showed off
today was the chromecast feature so the
YouTube app has got this little chrome
button here and imagine if I tap it
it'll start playing on a TV somewhere
which could be fun so no that's playing
somewhere it is available right away the
16 gigabyte model is 229 and it's also
going to come in an LTE version which
will work on a verizon t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T
that'll be quite a bit more expensive
there you go it's the new next step</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
