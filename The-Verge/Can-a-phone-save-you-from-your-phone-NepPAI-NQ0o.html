these new “time well spent” options,
which tell you how much time
you're spending in all of your apps,
and it gives you an
option to lock yourself
out of the app if you use it for too long.
Here's mine, and… wow.
I watch a lot of TikTok,
and I make a lot of puns on Twitter,
and I play a lot of holedown.
But the holedown shouldn't count
because I do it on my commute,
and so it's time I would have
wasted anyway, and…
(sputters) (sighs)
Okay, fine.
This is bad.
And the truth is, I've
tried setting limits
on all of these apps,
and you know what I do
every time I hit that limit —
and I mean every time?
I go back into the settings,
I turn off limits,
and I just keep using the app.
That's a problem.
It's a problem I really need to solve.
I need to be frittering away less
and writing and making
videos like this one more.
And it turns out that there
are gadgets that promise
to help solve this problem,
like this Palm phone right here
that was released last year.
It's a second phone that's
designed to help me leave
this attention-sucking phone behind.
But here's a question:
can a gadget really save me from my phone?
So, yeah, this is the Palm phone,
and maybe you've heard of it.
It's super cute, right?
Like, it's adorable.
In a way, this Palm thing
is a phone that's designed
to not be that great
but be there if you need it.
Here's how it works:
you pay Verizon — and it's
only available on Verizon —
$10 a month,
and it shares your phone
number with your main phone.
It runs Android 8, which
means that you can install
any app you want on it,
but you shouldn't do that.
Just install what you really need
when you're out with just this phone.
The idea behind the Palm phone,
it's, you know… it's not that bad.
In fact, it's so good that
when people look at this thing,
and they see it, and
they think it's so cute,
they don't actually want to
believe me when I tell them
that this phone is bad.
Some of the design choices
on this phone are just off.
The software skin has this thing
that's supposed to remind
you of the original Palm OS,
but it just doesn't work.
And it defaults into this
kind of airplane mode
whenever the screen is off,
which is theoretically
there to help stop alerts.
But really, it's there to
stop battery life-sucking
because the battery life, it sucks a lot,
almost as much as the
camera sucks on this thing.
Now, there are other
light phones out there
or even straight-up dumb phones,
but they don't run apps,
and so that's the point of this phone.
Sometimes there's just one app
that you really need to have with you,
like, say, Uber for calling a car,
and this lets you have it.
And then it's on you to not install apps
that waste your time on it, like holedown.
I installed holedown on it.
Yeah.
Look, the Palm phone is badly designed,
but even if it were perfect,
it would still have problems
because our cellphone
networks aren't set up
to allow something like this to exist.
Just as one example,
getting texts on it is super complicated.
You have to use Verizon's
terrible Message+ app.
But also, if you use
iMessage on your main phone,
or RCS on a Pixel or WhatsApp
or Signal or whatever,
you don't get those text messages on here.
They only go to your main phone, so… yeah.
A phone for your phone. It’s a nice idea,
but it's impossible to make it right
unless all of our carriers
change all of their rules
about how phone numbers work.
You know, maybe I should
make a video about that.
Now, there are other gadgets
that could help you use your phone less.
LTE-connected smartwatches
like the Apple Watch or the
Galaxy Watch can actually help.
If you have one, it does just
enough to let some people
leave their phone behind for short trips
or going for a jog or whatever.
It can get your texts
and your phone calls
and even notifications,
but it's still not as
good at doing most things
as a smartphone is.
There's no getting around the fact
that you've just got this
tiny screen on a watch,
and Siri just won't do
everything you want it to.
Another category that
you might not think of
as keeping you away from your
smartphone: smart speakers.
Now that I have a few of them in my house,
I pull my phone out of my
pocket just a little less often.
On a speaker, you can't check your email
or, you know, play holedown.
“Hey, Google, play holedown.”
[Google Assistant] Okay,
“Hold On” by Chord Overstreet.
Here it is on Spotify.
Who the hell is Chord Overstreet?
(acoustic guitar music)
Whatever.
“Hey, Google, stop.”
It means that you use the speaker
to get a quick calendar reminder
or check the news or send a message
without getting distracted
by the rest of the crap
that's on your phone.
It can just stay there in your pocket.
Oh, hey, I really do want to
mention one thing here.
You haven't heard a
particular word in this video,
and that word is “addiction.”
You've heard the term “smartphone addiction”
all the time, everywhere,
but the science on whether
or not it's a real addiction
is still unclear.
In fact, Rachel Becker has written
a really good article about this.
So one of the problems
with calling it “smartphone addiction”
is that there are so many things
you could be doing on your smartphone.
You could be shopping, you
could be playing games,
you could be checking
social media or gambling
or watching porn.
And so it may not be the phone
itself that's the problem.
It could be any of the things
your phone allows you to do.
Where does all of this
leave us when it comes
to escaping these
attention-hoarding monster machines?
Well, sorry, Chuck. You're on your own
to figure that out right now.
Maybe all of these screen time settings
that you can get on
iPhones and Pixel phones,
maybe they could work for you.
Maybe you're strong enough
to just leave your phone
in your pocket all the time.
Heck, maybe even one of those
gadgets that I mentioned
could help you with that,
if so, bully for you.
They don't work for me, though.
I see the behavior that I want to change,
but I'm just not changing it.
So here's my plan, at least right now:
it doesn't help me to
learn that I screwed up
and wasted a bunch of time on an app
when I hit a time limit from
a “time well spent” thing.
I need a barrier before I start,
and that barrier is probably obvious:
uninstall the apps. That
way, if I really need them,
I'll have to go through the
hassle of reinstalling them
before I use them.
And I'm also going to move a bunch
of apps off my home screen
so I don't see them most of the time.
Do you have a plan?
Do you think you need one?
It's worth thinking about,
and it's probably worth
doing something about.
There are a bunch of software solutions,
and there are those gadget solutions.
But, I don’t know, for me — and trust me
because I've tried it dozens of times —
there is not a gadget
that currently exists
that has really saved me from the gadgets
that I already have.
And I'm betting it's the same for you.
Hey, thanks so much for watching,
and let me know in the comments
what's your guilty pleasure app?
Mine is definitely
holedown, obviously.
And if you haven't seen it,
The Verge has been running this
series called Better Worlds.
It's a fiction series
that imagines a future
where things are actually, like,
good because of technology,
instead of being
completely destroyed by it.
We've got videos, we've got podcasts,
and we've got short stories,
and you should definitely
check them all out.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
