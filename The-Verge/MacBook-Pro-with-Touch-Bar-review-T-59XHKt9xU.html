the Mac sort of this is the MacBook Pro
and this is the touch bar it's a thin
touchscreen strip that runs from one
edge of the keyboard to the other
replacing me not very functional strip
of function keys that have been there
for years at its simplest the touch bar
is a set of digital buttons that change
from app to app so you get archived and
send buttons and mail forward and
backward buttons in Safari and so on but
the touch bar is much more than that in
fact it's often better to think of the
touch bar as a little touch screen
portion of every app and in a series of
ever-changing keys on your keyboard I've
been using a touch bar for a week now
and I have mixed feelings about it in
some apps the touch bar makes itself
immediately useful creating clear
keyboard shortcuts and letting me get my
work done faster but there are a lot of
other places where the touch bar is too
complicated or just fails to make itself
useful on the right side of the touch
bar is an always available set of
buttons for controlling brightness and
volume and activating Siri you can
change these which is good because I
never use Siri and would rather put
something I do use there like spotlight
these buttons take a little getting used
to but I'd almost completely adjusted to
them within a day they aren't better
than physical keys but they aren't any
worse either that brings us to the
middle of the touch bar which is where
the real action is third-party
developers will be able to customize
this to suit their apps but for the time
being I've only been able to test what
Apple's apps are doing
I found the touch bar most useful when
it just served as a simple series of
buttons that way I could get used to
them just like anything else on the
keyboard in mail I quickly picked up
with archiving spam buttons word and use
them to just jam through my inbox
there's this emoji key when you're
typing which everyone has show to love
and there's this great button in photos
that flips between your edited image and
the original I love that other buttons
help provide some context so Maps lets
you filter my coffee shops or
restaurants or hotels and Safari will
show you a preview of every tab you have
open I never actually used that but I
can imagine other people liking it it's
the more complicated controls that can
be hit and miss here's two examples from
Apple's Photos app when you're using the
healing brush a slider pops up that lets
you adjust its size so I can do that
with one hand and move the cursor with
the other it's great but elsewhere it
gets to be too much here
there are three different sliders to
switch between it's not entirely clear
what each of them does and I keep
accidentally hitting these little
checkmarks beside them the sliders are
useful but not necessarily easier than
on-screen controls other times it's been
more complicated buttons behave in
unpredictable ways so this one pops out
this one pops over this one drills down
into a new set of scrolling buttons
offals essentially built a new set of
menus into your keyboard which yeah can
be about as awful as it sounds and then
elsewhere the touch bar can just be kind
of useless there were predictions that
pop up when you're typing are
particularly odd they're so slow that
they don't even update until you finish
typing and some apps make puzzling use
of space you should really be able to
customize the touch bar for how you want
to use it but not every app lets you do
that the touch bar can be useful but
it's going to take Apple on third-party
developers a while until they figure out
best practices for it when that happens
I think the touch bar really will help
people better use the apps they're
already in all day but it's not going to
revolutionize the Mac and I suspect the
future looks a lot more like a dull but
useful row of virtual buttons than a
strip of DJ controllers ok so we already
have a video covering the MacBook Pro
without a touch bar and you should check
that out for a detailed look of the
computer's hardware I'll just give you
the quick version this is one of the
nicest laptops Apple has ever made which
is to say it's one of the nicest laptops
anyone's ever made
it's impressively small has an
incredible screen and I even love the
shallow new keyboard now for the
differences this higher-end version has
a touch ID fingerprint sensor it's
better than typing a password though for
some reason Mac OS doesn't always give
you the option to use it having four USB
seaports instead of two is a bit more
convenient but not that much more
convenient because you're still going to
need new adapters two cables for
everything for the most part this is a
fast laptop but if you're looking for
serious pro work your mileage will vary
I was able to get pretty smooth playback
and it didn't NADP video and premiere
but I wasn't able to handle 4k this
laptop is well made in the way that Mac
laptops always have been and I'm sure a
lot of people will like it for that
reason alone but it feels like this
incarnation of the MacBook Pro is
shooting for a future it can't quite
reach one where it can be impressively
thin and powerful enough for pros where
it can be super light and have all-day
battery life where its ports and
keyboard more perfectly to the needs of
every user that future might be out
there but it's not in this machine
