we're here at CES day one I'm sitting
down with Raj Hilary from Qualcomm he
oversees their IOT and mobile computing
division and we're gonna talk a lot
about smart homes and smart cities so
Qualcomm you had your press conference
the other night and you can ounce
chips are pretty much everything smart
home smart phone smart city cars drones
out of all those which is the biggest
opportunity for Qualcomm right now we at
Qualcomm we feel like the technology
we've invested in in phones you know you
know particularly all the connectivity
technologies and the application
processor technologies we are finding
applicability for those technologies in
many adjacent markets and you saw us
talk about a few of them you know
automotive and IOT and healthcare and so
on we think that a lot of those markets
are already quite big for us we actually
ship a lot of products in the IOT you
know ship I think we said in the press
conference hundreds of millions of ships
already into IOT market and so what the
home a big area for us is adding
connectivity to a lot of different
things around the home so for example in
China we sell a lot of connectivity
technology you know Wi-Fi and processing
into a lot of air conditioners for
example has a lot of you know
thermostats in air purifiers you know
washing machines and a lot of white
goods then we also sell connectivity
into streaming speakers into connected
TVs and that's into a big part of what
you announce yes a whole reference
platform for Smart Hub products it's
best to scale across these different
devices is that right right so so I mean
if you step back and think about a smart
home and think of the products in the
home and what kind of technologies are
mostly needed in that what we are
finding is that firstly they need to
have the ability to connect to the
internet and that could be Wi-Fi you
know
you know to the access point and then to
the internet they also need to have the
ability to connect to other things in
the house like a Smart Hub at your
smartphone r2 r2 you know the other Lang
lights would connect to maybe you know
another control system at your security
system and so on so what we're finding
is in the home there's multiple
connectivity technologies Wi-Fi
Bluetooth ZigBee are the key ones right
so how do you deal with the diversity of
requirements with low power and high
power and things that need you know just
in LTE connection things that might need
ZigBee your z-wave which it's my
knowledge I don't think Malcolm makes
chips for right so we haven't announced
anything on TLC bill yet but what we
find is that be Wi-Fi and LTE and
Bluetooth are actually very big in the
home and interoperating from one
connectivity to the other so basically
most of these connected homes devices in
the future will have multiple forms of
connectivity so it's probably connect to
your phone over Bluetooth the access
point over Wi-Fi and to maybe a ZigBee
hub over our ZigBee so we think that
multimode connectivity is very important
and that's kind of one of the things we
announce no difference platform is the
ability to have multiple forms of
connect to be supported in one chipset
interesting so how do you decide what
forms of connectivity to put in because
some extent you're the gatekeeper if if
ZigBee connectivity is built into our
smartphones one day that's going to make
that platform and all that smart home
products much more accessible to
everyone
yeah I mean there's multiple ways to do
it I mean it's not necessary to have
ZigBee into the phone for example you
know you could have I think that a lot
of the endpoints in the home will
actually have ZigBee and Wi-Fi or ZigBee
and bluetooth and some things like that
so - the connection to the phone maybe
it's through bluetooth okay our Wi-Fi
and from there it may be zip get the
other one so that's why I don't think
it's important to have all of them in
the phone but it's important to have
multiple forms in the endpoints
not ships okay and so the other thing
that you were out there talking about
the press conference is your smart
cities product I know you know it's a
lot of low power processors things that
we'll be able to sit idle right awhile
at a time I you know have you gotten to
the point where these processors or
these chips can last on a very very low
power for a long period of time because
that's going to be one of the big
hurdles right yeah so what we announced
actually is our next-generation modem
chipsets which and we announced a few
family of them we announced abortions of
them a few months ago at i/o a day we
had in China if I step back a little bit
if you think about smarts it is the
connectivity in the smart cities is
going to be different the way the use
cases for example let's say you are you
know you're like a you know water
like a security system somewhere are
you're like water metering system or so
on what happens is most of the time you
have sensors that collect the data and
only once in a while you need to wake up
and send some information back so you're
not like on all the time like a phone
right and the data that you need to send
maybe just a little bursty data maybe
small part of it not a lot so what we've
done is build modems now that are able
to last on just a you know double-a
batteries for for over 10 years so what
happens is you install these things they
live in the field and you don't have to
update them for 10 years but they're not
on all the time they're just only on
when needed and a narrowband IOT is a
standard that's providing that so if the
processors are here what are the hurdles
still to adoption because obviously this
is still an emerging yet field we don't
see it everywhere ATT was talking
yesterday about how its testing things
in a few different cities but it's not
widespread and doesn't seem like it's
going to be widespread overnight well I
mean I think it will happen and it'll
happen pretty fast you know I think a
couple of things you know one the
business models need to get worked out
and they are getting worked out like
operatory the plans for IOT how does
that look like and then also you know
there's a lot of product out there and
installations have to get replaced one
by one but you see it happening fast
already like if you update your security
system now you got a new security system
that connects and sends you messages and
so on so
the cycles happen to these products you
will be getting things with a lot more
connected bill do you see these smart
city products like water meters and I
guess you know traffic lights being part
of the same Internet of Things that is
part of our you know security systems
and washing machines a smart phone these
tie together one day exactly so the way
we think about it is we think about what
is the underlying technology for all of
them so we look at the IOT as for
example smart body which is all the
variables you wear on the body
smart home all the kind of connected
things you have in the home and smart
cities and all the things that go into
the infrastructure the underlying
technology you need for those is
basically all the forms of connectivity
from ltw to and processing at the edge
because many times you need processing
to happen at the endpoint and they can't
just be you know sensors because
otherwise you to go to the cloud and
come back and the latency is too much so
that we think underlying technology is
going to be very similar the end
equipment and the markets will be
different so how does welcome to decide
which specific products to target or
your partners coming to you and saying
these are the kind of things we need to
make or are you trying to look down the
road and see okay we want to be in
healthcare we want to be in traffic
lights yeah it's a very good question
that's kind of what we do what I do in
my job in product management is firstly
the inputs we get are you know kind of
all of the above first our customers
tell us we want to do that then we also
look at what's possible with existing
technologies and what's possible with
technology is a few years from now so
many times when we innovate and push the
technology forward then we present to
the customers and say hey if we can do
this what kind of products would you
have so it's kind of a combination of
both technology push and market pull
gotcha well thanks so much for joining
us Roger - great talking with you my
pleasure thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
