and this is the bebop to the follow-up
to parrots popular first bebop the new
bebop is faster flies longer and offers
some improvements in the connectivity
which was one of the chief complaints in
the Verge's review of the original
version curiously there weren't major
improvements to the camera it's still a
14 megapixel fisheye lens that tops out
at 1080p resolution notably they didn't
jump up to 4k video but it's harder to
say how much better the connectivity
really is since we only had a few
minutes to try it indoors today paired
emphasizes that it's easy to use with
controls packed into an app for iOS or
Android devices takeoff and landing just
requires the press of a button but
navigating itself is a little tricky
until I get the hang of it parrot
emphasized that they eliminated weight
and moving parts by leaning on software
to do the hard work notably including
image stabilization some filmmakers
however would question the suggestion
that software can achieve the same
smooth footage effects as a gimbal which
is what competing drones like the DJI
phantom series rely on the camera also
remains on the nose of the drone a
potentially dangerous placement for an
aircraft that regularly crashes into
walls and trees it's going to be
available on December 14th starting at
five hundred $49.99 or seven hundred
$99.99 with a flight controller that
extends its range but until reviewers
get more flight time it's hard to say
just how much better the new bebop
really is</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
