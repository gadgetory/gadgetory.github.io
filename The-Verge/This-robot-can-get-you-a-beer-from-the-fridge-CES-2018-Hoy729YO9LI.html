waiting for I'm Paula Miller with the
bridge and I found a robot that can go
it's in the kitchen
go open the fridge get a can of Diet
Coke or adult beverage great and bring
it to you and then many jabs you have
them on the robot haters it's out this
day can never come so my buddy Aeolus
has other functionality other than
fridge beer delivery you can actually
attach a vacuum cleaner it can sweep it
can move chairs around so gets the
chairs away and then it sweeps
I was supposed to go find your glasses
you see how well that works so what's
important to know is that this will not
be cheap but they're trying to make it
kind of affordable it's going to ship by
the end of this year and they're saying
roughly equivalent to a family of four
on vacation overseas so whatever you
think that means so like maybe less than
$20,000 in the labs like universities
build robots that have some of these
functionalities and it's like three
hundred thousand dollars so it's really
cool they can get this into the home for
for under the cost of your home that'd
be nice
I'm obviously pretty excited I've seen a
lot of robots seen a lot of robots at
this show but none of them do anything
other than like vacuum or just like look
cute so I'm well I'm ready I'm ready for
this to happen if you enjoyed this video
about it is the best robot ever there's
other less important things on
youtube.com slash the birds
we'll be out CS all week and we're love
robots I'm about to broker a peace
between humankind specifically myself
Paul Miller and Aeolus congratulations
on being a robot he doesn't shake hands
in the job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
