we're looking at the Windows 8 touch
interface and we're comparing how you
access individual features on the mouse
and keyboard side so one of the first
things you'll notice is where I'll see
on the Start screen here and to get to
this sort of Start button you'd swipe
from the right in touch and you get like
the sort of charms here on the actual
keyboard and mouse way you go into the
very bottom right hand corner and you
get translucent charms and then you
hover over them and you get to start
button so toss switching on the touch
version of Windows a is you swipe from
the left and you can pop the metro
applications in and to get up the task
switcher interface on the keyboard you
use the stop button and tap ok the next
one is how we sort of get rid of
applications so how we close them forget
into photos just swipe from the top down
and then you can literally just like
drop it and that closes the application
on the keyboard and mouse side and you
go you use the mouse to go to the top
and you get sort of like grabbed and
then you can grab and pull down and that
drops it away by swiping up from the
bottom we get the options menu and on
the mouse we're just literally
right-click and now give you the options
and you can also use the windows logo
key + Z so the next gesture is pinching
to zoom out so this is the semantic zoom
and you can name groups and stuff on the
mouse and keyboard side you'd hold down
control and then you use the middle
scroll button on the mouse so they an
access semantic zoom then you can right
click on on the actual groups to rename
ok so we're going to tap to hold to
rearrange this application here so you
just scroll down and then you can
obviously rearrange it there but you can
also scroll with another hand
and trotting just there and to quickly
rearrange an app to say the end of the
list you just literally scroll with the
middle mouse button you can just drop it
in search for an application in tablet
mode you swipe from the right go to the
search charm and you type in the actual
application that you need let's go for
photos and on the keyboard and mouse
side you need to just type from the
Start screen and you can brought your
app as you can see much less obviously
done a lot of work to make sure it's
easy on the keyboard and mouse side and
on the tablet side to access to various
features in the Start screen of Windows
