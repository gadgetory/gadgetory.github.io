and what we have we have a functioning
talking to Ableton Live at the moment
and I'll kind of I'll just play with a
little bit and I'll explain kind of
what's going on
so right now we have the pads and kind
of a drum mode where can launch scenes
or drum samples we also have volume
control map to this slider this is for
the drum track when the when the volume
controls not being used it functions as
a vu meters you can see the levels
bounce on each of these sliders pretty
close yeah pretty close each pad can
output pressure velocity and XY I'll
show the extra-wide functionality see
the auto filter up here is functioning
in an XY fashion right now I have this
bottom slider map to the cross fader in
Ableton
but it because it's multi-touch it can
also be configured to pinch like maybe
it's a frequency range on the filter we
also have another mode which we call
grid mode where basic is going to
function like a drum machine where I
could go kick snare kick snare kick
snare get kick
so you can see the the kicks there is
basically it allows you to program just
like a rolling drum machine the scrub
controller
and even the switches on the kunio have
pressure sensitivity so like an example
is let's say I mapped oh you could
scroll through patches with these two
buttons the harder you press the button
the faster it would scroll through the
patches and whatnot it's scheduled to be
a street price of about 200 bucks and
we're planning to ship late March early
April to the general public and we're
super excited about it
yes how did that well basically we were
originally looking to try to get funded
of about 15,000 to get started and when
the dust all cleared and then the
deadline hit we'd raised 165 thousand
dollars which is basically approximately
700 units that are gonna they're gonna
ship in March I don't think so you know
in a way it's kind of nice because you
know what the demand is gonna be as
opposed to trying to project it and we
have people rooting us on you know
people are like investors as well as
customers you know and it also allows
development to be a little more open you
know we've had updates on our progress
and it's been really cool the last day
of the Kickstarter project I hit refresh
you know like 35 times to see how you're
doing but yeah I kept yelling out to my
wife we made 160 thousand one hundred
sixty-four thousand so it's just really
exciting and it's a new way of doing
business that I think is it's really
cool like having people you know having
patrons you know actually investing what
you're doing so I'm really excited about
that as well
