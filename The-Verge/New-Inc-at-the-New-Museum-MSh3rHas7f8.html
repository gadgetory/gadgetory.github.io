roughest places in New York he was the
eastern border of five points and home
to the Bowery Boys one of America's
first street gangs a lots changed now
it's an Arts Center home to a bunch of
restaurants a handful of artists studios
and importantly for us the new museum
inside the museum things appear right
now the second and third floor devoted
to the polish sculptor Pavel altmer and
Pavel himself is wandering through the
building stripped naked to the waist and
covered in yellow body paint the fourth
floor is open to the public anyone can
paint whatever they want on the walls
and the fifth floor is decked out to
look like a Soviet spaceship they pride
themselves on showing off the newest
most innovative art in the city but this
month they're launching a project that's
really unlike anything in museums ever
done it's called new ink a kind of half
workspace half incubator that's being
set up in a building next door to the
museum they've already signed up the
experimental architecture program
studio-x from Columbia and rhizome an
arts and tech organization that's
affiliated with the museum starting
today they're looking for designers
creative coding projects basically
anyone doing cool things with a computer
all of these people they're common
thread is that they're kind of working
with technology in an experimental way
by placing all of these different
disciplines in small space together
new ideas might emerge through the sort
of creative collision of all of their
different practices there's a really
rich tradition of art on the Bowery
artists like myelin and bela bartok have
had studios just across the street
startups have also launched here
Kickstarter's first offices were just a
couple blocks away part of the point of
the incubator is to bring those two
traditions together if all you need is a
work space it's easy to find a cheaper
one new ink is going for something more
cross-pollination between art tech and
design the kind of magic you get when a
lot of smart people are all doing
exciting things in the same place the
interesting thing is that's happened on
the Bowery before whether it's 70s punk
or 60s pop art this one Street has seen
this kind of neighborhood renaissance
over and over again in the end new ink
is betting on one more Renaissance the
designers and coders can piece together
another golden
