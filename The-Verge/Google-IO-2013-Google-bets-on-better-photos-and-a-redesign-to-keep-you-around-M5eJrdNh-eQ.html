announcing 41 separate features that are
coming to the social network that's a
lot so we headed down to the company's
mount a new campus to talk to people
behind Google Plus let's see what's up
it seems like the last year has been
there's been a lot of stuff connecting
up to Google+ I know I at the last I owe
you described goplus as the spine Google
connecting everything together the first
is our social spine once you've logged
in and upgraded to google plus we want
to present you with one seamless
experience not a series of disconnected
products it seems like you largely
achieve that like everything feels
pretty integrated there's still a little
bit of work to be done so what's this
next year going to be about well you're
right the last year we spent a lot of
our energy really making sure that
Google feels like a beautiful unified
experience so that your identity is your
identity then you don't have to keep
telling Google when you go to youtube or
when you go to Gmail or whether you use
something on Android who you are I think
we're you know if I the handicap but I'd
say we're about sixty percent of the way
done all right you still have a lot more
to do to really make things seamless for
users most of the features that are
getting introduced for Google+ fall into
three important buckets the first is a
redesign of Google+ is main website the
company has essentially taken their
interface for tablets and applied it to
the web instead of a vertical stream of
posts you get a three-column layout of
cards each one can be flipped over to
reveal more content and Google believes
that you're going to want to drill down
to get more information within each card
one thing we know at Google is that
latency matters and so we ensure that
everything is served up as quickly as
possible there's no gratuitous
animations they're there when you need
them and they recede when you don't it
could be a little confusing but we'll
see how it's like an actual practice
Google is also automatically adding
hashtags to every post if you want them
the company is using its computers to
automatically figure out what it is
you're posting it's a photo of the
Eiffel Tower or a story about a baseball
game and add those hashtags in the next
big feature is hangouts it's a merger of
google talk google+ messenger and the
old video hangouts and it's a big deal
Google's been behind the curve on mobile
messaging and it's nice to see them
finally catching up but an iMessage
killer this is not
next up our photo enhancements literally
Google will automatically enhance every
photo that you upload to plus it runs
them through a gamut of smart filters
like light balance color balance it
fixes skin blemishes and much more if
you don't like the changes your original
photos are still there untouched some of
the enhancements were a little bit
overbearing in our original demo but
most of the photos were better another
feature with photos is called highlights
Google looks through every album that
you upload the + and automatically
presents you with the best photos as
determined by computers that learn from
real humans it can identify blurry shots
duplicate shots and even the faces of
your friends and family from your
google+ circles it actually does a
decent job of recognizing what makes a
good or bad photo so we know what you
like we know what is regionally
appropriate for your photos because if
you look at a photo of a wedding in
Thailand in the photo of a wedding the
United States they're very very
different the way to compose and shots
and kind of the colors that they like to
use and so we are able to take advantage
of the stuff over time and improve these
algorithms Google+ may not have your
friends like Facebook does but the
company does have a massive and
massively powerful cloud computing
platform the idea is basically to hook
your social network up to a data center
and see what interesting things pop out
of it Google's betting that they get
your photos they can get your friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
