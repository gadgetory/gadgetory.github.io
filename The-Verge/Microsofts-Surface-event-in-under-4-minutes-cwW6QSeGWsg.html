battery life across I want to introduce
you to the power cover it's a 30 watt
hour battery added to your product when
I say it is the most productive
professional tablet in the world I mean
it we went from a tablet to a laptop and
we can use it in both forms but now
we've moved it to a desk we now have a
workstation pc right in front of us you
can power two monitors right off this
docking station i'm going to show you a
collaboration between assimilate and a
camera called red dragon i'm using raw
6k footage right off the screen and I
can do what I want with it here at my
workstation I can take it right to the
movie set with me but we're using the
forty-six percent color improvement on
the optically bonded screen with the
least amount of reflectivity in the
entire industry this is power type cover
2 is a beautiful product we gave it to
you in color it is exactly one
millimeter thinner than the last title
total type cover 2 is now almost as thin
as touch cover one
there's one more thing it's also back

ends of windows 8.1 you can use
split-screen three apps at the same time
