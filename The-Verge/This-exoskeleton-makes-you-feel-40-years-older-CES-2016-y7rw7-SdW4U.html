trying not in ecstasy today
now when you normally think of exosuits
think Tom Cruise edge of tomorrow super
soldier but with this exosuit I'm
supposed to be super old do you know
where the oculus booth is yeah thanks
yeah business card you on a robot
talking to another robot I think as
robots go I'm the superior one so I was
just part of a show and they were able
to manipulate parts of the suit in order
to make me feel different things
different conditions that a lot of
elderly people experience when they get
older
one thing that I'm working on right now
is I'm simulating rheumatoid arthritis
which means if I join some way and my
mobility is very limited so this would
not be an ideal condition to have
walking through CES but I'm doing it
because that is how much I love hands-on
so the suit can also manipulate how I
hear things one of the things that did
was a mimic aphasia where it sounds like
my words are repeating themselves after
I say them kind of makes you sound drunk
when you're Earth it when you're
speaking to people another thing they
can mimic a macular degeneration where
you have blurred vision huh
Jaken you know they know they can tell
you what a glaucoma looks like or
cataract so it was a definitely a very
eye-opening experience makes you think
about getting older but it was supposed
to raise awareness about the types of
conditions that can arise from getting
older and age so hopefully it'll make me
more aware of these symptoms if they
come on but I am tired anyway if you
