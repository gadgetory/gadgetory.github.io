special edition apple vs samsung I'm
nilay patel the are we sure we run the
music the whole time Creighton all right
I'm nilay patel i'm joined by matt
meharry in Arizona what's up dude hey
how's it going ah pretty well and we
have brian bishop on the phone right
right although that we gone it's going
really well so Brian this is a this is a
crazy edition of our special edition
it's also the second episode so I guess
it's not that crazy but brian is live
from the trial so this week the trial
that was scheduled for five days of
testimony and Sabrina's there today and
this is your lunch break are you eating
yeah we I'm not even a sense right now
I'm in my car in a parking structure
next to the courthouse so it's very
exciting Wow um are you like selling
drugs like what's going on I don't like
to talk about that all right so let's I
know you have a limited amount of time
let's uh let's talk about what's going
on so real quick Brian you want to give
us the rundown of what happened sort of
an on Thursday and Friday last week and
into this week yeah well mean first off
the bat you know something interesting
this morning judge Koh asked basically
both Apple and Samsung CEOs to get
together talking one more time before
the trial goes to the jury for
deliberation she'd have come to that a
number of times you know before and I
still do it one more time against a day
they're hoping to go she was really
pushing it evidence you know all of it
has been this week Apple wants to call
Susan kare back one more time who can't
until Monday but just so that we said if
you can't get you know care industry she
was going to be out you know for her
money and also I arrow down the case
basically no she cut three phones
the international galaxy s galaxy s2 and
the ACE from the trial altogether
because Apple couldn't prove that they
were sold in the US yeah I'm so she
that's undergoing a trim down their
claim you know even further she battles
done a bunch of stuff that happened this
morning and the last couple days and we
saw samsung finally going to cone you
know kick into their case you know after
apple basically bring out the best terms
of birth the two patents that they say
Apple has infringed that was all this
morning yeah it was a pretty dry stuff
we're talking about me how essential
patents about 3g you know packet length
and you know regulating powerful channel
like super Drive stuff and I was kind of
cute await started because out of
nowhere samsung Display deposition
testimony can choose and tell employees
with no context whatsoever and then put
an expert on afterwards to kind of
explain that he's still on the stand so
he's going to be wrapping up should I
take the back here at the bread for
lunch we have a samsung understand some
designer coming in you know we just
start like two minutes to four lunch
break start again I that follows a an
icon designer to Samsung called
yesterday the kind of gives men to do
their design process but a little weird
actually they kind of struggle for
talking about you know how hard stance
and designers work Apple dogs be pushing
out how dedicated their teammates how
much they work and then the same thing
she mentioned a I working on the galaxy
s really split two or three hours a
night and kind of out of nowhere just
volunteered that she just had a baby is
it closed him away from 50 and when she
had about breastfeeding which was just
odd but definitely convey that they're
committed you know she was definite
committed to her job yeah it's it's
human interest that's what they're doing
yeah absolutely but I made a point and
it's interesting the industrial designer
that speaking today as well the icon
designer both from Korea they speak
cooing and they're having a translator
go and in both cases we kind of saw John
plan you know emerge from the shadows
kind of question both of those witnesses
again no nobody had a meaner yeah so
he's kind of you know emerging again and
obviously imagine those vista testimony
are very carefully you know constructed
Orchestra don't want to throw you know
you're leaving a lasting appeal then if
you have a translator involved so it
makes sense but interesting change of
control vero and been dealing with the
laudable of the most
I mean so it sounds like Samsung is kind
of their opening tak was to go with the
invalidity kind of argument right and
depth later yeah they introduced that I
show different they witnessed had their
different product they focus on one
called launched I'll won't call the
diamond touch table at a number witness
we speak about that no I mitsubishi
diamond touch everybody remember that
good amazing product that changed the
world bennett but you know it's an
overhead projector you know showing you
images down on a capac there's really
the software that you're really
interesting one is called fractal normal
on his Mandelbrot yeah and that does Joe
very similar single finger such going
and you know your gestures IE doing that
kind of stuff and it was pretty people
pretty compelling than they showed it
and the other piece of software was a
little bit less though it was called
launched I'll this was like a new Idol
is developed I'm actually sure of
running on the the ipaq which is another
thing was pitching the world right um
and basically had a rough approximation
kind of inverse bounce back features
long story short on this trigger you I
you'd have like a huge field of tiles
you can drill down one level for the
screen to cut into quarters and these
were chillin those files if you score a
little bit you know old hunk left to
right or up and down we didn't go far
enough and the page would kind of like
mouth snapback and the information that
that was so much of the bounce back
feature and she strolled to the edge
with this thing it didn't drink special
there was no you know revealing the
blank space and having it out back the
edge so there's a visual chief was
interesting but wasn't necessarily a
direct corollary the bath pakpattan all
right even more visual example was this
thing called tablecloth that was on the
diamond touch and that was basically
they shirt it looked like a Windows
desktop and you could use a finger to go
and scroll up or down and would deal
reveal a second desktop right behind it
like a mirror image exacting image and
then he let go of that it would snap
back again so once again interesting
visual similarity but not the same
functionality I mean definitely not you
know what was described
in the past back patent which is very
very specific about what they're doing
note how that office works right so Matt
let me ask your a patent lawyer right
aren't you isn't that what you do for us
I don't get and I used to hate him um
what's your take on kind of this this
prior art that they're showing and how
it kind of relates to Apple's bigger
case well I said from the beginning I
think that's where I think that's where
the best case is for defense because I
don't think they really have much of a
non-infringement argument at least on
these older models that that used to
practice these various features um but
you know I don't know how a jury is
gonna receive it because I think well
the bounce back feature whatever they
call it in that diamond touch is not the
same thing doesn't match up very well
with the claims um but you know that
doesn't necessarily mean a jury won't
kind of draw the won't kind of put it on
top of there and figure out a way to to
see it as it as an invalid ating
reference but I just don't what were the
other ones what was what did they use
for invalidity on the tap tap to zoom
Brian that hasn't shown up yet I mean
there's a thing like they were kind of
hinting at it with the with launched
I'll and that you know if you could like
would zoom up but in terms about that
being a very specific thing now you
double tap or you single tap in and
zooms up they haven't had any you know
direct corollary to that one the one I
took it and really good shot with though
is fractal zoom did that pretty much
looks like the exact same thing so Brian
what's the jury when they're going
through this not you know I completely
agree with Matt that invalidity adding
Samsung's devices especially the older
ones the galaxy ass Aeneas to I mean
they did they do the same thing so I you
know there's the non-infringement is
whatever but I think the better argument
and kind of argument that any most of us
believe should be true is the invalidity
argument that these ideas have been
around that Apple got patents on them by
drafting claims around the prior art and
what's the jury when that when what's
the jury looking like when they're going
through kind of the tech
goal here's X it doesn't compare to
apples why are they engaged they bored
what's the situation they're into
everything as long as it seems to be you
know visual or design related and I
think that's the way it feels in the
quarters and you know like everybody is
engaged by that stuff when it starts
cooling down to the real specifics of
technical patterns of stuff today it
gets really really smoothie it started
going to stay engaged because they're
doing down to such a level you know
there is never seen source code today
there wasn't being shown up on the
public screen is that we couldn't see
but you get that a level of granularity
that it's just you know it's just hard
to being engaged with my preset up here
in as well as they could have by
dropping into their stuff today I kind
of out of left field but you know the
most part of all the design stuff
they're really really engaged and you
know several of the example Samsung
showed earlier this week in terms of
prior art for the iphone and ipad design
patent was compelling others i mean
they're not necessarily the exact same
kind of x you look at all the
illustrations up together next to the
the iphone patents they do look like you
know rectangles they do have like center
screen there's a lot of similar elements
there so depends i think and how well
the jury is going to go in and buy into
you know what the distinguishing
elements of those features are like how
how broad is just you know a centered
screen you know how important is the
world lines on the side how important is
the notion of the bezel in terms of an
actual vessel or the impression of one
from yale a plastic you know line the
plastics it kind of compare to how they
can interpret all this stuff yeah so
actually let me talk about
non-infringement for a second because i
just i just remembered something that I
definitely wanted to talk about last
week Brian you caused what I would call
a firestorm of controversy but because
Samsung was trying to show that its
devices did not infringe several of
apples patents I think chief among them
that the scroll back patent the the
bouncing scrolled everybody knows I'm
talking about and they were showing some
devices and it wasn't clear what they
were showing and it wasn't clear that
they were even using the devices in a
way that would cause behavior and you
wrote there trying to mislead the jury
in a head
I agreed with I think Brian agreed with
two can you explain what was going on
with that argument and why you reacted
so strongly to it well they're about
three or four examples over the course
of the day and actors / startup that
they were showing a galaxy tab 2 7 is
the original Galaxy Tab basically thing
like you know look it doesn't go and
have this bounced back feature to which
the extras that will know it doesn't
version i did and there's several
different yo applications in which
should have that functionality no such
like a direct direct like assaults as
things like no you're just line it was
just a weird way to approach because it
wasn't necessarily like they're talking
about the new show to specific it was
just a device didn't say what version of
the OS was running didn't say what
version is actually was running just
here's something that has that same form
factor that doesn't do this you know
this you know we're going to throw hear
that you're wrong here in correcting
your line which is just weird because
there can be a versions depending on
each other software updates back but it
doesn't have behavior but those are the
important elements that deter other
that's legitimate or not yeah like you
have to go by that effect is presented
that with no context felt really really
weird and they call it up later they
were showing on bounce back sures with
her for one in the browser scrolling up
and down and saying like what we're
strolling up and down and it's not
having the bounce back but they weren't
scrolling all the way to the edge of the
screen which is what activates the
bounce back in the first place and the
witness corrected them and i was just
kind of odd and they went back to
another one they're talking about you
know single finger scrolling dual finger
scrolling you know dual finger gestures
method and the base that has to witness
you know do any other do this galaxy tab
you know how to duel finger scrolling
and he said but what doesn't they said
well yes it does and they basically
showed a video of a user you know
basically scrolling with two fingers
what they were doing is they were moving
her fingers you know in and out while
they were going into doing while they
were scrolling it's also works on an
iphone the same rate or not you know and
I've had the same way and trying to
misrepresent that as two finger
scrolling was incorrect that's not the
way the devices work if you're talking
about do Samsung devices you know scroll
with one thing I didn't have gestures
with two they do right so Matt let me
ask you is this
is this just more courtroom theatrics is
this what patent attorneys trying to do
in front of a jury to try to they try to
evine is this is this presenting a case
zealously or is this technical and
constantly it's lame lame because you
know there's times when there's greater
how you describe things compared to the
claim language and whether or not you're
arguing about whether your features the
same if its operating the same way but
when you're actually you know kind of
playing games like that I don't know
what you're gonna prove because I assume
you mean it sounds like the expert
called them on yeah and even if the
expert wouldn't have you know that
Apple's attorneys would have on redirect
so I it I just think it makes you look
bad I don't think it gets you anywhere I
mean the bed do you think that they have
a good non-infringement tactic at all I
mean you're Samsung's attorney what do
you what do you say on the designs may
be better um I don't think they really
have that I mean it sounds like the no I
think I'm the designs it's about it
because I don't think that what's come
out when we saw some of these dealt with
specially designed patents and pulmonary
injunction motion and co judge Koh said
you know she pretty much dismissed all
the claims except ended up being the tab
10.1 but um in each case for the design
pad she says there I think there's one
that she didn't but it's likely
infringed and likely valid but there's
no a reparable harm so I mean and we're
talking about the same basic prior art
here now I don't know if the diamond
touch was part of but I know that other
table what's called the Brian do you
whatsoever not the second a lot of us do
what is it wats problem well launch atop
yes that was that was part of the
preliminary injunction motion as well
and it didn't went the day obviously so
um no I think on designs they might have
it i mean juries different than judge
code they can convince a jury you know
where they can convince judge go but i
still don't really see the utility
patents getting
and I think it's pretty clear there in
fringe so I mean that's a if you knock
out one or two of the designs may be one
of the utilities I mean you still have a
pretty big case going forward um for
Apple you know whether it's an
injunction or damages right looks likely
damages it's still significant about so
let me let me ask about in terms of
pairing this down samsung argued that
Apple shouldn't have included the
International Galaxy S the S 2 and the
galaxy ace which is funny because I
ranted and raved about why the galaxy
ace was in the trial last week so i'm
assuming samsung listen to me and took
action on my words obviously what does
that mean I mean the galaxy s2 in
particular the international s2 was a
massive selling device a huge hit around
the world does that affect their damages
calculation does that affect I mean and
you know in many ways I think the s2 in
the ACE they they touch on those design
patents much more directly than some of
the other products the epic touch 4g
right i mean i don't think that it's a
qwerty slider it looks appreciably
different whereas the acs to they look
very much like the iphone just getting
around the case reduce apples damages
claim does it reduce the effectiveness
of their case Matt what's kind of your
sense there and then Brian I want to get
your sense about how that's playing out
in front of like the jury my sense is
that it's not a huge you know this is
the hard part we haven't been able to
get exact number breakdowns of where
each one of these phones kind of falls
into the damage model yeah so I know
that yes you know there's a big part of
these that hurt us sales and to be
realistic the International was i9000
and and i 9100 yep s1 and s2 variants
those should never been in the case
because they were there's never any
indication that they were sold directly
to the u.s. other than through some yeah
the reason internet purchase you got a
ship there but um so I don't really see
it I don't know I don't know if it's
maybe brian has a better idea because
he's heard him talking about that and
kicking those phones out of the trial
but I
and really seen a number attached right
well Brian let's talk about when they
got kicked out because it was another
contentious samsung moment in the court
when they were arguing that that they
should were they they should kick these
phones out can you talk us through what
happened there and and sort of what what
the judge in Samsung's attorneys were
discussing yeah well those public is
like you know at the end you know we've
seen through service coracle as well you
know at the end of the case you know
each side kind of like you know files
for a judgment basically um you know
things right in this case samsung
basically said no we want to go and you
know file that Apple temporary things so
we should just win and everything's good
and just you know the days leading up
she said like hey you know I just want
to do these oh maybe he'll want the rule
50 thing to these big deal i play ball
at the trial I'm going to happened you
know Sam someone to go and provide a a
lengthy argument gone like you know
mentioned multiple details about you
know why thought they thought apples you
know hadn't proved its case and whatnot
and a toe got very very frustrated was
like basically I've never had anybody
need to go and you know file like a
written brief for a rule 50 this is
ridiculous now they made their card with
me the arm and finally she said okay and
it went on for about an hour like I know
which took a while yeah but was
interesting because they talked about
these phones she rejected you know
basically rejected everything up they
requested expect for these free phones
but Apple to put up a fight like Apple
very you know there's a brief discussion
about an apple and basically shape it
like you know what's the deal Apple said
okay and then that was just over you
kind of like this oh my god so he's a
kind of felt like Apple was really
wasn't fighting that hard for it either
right me because why would they who
cares I mean they're not sign if I mean
there's a loser already yeah it is
whether they would have been put it out
in the first place expected effect
they're trying to go and get like the
demarcate marquee like non carrier
branded versions of these things up here
just like they're just pure entitle you
know galaxy s and also the truth is you
know a lot of those comparison documents
that we've seen have been for you know
the original gallic yes not the domestic
variants it's just you know these icon
comparisons my coffee no toys like to a
tree at this point you documents
internal Samson documents comparing the
iphone to dig out the
other GT i9000 thing you know how can
you prove it to be more like the iPhone
and so I feel like that may have
motivated part of what they wanted it in
there isn't if it's not in a certain
point maybe there's a controlled as much
water yeah um but uh but it wasn't like
Apple put a big huge training with spite
of the day kind of like no let it go on
the doll well yeah I mean I think you're
right i mean i think they got to they
got to do discovery on the galaxy s2
which is the phone that led to all the
u.s. variants and then when samsung
threw it out there like whatever we got
our necessary evidence in front of the
jury and now we can just say like you
saw the samsung fascinate became was
from the s2 and here's the process that
led to the s2 i'm not sure that they
couldn't have gotten there in a more
indirect way by saying the precursor but
they did it they accomplished a goal so
Brian let's talk a little bit about what
happened today with the judge asking
asking both sides to pare down their
cases saying please don't confuse the
jury get your CEOs together you both
have a lot to lose what's your sense
there from her I mean what was that I
was that moment like she's always made
at the beginning she's been pushing
every way to go and like you know this
down because she did not wanna have a
long trial she saw something move along
her she has no criminal cases coming up
she wants you know move on to so she's
never been shy about basically saying
you know like you know cut it down be
reasonable um it was interesting cuz you
know she start after this narrowing
basically bringing out the three funded
and kicked out as an example of like now
hey you know you guys really didn't need
to go and ask for Apple later you can
kind of go through as well a couple more
in a couple more long but then she asked
the Aspen since the CEOs to meet again
and both sides agreed readily the loving
any hesitation there but it was
interesting because she kind of a cold
mountain a couple things you said you
know basically I see bad things to be in
store for you for both sides if there's
goes to trial you know ethernet you know
we get a berth is not hung jury it can
still play out bad and then she kind of
called it out it was really really great
she put the whole reason guys are doing
it just to make everybody really really
aware of your intellectual property
mission accomplished now it's under stop
but yeah it was closed if I called it up
up because obviously that's a lot of
what's going on here I think there's a
lot of you know a lot of you know chest
beating on Apple's part
you know she make it really really
really scared to go and that's what
they're they're designing a patent force
people to go and design around yeah
another way she's doing what she has to
do because you're never going to get
people to settle if you unless you
convince them they both have something
to lose so I mean she's kind of just
doing what every judge would do well I
mean my assumption is that the
settlement talks have been going on in
the background of this the entire time I
mean it Matt I mean there's no way you
would have a trial without constantly
talking about settlement with the other
side through I think there's been a lot
of settlement I think it's uh I mean
that brings up a good point we chose
documents that came up an end of last
week that showed that they know exactly
the details of some of the offers that
Apple made or the deal they were trying
to work out at least initially with
Samsung um that's been going on many
many more times than we could possibly
know I'm sure um even up to date i mean
i think those talks that we've seen
right before the trial and then like a
month or two before that those are just
you know kind of the judge forced them
to get in the same room but I'm sure
it's nothing more than they've been
doing already well I mean do you think
that actually co saying you got to get
Tim Cook you've got to get the CEO
Samsung whose name I'm just not going to
butcher in this forum you've got to get
these guys together in a room and
they've got to be the ones who make the
settlement agreement I mean do you think
that the lawyers are having settlement
conversations and co is just pushing the
actual executives to do something or is
it this a show I don't under to trial
and I don't know how helpful it is
because we've already seen him getting a
room together yeah leastwise right and
nothing's come of it um and I think and
I think we have a pretty good idea why I
mean I don't think we've seen kind of
surprisingly just how how willing Apple
was and I I want to qualify that there
will they were very willing to settle
but you know think about their offer
they're willing to give their whole
portfolio even these people don't quote
fundamental core patents but the price
was very high and it was a big dispute
here I thinking the reason it's not
settling is because in the end in these
cross-license deals you usually have a
net winner Annette payer internet winner
and I think apples asking for a huge
amount of money and getting all of
Samsung's portfolio and a cross-license
and only given them like a 20-percent
discount yeah he's done that portfolio
so they're coming out with big money on
the other end of that and there's ego
problems with that with Samsung there's
there's value problems because they do
have whether or not it's really the same
type of portfolio it's pretty clear it's
not yeah but there's still a lot of
value in it you know with regard to some
of these standards pads and some of the
kind of core fundamental hardware pads
so i think it's i think it's just that
apple would settle i just think they
probably aren't moving off to moving off
those big numbers brian they are big
they're I mean they're huge cuz there
compared to we thought Motorola's offers
a you know 2.2 dollars and twenty-five
cents a unit were insane or two dollars
in twenty two point two five percent
that's what it was yeah yeah it was
that's what I was not dollars I'm crazy
I they want bucks per night for samsung
vo/nat forty bucks for tablet I mean
that's that's bonkers so Brian let me
ask you when you're in the courtroom and
this is this is wild I'm basically
asking you like dude like us magazine
body language reading here and I mean
what what is your read on the lawyers
and the executives who are showing up
every day are they ours Apple side like
ignoring Samsung they are they talking
to each other before and after are they
throwing spitballs at each other what's
what's your vibe of the emotion in the
room you're not seeing anybody talking
to each other and that was that's a big
difference from google oracle because
they would always kind of powwow or beef
on their seems I don't know if it it's
like it's necessarily contentious but it
does seem like they people know they
came out and chatting it up and being
cool you know after everything wraps is
usually like one side on their side the
other side on the other side in terms of
executives there's been some Samsung
executives they've been in the overflow
room with some that are no in the scan
they're just very very reserved and are
interacting with people of general but I
know it's also a matter of you know of
styles of the attorney everyone
we have their own kind of you know five
you know in the courtroom yeah that kind
of carries over of uh you know they're
arguing about you no objections and all
these kind of things you know that can
go and get a little heated because you
know they're both getting press Biko on
both sides she's having them both kind
of you know you know hurried along or be
more realistic or anytime should get
them to go move things along quicker she
does she's not you know she's a true
both so if you have both sides are your
organic or point that can get a little
frustrating there can be some cutting
off and that kind of thing now on that
sometimes happening you know then what
the situation that can be happening out
in front of the jury right although most
patients are try to keep it really
mellow and for the old guy and that
present like a nice you know become you
know accommodate right so let me ask you
who is it's been what two weeks two and
a half weeks now with us for you yeah
who's that who's kind of the smoothest
lawyer and on what side because i know
in Google Oracle was was clearly robert
van nest on the Google side who was
leading the charge in terms of being the
most charismatic after the jury who
who's really leading a charge here you
know it every splitting stuff up it's
hard to pick a particular person I think
belvera joven is actually is pretty good
because you he's given witnesses can
kind of get can kind of get defensive
you know he's good at kind of you know
being fun and so as bill price for that
matter both on the Sampson said they're
both like really really good and working
with witness um you know Apple you have
a William Lee who can to keep it going
for people yeah you know without me like
a big jerk you can kind of like you know
do those great you know it's almost like
a courtroom chief knowing where he's
like now what about this and you're like
that without coming off like a jerk ya
know and Michael Jacobs was also
attorney for oracle uh he does always
feel vaguely just kind of floating above
everything is not very engaging on a
human personal level I don't feel like
yeah um now which I think there's a
problem that when Oracle of Oracle yeah
so it kind of a kind of you know it's
kind of various in person to person you
know the one person I think that still
you know has some stigma attached them
and this may I don't know if the jury
feels this way cuz they didn't see what
we saw but it's
over time here John Quinn on Samson said
that stuff your septic expecting
something outrageous to happen but that
was acetone he said early on that's
probably why he hadn't been around so
much that yeah well I mean he did make
it seem like he was and he's not and
he's like a famous litigator you know
like he's he's a high-end attorney he's
not a cheap guy to having her side and
it's funny that he set this tone of
being completely out of control at the
beginning because that's not as well and
it could be fair like you know both
sides both of these teams are so smart
and so good and so professional you know
it's need to go and see them do this
thing even if they're like no strange
tactic but these are all just like
really really smart people and
everything they do I think you know is
very very calculated and intelligent
there's always a motivation behind so
and i was talking to brian about that
and he said it's interesting to judge a
house up in the coracle case was Barry I
mean I think there's a couple times he
said you know great arguments he was
kind of appreciated the lawyer those
going on to the most extent oh but Co is
Jesus had it him you come right out and
say at her you know I need a written
down I need evidence cuz I don't trust
anything you guys say in this courtroom
yeah yeah that's pretty harsh you don't
hear that very often from a judge
talking to lawyers are representing
clients in front of her I mean that's
that's bizarre why I think there's I
think you know my theory on this is this
goes back to them trying to settle I
think the gamesmanship at trial is
ultimately about leverage in these other
conversations that are happening and I
think on many levels both Samsung and
Apple maybe not at the legal division
but in the executive division cannot
believe that this has gotten this far
and that there will be a resolution then
the jury will make a decision and that
you know either Samsung has to pay two
billion dollars or Apple us to pay
however much and have some of its
patents and validated that they think
are treasures you know I don't think
their executives believe that that day
will come and so they're playing this
game brinksmanship and they're using the
court as a proxy and I think judge Koh
really sees that I think she understands
that that really what's happening in a
courtroom is a proxy for what
it's happening in a settlement or
conference room somewhere in settlement
negotiations and she's really irritated
about it I mean that's the sense in any
of you think they're gonna settle before
do or during deliberations uh I yeah I
kind of do at this point I kind of do I
it just it's so dumb I mean how can you
run one of these companies if you're Tim
Cook in the jury is in deliberations how
can you say we're going to leave it up
to the 29 guys right Brian or nine
people rather yeah we're going to leave
it up to these nine strangers we don't
know to decide the value of our patent
portfolio and the value of what Samsung
did to us in the past with these other
devices if you're running Samsung how do
you say we're going to let these nine
people decide if we have to pay apple
two billion dollars like that to me is
great you know you made your case you
presented it you you know the verge ran
a hundred stories about your internal
documents like that's great and it's all
wonderful but at the end of the day just
these companies have to continue to
compete in a broader level they have to
continue to partner and if they can't
figure this out I mean I do think it'll
be like the last day of deliberation
unless the jury goes away for like ten
minutes and they come out and like yep
they did it like I don't don't worry you
know I got good yeah I mean I think it
would be the best of both worlds if they
did because we get all the fun we had
all the funds yeah and oh yeah the
market hasn't really changed that much
in others and I think behavior has
changed like we talked about last week
yeah I think things aren't different
between what Samsung's doing now and
what they did then so that's you know
perhaps a good thing so I think you
still get the change you maybe want you
get some value because I'm sure that
there would be some money exchanging
hands in any settlement um and and it
like so we got we got to write about the
stuff and see all these cool documents
Ned an oddly Apple didn't really I think
a lot of people worried they would
settle or thought they might settle
because they'd be afraid of all these
documents but for the most part this
stuff what we saw was all very
interesting but it's all historical well
you know I had I talked to a source of
mine a person who worked on the iphone
and I said you had better get ready to
relive 2006 before the trial started you
better get ready to relive 2006 because
you're going to see every everything
that ever happened I mean that time of
your life is going to be poured over and
examined by the press and we're going to
talk about in this person he/she mermaid
I mer man could be anyone said to me
that's cool I want people to know how
much hard work we did to make the iPhone
because nothing like it existed before
and I think that was the attitude at
Apple I think that it's like whatever
it's out eunos on we're not talking
about the iphone 5 we're not talking
about the next iPad we're talking about
it came out three years ago and changed
the industry to have at it this is here
are all of our bad ideas it didn't
change the industry you know like I
don't think they care and you know that
to me this this idea that Apple is some
like irrational crazy actor that doesn't
know how to run a business it is like
purely emotional and operates on passion
alone is insane herbal decor thing it
yeah i mean like looks so yeah so Steve
Jobs might even CEO of Apple and he
might have said I'm gonna blow up
android spend all the money but he had
to report to a board of directors and he
had an army of employees who could say
that is stupid like ultimately that is
stupid and I don't think even even Steve
Jobs I don't think had the power to say
we're going to blow all of apple's
enormous amount of cash reserves on
killing Android just because I'm mad I
think it's something there's there are
plenty of checks and balances on system
to Brian I know you're going back into
the trial right you're right it I had to
jump off yeah we're we're starting up in
seven minutes here so I there to jet
alright well hey this it's I think next
week it's not five days next week is it
no no we're three days from here on out
and like unless you know co is hoping
the third of the jurors may be in
deliberations you know uh you know in
next next week so this thing is going to
be progressing even quicker show all
right well Brian it's great to have you
will looking forward to more reports
this week for me and we'll have you on
the podcast again next week absolutely
thank what guys take care sit all right
guys all right man any any last you
you cut off Matt there's mad again now
you got two brides that's right to
bryant's better than one man can we get
a Batman to brians double Brian and we
filed Matt can you write something up so
Matt let me get some last thoughts
before we go um I mean how do you how do
you think Samsung's on the offensive now
right they've done invalidity they're
starting to get into their friend
patents all other stuff how do you think
their offensive case is going to play
with the drain and then we can well I've
been I've been trying to get a feel for
that from Brian yesterday and today it
sounds like it's really kind of
scattered they were jumping around
between kind of their offensive case no
now that they're presenting you know the
primary doing all the direct
examinations they jump in between you
know kind of invalidity non-infringement
jump back to their offensive case on
their pads and I think now it's kind of
settled into just their offensive case
today on their patents and my guess is
it's incredibly boring they have you
know unfortunately they have to have
translators in there for a couple of
witnesses so it's very methodical and
dry and slow yeah and I think that
doesn't help it and I just learned
something from Brian today um I just
really bizarre to me as they were as
they were questioning I mean they were
presenting their evidence on these fran
patents which we know are the case in us
from the very beginning I thought that
was the biggest snafu that Samsung made
is keeping those patents in the case
going before a jury because first you
have apple presenting their story their
narrative nap ha peers and we're
innovators and and then you then you get
to the to where Apple's defending and
then they get to bring a story back up
and say see these bad guys now they're
trying to throw Fran patents and
standard pads it's desperation so I
figured you know they would buy the end
it would just eliminate those and that's
because there's such a such a wart on
their case that I had a hard time
believing they would keep it um but then
I found out today that for some reason
something's happened in this case and
I'm not sure where if there's been some
briefing that we did see but there the
judge and Samsung is basically keeping
apple from really asking these experts
anything about Fran
shoes I mean they're talking about the
wireless technology they're talking
about whether it's actually performed by
the iphone and the ipad which ones that
are talking about licensing i think with
Qualcomm and infineon but when it gets
too actually Apple trying to tell a
story about these are Fran patents that
are standard you can't do this with them
it's getting cut off really the drivers
kind of wine yeah apparently they're
objecting and the judge is sustaining
the objections on those issues and I I'm
not sure if that's because they haven't
opened the door enough to it but I don't
know why because to me that's I mean the
easy argument for Apple there is we can
talk about this all day long because it
affects the damages we have to pay on
these patents because they're Fran
patents and the percentages are lower
and you can talk about what it means to
be free and but for some reason they're
just they haven't been able to get into
that story and that could be huge for
samsung if they can present these pads
as kind of normal patents and not really
get into the obligations yeah under Fran
I think they can avoid that stigma well
but there isn't yeah honestly I did the
the legal mechanics of this or so opaque
um but you know they don't have apple
doesn't have the the breach of contract
claim at issue here right I mean it's
just a patent infringement claim it's
either you do or you don't not you
didn't finish fast yeah you've got it
you've got to put the claim in there
though right I mean it's you either you
do infringe a patent or you don't and
then the stuff of well we had to
infringe Pat in order to use the
standard or we have a contract with this
standards group that you will license
the patent to us that to me I mean that
those are alternate claims aren't that
yeah yeah but I don't understand I guess
they've tried to actually talk about it
so that's the weird safe they keep
trying to go in on this and and
Samsung's quick job Jett and the courts
keeping them away from it well and it
seems like if you're arguing on our
freshmen you could also be arguing and
maybe maybe it's a case okay night you
bring up bring up your you do cross on
yeah I don't know to me it seems like
these woods
would be the witnesses but maybe it's
just because they're experts on
infringement right and that's not
relative to the Frant so at some point
they'll have somebody up there that can
actually testify as to the standards
part of this yeah using Apple's gonna
put up somebody some old french engineer
from from etsy yes to be like that'll be
great alright well Matt I think we
should wrap this up we've we've gone
plenty deep this week always a pleasure
to have you ghost Brian I'm gonna miss
you next Wednesday Creighton that's next
Wednesday we're doing this again and
we'll be cruising towards either a jury
or a settlement by then I would say this
case is like three quarters done I mean
I don't the fact that co was trying to
steal streamline the case more didn't
really make sense to me because cases
almost done I think she doesn't make of
that big sheet of paper the jury that
says here's 50 and then twenty phones um
I'm that's that's got to be it so um
well we'll see what she does we'll be
tracking at brians there I started again
according to his seven minute
calculation and we'll keep you updated
for the rest of the week and we'll be
back again with the podcast next
Wednesday so thanks very much for
listening that's been the verge cast
special edition apple vs samsung mat
thanks a lot buddy very good times over
wednesday
