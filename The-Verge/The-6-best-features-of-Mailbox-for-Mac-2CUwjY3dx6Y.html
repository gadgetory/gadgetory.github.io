well it's in beta so there are a few
bugs but that won't stop us from showing
you the app 6 best features to help you
get through email faster than ever first
mailbox for Mac is super quick adding an
account downloads all your emails
instantly there are no loading bars ever
second the app swiping is here - as
you're scrolling through your inbox you
can quickly swipe to archive with just
one motion or as in most apps this takes
a few clicks third you can finally
select multiple messages sure that's an
easy one but is there any other mail app
that lets you push a ton emails until
tomorrow all at once or a ton of emails
until you get back from vacation in a
month for this thread view having access
to all your message snippets in one
column makes even long conversations
easy to parse you can click on a message
to expand it v is drafts in the new
mailbox you can click away from any
message you're typing and your draft
stays right where you left it and even
shows up on your phone instantly finally
the new app lets you defer a message to
your computer or to your phone let's say
you're out to lunch and want a certain
email to be at the top of your inbox
when you get back to your desk this
button lets you do it
mailbox is the first desktop email app
I've used that actually feels fast but
it isn't for everybody there are no
labels or stars and for now only works
as a gmail in iCloud but with the beta
finally out in the wild you can count on
a lot more features coming soon and
mailbox knows exactly what it needs to
do the beta is available now but there's
a wait list so you might have to wait a
few more weeks before you can start
burning through your inbox</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
