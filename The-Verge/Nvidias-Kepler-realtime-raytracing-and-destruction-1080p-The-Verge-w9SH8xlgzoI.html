finally able with Kepler's GPU do you
real trip do ray tracing in real time
and so notice the blue lumens yes
there's one person who really
appreciates know there's there's a whole
bunch of us so let's set this and go wow
that's really hard look at that and so
you could see the the claw our logo of
course you could see very clearly you
could see it reflected on the cylinder
and not the silly but the sphere you can
also see our claw reflecting off the
sphere but you can also see the sphere
reflecting off the clock off the sphere
okay notice that the glass case the
glass boss is not just a piece of
plastic is actually not
a translucent polygon is actually the
modeling of a piece of glass and notice
that it's reflecting and notice the
edges of the boxes all rapists there's
actually real challenging there there's
real glass it looks like real glass well
that's all very cool but let's pick it
up in our shall we
we know that ray tracing is hard we know
that fluid simulation is incredibly hard
what did we did ray tracing and fluid
simulation at the same time and ray
trace the fluids
let's go completely crazy shall we
alright Jim let's see it the reflection
and the refraction in the Pernell
offense of the water
it's just beautiful watch this as you
can see as you can see GTC is not only
about science GTC is not Stan Kepler is
just the beginning of it you can see
that in several years computer graphics
well look nothing like the chalk chalky
computer shaded easy easily shaded loves
WC in game console and video games today
this is the way that next generation of
computer graphics will look computer
graphics the first element of Kepler's
influence now of course we understand
that computer graphics is vital to the
work that we do together here it's vital
even 2gb computing and the reason for
that is because the computer graphics
is so large the video game industry is
so large there are hundreds of millions
of gamers around the world the video
game industry is tens of billions of
dollars large as a result is able to
fund enormous advancements if we could
harness that basic architecture and
leverage it for general-purpose
computing it is unbelievable how much Rd
we could bring to bear we can also of
course make this technology highly
pervasive so that everyone here in the
audience any of the scientists around
the world can easily reach out and grab
a supercomputer in their hands Hepler
is a big deal for computer graphics but
Kepler is a bigger deal for
high-performance computing today I like
to announce the other persona of Kepler
Kepler is going to be the most energy
efficient and the highest performance
