levels of secrecy around his films but
the latest film from bad robot takes it
to the next level three months ago 10
Cloverfield Lane didn't even exist as a
blank page on IMDB but this week it hits
theatres I sat down with the producer
and Star Wars director to talk about the
film and the least spoilery way humanly
possible how close are you to actually
just pulling a cinematic Beyonce just
dropping the whole thing on a Friday no
warning no trailer I don't know quite
get away with that but it was it was
definitely a decision to withhold the
movie as long as possible and just to
kind of see what might happen you know
anything that breaks the template and
the sort of expected way of things is
always kind of fun to to try and
paramount was open to doing it which I
was thrilled about yeah and I mean the
title obviously makes for a lot of
speculation about how this ties in to
Cloverfield and all of that I personally
enjoyed it it's just a trapped in a
bunker with John Grant my movie which in
which way do you look at so many of
those yeah yeah it's a it's a strong
genre in the bunker I mean with what way
do you think it's more enjoyable for
audiences to come in as like a
standalone or
how worried do you think this we
purposely you know didn't call this
movie Cloverfield - because it's not a
direct sequel at all and the idea is to
begin what is in part and anthology and
in part this other thing that we're
working on and it felt like you know
it's things don't make sense until you
know them so it's like what is being
questioned right now if this works will
be understood as soon as it does and
what I'm hoping is we have this sort of
big idea that it would be really fun to
do if we get the shot and this is just
another sort of you know step in that in
that direction but I think that that the
movie is deserving of attention I think
it's it's
it's a funny terrifying weird twisted
cool suspenseful thriller and those are
really fun to see when they work and I
think that Dan and the cast and crew
great job tell me a little bit of how
you started collaborating with Dan
because he came out of the the kind of
film journalism coverage world and like
how did that how did the idea develop
with him and how did you find him well
Lindsey Weber who produced the movie
with me knew Dan beforehand she was a
fan of his he had done some shorts as
well and he came in to meet he had an
incredibly clear vision was a kind of
very clear collaborator and so we began
working on you know the script once he
was signed on while he was shooting I
was working on Star Wars so I would
watch dailies but I wasn't on set with
him and then in post we were just
working together to make you know sure
that the rhythm of the movie the effects
the sound design all that kind of stuff
was as strong as it could be but you
know he directed this movie I was just
trying to be as helpful as I could to
help you know his vision be seen through
but he was a wonderful collaborator yeah
I mean it shows on screens he was so
cool so like ready in service he's great
yeah he's a very confident director and
I loved it it's almost more Hitchcockian
in a way than anything else and I feel
like you know as the first Cloverfield
movie was you know a family footage
movie and Matt Reeves
you know did such an amazing job with
that and that covered that kind of
energy dan does something you know
wholly different with this movie it's
very confident in time that time is very
still but building tension in a
different way and it just feels you know
it's an incredibly cool thing to watch
this movie and think it's us first yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
