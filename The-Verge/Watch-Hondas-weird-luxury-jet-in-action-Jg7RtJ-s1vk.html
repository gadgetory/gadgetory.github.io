known for its practical line of cars but
the Japanese automaker is dipped its
toes into a variety of other businesses
too as generators lawnmowers motorcycles
a friendly humanoid robot named SM oh
and now a beautiful jet designed to
ferry six titans of industry to their
destination in total luxury what makes
the HondaJet weird though sighs the fact
that Honda is making an aircraft is the
way the engines are mounted most
business jets like Lear Jets
Gulfstream's and the like a pair of
turbo fans mounted on either side of the
rear of the fuselage the HondaJet on the
other hand has its engines mounted on
pylons that rise from each wing Honda
claims benefits to fuel efficiency and
cabin space and on a jet this small you
need all the cabin space you can get the
plane has been in development for a long
time in fact Honda started looking into
business jets in the late 1980s
partnering with Mississippi State
University on the MHO to an even weirder
looking plane that was never intended
for production the HondaJet meanwhile
made his maiden flight back in 2003 and
has been delayed several times since
then it turns out building a mock point
six three luxury bullet is harder than
it looks at four point five million
dollars each the market for the HondaJet
won't be huge but for the executives who
absolutely need to get from New York to
LA in the blink of an eye this might be
one of the more attractive options out
there they'll be able to travel over
1,300 miles between refuelings with the
typical load clipping along at a brisk
420 knots at 30,000 feet even the pilots
are wrapped in luxury they've got access
to a battery of giant displays provided
by Garmin that sit in place of
traditional instruments the Honda Jets
from the future and unfortunately the
future isn't cheap if everything goes
according to plan and the plane is
certified for sale by the FAA early next
year they'll run you a cool 4.5 million
