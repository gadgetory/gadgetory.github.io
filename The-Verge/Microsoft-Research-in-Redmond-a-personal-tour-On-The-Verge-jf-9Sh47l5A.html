on that note I would like to show you
guys something that we did we went to
Microsoft you guys already seen a little
bit of this we went to I went to
Microsoft to their campus and looked at
some of the research projects they're
working on and it was a pretty
interesting trip
so take a look and and we'll be right
back
I never thought I'd see this with my
eyes with my eyeballs I figured I'd have
to get implants to see it build a 92
there's 91 buildings before this pretty
man hey hey Josh be an are you good to
see it so this is Steve Clayton he's
going to show us around the campus and
take us into the dark deep chambers that
no one else is ever allowed to see right
oh you promised me welcome to Microsoft
all right let's do it
excited I can get me a cloud computing
shirt t-shirt let's you will come on
bite size too small ladies small what
you need is some gold cool yeah do you
have golf gear here Ballmer is a golfer
right does he go
or no I think so I don't play around
with you loud to refer to miss Ballmer
excuse that against rules you can't say
wrong let's go fine yeah that doesn't
say Microsoft on it I'll bet it does no
it does it look at this line what is
what what are the savings like wait a
second this is line for zooms yeah what
do you mean no no but is there any
special reason why there's a line for
just another back in stock are you gay
zooms are back in stock to Microsoft or
there's a line this is insane this is
probably the only place you'll see a
line for zoom Zack
which is I think they're gonna kick us
out
now this kinda makes me want to buy a
zoom though I might get in this line how
much is the 64 this is a visitor center
this is design just kind of show off
what you guys are doing yeah it gives a
little sense of how the history of where
we Microsoft invented the typewriter
yeah you invented me you invented the
Atari and get a general electric
television are you taking credit for the
GE television I feel like that's
somewhat disingenuous my job is to work
with all of the kind of product groups
all of the research teams across
Microsoft were looking at trends like
natural user interface and social
computer and cloud computer and until it
helped to tell the story of what
Microsoft is doing across 90,000 people
well right now we are on main campus for
Microsoft in Redmond in building 99
which is the headquarters for Microsoft
research worldwide and the location of
our Redmond research levels hey so who
are you guys and what are you working on
so I'm Brandon Lloyd are you miss Teresa
I'm Nicola da Vinci that's the nature
and we both work in the extreme
computing group it's a kind of a lab
within Microsoft we're computing right
it guys had to drink a lot of Mountain
Dew this is a simple mobile augmented
reality system we have this image and
the cameras on the tablets that you see
here with that this one fixed on the
tripod they are tracking that image so
this is this is tracking here and then
you guys are tracking individuals right
right
by finding this image in the video feed
it can figure out where the camera is in
space and then once it knows where the
the real camera is it can render virtual
objects from that same point of view and
then overlay them on on the background
okay so you guys have another mode on
here that's called Kinect mode and we
brought Steve in to help us out with
this and can you explain what's going on
with this we hooked up a Kinect camera
to this and what we're doing is we're
capturing whoever sits in front of the
camera in real time this is disturbing
so this is kind of a different kind of
video chat
all right let me try this out when we
get there it is it is I feel like this
isn't right people should be like and
want me to look at yeah look at the
connector okay and then we'll freeze it
and now you can come in and explore
yourself with the tablet that is
something I enjoy doing so oh wow this
is very upsetting very upsetting this is
horrific I mean this is a true horror
this is like a scene from a Saw movie so
we're making our way through the
Microsoft campus here but we're going to
stop and take a look at this anechoic
chamber they've got where they do sound
testing and they test webcams there and
supposed to be pretty cool and I'm
hoping I can get maybe a little nap in
if i play my cards right hey hey how are
you I'm Josh I'm Dale sig oh I think so
thanks for letting us to come in here
that gel and what do we look at so we
are going to look at one of our an
approach Amber's here at Microsoft wow
this is really disorienting yes this is
is it's kind of making me a little
nauseous yeah normal um depending on the
person it can be and so if you guys get
I can barely hear you yeah that normal
that isn't that is normal by passing out
what if I just passed out right now does
that happen for that has not happened
before has anybody freaked out from this
oh we had to escort people out really
quickly so we test all of our acoustic
prog products obviously so our webcams
and headsets the Kinect was tested in
here we actually also test non acoustic
products like for our mice and keyboards
and other devices that have some
mechanical characteristics that might
generate a sound we'll put them in this
anechoic chamber so we can actually
characterize a sound and identify if
it's a buzzing or a hum or the sound is
coming from that sort of thing okay have
you ever come in here and discovered
Steve Ballmer asleep taking it a little
stealing away a little nap and had to
wake him up no really yet you can tell
me man no no
you know when you think about it with
the lights off and this nose sound be
the kind of like sensory deprivation yes
you know can you imagine what you'd see
in that pitch-black the ball everybody's
very uncomfortable Ballmer jokes around
here I have to say every time I mention
baller people are like I can't comment
on that
it's like he's listening watching uh you
know it's why I've thought about it I
actually could I go in here and just
stand in the dark in the chamber
sure okay great oh my god
wait a second I might actually be having
some kind of vision I'm seeing Steve
Ballmer napping this is amazing this
vision of Steve Ballmer I mean flying
this is really cool we're in the
Microsoft model shop this is where
Microsoft's actual products are designed
and built we're talking to Carson a
guard who is your model maker here and
so if a new Xbox were coming if there
was a new version which you can tell me
if there is it's no care off my world so
what are we looking at here you've got a
table full of we're looking at basically
a variety of what we do down here broken
down to everything from raw 3d printed
parts to some CNC parts this is a 3d
printed wrench that you printed in one
piece correct and you can use it like an
actual yeah so that shows the ability to
be able to print multiple parts together
as an assembly
so we're here with young Kim who's one
of the designers who worked on the arc
mouse which is a kind of an
award-winning pretty big product as well
as mice go it also kind of started with
was nothing more than just hair bands
and foam core where we were playing
around with pieces that bent and flexed
you have to take this up to Ballmer
right and say look this will work not
really don't you don't go right yeah we
didn't check in with Steve Ballmer that
he doesn't you know he doesn't approve
all the early mice design no that was my
understanding like this okay good that's
good
I really need to get something like this
or this because I'm using like an old
every time I reach into my bag there's
like a ball there what kind of and yeah
it's like it's one of these guys it's
like a classic it's a classic Mouse okay
have you ever seen anything this
advanced I think someone this stylish is
your I think deserves so that is
something like this battery and I
appreciate it but you know what's cool
about this actually I don't like big
mice and this is a little bit it's a
little bit bigger of a footprint but it
feels you almost understand where you're
holding it in your hand which is great
and it the fact that it you know full
fledge you can plans in your pocket I
mean this is this just disgusting this
is tickets man you have a hammer get it
get the hammer let's go
this is ooh very strong surprisingly
surprisingly it's go Logitech is gonna
love this by the way yeah there you go
by the way you know you have big you've
to sell or give me a mouse now okay no
you don't oh you don't have a mouse go
okay no hi hey thank you so much for
this really cool that don't you want it
I just totally destroyed my miles for
for no reason
and and I still don't have a mouse
replacement here's the really shocking
thing I discovered right after I smashed
my mouth mouse which is a bluetooth
mouse that the ark touch has a dongle so
it was pretty upsetting</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
