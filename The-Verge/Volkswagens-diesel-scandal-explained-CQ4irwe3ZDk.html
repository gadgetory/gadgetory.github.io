Volkswagen Audi cars made between 2009
and this year we're using a so-called
defeat device to get around emissions
laws designed to keep the air clean but
what does that mean exactly well modern
cars have dozens of computers inside
them and some of those computers help
coordinate the functions of the engine
for optimum performance while making
sure that there isn't too much garbage
coming out of the exhaust pipe they've
actually been working this way for
several decades now basically every part
of a modern cars engine has a sensor or
controller on it and these computers are
reading in data thousands of times per
second making adjustments like the ratio
of fuel to air that's going into the
cylinders these cheating Volkswagen and
Audi models are easels and diesels have
one more really important
computer-controlled parameter which is
the amount of unburned fuel going into
the exhaust now that sounds bad doesn't
sound like you would want unburned fuel
going into the exhaust but in the case
of a diesel you have something called a
NOx trap which is a device that absorbs
and traps nitrogen oxides that are
pollutants that would otherwise go into
the atmosphere and the effect of that
NOx craft is enhanced with unburned fuel
so a defeat device is a special program
inside these computers that can make it
look like the car meets emission
standards even when it doesn't
Volkswagen had a problem on its hands
its diesel engines were known for
getting great fuel economy but the NOx
trap only works well when more fuel is
being used so the car would detect using
this defeat device when it was getting
an emissions test it would use more fuel
make the NOx trap work well emissions
would be fine but then you get on the
road the device turns off your burning
less fuel but you're putting as much as
40 times more pollutants into the
atmosphere but how the heck did the car
know that it was being tested for
emissions compliance the EPA says it was
a sophisticated system that check things
like steering wheel position speed how
long the engine was on and even the
atmospheric pressure in other words
there was no way this was accidental
because the software was designed very
carefully to detect an official
emissions test that's some pretty
serious deception and that's why
Volkswagen is in such serious trouble in
fact their CEO Martin Winterkorn just
stepped down so what happens next
well if you own one of the half million
diesel Jettas beetles gulfs Passats or
Audi a3 is affected the good news is
that your car is still safe to drive
you don't have to put it away until
Volkswagen issues a recall but at some
point they're probably going to have to
update the software inside your car and
when that happens you might get fewer
miles per tank lawyers are already
gearing up for class-action lawsuits so
owners might get compensated at some
point in the future but that's not going
to happen anytime soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
