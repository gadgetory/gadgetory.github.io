checking out chrome for iphone and ipad
so let's jump right in chrome on iphone
ask you to first sign in with your
google account once you do you'll see
these tabs screens so you can go through
your tabs you can flick one off the
screen if you enter a tab you can do
edge drag to actually go between them
there's a little indicator bar at the
top showing how far along the site is in
loading but let's say you want to check
out some tabs that you were looking at
on another device so if you do new tab
you get a window down here where you can
look at other devices so here's my iPad
last think two minutes ago so there's IG
on facebook and gmail here's on my
macbook air last synced eight minutes
ago so you can actually see the the tabs
that you have open on each computer and
you can force this to refresh if you go
out and then go back in and I'll see
your bookmarks all your chrome bookmarks
like mobile other desktop bookmarks so
you can go through all these you can
edit them and it's all really fast if
you look up at the top of the screen
you'll see Chrome's familiar omnibox
going to web sites even though this
doesn't use the Nitro JavaScript
enhancements Mobile Safari uses is still
really fast there's a menu up here to go
to settings it's kind of like the one
you'd find in Android and you can star
your site so you can refresh the page
there's actually no forward button
because you pretty infrequently need it
you only see it if you press back then
you can see the forward button right
there but up here again there are new
tab there's new incognito tab which
actually takes you into see you've gone
incognito you can see the incognito is
actually separate so if you go back to
hear you can actually email the page
from here you can find in page for words
that you want to look up and request
desktop site which is interesting
because you can actually change the user
agent from within the browser so you can
get desktop sites then you can also dig
a little deeper with regular settings
you can change your search engine from
google yahoo to bing you can save your
passwords voice search works pretty well
on here from the omni bar you can use
series voice search if you want using
the microphone down here like usually
would or if you hit the X you can use
google's voice search
the verge to look up whatever you want
one nice thing is that if you're logging
into a site you've never been to before
you enter in your username and password
and Chrome for iOS will actually asked
you down here do you want google chrome
to save your password for this site you
can exit you can hit yes or you can it
never and those changes will take take
effect in any other instance of chrome
you're running chrome on ipad is
virtually the same but you have the tabs
up here you have a toggle in the top
right that you switch between incognito
and regular mode and you have this
persistent star microphone and drop down
menu on the side here but besides that
it's pretty similar one cool thing
though is that you won't get the
animation but you can do the edge tab
switch like you can on chrome for chrome
for iphone so if we want to take a look
at the other tabs from here if you do
new tab you can swipe between most
visited bookmarks and other devices so
let's look at other devices and you can
see the iphone we were just looking at
right now is on my side the verge
pitchfork back on the verge one of those
valuable things here is that the way
they pitch it if you're on your iPhone
and you're checking something out and
then you want to go on your iPad it'll
be there so let's say we want to look at
IMDb so I have I'm to be open on the
iphone right now and let's say I am
going over the couch I want to look at
it on the ipad right here so imdb's
loaded over here and let's just hit
refresh on the ipad and boom IMDb is
right there you can also move around
tabs drag them around however you'd like
and you can close them just like that
just as easily chrome is pretty close in
terms of speed with mobile safari but in
some situations on JavaScript heavy
webpages it's probably going to be a bit
slower because it doesn't include apples
nitro JavaScript booster if you use
chrome everyday on your Mac or PC at
home you're definitely gonna want to
download chrome for iOS it's really
smooth it works well and everything is
just really easy to use well you do have
to dig through a little bit for settings
or to go through to your tabs or
bookmarks unlike in mobile safari you
just have a lot more space on screen
because there's no navigation bar down
there
and even if it may be in some instances
a little bit slower it's still
definitely something you want to try</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
