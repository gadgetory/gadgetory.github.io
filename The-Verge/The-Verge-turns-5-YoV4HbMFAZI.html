month and we're updating our entire
design to be sleeker faster and more
illuminating see these serifs on our
logo we're cleaning them up and spacing
things out so everything looks better on
mobile and works better in videos all
that 70s sci-fi orange is evolving into
a new design language were calling
pathways bright laser lines that
illuminate the stories we tell about the
future because that's what it's all
about the verge hunts for the inflection
points that mark the moments between
before and after it might be a new
device or a groundbreaking film or
surprising new research study there's no
evidence that this works that doesn't
mean it doesn't work it just means we
don't know that it works it could be a
subscrible as a rocket launch the verge
is illuminating fast and beautiful our
design photography and video carry as
much visual impact and thoughtfulness as
our stories themselves I mean look how
good we made a laptop look even though
the keyboard is a little shallow the
verge is thoughtful useful entertaining
and rebellious we follow our instincts
wherever they lead we view power and
authority with skepticism and cover it
without fear and most importantly the
verge is inclusive technology is a part
of everyone's life and the verge is for
everyone five years ago the big idea
behind the verge was that technology had
gone from the fringes of culture to the
center of everything as mobile created a
new generation of digital consumers five
years later we live in a dazzling world
of screens that is assured in
revolutions and media transportation and
science we have to evolve just like the
world evolved we have to get cleaner and
simpler and just a little bit louder
technology and culture are changing so
they're faster than ever and you'll find
all of it right here on the verge
