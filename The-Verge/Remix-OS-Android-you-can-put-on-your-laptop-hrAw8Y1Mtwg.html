I'm here at Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona looking at the remix OS a
version of Android that basically
functions like a desktop operating
system so it's got everything you'd
expect from the Android mobile operating
system that means you have apps like
we've got clash of clans here we've got
Twitter we've got YouTube down here but
it adds the sort of interface elements
you'd expect from a desktop that mean
there's there's windows that you can
drag about you can minimize them you can
open them up then close them down
there's a taskbar down at the bottom
here if you go down to the bottom left
open that up you've got all your apps
and app drawer that you know functions
quite a lot like a Start menu and then
you can also do things that you just
cannot do on Android with touch which is
drag-and-drop move images over move them
back and forth basically everything you
do on a desktop operating system the
company behind this guide first released
this in CES earlier this year in an
alpha now today they've announced that
the beta is going to be coming out and
available to download for free from
March 1st now you can put this on pretty
much any desktop computer alpha the
Alpha had support for an x86 systems
while the beta adds support for older
32-bit systems it also brings in a few
bug fixes and adds over-the-air update
that means you can keep your version of
remix OS up to date without too much
fuss
you can whyme it onto a flash disk stick
that into a computer and you've got
Android and a computer so there are
still a few challenges when it comes to
using remix OS Google is currently
examining the software but at the moment
they're not giving integrated support
for Google Play services and the App
Store you can sideload these yourself at
home but it's just another step before
you can get up and running guide though
says that that's going to be fixed by
the time the full release comes out in
the next three to six months the company
is also working with a number of
hardware and software partners to
increase the availability and the amount
of programs you can use on it for more
on remix OS and other products from
Mobile World Congress you can check out
