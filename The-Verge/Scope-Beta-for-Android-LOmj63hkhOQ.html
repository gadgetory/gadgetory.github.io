we are looking at scope beta for android
this is a private beta of a social
networking app formerly known as
socialscope they have rebranded this is
a very popular app on blackberry it's
coming to android it's in a private beta
right now essentially what it does is it
combines your social networks into a
single app so it can do Facebook
Foursquare Instagram Twitter and Tumblr
and the core functionality here is if
you go into all activity you can see all
of your activities so you can see
facebook twitter if there's an Instagram
here we can scroll down see Instagram
photo posted here images are full width
which is pretty neat it also includes
videos and so this is you know pretty
much everything and when you when you
see something that you like you can tap
into it so this is a Twitter thing here
I can reply I can retweet I can favor it
i can share if there's an Instagram you
can favorite and comment and so on and
so forth you can also there's this
button down here on the bottom right
which shows you the different sections
that you're in so we're in the all
section but if I swipe to the right
you'll see that we've jumped into the
images section and so you can see all
the images that have been posted
recently it's pretty neat and you can
see here we do have some duplication
because of showing same thing on
multiple networks but here's a pretty
sweet image from Philly Disney solve
them something to that looks like I'm
viewing this on Twitter I'd rather do it
on Instagram which is where he posted it
there's the Instagram one so I can like
that really quick and if you swipe to
the right again you've got videos and so
here's a video that Ross posted and i'll
just open up the web
go back to the app here we can look at
check-ins as well and at replies i'm not
going to show you my messaging but
that's down there as well and then you
could also even filter into just
Facebook just four square just Instagram
or just Twitter in addition to this
filter down at the bottom there's
another filter in the upper right which
is for the different social networks
within the stream at you're in so it's a
pretty complicated setup for you know
filtering if you want to dig in and be a
power user but if you just want to use
it straight it's actually relatively
straightforward you know it's not a full
client for any of these social networks
so you know there's no list support in
Twitter for example but on the other
hand it does aggregate all of your
messages from facebook and twitter which
is pretty neat so you can look at your
private messages there as well as far as
posting goes they have a button in the
lower left hand corner this is almost
identical to how path operates which is
an interesting but useful so you can
post a status update a check in an image
pull an image from your gallery or even
save a draft and so we can you know go
here to post a message you can type in
your message you can choose the networks
that you'd like to post it to you can't
check in on foursquare without having a
location but you can do that it will
even auto populate @ replies here which
is pretty cool and you can attach images
and whatnot unfortunately you can't post
to Instagram although you can view and
like Instagram stuff and comment on it
but that's just a limitation of the API
the instagram has available disk aren't
that message so there you go that is
scope beta on android oh one other
feature I'm by apologize it does a
really good job of aggregating your
friends into a single contact so if you
want to see everything that a certain
friend is doing on a certain social
network you can dig into that person
just sitting down to josh here and you
can see I've got Josh on Twitter
Facebook and Instagram which is pretty
neat anyway there you go that is scope
beta for android it isn't private beta
so you'll need to snag an invite it
should be launching relat
soon there's no word on when a iOS
personal comments Android only but it's
pretty slick if if you use all these
social networks and find yourself
jumping in and out each of those
separate apps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
