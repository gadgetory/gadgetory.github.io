we're here at the 2013 San Diego
comic-con talking to Jeff Wadlow writing
director of kick-ass - Jeff thanks for
sitting down with us my pleasure Brian
thanks for taking the time
absolutely so I'm real quick panel
yesterday
whenever well oh yeah I could not have
gone better I mean kick-ass is designed
for comic-con I mean you couldn't I
don't think you could think of a film
better suited for comic-con than
kick-ass I mean I know there are
superhero movies that are much bigger
but we're basically saying you know this
movie is for you guys this is a love
letter to fans of superhero movies where
we're going to say we know the rules you
know the rules now it's breakup right
now I'm going to talk about just in
general you've been blowing up lately
you know the news about you know go-fast
came up recently or something direct
that for Sony you're writing x-force you
know maybe directing is there you're
gonna be at the flux panel later is
there anything I'm not gonna be the Fox
panel I'm all about kick-ass - but I am
writing x-force - to make it you know
that's that's what I do that's what I
did with kick-ass - I think the the
issue there more is you know I mean it's
a there's a big difference between
development and actually making the
movie we all know that Fox's written
scripts for magneto and an x-men first
class with you know Cyclops and Jean
Grey so I mean the movie is far from you
know green light so right now I'm just
sort of telling my story and hopefully
they'll be as excited about a design a
lot of films that are coming out they're
you know not coming up within the system
they're basically you know getting
picked up and distributed afterwards but
they're getting independent financing do
you find that provides you a greater
creative freedom and yes even if it's a
big property like this I don't know I
think it's just an example of like by
hooker by Kirk right you know whatever
it takes to get the movie made that's
what you got to do and so I think that's
why you're seeing more unconventional
ways to get films made is because people
are just pushing and always looking for
what you know what it's going to take to
get their movie
and he expected experience with like X
horse is gonna be subtly different since
that is being developed you know in
house maybe but I mean so far you know
they've kind of let me do what I wanted
it you you know I told them this is the
story I want to tell and they got
excited about it and they said now
what's it like working I mean
pre-existing property obviously kick ass
there's already film people love when
you're coming into that as a director
you've written your you know what the
story you want to tell as wreck there's
certain things you want to bring
stylistically visually or that make it
like you know like your film yes and now
I mean you have to be pretty sort of
egotistical I think to think I gotta
come in and make it mine and put my mark
on it and it really wasn't my approach
my approach was a fan I love the first
film I loved it I don't want to reboot
it I don't want to reimagine it I don't
want to read anything you know it's just
like I just want to spend time with
these characters and I want to see what
happens next and that's how I approached
it and the things changed for a variety
of reasons one we're telling a new story
and so things are going to change about
the way you shoot it and the way you
tell that story things also change
because I'm just a different person then
you know then Matthew and and I love him
and respect him but you know making a
movie is a very personal endeavor and so
even if I wanted to make it just the way
Matthew would have made it I'm still not
Matthew so it's always going to be
different because I'm feeling it and
experiencing it and and having different
ideas you know it's a creative process
so I feel ownership of the movie in that
sense because I was allowed to do that
you know Matt Merced you got to make
your movie go make it so I think it is
different and I do feel like you know my
fingerprints are all over it for that
reason but it wasn't because I came in
and
and date to make it a Jeff Wadlow film
right now the one thing you know
kick-ass it there's this fine line that
a modulus really carefully in terms of
you know pushing you know like violence
and comedy and like it works great
because it pulls both off simultaneously
you know how did you modulate that just
as a filmmaker
it is a tonal tight rope act but you
know I had a great model to follow which
was the first film and for me it's just
about being honest and pushing it right
and so I think as long as you aren't
being insincere about the the humor or
the consequences of the violence that's
what's interesting just a side note
about the violence people talk about
that a lot and our film like yes it's
violent but when violent things happen
like you see that bad things happen like
people get hurt yeah there's
consequences this isn't like some
bloodless assault rifle sequence where
you know you're you people are emptying
magazines and actually they never empty
the magazine they never run out of
bullets from the situation and nobody's
getting hurt and you know gadgets
falling over I mean to me that that
sends the wrong message because it's
saying like oh no there's no real
consequences you know for an intense
situation like this and we're we're
actually pretty seasoned jobless it's
like oh yeah like if you try to go out
and fight crime like you're gonna get
hurt yeah well it's not the underlying
you know theme of the entire first movie
you know it's like how that's that you
know trying to do that doesn't really
work at first that's the whole point of
it so it's an odd comparison now to put
that together so talking about you know
Matthew you brought the script Matthew
Picht you you know how heavily was he
involved in the process either
day-to-day or is it just kind of like go
I trust you do your thing it was it was
both in that Matthew as a filmmaker
understands what a filmmaker needs from
his producer and and he did it perfectly
I could not have asked for a better
partner in that you know he never came
to set he said make make a movie but at
the same time I probably talked him on
the phone every day for you know half an
hour or an hour all through prep and
production and you know we just got his
advice because he is a filmmaker and he
understands the
tight wire the high wire act that we
were trying to pull off with the tone
could be getting himself so it was sort
of a perfect mix of being there but also
letting me do my thing
awesome cool Jeff thank you so much
respond the time with us looking se for
them anyway there at the comic you as
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
