we're here at the 2013 san diego
comic-con talking to jeff wadlow right
and director of kick-ass 2 just thanks
for send out this my pleasure Brian
thanks for taking the time absolutely so
I'm real quick panel yesterday went over
well oh yeah I could not have gone
better I mean kick ass is designed for
comic-con I mean you couldn't I don't
think you could think of a film better
suited for comic-con then kick ass I
mean I know there are superhero movies
that are much bigger but we're basically
saying you know this movie is for you
guys this is a love letter to fans of
superhero movies where we're going to
say we know the rules you know the rules
now it's breaking right now I'm going to
talk about this in general you've been
blowing up lately you know the news
about you know go fast came up recent
your son trick that for sony you're
writing x-force you know maybe directing
is there you're going to be at the fox
panel later is there anything I are not
going to be the fox panel i'm all about
kick-ass 2 but i am writing x-force to
to make it you know that's that's what I
do that's what i did with kick-ass 2 i
think the the issue there more is you
know i mean there's a big difference
between development and actually making
the movie we all know that Fox's written
scripts for Magneto and an x-men first
class with you know Cyclops and Jean
Grey so mean the movie is far from you
know green late so right now I'm just
sort of telling my story and hopefully
they'll be as excited about a design a
lot of films that are coming out there
you know not coming up within the system
they're basically you know getting
picked up and distributed afterwards but
they're getting independent financing do
you find that provides you a greater
creative freedom against even if it's a
big property like this i don't know i
think it's just an example of like by
hook or by crook right you know whatever
it takes to get the movie made that's
what you gotta do and so I think that's
why you're seeing more unconventional
ways to get films made is because people
are just pushing and always looking for
what if you know what it's going to take
to get their movie
and he expected experience with like X
horse is gonna be subtly different since
that is being developed you know in
house um maybe but I mean so far you
know they've kind of let me do what I
wanted it to you you know I told them
this is the story I want to tell and
they got excited about it and they said
you know go make it cool and what's it
like working I mean pre-existing
property obviously kick ass there's
already filling people love when you're
coming into that as a director you've
written your you know what the story you
want to tell as rector there's certain
things you want to bring stylistically
visually or that make it like you know
like your film yes and now I mean that
you have to be pretty sort of
egotistical I think you think I gotta
come in and make it mine and put my mark
on it and it really wasn't my approach
my approach was a fan I love the first
film I loved it I don't want to reboot
it I don't want to reimagine it I don't
want to read you know it's just like I
just want to spend time with these
characters and I want to see what
happens next and that's how I approached
it and the things changed for a variety
of reasons one we're telling a new story
and so things are going to change about
the way you shoot it in the way you tell
that story things also change because
I'm just a different person that you
know they Matthew and and I love him and
respect him but you know making a movie
is a very personal endeavor and so even
if I wanted to make it just the way
Matthew would have made it I'm still not
Matthew so it's always going to be
different because I'm feeling it and
experiencing it and having different
ideas you know it's a creative process
so I feel ownership of the movie in that
sense because I was allowed to do that
you know Matt Mira said you got to make
your movie go make it so i think it is
different and I do feel like you know my
fingerprints are all over for that
reason but it wasn't because I came in
mandate to make it a jeff wadlow film
right now one thing you know kick asset
there's this fine line that a modulus
really carefully in terms of you know
pushing or like violence and comedy and
like it works great because it pulls
both off simultaneously you know how did
you modulate that just as a filmmaker it
is a tonal tight rope act but you know I
had a great model to follow which was
the first film and for me it's just
about being honest and pushing it right
and so I think as long as you aren't
being insincere about the humor or the
consequences of the violence that's
what's interesting just a side note
about the violence people have talked
about that a lot and our film like yes
it's violent but when violent things
happen like you see that bad things
happen like people get hurt yeah there's
consequences this isn't like some blood
lists all trifle sequence where you know
you people are emptying magazines and
actually they never empty a magazine
they never run out of bullets from the
situation and nobody's getting hurt and
you know gadget is falling over I mean
to me that that sends the wrong message
because it's saying like oh there's no
real consequences you know for intense
situation like this and we're we're
actually praying season realis is like
oh yeah like if you try to go out and
fight crime like you're gonna get hurt
yeah let's not the underlying you know
theme of the entire first movie you know
I was like how that's that you know
trying to do that doesn't really work at
first that's the whole point of it so
it's an odd comparison now to put that
together so talking about you know
Matthew you wrote the script Matthew
picked you you know how heavily what is
he involved in the process either day to
day or is it just kind of like go I
trust you do your thing it was it was
both in that Matthew as a filmmaker
understands what a filmmaker needs from
his producer and and he did it perfectly
i could not have
for a better partner that you know he
never came said he said make make your
movie but at the same time I probably
talked him on the phone every day for
you know half an hour an hour all
through prep and production and you know
we just got his advice because he is a
filmmaker and he understands the tight
wire the high wire act that we were
trying to pull off with the tone because
he did it himself so it was sort of a
perfect mix of being there but also
letting you do my thing awesome cool
Jeff thank you so much was from the time
with us looking safer from moving away
the rest comic you as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
