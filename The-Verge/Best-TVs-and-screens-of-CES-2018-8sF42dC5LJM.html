relevant show in the world anymore it's
not really the place to go to see the
technology that is changing people's
lives and meaningful ways but one thing
that CES is really really great for is
TVs and giant screens and looking at the
future of looking at things and the best
place to start is LG's booth which is
the first thing you see as you go in to
see yes there is this crazy Canyon of
OLED panels that funnels you into the
booth and once you're here there is a
lot to look at
so LG already makes the best TVs in the
world it's all that ranges available now
and they've updated that of course this
year the new models for 2018 have Google
assistant Amazon Alexa and UI tweaks for
webOS but looking further forward
there's a lot of crazy stuff as well LG
display the display panel arm of the
company is working on this unbelievable
65 inch rollerball display which just
rolls up right like a newspaper and the
company is also starting to experiment
with 8k as well so Samsung on the other
hand is kind of not really doing all
that TVs anymore they used to show up
them at CES every year right now it
focuses on LED and this year it's
showing off a new technology called
micro LED which it claims is going to
kinda like overtake OLED and offer all
of its benefits without some of the
drawbacks and the way it's demonstrating
micro LED is with this unbelievable huge
panel called the wall and it's a modular
TV it's built up of different blocks and
you can make this as big or small as you
like so of course the wall is not going
to be coming to many people's living
rooms anytime soon but it's an
interesting vision of how something is
planning for the future of TV's so it's
not just TVs CES is a great place to
check out monitors as well and in some
ways the lines between monitors and TVs
are actually kind of blurring a lot of
companies are showing off gaming one
Assistants about HDR which until now has
not really been a thing that's taking
off in the PC space so you're saying
relatives from Lenovo issues a whole
bunch of companies that are like making
a shara thing on PC LG has this
incredible 5p ultrawide monitor with
Thunderbolt 3 which I demand to have on
my desk immediately
nvidia is maybe making the most
interesting gaming panels here it has
this new platform called the big format
gaming display which is a way for
companies to make 65-inch 4k HD our
gaming displays with G sync and gsync is
Nvidia's technology that syncs the
display and the GPU for really really
smooth natural output it's an amazing
technology for a monitor and to have it
in this huge crazy 65 inch long
factories like it's kind of
unprecedented so of course most of the
screens and TVs and panels you're
looking at at CSR 4k 4k has been a big
buzzword for many years at CES and it's
not really the stuff of future dreams
anymore it's a mainstream technology but
in some places like gaming voce has
always been a little bit of a compromise
the gaming monitors have been capped at
60 Hertz at 4k so if you prioritize
frame rate over resolution they it's not
being the best technology to go for but
with things like Nvidia is big format
gaming display things are changing you
can now have the best of both worlds you
can run games at 4k and you can run
about 120 Hertz and get absolutely an
amazing experience and this is the kind
of thing to CES is grateful right like
seemingly intuitive spec upgrades that
in practice if you care about this stuff
will actually make a huge difference
your experience and that's really why I
can see it I love to look at the stuff I
love to look at these unbelievable
screens and it's just fun to think about
like what my living room is gonna look
like 5 10 30 years into the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
