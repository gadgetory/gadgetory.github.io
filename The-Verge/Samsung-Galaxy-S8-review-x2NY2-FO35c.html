made and quite possibly the best phone
period this is a Galaxy S II but before
I can talk about how great this phone is
I have to answer the question that
everyone is thinking will it explode
because the last best phone that Samsung
ever made did explode twice now to be
perfectly honest I don't know if the s8
will explode but what I do know is that
Samsung has put a lot of time money and
effort into making sure what happened
with the note seven doesn't happen again
okay now that's out of the way let's
talk about the Galaxy s8 it comes in two
versions there's a smaller version with
a 5.8 inch display and then the bigger
s8 Plus which has a 6.2 inch screen
basically these phones are exactly the
same except for their screen size they
the same design same features same
camera and so forth they're also pretty
expensive the SI is going to run you 720
dollars or more depending on your
carrier and the SI plus is going to run
another hundred dollars on top of that
now that's about the same as what you
pay for an iPhone or other premium
device but that's still a lot of money
but when you first touch these phones
that price or anything in samsung's
recent history are the last things
you're thinking about this phone is
gorgeous it's so refined and polished
Samsung has taken everything it's
learned over the years for the s6 and
the s7 and applied it here it's clean
and elegant nipped and talked and really
polished to a shine and it doesn't look
anything like an iPhone or any other
phone you can buy the star of the show
here is the new display a bright and
vibrant quad HD Super AMOLED panel
that's stretched to the edges of the
phone and then curved on the sides
Samsung calls is an infinity display
because the edges almost disappear off
the side of the phone so the screen has
a new shape it's 18 point five by nine
aspect ratio which you can see is taller
and skinnier than most other smartphones
now there's pros and cons to this when
you're viewing a webpage or other
content you can see more of it on the
screen or if you're watching a 21 by 9
widescreen video it uses more of the
available display but where you really
notice the new shape is when you're
handling the phone because the SAT feels
a lot smaller than you might expect it's
not as wide as other phones so it can be
easier to use in one hand but at the
same time it's a lot taller so it can be
difficult to reach the top with your
thumb even if you're using a smaller
phone like I am it's a bigger change in
how you handle and use the phone than
you might expect and then there's some
apps and games like Super Mario run that
don't automatically use the whole
display so you either get a black bar on
the top and bottom or you stretch it to
fit and it cuts off the sides but
overall I'm a fan of this new shade and
how much Samsung has done to reduce the
size of the phone's frame around it it
really feels like you're just holding a
screen instead of an entire smartphone
the other bits of the hardware are
equally impressive the screen blends
seamlessly into the metal frame around
it and the back glass is curved in the
symmetrical fashion and because it's all
glass it really attracts fingerprints
and gets kind of greasing just a few
minutes of use and believe it or not we
got a scratch on one of our review
Mnet's in just a couple of days that
means that you're probably going to put
a case on top of it which is kind of a
bummer because it hides all of this
great design work and you might have
noticed because of this new big screen
that there's no home button on the front
of this phone frankly Samsung didn't
even have room for it instead there's
this new virtual home button that's
pressure sensitive it's like they took
the iPhone 7s force touch and just put
it right here at the bottom of the
screen where a home button would have
been you can push on it to wake the
screen up or go home even if you're in a
full screen app and you don't see a
button there now the other consequence
of this big screen is that sampling had
to move the fingerprint sensor onto the
back of the phone and it's probably the
only real misstep with the essays design
it's located really high up on the back
and it's right next to the camera which
means it's hard to reach and also means
that you're going to be putting your
finger all over the camera lens all the
time now most people use the fingerprint
scanner to unlock their phone so to make
up for this Samsung's added two other
ways you can unlock it you can use your
irises or this new face unlock feature
but neither are really great the IRS
scanner means you have to hold the phone
really close to your face and the face
unlock feature is less secure and pretty
slow it's a pretty big blemish in what
is otherwise a stellar design now
surprisingly samsung's software on the
SI is almost as polished and good as its
hardware which is not something I'm used
to saying it's cleaner and easier to use
and unlike prior Samsung software it
doesn't send me running to the Play
Store to download a new launcher icon
pack now out of the box the setup is
really simple with just a handful of
clean app icons on the home screen and
tasteful text throughout their other
tasteful touches all around like the way
notifications pop up on your screen or
how you can just swipe up to get to your
apps and if you do want to dig deep into
the settings menu there are lots of
customization options from the order of
the on-screen buttons to full themes
that change almost everything about the
software's appearance I like the fun
stuff too like the lenses that Samsung
stole right from snapchat and put in the
camera app or the way that I can
customize the always-on display to show
a donut so that I'm always on brand but
the big new software thing this year is
Samsung's taking a virtual assistant
which it calls big speed it even put a
whole button on the side of the phone
just dedicated to launching big speed
now the problem here is that Bixby just
doesn't do very much if you push that
button it will launch a home screen page
it has different cards of information
and can plug into services like Twitter
and Spotify and other things but it's
not really different from what we've
seen from HTC and Google already now
Bixby also shows up in the camera so you
can use it to scan items and shop for
them on Amazon or find more pictures but
again that's not really much different
than what Google Goggles did four years
ago now Bixby will eventually support
voice commands and voice controls but it
doesn't at launch and I haven't been
able to test that yet on the upside the
si does come with Google assistant which
you can use for all of your voice
commands now and probably forever it's
just a bummer that you can't change the
button on the side of phone to do
anything else
now you probably notice that we're
multiple minutes into this video and I
haven't talked about things like battery
life or processor or camera performance
well that's because there's really not a
whole lot to say here the Galaxy s8 that
we can buy in the US is the first phone
to come with Qualcomm Snapdragon 835
processor and it's just as fast and
snappy and fluid as you'd expect but so
is every other high-end phone whether
it's an iPhone or a pixel or even
Samsung s7 from last year the real
question is how will the Samsung Si
perform in six months or a year down the
road because Samsung software is
notorious for slowing down over time but
unfortunately I can't answer that yet
likewise the battery life in the Si and
the SI plus is adequate but not
remarkable it's not a marathon runner
and if you're a heavy user you're
probably going to have to charge at some
point throughout the day
now one thing Samsung claims is that in
addition to not having a tendency to
catch fire the new battery in the si is
supposed to last longer throughout its
lifespan and provide up to 95% of its
charge after two years of use I'll have
to check in with you in two years to see
if that's true
and finally the camera in the Si and the
SI plus isn't usually different from
last year's phone in fact the rear
camera has the same specs as the s7 now
Samsung's done some software work to
improve the image quality but it's not a
huge difference and really it's a great
camera last year's s7 was one of the
best cameras you can buy in 2016
pretty confident the si is going to be
one of the best cameras in 2017 now on
the front camera Samsung has made some
improvements its higher resolution and
an auto focus which is apparently a
thing that front cameras didn't do
before so now all your selfies will be
as sharp as you'd expect so now the big
question here is does the galaxy si do
enough to get Samsung out from the dark
cloud of the note 7 do as design
features and performance do enough to
make you forget about all of those
exploding phones from just last year I
think the answer is yes the galaxy si is
a tremendous device with beautiful
design new ideas on what a smart phone
can look like and great performance
Samsung deserves a lot of credit for
taking a risk and pushing forward what a
smart phone can look like in 2017 at a
time when pretty much every phone looks
the same now let's just hope that risk
doesn't blow up in Samsung's face
