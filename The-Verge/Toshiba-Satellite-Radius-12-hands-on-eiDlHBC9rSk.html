at Toshiba's satellite radio slowly a
usually toshiba doesn't do many exciting
laptops for every year but this one is
kind of difficult
this was the 4k display and it's a 12-8
of 12.5 inches play it's just kind of
small for 4k display and we lose pretty
crisp and viewing angles are pretty
decent but the support a display is
small kind of the vertical travel here
and just like the de novo yogas you got
a hinge here you can flip it all the way
around straight over into a tablet mode
you don't see we just tends to also
tablet mode II navigate around the
different apps and stuff and I guess the
comic more interesting thing this is an
interesting camera the top here and so
she recently took about he's a key what
is this an infrared camera and it
supports a new picture of Windows 10
Windows
which essentially allows me to look
straight at the screen just whistle off
screen and it assigns me in without a
password that's going to be to each of
things I think we will assume that you
need an intel realsense camera and that
is not on there and there's some sort of
infrared camera and that's all we know
I've been that and it's an until the
latest crisis arena skylake core i7 all
the way up to that and a Teague around
and you've also got a USB type-c on the
side which also commanding you for these
little laptops and there's only one on
here you got a couple years these and
HDMI swap and but yeah that's the sinew
we're pretty good see a lot of that USB
type-c coming to tablets convertibles
and soon yeah that's the Santa way
