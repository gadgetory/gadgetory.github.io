new stuff with the link m.i.c hubs is
part of a big New York City effort
they're putting thousands of these hubs
all over the city to provide free Wi-Fi
but there's also going to be an Android
tablet installed in each hub and that's
what we're gonna check out today so this
is it you can see we've got Internet
free calling city services maps and then
this sort of puts it back so you know if
you're new to New York you want to find
your way around you can pull this up and
it'll just bring up this Google map
slightly slow I think that's not the
gigabit that's broken the processor but
yeah and this will do all the you know
things you expect from a Google map and
that's exactly where we are 1315 so
they're gonna install these all the way
up third Avenue is the current plan
really all the way off the island so
it's just gonna go straight up Manhattan
and in the Bronx well another couple of
things gone but that's that's how the
conduits are stretched so then we want
to go out and go back to home it sort of
works just like you'd expect an Android
tablet there's the home button the back
button if we want to access city
services here we are you can make a
complaint someone's parked bad taste the
money or the city get a 3-1-1 app let's
find out stuff right your neighborhood
pay parking ticket or you can just go on
the Internet
so this is all fed by a gigabit cable
that we're running in a conduit up and
down the sidewalk so you know we've got
other services there's audio case you
wanna plug your headphones in 911
if there's an emergency you can just
push that button that summons it and
this is the dialpad
most importantly if your phone is
running low on battery as mine currently
is
there's USB power which you can plug in
down here and then it's charging this is
a importantly a power only connection so
you don't have to worry about catching
malware or anything or you can't upload
files or anything from it so it's
obviously not the most powerful tablet
we've ever seen but having these on
street corners all around the city
be a really cool thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
