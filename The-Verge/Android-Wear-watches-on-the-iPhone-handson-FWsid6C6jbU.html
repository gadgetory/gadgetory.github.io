watches coming out this fall and they're
going to have a new trick they're going
to work with the iPhone
that means the Apple watch is going to
have a lot more competition pretty soon
but the big question is how much can
Google's watches do when they're paired
with iOS we went to Google's
headquarters to find out today or
announcing that we are bringing Android
wear to iOS so if you have an iPhone you
can also use these watches and so for
the newest watches that have come out so
LG watch urbane and aces then watch too
and Huawei watch and I'll build new
watches I'll be coming out before the
end of the year and in the future you'll
be able to take those and out of the box
you'll be able to pair it with an iPhone
and you still still get your favorite
features so things like notifications
Google now voice searches you can have
all of that functionality and you know
watch faces even and you can use it with
your watch and so we're really excited
about that I actually got a chance to
set up Android wear with my own iPhone
and the set up was actually really
simple you just download the Android
wear app from the app store installed on
your phone pair it with an Android wear
watch and you're done
but Google can't dig down deep into the
bones of iOS with the Apple watch can
and that introduces some complications
Google actually managed to work around a
lot of them especially with
notifications that the problem is there
are a few things that the Android wear
app just can't do with iOS when you have
notifications that are showing up on
your watch we actually think of it as
simplifying your life like we don't want
your life to feel overburdened or more
complicated because you have these
notifications in fact the fact that you
can get them with right on your wrist is
really convenient and furthermore the
way we've done this if you get the
notification on your watch you know for
notifications that would have buzzed
your iPhone
we buzzed your wrist for notifications I
would not have vibrated your iPhone we
don't vibrate your wrist we make sure to
respect those kinds of notification
settings furthermore if you get a
notification on your wrist and you swipe
to dismiss it and dismisses it on your
iPhone as well and so this is true
across Android wear with Android phones
and everywhere with iPhones in this
first release you won't be possible to
you won't be able to install third-party
apps
onto the watch for Android wear watches
however and all the things I talked
through in terms of notifications
fitness tracking voice searches Google
now we also have some you know first
party applications that Google has built
that are included on the watch things
like a weather app a Translate app the
Translate app actually lets you flip
over your watch so that the other person
can see the translation those kinds of
things are built in and those will work
out it locks so there is one weird thing
about voice search which is that when
you do it it opens up in an in-app
browser inside the Android wear app
that's because Android wear can't talk
to all the other apps on the iPhone but
it can talk to the Google Apps which
means that calendar and Gmail can give
you rich notifications and you also get
Google now cards so all told Google's
done a surprisingly good job fitting in
a lot of features into Android wear with
the iPhone I didn't really expect them
to be able to pull off it does way more
than the pebble cam with iOS
unfortunately it can't do quite as much
as the Apple watch but Google thinks it
has an ace up its sleeve well a watch
and that's it there's going to be a lot
of different styles of Android wear
watch is coming very very soon whereas
the Apple watch just basically has the
one for a lot of people that first
impression matters a lot in terms of
what the thing looks like how it feels
the overall shape the overall style the
materials and so we just want to give
people that choice because we think
smartwatches are really useful like I
really think people like these watches
at launch Android wear is only going to
work with a few watches with the iPhone
the quali watch the Asus then watch -
and the LG watch urbane but a lot more
coming very very soon and that's going
to mean a lot of competition for the
Apple watch they might not be able to
imagine on features but they can
definitely be competitive on the number
of styles and on price nobody knows if
consumers want that more than they want
an Apple watch and so we're just going
to have to you know watch and see what
happens
