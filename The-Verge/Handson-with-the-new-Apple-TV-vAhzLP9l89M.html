here with the new Apple TV which is just
announced today at the event this is the
remote that I'm holding here at the top
it's got a glass touchpad with a button
that clicks menu button Siri button play
pause volume which actually shoots out
over IR to control your TV and a home
button here it is also has a gyroscope
and accelerometer so you can do motion
control gaming with it and this is the
entire thing charges over lightning run
connects to the Apple TV over Bluetooth
lasts for three months and this is the
main controller for the new interface
which is now being called TV OS credit
egg reading told me it's 95% iOS the new
set of interface frameworks over the top
to man account for the remote and the
new TV display so this is the home
screen of TV iOS you can see it's very
similar to the existing apple could be
interesting cleaned up as I move my
thumb over the touchpad you can see the
icons kind of move one-to-one with my
thumb that's that's how you know you're
swiping around here you can go into any
of these apps these apps have all been
redone for TV OS there's also an app
store which isn't live yet you drive in
iTunes movie as you can see this
interface looks super similar to what is
existing right now the Apple TV but the
big difference of course is Siri so I
can just push this here button and say
show me comedies and see some comedy
selections so this is Universal Search
Anna so I can see the entourage movie
and series gonna show me all the places
I can see from here it's just in iTunes
the universal search works across iTunes
HBO Showtime and Netflix and Hulu right
now with support for additional services
coming Apple's not saying whether Apple
would add the support or whether
third-party developers can have the
support and lastly there are games so we
can quickly play asphalt to show off the
motion controls on the remote so you can
see I'm really bad at this game but you
can see I'm just bang along and the
accelerator accelerometer and the
gyroscope here is just let me play just
like you would with an iphone you can
connect other iPhones and iPod Touches
to be a motion controller like this you
can also connect any made for iPhone
game controller which Apple is expecting
people would do as games get more and
more lit up and that is gaming on this
thing we can jump out I can I can lose
but this all runs very smoothly and very
quickly I haven't seen anything fail
it's been noisy here so series when
having some problems but other than that
everything is working great and I'm
really excited to see what
happens when developers actually get
their hands on the AppStore</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
