dryer as you can see it's got a touch
screen it's a lot like the one samsung
did yesterday that's capacitive you get
right up ahead we can start it which is
crazy you know normal settings for
washing machine and it's starting it's a
shit I would say this wash machine the
inside of it looks more like spinner
rims than any other wash machine I've
ever seen in my life so that's cool you
can cancel the cycle it's effin it's dig
into the setting you see I've no idea
what I'm doing so you can see there's
Wi-Fi connected to a network throw up
this zigbee you can get it if you do a
zigbee home automation network and then
you can got all this smart thing stuff
so you get a smart grid you can access
it from a smartphone because apparently
you can have it called support for you
which would be really great if you're
running lost machine and you were so bad
using a washing machine you had to call
a person to help you so this isn't one
of the smart appliance there's another
there's a dryer here that's pretty much
the same stuff only the club's go in the
front to get dry so I'm going to top and
wet I've we've got to difference between
lofts in the dryer anyway these things
are out in force washing machines
leading the biggest story at CES 2012 I
think they're going to change everything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
