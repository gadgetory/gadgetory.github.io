the ipod touch the latest version just
announced a few weeks ago and it's now
hitting stores this week the first thing
you notice when you take it out of the
box is just how thin it is it's less
than a quarter inch thick and only way
is slightly over three ounces which is
just insanely small it still feels
relatively well made though but it's not
quite as well machined or crafted as the
iPhone 5 also unlike the iPhone it comes
in a bunch of pretty intense colors
whichever color you pick you get a same
colored loupe with it the loupe is the
strange combination of a lanyard and a
nub that comes out of the back of the
iPod and lets you essentially wrap it
around your wrist so you don't drop it
fortunately the little nub retracts if
you don't want to use it otherwise
though the new iPod Touch is basically a
combination of the last three iPhones it
has the same 4-inch display as the
iPhone 5 same resolution same technology
it has the same a5 processor as the
iPhone 4s and it has the same 5
megapixel camera as the iPhone 4 it also
runs iOS 6 and you get just about every
feature in the new OS there's really
nothing that gets left off I used an
iPhone 4s for a long time and it feels
basically just like that it's not quite
as smooth or fast as the iPhone 5 but it
works really well as always it's great
for music and you can easily use
Bluetooth or airplay to send audio or
video to a different device airplay
mirroring works really well there's also
a speaker on the iPod which is located
right next to the iPods lightning
connector on the bottom and it's okay
but you'll still want an external setup
for almost everything that's also true
of Apple's earPod headphones they're
definitely a step above what Apple is
offering before but they're still far
from being good headphones one of the
examples talked a lot about with the new
iPod touch is how it can replace your
point-and-shoot camera and for a lot of
people it's probably true it has
somewhat old optics from the iPhone 4
but with new software and a better
processor actually takes better pictures
and does pretty well overall this really
is the best iPod touch yet by a long
shot
it's the most like an iPhone it's ever
been and got some really good hardware
upgrades and software upgrades in the
latest revision but when the cheapest
iPod Touch is now $299 it's not exactly
an impulse purchase anymore I suspect a
lot of people buy iPod Touches for their
kids or if they're not ready to pay for
a data plan and this is great device for
all of those people but it's a seriously
steep price to pay the iPod Touch is
definitely still the de-facto music
player and still the best one but you're
probably gonna have to think a little
bit harder before you buy this model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
