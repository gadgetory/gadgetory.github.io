our problem in cities both vertically is
the first example of family of a new
idea of architecture who doesn't simply
use green has an ornamental component we
are reducing the heating of the city
absorbing the co2 we are absorbing the
fine dust produced by the urban traffic
we are reducing the consumption of
energy it's hard to brace the bananas or
to build in Beijing assertively in
Frankfurt is sometimes hard to videos in
Boston so if we have that we have a
common issue all over the world we are
taking the calculation on how much the
tree grows and consequently how much
carbons they fix in the two towers we
have more than 25,000 and plants on both
the towers vertical story is one of them
I say most important and efficient way
to reintroduce nature inside the cities
when we started to understand how to
maintain the system there were just one
way to do it we asked to have
professional team of arborists to take
care of trees not exactly gardeners but
our worries and they a jumpa asylum and
they move in vertical other we had a lot
of reaction from the point of view on
the resident someone is looking and
someone is saying ok yes you look
strange but you are doing a good job
someone is offering our coffee
as as architects we cannot escape from
our responsibilities of builders of
urban environments so climate change the
very serious issue it is very serious
issue and if we really want to deal with
issue we have to think seriously how we
can contribute it's also weight to give
to the inhabitant also from a
psychological point of view and soft
comfort but normally we don't have when
we live at 80 100 150 meter jianchi
if you really you chill unique in a
chaotic inoculate Ivana Poisson equation
model car a Delhi mutually inclusive so
didi relax in the future I think we will
need to imagine also the realization of
real forest cities so cities which will
be composed by buildings all with trees
and place of the society I really hope
many other architects many other urban
planners many other politicians will be
in condition to replicate and improve
what we have done because I think that
the vertical forest is the serious
contribution to improve the quality of
fare to improve the quality of life in
our city
