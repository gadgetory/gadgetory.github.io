The Verge here at MWC 2019.
And what I have with me
is Oppo's new 10x optical
lossless zoom camera system
housed in a prototype.
It's on lockdown very
tightly, all we can really do
is play around with the camera app.
But that's really what we're here for.
(upbeat music)
Oppo's new system is claimed,
it has a 10x lossless zoom
that works with three lenses.
Over here in the back
you have one main camera,
48 megapixels then you have a wide angle,
ultra wide angle lens
that covers an equivalent
of 60 millimeters.
And then you have a
telephoto lens which covers
in photos up to 160.
So you're going from 16 to 160 millimeters
of optical zoom, inside your phone
without it being especially thick.
Alright so just to get an
idea of when it switches
between the lenses, at the
moment it's using the main lens.
But I'm going to cover
up the telephoto lens
with my finger at the back.
And then start zooming,
and at 8.2 it switches so.
This is it using the
telephoto lens right now.
And one thing I immediately
noticed with the telephoto lens,
is you get quite a bit of a jelly effect.
Because it does have
optical stabilization.
But because it's so zoomed in you get
a jelly effect on the screen
when you're moving it around.
So obviously this is gonna be
terrifically good for video.
Oppo doesn't even let
us try to do any videos.
So in order to get really
close with the telephoto lens
it has a periscope system on the inside.
Mirrors and lenses inside
the body of the phone.
So having an ultra wide
angle lens like this,
isn't particularly new, companies like LG
and quite a few others have done it.
Even having a telephoto lens
on top, having three and four
lenses isn't especially new.
What Oppo has done is
optimized everything.
It has improved the size,
it's reduced the size
while improving the zoom.
The results, we're gonna have to test it
we're gonna have to review it.
But on the first look it does look like
a really compact system.
I mean just look at the
thickness of this phone.
When you consider that
it's got this case on it,
it looks exactly the
size of a regular phone
you're not really compromising physically.
But you're gaining so much
in terms of optical zoom.
When I take a photo
with the telephoto lens
versus when I take a wide
angle photo and then zoom in.
The difference in detail and sharpness is
really easily noticeable.
That being said this photo
isn't in focus because
you do have quite a bit of
a minimum focusing distance
with the telephoto,
you're not gonna be able
to take really macro shots with this lens.
So it's really designed for subjects
that are distant from you.
You will be familiar
that Oppo and One Plus
are kinda sister companies
they work very closely.
And Oppo tells us this is
coming in quarter two of 2019
which might be around the
time when we can expect
the next One Plus flagship.
So if the next One Plus
phone, which may or may not be
the One Plus 7 happens to
have a camera system like this
don't be surprised.
So that's it our first look
at Oppo's new 10x lossless
optical zoom camera system.
It's not a new 5G phone, it's
not foldable, it's not even
an actual device yet, but
again it's an exciting new
development, and exciting new addition.
Camera phones are getting
formidably good these days
and this is distinctly
different and unique.
So for more technology
from here at MWC 2019
which includes cameras,
lenses, foldables, 5G
but no 6G sorry.
