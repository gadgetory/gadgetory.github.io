is the xperia z3 v this is a new variant
of the xperia z3 that's been designed
for verizon there are some small design
changes most notably you'll see the
sides are no longer all-metal it's sort
of a soft touch plastic with inside a
metal band along each side it's still a
really nice design though it feels
really nice it's same 5.2 inch display
the battery is very slightly larger in
this model at 3200 milliamp hours and
still supposed to last over a day which
is one of the defining features of the
z3 for the really big change for the
verizon models that now supports qi
wireless charging which will make it
really easy to charge this thing
otherwise this is basically the z3 that
you already know and that includes the
fact that it's waterproof and that it
can stream ps4 games as long as you're
in your home separately Sonia is selling
a mount that allows you to attach this
phone to a ps4 controller it's there's
no technology and it's literally just a
suction cup that you stick it on tube so
it doesn't have anything to say about
the z3 compact coming to verizon but for
now the z3 v is going to be available on
october 23rd for 1 99 99 on a two-year
contract will be available in black and
white
