September 4th 2013
I'm marques Brownlee aka mkbhd and this
is 90 seconds on the bridge today at
Aoife Samsung came to impressed the
company finally announced the
long-awaited Galaxy gear SmartWatch it's
got a 1.9 megapixel camera that connects
the galaxy phones and tablets
unfortunately you'll need to charge it
early and often samsung also unveiled
the Galaxy Note 3 a 5.7 inch smartphone
with a whopping 3 gigabytes of RAM both
products along with the Galaxy Note 10.1
will be available by the end of the year
samsung wasn't the only one making a
scene sony also had its own set of
products to show off the Xperia z1 is a
5-inch waterproof Android smartphone
with a massive 20.7 megapixel camera and
of course we got the official review of
the long rumored QX smart lens it's a 20
megapixel lens that attaches to your
Android smartphone with all these
announcements is clear that Sony is
continuing to keep its focus on cameras
and finally Google's love for all things
KitKat may have given us a sweet sneak
peek at something else yesterday a
promotional video for Android 4.4
contained footage of a Google employee
holding what appeared to be a new Nexus
smartphone the device even had an LG
logo like the current Nexus 4 of course
the video was pulled from YouTube
shortly thereafter it's certainly time
for a new Nexus it's been almost a year
since the Nexus 4 was announced and
products like the Moto X and galaxy s4
have made a splash in the mean time and
that's it for today's top stories coming
up tomorrow you tube mailing free
