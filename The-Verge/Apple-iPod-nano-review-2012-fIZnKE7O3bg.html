is the seventh generation iPod Nano
it's the latest radical redesign of the
Nano Apple seems to love changing this
product as you can see the biggest
change is this new 2.5 inch multi-touch
display the old nano kind of looks like
a watch and this one kind of looks very
much like a tiny little iPhone it's even
got a sleep/wake switch at the top it's
got a volume rocker on the side in the
middle that's actually a button to its
play/pause and on the bottom you'll find
the headphone jack and there's apple's
new lightning connector as well the new
nano comes bundled with apple's ear pods
headphones which the company claims it's
been working on for three years but to
my ears they only sound marginally
better it's really small and really
light and it's nicely made but
aesthetically it just doesn't quite fit
with Apple's all the products of the new
iPod touch with the new iPhone and that
impression is kind of carried right over
into this OS which is called the Nano OS
it's not a OS and it's strange you can
see that instead of rounded rectangles
like on the iPhone and on the iPad Apple
is using circles on the Nano to
reinforce that it's a different OS and
even a home button has a circle in it
which is truly strange actually using
the Nano is very basic and you press on
music you get the standard iPod list
that you're probably familiar with if
you're in another part of the interface
you can press the middle button to
actually go back to whatever you're
playing before which is convenient but
it works somewhat inconsistently
sometimes it really does just playing
pause you can play videos the video
player is a little funny musical layer
so many different UI elements here you
can see we've got the navigation
controls and if we start changing the
volume the volume controls overlay the
navigation controls it's a really tiny
screen it's kind of impressive that
Apple's fitting so much information on
to it but the overall value of this is
somewhat unknown Apple knows that people
love to use the Nano as a fitness device
so they've baked Nike+ right in it'll
play music at you you can set up our
song when you plug it back in your
computer it syncs with Nike Plus you can
look at photos hilarious so you can
pinch and zoom photos pretty funny on a
device of this size there's a radio
which lets you do radio stuff you can
set presets you can hit pause for up to
15 minutes and come back and there's a
clock the clock is actually a part of
this that I find the most heartbreaking
I was really hoping Apple would take the
previous Nano and turn it into more of a
watch and instead they retained a little
bit of functionality with multiple watch
faces but you can't download new watch
faces from i2
anymore and you're limited only to these
weird variations on green with the green
arrow and that lack of choice actually
carries over to the wallpaper strangely
enough you can only pick from four
patterns that match the color of the
device so here I've got four green ones
and gray I have no idea why Apple
decided to restrict it like that but
it's just a bizarre limitation on this
device which should be able to let you
set anything as a wallpaper so that's it
that's the new ipod nano it's $149 it
comes in a bunch of colors and it's
probably one of the best iPods Apple's
ever made but it's still an iPod you
have to plug it in your computer with a
cable you have to manage your files and
iTunes you have to copy files to it and
I suspect that if you're anything like
me you don't want to do that anymore you
use a service like Spotify or R do that
stream sings from the cloud that syncs
things to mobile automatically and I'm
hoping with the next generation of
iTunes and the next iPods Apple makes it
catches up to where it's most
forward-thinking competitors have
already landed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
