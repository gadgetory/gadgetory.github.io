we're here with Lobos new yoga 7:30
which I've right here in front of me and
the Flex 14 the yoga 7:30 comes in two
models a 13-inch that I have here and a
15-inch model they are pretty identical
to last year's 720 but there are some
slight design tweaks kind of all over it
there is a really nice change in back
here where you have these rounded edges
which look much more modern and sleek
and this angular design on the the
hinges also since a yoga you can of
course flip it around into tablet mode
but there's a nice difference for when
you hold it in one hand there's an angle
here now too which makes it a little bit
easier when you're holding it one-handed
and yeah it's a little bit easier so
that's nice but otherwise the hardware
is pretty much the same is still no
windows hello camera but there is a
fingerprint reader I also really love
this copper color but unfortunately it's
only available in Europe in the US
you're only gonna get gray and silver
which every everybody has a gray and
silver laptop the computer start around
$900 for that price you'll get an eighth
gen I 5 processor and a 1080p display
but you can also spec them way up you
can go up to an i7 processor 16
gigabytes of RAM on this model you can
also get a 512 gigabyte SSD and on the
15 inch you can go up to a one terabyte
SSD and add in a gtx 1050 GPU which
would be great if you're doing some
serious video editing or even some
gaming lenovo is estimating around 11
hours of battery life on the 1080p model
and one thing that is really cool this
year is that logo has built Alexa into
these laptops so they have far-field
mics and when you have the laptop open
and you have to be logged in you'll be
able to say Alexa and get your answers
so you can choose between Alexa and
Cortana if you want it's basically just
Amazon's app built in but it's pretty
cool that they have built the hardware
into this so that you can use Alexa
properly computers have a mix between
USB C and USB ports it's for rapid
charging and they're gonna be available
in April it's a really nice looking
computer and the real difference between
this and the higher-end 900 series model
is mostly the design and the design this
is pretty nice as it
is if you like to spec it up you can get
a pretty good laptop inside this shell
when area it would have been nice to see
Lenovo change this a bit is the display
while this play looks pretty good it has
a really large bezel on the bottom and
it's too bad because we've been nice to
see them bring that down a bit and give
us a different aspect ratio with a bit
more screen space in addition to the
yoga 730 Lenovo is also announcing the
flex 14 which I have here in Europe the
flex 14 is actually gonna be known as
the yoga 5:30 which is a little bit
confusing but also is kind of helpful
because it lets you know that this is a
little bit below the 730 as far as specs
and build quality go now that's
basically what you're getting this is a
very similar design for the 730 very
similar specs if you pay enough but
you're not getting all the same features
so you don't have alexa you don't have
far field mics and the build quality is
not quite as nice but you just still see
some of the changes here you have these
more rounded edges here and the sloped
hinge one thing that I don't like about
this computer already is that it is
extremely hard to open I have - you
definitely can't do it with one finger
and I really have to get my fingernail
in there and kind of pry it open it's
like it's it's a little bit of a workout
it's like doing one of those ham squeezy
things it's very strange but you do get
more ports in this laptop you have USB
see USB a HDMI and a full size SD card
slot which is pretty nice this laptop is
gonna start in the $500 range we don't
know exactly the specs that you're gonna
get for that price but if you're willing
to pay more you can spec it up to an
eighth gen I have a processor 16
gigabytes of RAM you can even add a
geforce MX 130 GPU unfortunately though
you're gonna be stuck with the 1080p
display just like the 732 flex 14 will
be available in April for more you can
