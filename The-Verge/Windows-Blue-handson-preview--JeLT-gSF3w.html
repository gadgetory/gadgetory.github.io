verge and we're looking at windows blue
which is basically the upgrade to
Windows 8 so it's a new version of
Windows and from the lock screen and
sign-in pages you won't notice a whole
host of changes if we start to look at
the Start screen you'll start to see
some additions swiping through the tiles
is pretty much identical to Windows 8
but if we go back and pick out one of
the live tiles you'll see we're
presented with some options to resize
this to a smaller one that's pretty much
identical to the small live tiles found
in Windows Phone 8 and you can edit the
tile sizes for all apps and there are
large medium and small options available
however the desktop tile also has an
extra large mode - and it's the only
tile that can be increased to this size
Microsoft has also tweaked the way that
you arranged live tiles on the Start
screen moving away from the drag down on
a tile movement towards the customize
button that then lets you move tiles
around and also name the groups of tiles
as you please we suspect this is
probably to prevent accidental movements
of the new smaller live tiles there's
not a whole host of new gestures here
but one addition is the ability to swipe
up on the Start screen to presume that
all apps view the views identical to
Windows 8 but simply more easily
accessible you'll notice we're using the
default color options here but my
sisters added the personalization
options into the settings charm for the
Start screen is background wallpaper
background color and even accent options
and you'll notice that it's fairly easy
to pick between all of them the color
options are a lot different to Windows 8
allowing you to pick a number of
different shades and the accent color
will alter the colors that you see on
the start button and elsewhere in the
operating system there's also a lot of
changes in the PC settings options
within the Start screen Mike's off now
includes frequently changed settings in
a learning page providing quick access
to regular settings lock screen settings
also include a reference to a new
picture frame option for photos and an
option to enable camera access on the
lockscreen
Microsoft has also extended the settings
to include access to display options you
can set the resolution orientation and
number of displays here without jumping
into desktop mode there's also the
ability to change some of the touch
preferences moving on to account
settings is not much to see here beyond
the regular options and a sync section
that's not currently in use a new
addition to the same section is SkyDrive
it appears that Microsoft is integrating
I Drive even more into Windows with blue
there are options to backup devices to
SkyDrive and control how they're stored
and there's even automatic uploads of
pictures and videos taken with the
camera and that's an option that's very
similar to Windows Phone moving on to
the privacy section you'll notice that
you can change location preferences and
have really granular options on privacy
here the devices section is improved to
include access to add and remove devices
and autoplay options and a network
section has also been added which lets
you toggle connections very easily and
you can also add in VPN settings there's
also access to network options including
proxy settings and homegroup management
finally there's also a new app section
that lets you control a new setting for
quite hours to ensure notifications
don't trigger at certain times you can
also control individual app
notifications and there's even the
ability to view app sizes to see which
applications are taking up the most
storage space there's also a new
Settings panel to change the app
defaults to control how files are opened
over all the settings are greatly
improved from Windows 8 and it should
prevent people from having to go into
desktop mode Morstan in terms of new
apps there's clearly an alarms app that
Microsoft is working on is that
occasional it's you add multiple alarms
and it includes a neat looking radio
menu to select the hours and minutes
there are options to control when the
alarm repeats and the sounds but overall
it's fairly basic right now next up is
also a calculator app and this includes
a standard character that works as you'd
expect there's also a scientific version
and but muscles also including a
converter option to quickly convert a
variety of options including volume
length and weight there's also a basic
sound recording app that lets you record
audio from a microphone and then share
it to other applications so you can see
here you can share it to SkyDrive and
mail Aboudi expect our apps will be able
to support that in future the final
built in app edition is movie moments
this appears to be a Windows Movie Maker
replacement and is fairly basic right
now B can add captions into videos very
easily and the results are protest and
then saved into the pictures library
you'll see that the the end result of
the video is extremely basic and but we
do suspect that Microsoft's actually
improving this quite rapidly although
there aren't any other additional
applications at the moment in Windows
Blu
Microsoft is also making changes to its
existing ones elsewhere Internet
Explorer has some minor changes that
hint at further improvements for blue as
a whole you can see that the layout is
pretty much identical to the Windows 8
version with his settings menu and pin
options but on the tab section which can
be found at the very top there's also a
new sync tabs option and we expect that
Microsoft is building in tap sync
functionality for Windows blue itself
but you could also expand this to
Windows Phone blue in the future to make
Internet Explorer more like Google's
Chrome browser the internet options here
are fairly unchanged so it's only tab
sink that's a new addition now this
version of Internet Explorer in Windows
blue is actually Internet Explorer 11
and you can see that if we switched to
the desktop version that that's
available in the about screen as for
other changes in Windows blue and it
looks like Microsoft is working on a
shutdown screen that's similar to
Windows Phone and the company has also
developed new snap views and by default
apps all snap into a 50/50 view that
will basically allow you to open up two
apps directly on alongside each other
you can in drag drag apps to the snap
view on the side and on higher
resolutions you'll actually be able to
drag as many as free or four apps
alongside each other there's also
improvements to the charm options in
Windows blue if we bring up Internet
Explorer and try to share a page you'll
notice that there are options to share a
screenshot of Internet Explorer or
simply link to the page now the same
applies for other charms and while the
search charm hasn't been updated to
include improved search to share the
devices charm shows new options when
you're attempting to play music or video
the charm has been updated to include a
play option which we suspect is the
normal play - option that lets you play
content exports and other devices and
there's also the usual print and in
quick access to projector options
finally we also notice that Microsoft
has tweaked its keyboard layout making
it easier to access a number keys by
holding down and swiping up and that was
a quick look at Windows blue which we're
expecting to be made available as an
upgrade to Windows 8 later this year
