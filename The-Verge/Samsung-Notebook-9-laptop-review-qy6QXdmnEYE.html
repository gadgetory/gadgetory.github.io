years but for the most part you're stuck
with a smaller screen with them maybe a
12 13 or possibly a 14 inch display with
this new Samsung laptop the notebook 9
is a thin inline computer weighs less
than a MacBook Air but it's got a big 15
inch display when most 15-inch computers
like a MacBook Pro away four and a half
pounds or more it's pretty rare to see
one that's as portable as a 13-inch
computer there are a bunch of reasons
why you want a larger screen it's easier
to look at easier to multitask with it's
easier to work on just generally more
pleasant to use you also get room for a
bigger keyboard and trackpad which is
always more comfortable and welcome and
you get a bunch of ports that you might
not see on a smaller sized computer the
notebook 9 screen is 15 inches in size
and it's a 1080p resolution which isn't
as high as others that you can get right
now
but still sharp enough for most purposes
as a really thin border around the
screen which makes it look even bigger
than it actually is what's really neat
here though is that it lacks a
touchscreen which a lot of Windows 10
computers offer now frankly I really
didn't miss it much during my testing
the keyboard on the notebook 9 is roomy
and responsive but it lacks backlighting
which is kind of a sin at this price
point it's also a bit spongy or not as
clicky as other laptops you can get but
fortunately the trackpad is huge and
really smooth what's great for
multi-touch gestures notebook 9 is a
bunch of useful ports too like two
full-size USB ports USB C port headphone
jack and a full size HDMI port less
useful is this mini port for an Ethernet
adapter and the micro SD card slot which
I wish was just a full-size SD slot and
while you can use this USB C port to
charge your phone can't charge a laptop
with that so you still need a
proprietary brick to plug into a special
power port performance on the notebook 9
is good for a bunch of things thanks to
the core i7 processor and eight
gigabytes of RAM even Chrome with dozens
of tabs running isn't enough to bog the
system down battery life on the other
hand is merely acceptable Samsung says
you can get up to 12 hours of battery
life with it but in real world juice I
get closer to 6 or 7 not everything is
great with a notebook 9 the design is a
bit boring looking it looks a lot like a
MacBook Air from 6 years ago and the
build quality isn't quite as good as
other computers the display hinge is
really loose and it feels a bit hollow
in your hands
now the other downside here is that
while it's great
have a big screen and keyboard a 15 inch
computer isn't always great for travel
it doesn't fit on a tray table and it's
a little bit clumsy err to use on your
lap but what the notebook netic does do
is change your perception of what you
can get from a thin and line computer no
longer are you stuck with a small screen
it's not the best computer in any metric
but as a good value for its price and it
does most tasks really well without any
major compromises because of its design
if you've been craving a lighter
computer but are tired or squinting at
smaller screens the notebook 9 is
definitely worth a look check check this
is data from the verge talking about
laptops which is not as sharp as some of
us yeah that's right like so you still
need to plug into a power brick with the
proprietary well I just didn't lost
myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
