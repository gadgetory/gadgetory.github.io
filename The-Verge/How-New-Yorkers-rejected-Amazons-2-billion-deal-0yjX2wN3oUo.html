York headquarters it was this
billion-dollar project there's gonna be
a new helipad a waterfront Esplanade and
for Empire State building's worth of
office space but on Valentine's Day
amazon decided to break things off with
the city the company was scrapping the
plans pulling out of the Long Island
City site and New York entirely it was
an ugly end to months of planning a
major embarrassment for everyone
involved but to understand how I got so
messy so fast you have to look at the
big picture
Amazon Seattle headquarters is the
biggest urban tech campus in America
with 40,000 workers and almost 1/5 of
the city's prime office space but that
still wasn't big enough for Amazon in
2017 Amazon announced it was looking for
a home for its second headquarters
dubbed HQ - 238 cities jumped in with
proposals usually dangling massive tax
breaks there is a bizarre game show vibe
to the whole thing clickhole joked about
the mayors of Pittsburgh in Kansas City
beating each other to death for a chance
at the headquarters after all that
Amazon's final choice was kind of an
anti-climax
instead of revitalizing a smaller city
Amazon would split the new headquarters
between New York and Washington DC there
is also a small outpost planned in
Nashville but for the most part the
company would be investing in cities
that didn't need the money almost from
the beginning New Yorkers were skeptical
in the days after the deal was announced
there were a ton of protests Amazon even
got booed out of a City Council meeting
a big issue in the background was rent
those high paid tech workers bring a lot
of money into the neighborhood which has
a way of driving up rent sometimes
really fast the effect has been most
extreme in the Bay Area where the influx
of tech money is driven up rents by as
much as 50% since 2010
that's led to a lot of conflict between
tech workers and everyday citizens some
of whom see the companies as hostile
invaders anti gentrification activists
have gone as far as blocking the buses
that take Google employees to work
outside San Francisco as a kind of
protest of what Google is doing to the
city if you're Amazon you have to think
are we gonna see that same kind of local
opposition in Queens locals also had a
problem with the deal itself which gave
Amazon 2.5 billion dollars in tax breaks
as a reward for moving in this kind of
deal happens a lot and you can argue
it's a good trade since the city still
ends up collecting more tax revenue than
it pays out in subsidy but there's a lot
that doesn't take into account including
all the residents and other businesses
that get displaced by the new
headquarters on paper Amazon was
offering the city a lot including job
training at nearby housing projects and
internship programs with local high
schools but the idea of paying Amazon
billions of dollars to remake downtown
Queens was just too much for local
politicians particularly city councilman
Jimmy Van Bramer it didn't help the
Governor Cuomo who mastermind for the
deal was wildly unpopular and didn't
have much goodwill to draw but the most
dangerous local opponent was state
senator michael generis who in January
joined New York's public authorities
control board that has official
oversight over the Amazon deal and since
the board requires unanimous approval
for a lot of motions generis would have
had lots of chances to make life
difficult for Amazon in November generis
told the virtuous staff was digging into
the incentive package to see legally
what we can do but as it turned out he
didn't get the chance
three months later Amazon backed out in
its statement Amazon said it was pulling
out because a number of state and local
politicians have made it clear that they
oppose our presence and will not
with us now that could be a reference to
generis specifically but the broader
opposition was just as scary
none of the local politicians had the
power to stop the deal completely but
they could make things a lot harder
the Queen's project would have taken 15
years to complete and along their way
there were going to be permit issues
labor disputes and the kind of headaches
that come with any ambitious
construction project there would be lots
of chances to make trouble and extract
real concessions from Amazon in the end
it just wasn't worth it now not every
tech company is so unlocked at the same
time that Amazon was fighting in Queens
Google announced a massive expansion to
its Manhattan headquarters but they did
without the big subsidies without the
game show and as a result without the
public opposition and south of DC where
there are fewer people being displaced
and fewer activists to raise hell
Amazon's headquarters is going forward
as planned
it's like mayor de Blasio said after the
deal fell through you have to be tough
to make it in New York thanks for
watching ton of questions in this
episode was Amazon right to back out of
New York would it have been bad for the
city for the headquarters to go forward
