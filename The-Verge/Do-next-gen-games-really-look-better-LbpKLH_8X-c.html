purge the xbox one and playstation 4
have launched heralding the arrival of
next-gen for many game publishers this
means having to release four different
versions of the same title across two
generations of consoles but what does
that mean for you the next generation is
supposed to represent something we can't
see or do with our current technology is
this first batch of games up to the task
the biggest boast of any new console is
graphics and right now next-gen
primarily means higher resolutions and
more complete worlds we've tested a
number of new titles and across the
board we've seen improved lighting fewer
jagged edges and more detail both near
and far Assassin's Creed 4 is a great
example of this just look at the more
nuanced shadows in the water and how the
islands trees and plants are filled out
in battlefield 4 we see vastly improved
lighting on dynamic range as well as
added details like flocks of seagulls
and new building models and best of all
these launch games are far more
responsive on new consoles thanks to
higher frame rates these are relatively
minor improvements but at least there's
a meaningful difference between the next
and last gen versions other games are
unattractive no matter what platform you
choose call of duty ghosts of madden 25
for example feature bland textures and
unimpressive effects in contrast NBA
2k14 is far from a simple port you can
see the huge visual upgrade and
everything from players faces in
uniforms to the crowd and reflections on
the court ultimately a lot of these
games fall into a gray area better than
before but not wildly so for people
looking to justify a brand new console
these Inbetweeners may seem
disappointing but it's not fair to judge
the ps4 and xbox one on these games
alone when you look at games truly built
for new consoles compared to their
previous gen counterparts the visuals
are striking the cars and ports of five
are photorealistic and motion blur gives
a true sense of speed compared to forts
of four on the Xbox 360 similarly
killzone shadowfall stuns with
incredible lighting effects and high
resolution environments that far
surpassed Killzone 3 there is no reason
why we shouldn't expect to see similar
advancements in more games over the next
few years especially once developers
leave the xbox 360 and playstation 3
behind so will the future of gaming be
more visually stunning absolutely but is
it worth buying into yet that is not so
