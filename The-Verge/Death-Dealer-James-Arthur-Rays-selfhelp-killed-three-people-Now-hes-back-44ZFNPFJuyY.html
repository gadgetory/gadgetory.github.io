someone to you either into various -
what's wrong - people breathing 12 no
conference yes okay an arizona resort
has become a crime scene after two
people died inside the crudely
constructed sweat lodge and several more
were sickened dozens had flocked to the
Angel Valley retreat center for a
spiritual event
that promised to absolutely change your
life James Shaw reveal walking at Kirby
Brown of New York died after
participating in a cleansing ceremony
inside this crudely built Hut the cause
of death for the third person who died
after attending the October ceremony was
multi-system organ failure the event was
hosted by self pelvics where James Ray
that investigators are looking into
whether criminal negligence played a
role in the deaths ray has refused to
speak with authorities and has left the
state
the way I would describe Kirby always to
people was that she was drunk on life
that she loved life she is always
willing to me and be open to accept
somebody as they were she and her
friends were enamored of the secret and
they were also big followers of Oprah it
is the secret to creating the life you
truly want make more money lose weight
fall in love land your dream job my
guests today believe that once you
discover the secret that you can
immediately start creating the life you
want
so when Oprah had James Ray on her show
I think Harvey felt very comfortable
that this guy was had a lot to offer and
a lot to say and a lot to teach your
thoughts your feelings and your actions
all have to be firing and simultaneously
in the same direction if you look at
anybody who's not achieving what they
desire and deserve in their life you'll
notice that one of those three is
missing there may be thinking and your
feelings are action that's three for
three she went to the promo in October
of 2008 in the Baja and at that
promotional talk she could sign up for
the two-day seminar and get a
two-for-one deal and she invited me to
go with her on her free ticket some of
you think wealth means money and I'll
guarantee you this you might go after
the money get rich it doesn't mean
you'll be wealthy there was a lot that
was talked about that I thought was
actually very helpful I was impressed by
Ray's charismatic abilities and how he
presented on the stage
it was very uncharacteristic of me to
write out
a check right then and there for George
to attend harmonic wealth in San Diego
and it was at that event that Kirby
signed up to go to Sedona a group of
participants traveled to Sedona Arizona
in October 2009 to attend a spiritual
retreat
James Ray had promised people that the
event would be great and that they would
have an altered state
what his program was designed to do was
basically to break people down they were
told not to sleep they had to talk about
very traumatic things in their past in a
group setting and at the end of the week
James Ray ran a sweat lodge James Ray
explained to the participants that they
were going to do a sweat lodge and that
his sweat lodge was hotter than any
other that they needed to stay in the
whole time things of that nature
typically a sweat lodge is of the size 4
10 12 15 people and typically they do
four rounds and in each round people can
go out the door opens and James did more
rounds than four I didn't know exactly
how many but as it turns out he did
seven rounds and in 2009 he did actually
eight rounds because he miscounted one
so he did an extra one James Ray's
version of the sweat lodge was a heat
endurance test it wasn't a sweat lodge a
typical sweat lodges they go in and they
relax and it's not it's not that
difficult
in James ray sweat lodge they were told
to stay in there as long as possible and
as people were leaving James Ray would
try and encourage them to stay in during
the ceremony several people came out and
they were definitely not feeling well
one of our staff was there and she's and
she was extremely upset she said there's
people's that said that some people
passed out and I heard him say we'll
look we'll see to that
after this round people are starting to
realize something's not right here
there's people sick James Ray kind of
disregarded that people were in distress
people started coming out and and this
took about 15 minutes for everybody to
file out of the sweat lodge the woman
who was part of the fire keepers team
she went back in to see - to see whether
everybody was out and was not there were
three people still in there and they
were unconscious I just knew I just knew
it it was so late
the next thing we heard was someone
knocking on the door and about 8 o'clock
in the morning on Friday morning on
Friday more knocked over 9 to ask did we
know her state trooper asking us if we
knew Kirby Brown Miss then he he told us
that she had passed at a certain point
we knew what happened in a sweat lodge
there's no question from talking to
everybody involved we know exactly what
happened in the sweat lodge it got too
hot and James ray encouraged people to
stay inside even though they were
wanting to leave but we didn't know if
that's a crime when we began hearing his
lack of attention to their need for help
I was like this man murdered these
people we did some research to look into
James Ray's credentials where did he
learn how to do a sweat lodge and we
didn't find anything that that showed us
where James really learned how to do
these different events I've had blessed
opportunity to study with many
indigenous traditions and in the Andes
Mountains and the jungles of the Amazon
and and if the principle is all the same
he claimed to have had extensive
training to do a sweat lodge not true he
claimed to be trained in holotropic
breathing by Groth not true everything
he did that week that he claimed to have
training in and experience and knowledge
was untrue
nearly four months after his
controversial sweat lodge ceremony
self-help guru James Arthur Ray has been
arrested on three counts of manslaughter
an arizona jury heard opening arguments
Tuesday in the trial of a self-help guru
who sweat lodge ceremony in 2009 turned
deadly for three of the participants the
self-help author is now headed for jail
tonight and it comes after a lot of
backlash in court over his deadly Sedona
sweat lodge ceremony the judge is a
notoriously light sentencer and instead
of giving him three counts consecutively
he let them run concurrent so he could
have been given six years but he was
given two we're here today because Kirby
isn't James ray is expected to get out
of prison today after her death in the
following months it took us a number of
discussions to get a little bit clearer
about exactly what we wanted to do when
what kind of action we wanted to take
there's a lot of people in this industry
that like James ray operate unethically
and unsafely
and we wanted to try to figure out some
way to change that so we've put together
the seek safely promise which is really
both for the providers of self-help and
also for their consumers to understand
that this is what they're entitled to
and this is what they deserve and we
were asking the providers of self-help
to sign on to just some very basic
values as someone who's going to an
event this is what you're entitled to
this is like your Bill of Rights these
are your rights and and you need to ask
for this this industry has to change it
has to become infused with ethical
standards and accountability large group
awareness training is an unregulated in
industry it has been for a long time
there are a number of companies that
sell this training they have a history
of problems there is not a month that
goes by that I don't receive complaints
about these weekend retreats that break
people down to make them over again and
change them anyone can be hurt by them
and there doesn't seem to be any real
responsibility or accountability so I
think though legislation may be a real
difficult thing to accomplish due
diligence is something that can be done
and should be done before entering into
any program and people should realize
that these large group awareness
training programs even though they see
Oprah pitching them they are
controversial and they have a history of
problems many times in my work people
will say to me you know what kind of
person gets involved in this stuff as if
there's a particular type of person that
has a stamp on their forehead that says
this person is vulnerable if you think
that you're somehow invulnerable think
again all the people that we talked to
that associate with James Ray Ward seem
like regular normal people and I didn't
see that coming I thought that this was
going to be some kind of cult but no
these are just regular people that's
what makes James Ray so good and then
also so dangerous is because these
aren't mental midgets that he's
targeting these are mainstream doctors
lawyers normal people that become
followers we're taking a big step here
this morning
because as parents we find this
tremendously hard James Ray gets out of
prison today he is now free we want to
make sure that seekers are free to seek
safely we're going to issue him the
promise we hope he'll sign it we hope
he'll follow it we hope that he will not
hurt anyone else in the future
I have no intentions whatsoever of
certainly ever doing another sweat lodge
and we do any kind of self-help I don't
know you know peers oh hey you could be
an even better position now to to help
people who've been through a nightmarish
experience I I hope so
you know he he put himself out there as
being omnipotent but in the face of
crisis he was impotent he was unable to
act he did nothing to help the people
that had placed their trust in him he
did nothing to help them and then he
walked away he abandoned all of them
she gave him everything she had
everything there was hardly anything
left in her bank account all of her
money all of her trust and ultimately
her life he took it all
