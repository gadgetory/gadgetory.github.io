The Verge I'm at pebbles offices in
Redwood City in Silicon Valley and today
we're taking a hands-on look at the
first update to the original pebble from
2013 this is the pebble to and the
biggest difference is that it has
optical heart rate sensors let's take a
look so one of the first things you'll
notice about the new pebble too is that
this right here is Corning Gorilla Glass
the original pebble had a plastic
coating over it it's also thinner and
it's definitely lighter than the
original pebble but the big news here is
the addition of the optical heart rate
sensors pebble recently got into health
tracking with its watches and it uses a
variety of different sensors and
algorithms to determine what kind of
activity are doing but with the addition
of optical heart rate sensors company
says it will be able to better track
things like when you're sleeping or what
your heart rate is when you're actually
exercising the watch has the same
silicone straps as previous pebble
watches and if you have straps from
another model you'll be able to swap
them in and out it has the same three
physical buttons on this side physical
button over here it's not a touchscreen
SmartWatch
unlike most other smartwatches out there
so the way you kind of navigate through
the interface is by pressing various
buttons Pebble today is also announcing
an update to its pebble time series
previously you could buy a pebble time
and a pebble time steel but now they've
combined the two and you'll notice that
the bezel is much smaller than the bezel
on previous models you can see up to 50%
more of the display and one of the
software features that's new with pebble
is called actions this means that if you
press this button up here you have easy
access to core functions of certain apps
that you can program in the main pebble
app so for example here the weather just
see the weather right away you can send
text to someone you designate to be the
person you want to send texts to you can
just automatically tell at your current
location
pressin uber with just a couple of
presses in the button the idea here is
that the interaction is supposed to be
pretty shallow you don't have to go
through multiple screens or press
multiple buttons in order to do that one
thing you want to do with an app pebble
says it has sold 1.8
smartwatches to date and that they're
pretty happy with that but that's not
nearly as much as something like the
Apple watch or even Fitbit sales pebble
says that it sees itself as sort of the
swatch of the SmartWatch world it's
meant to be fun accessible and
relatively inexpensive the pebble too
goes on sale today on Kickstarter for
$99 and the company says it expects it
to ship in September the pebble time to
goes on sale on Kickstarter as well for
169 dollars and that will ship in
November</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
