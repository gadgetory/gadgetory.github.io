here at the Geneva Motor Show at the
Hyundai booth with the new hyundai ioniq
which is their competitor for the toyota
prius and pretty much every other hybrid
and small electric car on the market
unlike most of them though it has three
variants which is a unique thing for the
industry and Hyundai is very proud of
this one is a normal hybrid with a
battery that's charged up through
regenerative braking another is a
plug-in hybrid that can actually go 50
kilometers or about 30 miles on an
electric charge before the
gasoline-powered engine kicks in or this
one behind me which is an all-electric
version it can go Hyundai says 250
kilometers on a charge which is about a
hundred and fifty five miles and Hyundai
has some interesting ideas about how
they might sell it they could sell it
like a normal electric car where you buy
the car and the battery with it or they
might let you buy the car and then lease
the battery because they think battery
technology in the future might improve
so you could keep the car but swap out
the battery for whatever that new
technology is the electric version
should cost about 40 thousand euros when
it goes on sale later this year in
Europe and Korea the hybrid and plug-in
hybrid versions they say should be
pretty comparable to the Toyota Prius if
not coming in a little bit cheaper and
it sounds like they're going to come to
the US later this year we'll see if
Hyundai has actually built a Prius
killer or just going to expand the
market a little bit more either way
we're excited to try it out this is
Jordan with the verge reporting from the
Geneva Motor Show for much more you can
