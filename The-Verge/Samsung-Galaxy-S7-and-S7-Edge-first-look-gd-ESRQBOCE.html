taking a look at the new Galaxy s7 and
galaxy s7 edge from Samsung
these are Samsung's flagship phones for
this year and I'm very similar in looks
and feel to last year's s6 and s6 edge
but there are some key differences that
Samsung's really improved in a number of
ways for one the s7 is a 5.1 inch
display so that's the same size as last
year but the back has been curved so
it's a little bit more comfortable to
hold very similar to the note 5s design
there but the bigger change is with the
s7 edge it's now a 5.5 inch screen it
still has that dual curved edge display
but the back has a slight curve to it as
well to make it more comfortable to hold
and easier to pick up off a table the
bigger screen is still in a compact size
you can see there's a pretty small phone
it's not much bigger than the 5.1 inch
s7 it's significantly smaller than other
phones with 5.5 inch screens like the
iPhone 6 plus and it makes it a lot
easier to use in one hand and to slip in
and out of your pocket and yet still
gives you a really big display the
display itself is obviously Samsung
Super AMOLED technology it's got a qHD
resolution you can see here on the back
the camera has been trimmed down a lot
so it's not doesn't stick out as much as
it used to it's a 12 megapixel camera
this year so it's a new sensor and
Samsung says that the autofocus system
has been greatly improved as well as
low-light capture so brighter lens
larger pixels for better low-light
capabilities and then a lot of the other
details are very similar to last year's
phones however the big change here is
obviously you can now put a micro SD
card slot in and these new phones are
now also water resistant up to one and a
half meters for 30 minutes so those are
two big changes from last year's phone
inside the devices that we sold here in
the US are gonna be running Qualcomm
Snapdragon 820 whereas Samsung it used
its own Exynos processor elsewhere it's
obviously a very high-end fast processor
everything here is going to run really
fast and quick it's running Android 6.0
marshmallow
it's got Samsung's TouchWiz skin on top
of it of course supports Samsung pay
quick charge or fast charging Wireless
fast charging all those features that
have become kind of standard on Samsung
devices the one thing that's been
updated for the s7
edge is the new edge panel here it's
larger you can see more detail you can
get more information you can add more
shortcuts to apps you can add direct
shortcuts for various activities like
taking a selfie is a bit more
customization there as well the other
one other feature that sensitives added
is a new always-on display so you can
see the time and date and you can set a
picture or clock or notifications here
that will always be accessible on the
screen itself it's not a wake up or
anything like that it's just always on
the screen samsung says that the s7 and
s7 edge will be available on all
carriers here in the US and you can
expect them to hit stores on March 11th
and the pricing should be roughly about
the same as last year's that's it for
the Samsung Galaxy s7 s7 edge for more
