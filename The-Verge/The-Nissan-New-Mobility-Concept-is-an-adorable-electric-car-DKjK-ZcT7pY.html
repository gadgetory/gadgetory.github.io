could not have picked a busier place to
test this thing out Madison Square
Gardens right there pen stations over
here and this is the Nissan new mobility
concept if it looks familiar it's
basically the same exact thing as the
Renault Twizy which has been around for
a while in Europe and Nissan took it
rebadged it a bit broad to the States
made some modifications and now they're
testing it out here in the United States
they've only got about a dozen or so
here ten of them are part of a pilot
program in San Francisco where people
can rent them and share them but they're
really just trying to figure out how it
might work
here in the States so we just turned on
to eight that we're gonna go up towards
Times Square a bit yeah so this is all
electric it'll get you about 40 miles on
the charge right now it takes about
three to four hours to recharge the
whole thing off of your standard evie
charging port and in the US its speed
limited to 25 miles an hour in Europe
this same thing can get up above 50 or
so miles an hour which is definitely a
little sketchier it's similar in some
ways to the our Komodo
SRK which we got to ride bashes CES
obviously the big difference is this is
four wheels that was three but you've
got the same open air construction
another big windshield so you can see up
in front of you this isn't going to get
you around with a hundred miles of range
or 200 miles range in the suburbs but in
the city it could get you around I don't
know if you'd want this in New York City
but once you miss all the buses and
stuff
actually not that bad the ride it is not
the smoothest there is some
interesting-looking suspension on all
four wheels but I just said some
potholes back there that made me think
about my lunch from a couple hours
before now this is all part of what
Nissan calls the future lab something's
been around for a couple years and
they're basically studying big urban
environments whether that's sort of big
like San Francisco we're really big like
New York and trying to figure out how
people get around how that's changing
from how we've always known people get
around and this is basically the first
project that they've employed based on
their findings and so like I said
there's ten in San Francisco right now
in a partnership with a program called
scoot and people are able to join up
with scoot and rent one of these things
and it's point-to-point a lot like bike
sharing you grab one drop it off
somewhere else throw it back in a
charger so to see more weird stuff like
this and more traditional cars and all
this stuff in the New York Auto Show
