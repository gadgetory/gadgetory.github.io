editor of The Verge this man doesn't
need an introduction but I'm gonna do it
anyway
he's also executive editor The Verge
Walt Mossberg who knew there you go
we're gonna go look at some stuff at CES
okay so this is my 24th CES or Comdex
which I won't explain but it was sort of
like speed with the thing all right here
we are at the monopolist megalopolis so
Samsung this is the Samsung it's
basically a city you did well that's
that's always tricky to figure out how
to get in
it's like a fortress well I knew the guy
who used to be the CEO of Samsung
because I got drunk with him one time in
Korea oh you know what I want to see I
want to see the Tab pro no I I'm like a
size thing oh it doesn't do monthly wait
ah all right
that seems dumb I'm a big nut for these
shortcut keys quickly on on you know
mobile OSS what's your feeling on the
caps lock key I think it's time to get
rid of it let's get rid of it Google got
rid of it they changed it to a search
game yeah I agree
yeah how often you use it really I mean
my feeling is if you're going to yell on
Twitter is every key yourself otherwise
you're not just yelling it's lazy I
never thought of that argument where's
the friend let's go look at the bridge
all right now the fridge doesn't allow
close-up photography why not
because Samsung is afraid of cameras I'm
taking a photo like they can't stop me
close-up can I live stream from the
inside of my fridge can i periscope from
the cameras inside the fridge what what
if I probably we can make a virgin of
this yeah well I want to put the verge
on here no it's fine we can take a
selfie I'm Walt
this guy's a journalist in Estonia this
is TV
that's TV did you know the big new
feature the Sheeran TVs
is HDR HDR I mean what that's freighter
don't I have that on my phone there's a
box with an extra X we weren't for box
well we don't have two x's in our name
no should we get another X 3 / 3 X's I'm
I'll call Jim Bankoff right now yeah
yeah sonic built the house they built a
house but its Stadium
it says where's Lucy well is it a nice
house internet-connected blenders
seriously I'm serious you're on your way
home you're driving in your car and the
vegetables have been sitting there all
day getting come we'll get a rock this
looks like you know one of those decks
you use when you're trying to raise
money for your startup I'm gonna go
stick my face in the nano facial didn't
I do it because I'm the least important
executive editor you want to do it
together
oh yeah all right here we go here we go
Nilay has to do all the work to this why
is this nano I mean that's not a new
invention nano at all
what happens if I put vodka water I
think I know you're this tournament
you're not probably running the business
for this maybe you are if you are I have
a tip do a partnership with VIPs all
right do you know a dpi I don't either
so why don't we go visit all right
here's monster sound the USB cable in my
back pocket got more expensive just
being near monster so this is to me this
is an interesting lesson there are
companies that are not household names
that actually make a lot of tech stuff
that people might go to the store and
buy but they don't necessarily know and
the other lesson is that you don't have
to be located in Palo Alto you could be
in st. Louis oh my god
slap a DVD in there
close it up but it's an Android tablet
would you put this in your kitchen what
these ours are actually charcoal grill
starters that makes more sense okay now
here's here's an existential question
okay is the alarm clock dead because
everybody uses their phone or their
watch or something to wake themselves up
no I agree with you I have one that has
two alarms yeah that's good for taking
naps on the weekend I bet you five
dollars there's a cranking weather radio
here let's see alright no are you taking
my bet
yeah alright maybe like finally paid me
ah look at that
I didn't even have to go five feet
that's not a radio though it's a
flashlight oh there's a radio of this
okay five bucks
Nilay if you're watching this this is
the way you do bets you don't wait six
months easiest money I've ever made
what do you think is this the future I'm
sorry I'm in the middle of like being
attacked by dinosaurs oh my god a music
Feeny music
I got a hands-free mic I would wear this
in the winter but Lydia this is diving
mine's cuter I want to directly address
Tim Cook why are you so far behind on
rod speakers get with the program
sundar don't make this suction cup
speakers for four heads this is a future
of wearables right here
they've Android pay they've Android auto
but do they have Android suction oh he's
getting now now dark this this is really
this is an important part of CES which
are kind of the back corners and the
prefab offices yes I don't know the
money gets made big cameras are coming
back like it looks like that's not real
yeah NSA is running it's definitely real
Ayana stay so these are names we know
GoPro Nikon is Nikon like up or down
what do you think it could be I did one
with me but they preferred the one with
earth we do this one to come in in there
I don't know
videos 1 out of 10 what's your what's
your rating at CES this year this year
yeah I would have to say it's a 4 or 5 I
give it a 5
all right guys hi and this rumors are
watching over 20 point eight four point
eight four point eight five
all right follow us on YouTube please
subscribe we'll have a lot more videos
