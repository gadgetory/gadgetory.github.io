we're taking an early look at adobe's
very first venture into hardware a duo
of smart tools known as Project mighty
and Napoleon Adobe was quick to stress
that these products are still in
development and they'll almost certainly
change in the future of the two the
smart stylus mighty is a lot further
along and as a polished design and
working internals the pen is a sleek
triangular shape and it fits really
nicely between your fingers and thumb
there's a single button on it just above
the tip and like the home button on an
iPhone pressing on it in different ways
can do a handful of different things a
single tap opens up a Spartan menu where
you can swap palette and brushes and
long and short taps can be used to copy
and paste layers of an image you can
also hop over to another person's iPhone
or iPad and drop the asset there drawing
is really smooth though it won't make an
artist out of you there can be a little
bit of lag over bluetooth but Adobe
tells us they've gotten the delay down
to 37 milliseconds that doesn't sound
like much and in reality it isn't adobe
says that mighty has about 4,000 levels
of pressure sensitivity and the
depending on the brush you're using the
lag could be a little bit longer or
shorter in practice that's about right
more basic tools like a pencil appeared
almost immediately on screen adobe is
also toying around with different
charging stands for mighty on one model
power came in through a nickel plating
above the Pens tip while another two
little dots along the neck of the pen
let it lie down and charge in a number
of different stands adobe is really
thinking of it as a part of designers
workflow and set up and it wants to make
the entire package look good well my tea
already has a lot of fit and finish the
Napoleon smart ruler isn't much more
than prop with some neat software right
now at the moment there's nothing inside
of it and the icons along the top aren't
even functioning buttons yet but
software knows how big the ruler is and
will automatically draw out parallel
lines or a triangle or even a French
curve depending on how you have it set
there's not necessarily a practical
reason to use Napoleon over digital
ruler but a lot of people could enjoy
using it for the same reason people at
like using moleskine journals a
particular sense of aesthetics and
nostalgia Adobe isn't saying yet whether
i'll be taking my tea and napoleon to
market but it certainly put a lot more
time and thought into the tools and
you'd expect for a simple experiment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
