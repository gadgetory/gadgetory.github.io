guessing you've been here before
over the last decade YouTube has grown
from a handful of oddball clips into the
world's biggest and most influential
video platform and today it's about to
introduce its biggest change yet a
monthly subscription service that will
fundamentally change the way users and
creators can interact with YouTube
advertising has always paid the bills on
YouTube but with YouTube's bread that no
longer has to be the case you subscribe
for $9.99 a month and you'll never see
an ad again in addition you can take
videos offline and watch them when you
don't have connectivity and you can
watch youtube videos in the background
so if you've got a TED talk or a music
video you can let the audio from that
play while you're answering a text or
out on a bike rack you've announced
something that's pretty interesting and
steps a bit away from advertising
tell me about what it is you guys are
rolling out today essentially a way for
people to amplify their YouTube
experience by removing all ads at the
same time we also have announced that
will produce new fake original content
with the people who have become most
successful on YouTube and have rabid
audiences of fans and instead of having
them produce great new content for other
platforms they can do it right here
where their home is where their
audiences this is really good
really impressed YouTube understands
that the last thing its creators want is
to force their fans to pay to watch
videos so with YouTube read all the
choice lies with the audience it's a lot
like Spotify or Pandora if you want to
watch for free you'll sit through some
ads if you decide to pay everything is
ad free and there's some power features
we really believe that viewers want the
choice to have an uninterrupted youtube
experience and so we said how can we
create an offering that can remove the
interruptions of ads that can give
additional features like background and
offline capabilities and even access to
new exclusive content at the same time
YouTube is eager to coax more content
behind the paywall they want this to be
a service not just for the superfans but
for someone who might otherwise sign up
for Netflix or Hulu and so at an event
this morning in Los Angeles they
unrolled a new slate of originals that
you can only see if you subscribe the
stuff that sits behind the paywall will
feature stars who were native to the
platform pair with talent from Hollywood
and television all with a generous
heaping of Google money thrown on top
we're not focused on what other people
do were focused on our own audience
our approach is focused on our own
talent pool and worked with them and and
have them be our temples so what we're
doing is matching them together with
other really experienced producers
PewDiePie for example YouTube's biggest
star is being paired with the producer
of The Walking Dead and getting a giant
budget to create a brand-new horror show
which will run in addition to his normal
YouTube channel
what eyebrows to us this is a great
example of a collaboration between you
know just a phenomenal global talent
from YouTube and somebody who has
created one of the best and most popular
TV shows on television today and sort of
meshing these two talents together
another one is literally saying shooting
a documentary of her tour around the
world which is amazing YouTube is facing
increasing competition from the likes of
Facebook snapchat and vine
it's hoping that with YouTube read it
can create a big pool of new revenue
revenue it can use to reward its
creators and keep them on YouTube a lot
of concentrators were really successful
in achieving large audiences through all
kinds of platforms are turning to other
funding mechanisms Kickstarter and
battery on etc to access and love and
translated into support and we're
effectively doing that through YouTube
brand YouTube Music is going to have
what I would expect which is you know
music videos interviews concert footage
and so you were saying that you know you
feel like almost all the big music
labels around here we have all the major
labels and publishers and aggregators of
music and menu for entertainment
partners that roughly have music company
are coming on board so we're very
confident that as they continue see in
the experience they're going to get more
excited to have their company happen if
she's gonna grow as far as competition
if you're in a space that's you know 250
billion dollars annually you will not be
the only person playing and it be other
acoustical companies trying to take the
share of that Big Pine Facebook
obviously is a very capable one Twitter
is another one and there'll be more and
more we constantly make sure that we
know everything about the competition
just so we are smarter what we're really
focused on is what does our audience
want how can we enhance our business the
world that all of our advertising
partners are used to remains alive and
well and continues to grow at an
astonishing rate of 60 percent year
we're focusing on growing the ad
business at the rate that we're going it
now and and now layer on top of it in a
subscription business that hopefully
diversifies the revenue stream for
helping traders and accelerates the
five-year compensation now ads on
YouTube obviously aren't going to go
away for most people in fact YouTube
thinks that the vast majority of viewing
will still be free ad-supported but it
knows that at the same time cable and
network television are in decline people
like me cord cutters are increasingly
used to putting together an ala carte
selection of subscription services for
music and television and film and the
generation younger than me they're
watching most video on their phones and
are more likely to recognize a star from
YouTube or snapchat then a big
personality from time time television
the infinite is doing to cable with
cable dick the broadcast that it's just
you know broadening a set of choices
which means total engagement is going up
but the ratings on the few or bigger
things is going down so I think you have
to you have to really learn how to
function in a fragmented world and I
think that YouTube is incredibly well
positioned for that world I mean that is
all the episodes since the dawn of the
World Wide Web people have dreamed of a
new media universe one with a nearly
unlimited supply of creators each
serving an audience perfect for them
with YouTube read we're about to find
out how close we are to finally
achieving that dream</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
