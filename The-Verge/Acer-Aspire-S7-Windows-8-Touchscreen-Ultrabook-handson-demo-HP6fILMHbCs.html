2012 and we're taking a look at aces
aspire s7 this is actually a laptop that
we first saw at Computex I wanted to
come back and take another look at it
because this is actually very very
impressive in hardware terms and
specifications firstly because of this
amazing thinness that it has the first
time that I took a look at it aether was
just a tablet with it's such a bore
keyboard but it is in fact a Windows 8
laptop
he runs an Intel Core i5 or i7 low
voltage processor this particular one in
front of us has a 1.9 gigahertz core i7
and it has a touchpad in the keyboard as
most laptops so you can unlock your home
screen like so
however it also happens to have a
touchscreen and it works brilliantly
well it's capacitive screen 11 inch
display 1366 by 768 resolution as really
attractive viewing angles as well that's
impressive it is framed by this Gorilla
Glass frame which goes right up to the
edge so everything is covered by grass
it isn't too glossy isn't you reflective
and the glass itself is surrounded by
this aluminum / magnesium mixed body
which is very strong and very firm it's
extremely impressive and actually makes
for a very very beautiful laptop it has
this crosshatch pattern on the top it is
very rigid and very impressive you've
got a few status lights down here a
couple of vents for the processor under
cooling agent might port there's a
couple of years b2 3.0 ports in fact
funnily enough there's a power button
over here on the side as I say he really
reminds me of a tablet he's so thin you
know it was like a really high high
quality really premium device that were
looking at here so physically is very
impressive but there is one thing that
we noticed
over here and one of the issues is that
it's actually a bit of a nightmare to
open up okay so I'm just going to look
at here one of the things that we
noticed is that while using the sub
screen the usual windows 8 gestures do
function so you've got the gesture to
charm bar on the right you can switch
between applications by coming in from
the left to eat and bring up the menus
from the tops and sighs I'm sure he
already aware of these pressing the
Windows key switches you between the
Metro interface and the standard ish
Windows 7 old-school desktop interface
so that's all well and good
however these gestures the ones that are
attached to the touchpad down here the
bottom do not seem to work in this
particular model it's running Windows 8
release preview so it is obviously isn't
final software but it is a little bit of
a disturbing thing because one of the
issues that might pop up here Oliva and
generally as laptop manufacturers and
several of manufacturers put together
these keyboards is touchpad
compatibility with gestures so for
example there if you go to the Metro UI
you should be able to swipe with two
fingers left him right but you cannot so
you kind of have to drag your mouse to
the edge and it's really not as
intuitive it's nowhere near as smooth or
as fluid it's one of Microsoft's big
words with Windows 8 fluidity which is
brilliant when you're doing it with your
finger and when you're using the
touchscreen but not so much with such
bad so hopefully I so sauce this out in
advance of releasing this laptop and say
we don't have any release date
information we don't have a price all we
really know is that it's amazingly thin
it works really quickly it has a really
attractive display and a really
attractive design and we'd like to see
more of it actually just a final note to
say that the barren life is rated for 6
hours we're taking a look over here it's
given us two hours remaining on 28
percent charge
a few minutes ago it gave us one hour
remaining on 35% charge so it fluctuates
but that kind of gives us a good idea
so good to have the longest battery life
in the world because it is so slim and
skinny but still a very impressive
laptop for Mesa this is the Acer Aspire
784 27 Berlin</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
