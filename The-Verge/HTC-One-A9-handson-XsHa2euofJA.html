you wouldn't know that by looking at it
this new Android smartphone can be easy
to confuse for an iPhone here's the same
shape the same aluminum unibody design
and it all feels the same when you hold
it what makes a distinct however is
precisely the fact that it brings all
these iPhone qualities to the world of
Android and not just any Android but
Android marshmallow the latest version
of Google's mobile OS the one a9 box the
present trend forever larger and more
powerful flagship Android phones
prioritising instead of thin lightweight
design overall horsepower
the display is a 5 inch AMOLED panel
that looks great in all lighting
conditions there's a new 30 megapixel
camera with optical image stabilization
HTC isn't willing to describe this is
this best camera ever but I can already
tell you that it is thus a
disappointment of this year's earlier
one m9 has been rectified HD signature
boom sound speakers have you removed to
make room for new fingerprint sensor
under display which also act is a touch
sensitive home button unlike the iPhone
of the galaxy s6 this home button can't
be pressed in and only offers vibration
feedback but it is just as fast and
accurate as the others and sound still
remains the top priority for HTC with
support for high resolution audio and a
single speaker that still sounds great
HTC One a9 is a lot like Samsung's
Galaxy alpha of 2014 a phone that
doesn't have a clear relationship to the
company's flagship device but it's
designed like a flagship in some right
like the Alpha the biggest sacrifice
that a one a9 makes is in the battery
it's only 20 150 milliamp hours which is
more than the iPhone but well below the
modern Android average that's paired
with a Snapdragon 617 processor which
promises greater efficiency and Android
Stowe's feature to have a better life
that's at least adequate the funny thing
about the AC 1 and 9 is that none of its
specs appear to be class-leading or all
that special and yet it performs with
beautiful speed and fluidity it feels
great and does pretty much everything
you'd want the motor smartphone to do
it's like HTC copied the iPhones
it just works credo along with the
devices look at design
and that's what makes the one a9 so
interesting in a sea of high-powered
machines it's a light and airy
alternative that puts the user
experience first the one a9 will be
available around the world from the
start of November stay tuned to the
verge for a full review in the coming
days</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
