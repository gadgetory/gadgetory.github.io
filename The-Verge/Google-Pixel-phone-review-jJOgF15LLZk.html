made by a lot of manufacturers but never
one made by Google until now this is the
pixel and I'm just gonna say it right at
the top it is the best Android phone
that has ever been made okay but what
does it mean that Google is making a
phone now well it means that we finally
get to see what Google wants when it
makes some hardware and what does Google
want it wants to make a phone that's
really simple and approachable every
phone these days is made of just metal
and glass but Google's take is really
simple in utilitarian it comes in two
sizes five inches and 5.5 inches and
they feel pretty good to use even though
they're a little bit thicker than you
might expect there's also this glass
shade on the back which I don't know is
there for maybe antenna reception and to
help you know which way is up it's fine
there's also a fingerprint sensor on the
back which is where I prefer a
fingerprint sensor to be it's way more
comfortable to use except when it's
sitting on a table now there's only one
speaker but it's really loud it's here
on the bottom and also on the bottom of
course you'll find a USBC jack and of
course there's a headphone jack on the
top overall the pixel just doesn't feel
techy like a Samsung phone it just feels
like a smart phone and it feels a lot
like that smart phone the iPhone like I
said Google wants the pixel to feel
familiar inside it's powerful Google
really wanted this thing to be a
top-tier phone so there's a fast
Snapdragon 820 one processor four gigs
of ram and two storage options 32 or 128
gigs and I love the screens they're OLED
which means they have really good color
and super deep blacks they look stupid
endows and the pixels are faster and way
more responsive than any Android phone
I've ever used I also really like that
the small one is just as powerful as the
big one now because Google can control
both the hardware and the software it
can optimize a bunch of stuff like
battery life the battery life is
stupendous I'm getting about two hours
more on the pixel than I ever got on an
iPhone or a nexus phone but you pay for
all that power and design
it starts at 6:49 for the small one and
it goes all the way up to 869 for the
pixel XL with 128 gigs but my main
takeaway for this is that it is a
top-tier phone but it's not like some
precious piece of jewelry it's a phone
and you're meant to use it so Google
made it feel normal really my only
problem with the hardware is that it's
not waterproof the other super important
reason that Google had for wanting to
make its own phone was being able to
fully control the integration between
the hardware and the software and
there's no more important piece of
software on this phone than the Google
assistant the idea is simple like Siri
on the iPhone you hold your finger down
on the home button and you start talking
and it looks like a chat interface
because Google wants it to be a
conversation you can ask it all the
usual stuff whether you can set text you
can make appointments and so on but it's
smarter about follow-up questions it
remembers what you're talking about
when do the Vikings play next the
Minnesota Vikings will play the
Philadelphia Eagles on October 23rd at
1:00 p.m. who is their quarterback Teddy
Bridgewater Sam Bradford and others are
quarterbacks for the Minnesota Vikings
it even knows what you have on the
screen
who's the cast for this TV show
the cast of ultra catch fire includes
Lee pace Lincoln show me pictures of him
check out these pictures of Lee face it
can open some apps like Spotify an open
table but it doesn't work with a lot yet
that's not coming until later this year
and like all assistants this assistant
sometimes is kind of dumb when is the
next presidential debate the third
presidential debate is on Wednesday
October night put that on my calendar
when is the event when you just told me
sorry what's the day and time you're not
very smart are you the assistant still
has a ways to go but it's probably the
best that's out there right now that
just doesn't mean that it's amazing
there are some other custom software
bits to talk about the launcher is new
it's got round icons and you swipe up to
see your apps like this you can also
long press on icons for shortcuts like
this and it comes with 24/7 phone or
chat support including screen sharing if
you need extra help but the clearest
example of software integration is
actually in the camera google says that
this is the best camera ever put in a
smartphone and it's really good but I'm
about the best there is a lot of
Technology in here though it's a 12
megapixel shooter on the back and the
pixels are really big for good low-light
images and there's also phased detect
automatically so one thing it doesn't
have is optical image stabilization
which for people like me with really
shaky hands is kind of a bummer but the
proof is in the pictures and I got to
say I'm pretty impressed first of all
this camera is really really fast it
shoots an HDR auto mode by default and
usually that slows a camera down on
Android but here it's fine and the
pictures that come out are pretty good
they're ready to post they're not quite
as true to life as the iPhone 7 but you
know what maybe that's okay at this
point it's more about your photographic
preferences than it is about any one
camera being the best this camera is in
the same ballpark as the galaxy s7 and
the iPhone 7 and that's really
impressive oh and one more thing the
video camera has electronic
stabilization because it's tied to the
gyroscope so if I'm shooting a video and
kind of shaking the end-result still is
pretty stable but maybe the best part is
that everything that you shoot on the
pixel gets stored in the cloud for free
at full resolution forever ok so this is
what it means that Google is finally
making its first ever phone good
hardware a pretty smart assistant and a
really good camera it means that this is
the best Android phone that you can buy
period but what it really means is that
Google is getting in the ring they're
ready to fight hell this thing is going
to be sold in Verizon stores and they're
going to market the hell out of it we've
never seen Google take on Apple this
directly before and they're going toe to
toe Google will tell you that this is
going to be a really long fight and it's
only the first round and they're right
there's no knockout punch here but not
on either side the pixel goes
head-to-head with the iPhone and doesn't
fall down and for a first try that's
really exciting
now Google it uh look you now because
given
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
