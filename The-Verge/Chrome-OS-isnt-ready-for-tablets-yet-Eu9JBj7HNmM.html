- The writing has been on
the wall for a while now.
Android tablets, they're
kinda on their way out,
and Chrome OS tablets are
coming soon to replace them.
But, here's a question.
Is Chrome OS really ready to
replace Android on tablets?
(upbeat music)
So it's been obvious
to me for a while now,
that Chrome OS is coming to tablets,
and it makes sense.
Chrome OS can run Android
apps pretty well now,
and most of them have touchscreens.
And some of them, like
this Lenovo job here,
can even be flipped around
into full tablet mode.
But the problem is, you still have
a keyboard attached to the back of it,
and I wanted to know what it was like
using Chrome OS without
a physical keyboard.
So, I picked up this little dude here.
It is the Acer Chromebook Tab 10.
It's a tablet called a Chromebook,
but, whatever, it's a tablet.
And I want to look at this,
and see what it's really like
to use Chrome OS without a keyboard.
Let's just talk about
the hardware real quick
to get it out of the way.
Now, this isn't totally fair,
'cause this is an education-only device.
You can't go to the store
and buy this, really.
And education devices tend
to be just a little bit
bulkier and sturdier than
regular consumer devices.
And that's totally the case here.
It's got this grippy plastic back,
and giant bezels for grabby,
little hands to hold on to.
And, yeah, it's pretty thick,
which is pretty standard
for education devices,
but it may also be a thing
for future Chrome OS tablets.
This is running pretty well
on an ARM OP1 processor,
but if anybody ever wants to put
an Intel processor into
one of these tablets,
that may require a bigger
battery or more heat dissipation.
We're going to have to wait and see.
The cameras, they're pretty terrible,
and the battery life is
basically just average.
But we're not really here
to look at this hardware.
We're here to look at
the Chrome OS software.
And honestly, that's where things
start to get a little bit messy.
The first thing you should know is that
there are three tracks that
you can run Chrome OS on.
There's Stable, Beta, and Developer.
Most people should run the Stable track,
because it is very, you, know, stable.
I tend to run on Beta,
which gives me access
to new features sooner,
but can be just a little bit buggy.
What we have here is a Developer build,
and you shouldn't run it.
You get access to the newest stuff
that's still in development,
but it's really buggy, it's pretty janky,
and it might even be a little less secure
than the other versions.
So, we're gonna look at it.
You shouldn't run it,
because, here be monsters.
One of the things you'll
notice on this build
is that Google is trying to figure out
what Chrome OS should look like,
and it looks a little bit different now.
It's some weird mix of
Android and Chrome OS.
When you open up the
system and you're down here
in the lower right, there's a bunch of
Android-looking buttons
next to regular Chrome tabs.
You are just as likely
to run into something
that looks like Android,
as you are something
that looks like Chrome.
But the two systems do
integrate pretty well now.
You can open up a tab by clicking
a link in an Android app,
and you can cut and paste between them,
and everything just sort of works.
Also, I don't know if you know this,
but Chrome OS can do split screen now.
When you go to the multitasking view,
you can take a window and
drag it over to one side,
and then open up an app on another side
and you've got a 50/50 view.
And then you can drag
this little pane over
and get a one third or a two thirds.
Now, if you go into portrait mode,
it only works top and
bottom, not left and right.
And also, I don't know, maybe
it's a glitch, maybe it's not,
but, check this out.
When you are in split screen
and you rotate it 180 degrees,
the sidebar goes over to the
other side of the tablet,
which I don't think is what anybody wants,
but there it is.
Maybe the most important thing on a tablet
is the typing experience,
and here, it's a bit of a slog.
Sure, you can swipe
just like you can on the Android keyboard,
but, when you only have
an on-screen keyboard,
you want perfect responsiveness, and this,
this isn't that.
Now, again, we're talking
about the developer build here.
So, we expected there to be bugs,
but I think what I'm seeing
here is a lot of good ideas,
and not a lot of great implementation yet,
because at the end of the day, I do think
switching from Android
to Chrome for tablets
is a really good idea.
The full Chrome web browser
is just so much better
than Chrome on Android
or Safari on the iPad.
It is just great to be able
to do full, real web things
on a tablet.
It's really clear that Google is still
working on developing this thing.
And, it's kind of cool that
we get to, I don't know,
watch the sausage get made,
or maybe eat the sausage
while it's getting made.
Let's just not worry about that metaphor.
The point is, I don't think
Google knows quite yet
what Chrome OS on a tablet
is supposed to look like.
And to be clear, that's
not Acer's problem,
it's Google's problem to fix.
I mean, honestly, the only
reason this tablet even exists
is that schools desperately wanted
a Chrome OS tablet option,
and so Acer went ahead
and made it for them.
And, for basic stuff, this is fine,
but it's super not ready
to be a daily driver.
I know this seems obvious,
but I'm gonna say it anyway.
Tablets are not like laptops.
Tablets should feel more like appliances.
You should be able to
sit back on the couch
and read, and watch Netflix,
and do whatever kind of stuff
it is you do on a tablet
without it feeling like you're
having to configure stuff.
On a laptop, configuring stuff is fine,
because you've got a keyboard
and a mouse to deal with it.
But, this thing still feels way too often
like it needs a keyboard and a mouse,
and to me that means that
Chrome OS isn't quite ready
to be a full-time tablet
operating system yet.
(mellow music)
I do still have hope that Chrome OS
is going to get the right tablets,
even if it does take a while,
because Google really does
seem committed to this path.
Maybe, someday in the future
we'll get some fancy, fuchsia OS hybrid
that makes Chrome OS tablets
as obsolete as Android tablets are now,
but that is a very long way off.
In the meantime, if you want
to get a Chrome OS device,
I suggest getting one with a keyboard.
Thanks so much for watching.
I wanna know, what do
you think Chrome OS needs
to be ready for tablets?
Let me know in the comments,
then once you do that,
go check out our friends at SB Nation.
They do this video series
called Weird Rules,
which is about weird rules in sports,
and even if you're not a sports person,
it's still like, fascinating,
and kind of hilarious.
You should check it out.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
