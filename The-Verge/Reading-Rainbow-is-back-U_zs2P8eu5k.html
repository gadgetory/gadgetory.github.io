project ever with over ninety three
thousand contributors and Counting but
you don't have to take my word for it
perhaps most generous is Family Guy
creator in Kosmos boosters Seth
MacFarlane who has pledged to match
every dollar raised after four million
up to 1 million in all so it's safe to
say levar burton is back what has he

my premiering in 1983 the award-winning
Reading Rainbow ran on PBS for over two
decades before its revival years later
as an iPad app in 2012 goodwill for the
Reading Rainbow reboot seems to be
peaking as the product reaches its
conclusion the other projects in
Kickstarter's top 5 most funded that's

all donated rewards from their own
campaign to give to reading rainbows

Reading Rainbow reaches 5 million
dollars which is now guaranteed to do so
