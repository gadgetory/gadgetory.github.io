we're looking at Asus Zenbook free which
is essentially the Windows version of
the 12-inch MacBook and that's pretty
much what soos is pretty much aiming
this app the really interesting part of
this is it's actually thinner and
lighter than the MacBook equivalent and
that's kind of what a suits have been
sort of saying for the last few months
when it originally announced its early
this year so what's changed from kind of
what they announced this year this is a
trackpad now has a fingerprint reader
actually sort built into it so you can
log in as Windows for those support so
you'll get you're logging into apps
logging into websites let's sort stuff
in terms of the actual chassis and the
design it's super light it's obviously
slightly lighter than the MacBook 12
inch and it's super thin it's only a ray
it's around about just less than 12 mil
so super thin and it's only got one USB
type-c port so just like the mat look
super squidgy keyboard kind of like the
MacBook as well and it's really hard to
like not look at this and just be like
this is the Windows equivalent of the
MacBook 12 inch it's got Intel's latest
their cable 8 processors which is
obviously a little bit more powerful
than the core M that's found in the
MacBook it's going to be available soon
we don't know the exact release date it
should be available for around about
$2,200 so that was a real quick look at
your suits in but free thanks for
watching and don't forget to subscribe
