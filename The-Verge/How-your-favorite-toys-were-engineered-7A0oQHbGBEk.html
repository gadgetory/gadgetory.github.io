your toys as a kid you'd squeeze them
and they'd make a funny noise it was
enough to put a big smile on your face
as simple as these toys might seem their
creation is actually a complicated blend
of arts and science of dreaming big and
then turning those dreams into reality
there are so many different parts to
tour design I think it's probably one of
the most complicated disciplines to
learn in the first semester they don't
actually really know what a toy is Judy
Ellis is the founder and head of the
Fashion Institute of Technology's toy
design program it was the first program
of its kind in the US when I was founded
over 25 years ago its alumni probably
had some material impact on your
childhood many graduates have gone on to
win the coveted tuyo of the Year award
or toady some of these pieces were
actually made in the model making shot
like that piece on the top these are
products that are on the market or war
on the market and they're all designed
by aldo night how would you biggest
define a toy a vehicle that's going to
take that child on some kind of
wonderful adventure the moment that you
realize that your toy has to enhance out
of the way they learn to touch or hold
or speak or interact with people that's
when you have a toy and the best toys no
matter what they are in the real world
or just a representation of something
much bigger this is Raul he's a frog
he's really only about this big but he
thinks that he is the most important
thing in the world and it takes him a
long time to learn to be humble I came
here thinking I was going to win every
event and now I'm going home
empty-handed roll gets on stage and says
to the crowd I don't have a talent like
my Brazilian friend mill but i can do
what i can do is whistle the crowd is on
its feet cheering and clapping none of
them expected such a beautiful song or
for it to be so loud and clear and come
from such a little frog
this sort of original world building
feels less common these days games and
toys seem to be dominated by franchises
featuring your favorite superheroes or
TV characters which is to say of course
licensing one of the big changes that
I've seen is that there was in the
beginning what we called standalone
product that meant that you didn't have
to have a movie behind you you could
just have something that was great for a
child to play with when this country
started to experience some economic
issues licensing became much more
prominent most toys that everyone runs
to the store to have to have your
running because your child's has seen it
there's a movie there's of this that
doesn't have a lot to do with what makes
a toys success that will have a lot to
do with what makes you run to get that
toy Cardinal Industries is a family
owned business that's been making games
and toys for about 70 years even if you
don't know Cardinals name chances are
you've seen their work they make games
for minions Marvel Disney and even less
common tions like Wikipedia and the ABC
drama scandal for something like scandal
I actually sat down with shonda rhimes
so that was actually a really a
collaborative effort we worked
specifically with her and her team to
bring a game to life that she would want
to see on the shelves we made some
tweaks along the way to make sure
gameplay worked but classic play
patterns never go away and no matter how
old you are or how young there's
something very comfortable about classic
play patterns you know it's kind of like
how even trends happen with TV shows or
movies you know what's old is new again
right now I know dominoes are surging
again a few years ago mahjong had a
really big resurgent it comes in waves
it can work in Reverse two games can be
turned into brands themselves any game
with a hint of a larger world attached
to it can be grown into an ecosystem of
products
if you enjoy angry birds for example you
might enjoy having new ways of getting
those characters or the imagery you can
do that by extending that out into other
products and mediums a newer
increasingly popular trend is finding
ways to blend the digital and physical
world think Skylanders Nintendo's amoeba
characters and Disney infinity you're
calling a twist to life they're taking
the physical toy and having it be able
to interact with the screen the world
the story can be much larger and yes
kids definitely want that but if you
give your child everything that they
want that has to do with technology only
you're not going to develop the skills
to handle the challenges or where this
world is going we have a very big
responsibility to still hold on to
things that are real if we don't I'm
will lose the one thing that makes us
really special with our humanity being
human is about making connections
between person and person between person
and idea and if you spin even five
minutes talking as that gauge the
artisan designer perhaps best known for
iOS games like spell tower you start to
think about games interaction these
philosophical terms one of the things
that's weird about making interactive
art is you're always designing an
experience for people that they've never
had anything like before you have to
think a lot about like what is it going
to be like when someone walks up to this
piece how will they learn people are so
complex and interesting that often you
can design mechanics that don't actually
work but when you add a human being into
it it becomes functional in a way that
it wasn't functional as a pure system
cards against humanity does a similar
kind of thing like relies on this like
human element
I think my litany of toys and games
growing up was kind of the standard set
I played parcheesi and mouse trap and
monopoly a lot of bad board games what
made them bad games to you well I mean
the canonical example is monopoly it
sets up an experience where somebody is
going to have a miserable time and then
makes that experience as long as humanly
possible mousetrap is like all glitz and
no content but now you've got
carcassonne a you got slopes catan got
these European games he's dreaming if
you're talking about kind of coming over
why why do you think these games do
better now one mobile phones happened
and created such a phenomenal shift
everybody plays games now when you have
like groups of young people who want to
get together and want to do something
they can't play multiplayer games on
their console because those games barely
exists outside of Nintendo and
everybody's primed play a game so they
want to play a game and what do you do
will you go play Settlers of Catan which
is just magically shown up at the right
time we're right smack in the middle of
the Golden Age of board games
Kickstarter's on board games they're
going crazy every couple of months some
new board game comes out that I'm really
excited about playing you know
everything is exploding outwards in
every direction right now we never lose
the need to play to create new worlds
and assume new identities games and toys
allow us to escape and connect with one
another in a visceral way even as our
lives are filled with more and more
screens the need to play still thrives
and now more than ever we have so many
amazing options for bringing out our
inner child
