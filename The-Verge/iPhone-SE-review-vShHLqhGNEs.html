newest iPhone although it's not
necessarily the company's best new
iPhone on the one hand it's a really
tiny phone that has almost all of the
features of the flagship iPhone 6s on
the other hand it's basically a very
improved iPhone 5s which came out in
2013 so you would think maybe in three
years these technological advancements
might happen anyway so how good is the
iPhone se and who is it for
I'll answer that last question first the
iPhone se is probably not for someone
who already has a large phone and liked
it over the past few days I have found
that it feels pretty weird to go back to
a smaller smartphone after using big
screen phones or even using a normal
sized 4.7 ish phone like the iPhone 6s
the iPhone se is really for people who
want to stick with that smaller 4-inch
display size it's also the least
expensive iPhone that Apple has ever
sold at least in terms of starting price
which is $399 for a 16 gigabyte phone
that makes it a good first smartphone
for a lot of people or nez upgrade for
iPhone 4s or 5s holdouts of course that
cost is still relative because $400 or
$500 for a phone is still a lot for a
lot of people and it's still not as
cheapest comparable Android phones but
it's not as expensive as say $700 iPhone
so if you ever had an iPhone 5s or
you've at least seen one of those the
iPhone se is going to look pretty
familiar because it is essentially the
same smartphone on the outside it has
the same boxy body and chamfered edges
the buttons are all in the same place
and of course there's the 4-inch Retina
display personally I used to really like
the way that the smooth aluminum iPhone
5s felt in the hand
and also the fact that it fit in my hand
and the iPhone se feels exactly the same
but it's what's inside the iPhone se
that's really supposed to make it better
it has most of the same parts as the
success but crammed into this tiny body
the biggest improvement is in its
processing power the iPhone 5s ran on
Apple's a7 chip and had one gigabyte of
RAM the iPhone se runs on Apple's faster
a nine processor the same chip powering
the 6s and 6s plus Apple hasn't said how
much RAM the new phone has but based on
my experience so far the se feels super
speedy the more efficient processor also
impacts battery life and in a good way
even though they're the exact same size
the iPhone se gets better battery life
than the older iPhone 5s it really takes
a few weeks to get to know an iPhone's
battery but in the few days I've been
testing this it has gotten me through a
full day the camera is also a lot better
than the camera on an older iPhone it
focuses more quickly 12 megapixel rear
camera sensor matches the rear camera
and the iPhone 6s and the front-facing
camera has a retina flash for selfies
the iPhone se actually captures 4k video
and now there's Apple pay the iPhone 5s
had touch ID Apple's authentication
system but it actually did not have
Apple pay now the iPhone se does so you
can use this phone to quickly pay for
things that stores that accept Apple pay
or you know on the flip side hold up the
line of places where you're not sure
Apple pay works but you sure hope it
does okay so real talk the iPhone se is
not a huge leap forward it's not a tiny
little engine of technological
advancement it's today's tech in
yesterday's phone body and it's
primarily a business move on the part of
Apple how can we get people upgrading to
iPhones and not buying $300 or less
Android smartphones
close the thinking and in truth it's
probably pretty smart thinking because
even though the iPhone se doesn't have
all the features of the flagship iPhone
6s it has made improvements where it
matters all of this coupled with the new
software for newer iPhone
makes the iPhone se kind of a no-brainer
for people who are looking for an
upgrade or you know for people with
really small hands</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
