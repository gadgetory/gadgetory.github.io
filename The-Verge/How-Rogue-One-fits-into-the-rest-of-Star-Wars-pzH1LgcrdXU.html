and Counting
but rogue one isn't part of that it's a
standalone so where and how does it fit
in a New Hope's famous opening crawl
alludes to a prequel that's only now
nearly 40 years later been adapted to
film rogue one is this prequel to
Episode four a new hope I understand
maybe you're a little confused here's
what you need to know rogue one takes
place between the two star wars movie
trilogy so that's after Anakin Skywalker
becomes Darth Vader but before Luke
Skywalker and company blow up the Death
Star it's like a heist film crossed with
a war movie remember the beginning of
the original a new help Princess Leia
needs r2d2 to get the Death Star's
blueprints to the Rebel Alliance so they
can do this road one is about the
original ragtag group tasked with
stealing those plans from the Empire in
the first place so we have this many
people against the Empire it's basically
a suicide mission
when the movie starts the Empire has
already taken control the galaxy the
Rebel Alliance is just forming it's the
Empire's scrappy underdog adversary that
scene in the trailer with the a dots on
a beach that's the Battle of scarus but
we won't spoil the plot the hero of
rogue one is jyn erso
she's accompanied by Cassie and and or
in this hacked Imperial droid that's
kind of a jerk
thanks but Jim's not a Jedi she's just
someone who causes a lot of trouble and
here's perhaps the most unusual thing
about rogue one it won't get a sequel
along with the Skywalker movies we've
been watching for years
Disney is releasing standalone films
that's why rogue one is called a Star
Wars story and Star Wars stories can be
about anything at all so Disney can keep
making them forever
so enjoy rogue one this may be your only
chance to see these characters on the
silver screen up next in the Star Wars
spin-offs is something a little more
familiar the origin story of Han Solo
starring that dude from Hail Caesar is
Han in dollar Glover as Lando Calrissian
because Star Wars never end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
