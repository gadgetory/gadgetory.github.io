the verge mobile show this is episode 41
which means that we're over the hill
it's the week of April first but there
are no stupid jokes here hi I'm dieter
bohn i'm vanessa and i'm dan seifert and
we are sadly without chris sigler he is
on assignment it's a very important
assignment it might be the most
important reporting he's ever done in
his entire life but luckily for us we we
have somebody else filling in for him we
have Walter White Oh seriously lied you
look awesome you can just go any
Heisenberg that's why I isn't perfect
you need the Hat oh my god you need to
get the Hat that would be amazing
somebody needs to buy for me how to pick
the serve him in the UK in the UK will
have bowler hats and you know anyway now
I mean this was this was actually very
intentional i didn't have Walter White
in mind I did have gianluca vialli his
famous for my Italian footballer in mind
and I was like if my hair is this short
and I haven't shaved in this long I need
to do this at least once yeah totally
worth it I'm incredibly jealous I
meanwhile I'll haven't had a haircut in
six years and it's pretty bad oh sheesh
yeah so okay we missed last week and for
that we are deeply sorry and the level
of angst in the comments on our sorry we
can't podcast post was pretty high but
doesn't mean we don't like you guys it
just means you know we were busy I would
you know yeah I'm short-staffed out here
Vlad was away and you know we could have
done just a mobile show just Dan
standing there just standing there
smiling not actually say no guys I mean
I'll tell you I'll give you a breakdown
of what I did last week so you know how
committed I was I had to play Tomb
Raider I had to play bioshock infinite I
had to play xcom enemy unknown which has
been out for a while but honestly are
still having crank that gains amazingly
hot actually what else was that it was
loads of clothes done having nothing
absolutely no chance podcast we'll make
up for it today right first of all
yesterday basically killed the news
cycle hey nobody bothered to announce or
do anything important yesterday because
everybody was way too busy making the
worst jokes in the world google had
something like two months worth of work
invested in speaking things yesterday
and yeah yeah there was like more jokes
from google than you could count on one
hand which is just mean that's the way
right um yes but it wasn't always there
way because they launched gmail on april
first 2004 and it was no joke yeah i
spent so there that there was one piece
of news yesterday that started out
looking like baby was an April Fool's
what turned out not to be in that time
Charlie hindle uh who used to be product
manager of Microsoft for Windows Phone
we do so he's a Windows Phone evangelist
or something now he had a bigger title
than that he's a he's a great guy we've
met him anyway he is going to work for
Amazon on a secret project it probably
starts with p h and ends with any social
work and phonemes for them I'm not semi
shoot so close um not so that that
happened but other than that I mean you
know actually the funny thing is April
first is my mother's birthday so I
didn't learn about April Fool's until
later and I didn't understand why all
these people you know were being mean to
my mom it was very strange to me i don't
know i wish i had a punchline for that
joke but that second is just put it in
CT at the same time you do have german
heritage so there would have been a
little strange things in your youth and
chavez ticket is a german bread kid
growing up in Minnesota well by my
father's birthday is on Halloween so I
just thought that like everybody had
birthdays on holidays Oh work yeah I
wondered why I didn't it was very sorry
it's bringing back to charm kindle first
of all I love this and I'm sure
everybody else does his name is kim
boo-ki and
l and he is about to work for a company
that produces the kindle which I don't
need to spell but it's very close so
it's mr. kindle working for the kindle
maker which is not at all confusing
that's the first thing but same thing is
he's phrasing his wording is very nice
because it says that he's working on
something totally new for Amazon ah so
so I mean yes everybody every evangelist
like we're saying is going to tell you
what we're working on is totally new its
revolutionary it's gonna be kick ass etc
but something new for Amazon is a very
sort of phrasing I mean think about all
the things that was on already does
there aren't that many things which are
totally need for that company yeah video
game production might be a random thing
that is new and might be done by amazon
me okay he's not going to do that but
but yeah every does look it really does
look like the Amazon phone and shaping
up in child Kindles gonna be part of
pushing that well I mean that's the
obvious speculation we could be way off
base here but we've been expecting
amazon to properly fork Android and do a
pro phone rather they've already done it
for the kindle obviously and actually I
archives and what we've written about
junk in doin he already had come in
saying goo his lost in 12 Android yeah
so he's already of the mindset let's say
that Android can be split up can be
folks successfully and Google is it
isn't the one who's going to control his
future and other companies can have that
position you can kind of meshes with
what amazon would be intending to do
well okay let's um let's just jump ahead
of the agency want to talk about
Facebook because they also are a company
everybody's been assuming is going to
have a phone and this thursday two days
from the day we're recording this will
finally find out what exactly they have
planned and it looks like what's going
to happen is they're going to do
something called facebook home which is
going to be basically home screen
replacements like an like a launcher in
addition to you know presumably deep
ties into other bits and bobs and then
alongside that
we're expecting that HTC will probably
have a mid-range phone that it'll launch
on but that it'll still be available to
other phones when the thing got
announced a whole bunch of you know New
York Times Wall Street Journal came out
with you know whatever rumors they have
and then android police got a hold of
the actual APK the file that runs this
app and did a teardown of it and I think
we learned a few things it has hooks in
there for both talking to HTC Sense and
TouchWiz in addition to standard Android
so it should work on a whole bunch of
different phones you know it's called
Facebook home however at least there's a
Facebook home logo in there they've got
a little button to launch you know the
app the app chooser what else did we see
just a bunch of stuff so basically like
we've been hearing for years mark
zuckerberg say Facebook isn't going to
build a phone and it looks like he
hasn't been lying I mean what do you
think is going to happen to people go to
see this HTC phone its kind of mid-range
it's kind of not that exciting alike oh
the facebook phone sucks just like the
cha-cha-cha sucked and whatever the cha
cha cha's sister phone was ah-cha cha
had not the status the touchscreen one
it was terrible yeah yeah whatever that
was called but I think there's there's
been a lot that's been said salsa salsa
thank you actually I'm sorry to break
away but my cousin sorry you're not
sorry my cousin had one of those two
phones and he had an incredibly low
amount of RAM the chacha yeah you could
help you could fill out the apps on the
I I had reviewed the status way back
when when it was on ATT and it was like
six apps and you'd fill the other thing
and you're done but but you know what's
funny even though those were essentially
themed his facebook phones like that
who's been saying they don't seem
perceived as Android phones like my
cousin for Android sucked right and and
well that might be as mad as a diss Huck
yeah well I'm sure they saw the good
thing about me is that I managed to
avoid using both of them for longer to
like seconds but that might very well be
the reason why the mark zuckerberg
so reluctant to have anything called
facebook phone hello I don't know that
it dissipates Facebook's chance to get
into marketers there's going to be in
these mid-range low-end devices not is
like a leading platform because Facebook
doesn't have anything to contribute on
that front side of it well I just know
that there's been a lot that's been said
this past week since facebook's
announcement of who really wants a
facebook phone or who really needs a
facebook phone and i think the audience
of people who are into technology and
are into having the latest and greatest
phones are not the market that's going
to be like oh my god a facebook phone
but you know when the average customer
comes into the phone store and you know
they're like well what do you want to do
with your phone it's like well
everybody's on facebook with their phone
so i want to be on facebook with my
phone and then there's this phone that
is all Facebook through and through you
can access your facebook Messenger you
can access your facebook camera and
photos you know really quickly and
easily and everything looks like it's
faceboook i can see that totally being a
peeing thing for for someone who doesn't
care too much about the specs they're
not going to spend three hundred dollars
plus sign a two-year contract with their
new phone they're going to get like a
fifty dollar or $75 phone or whatever i
think it totally makes sense for that
type of market and the fact that it's a
mid-range phone it looks like it's
running an older version of sense HTC
probably hasn't put a whole lot of
resources into putting making this a
cutting edge device I don't know if that
matters so much for what the type of
market that might be interested in this
thing that's angry that's really good I
think I think what we've come to
conclude with the south and cha-cha-cha
experience a triple jar in Spain to
avoid cursing what was that like HTC and
Facebook because Facebook was part of it
they can't too many corners with the
specs right yes we don't care about the
specs but we do care to the point where
people like our cousins want to be able
to install some apps like she literally
had to disable things like Skype or
whatever in order to keep using her
phone
right but I mean is that crazy that this
was also two years ago too so like an
entry to mid-level android phone today
has got to do a core processor it's got
you know a gig of ram or more it's got
16 gigabytes of internal storage I mean
yeah today's mid-range and entry-level
phones are way more capable than they
were two years ago and I don't think
that's as much of an issue as it was
with this status in the cha-cha right so
you could take something like the one sv
for example right because in wvga screen
it's kind of a morrow mid-ranger and
essentially just adapt and just slept
the facebook stuff on top of it so i let
this discussion by asking you guys are
people going to focus on the phone
instead of on facebook's you know
software and offering it across all of
android and like you know what it means
for facebook and what people actually
want it on whatever phone they've
already got and you pretty much answered
my question by completely ignoring and
just talking about phones like I I don't
want to get too far into my thoughts and
feelings of this because I want to
actually write it and publish it on the
site but i will say that imagine you
pick up you've got an android phone and
it kind of your kind of like yeah
there's this kind of sucks touch so it's
kind of lame I kind of like it but
you're a regular consumer who never
would have been a million years
considered routing or even installing
nova launcher or apex or whatever but
you hear that hey there I've got I've
got this facebook app and I know that it
does about two random stuff and I'm it's
a little bit too nerdy for me and I
can't figure out how to use it for free
voice calling and free messaging but I
know that if I like click the button
that's going to be shown to be all the
time on the facebook app itself hey you
like the Facebook app make your whole
phone a facebook phone I'm gonna
ventually do it and they're gonna
convince me that I get free calling and
I get you know all those other benefits
and like they they they could become a
big part of the market on top of Android
now it's interesting is the part of this
leak was that all the Google stuff
appears to still be there so it's not
they're not pulling an Amazon and just
completely for getting away from Android
it's still going to have google
stuff built into their because that's
the way stuff is built in on phones
already but I mean I look at this from
Facebook's position it could try and
make a phone based off a fork version of
Android and have every story for the
next three years be why can't Facebook
get more than two percent or five
percent or ten percent at the max market
share why are they getting pantsed by
windows phone and blackberry you could
either have stories about getting beat
by blackberry and Windows Phone or you
could have stories about how you're
secretly taking over the entire Android
ecosystem and like nobody sees it I mean
that's an easy answer they're already
trying to do it with the app ecosystem I
wrote this report a few months ago and
they're just like Facebook would rather
be the connective tissue that underlies
the internet then it would try to take
on Apple for Hardware profits but yeah
that's a given um nette name point it's
a given then why are we talking about
the mid-range specs on some random HTC
phone this is a much bigger game well
because that because I mean look you
can't view this just because it has
branding now facebook home you can't
view this is like this brand new thing
they're breaking with your tradition a
facebook you've been trying this for a
long we tough right it had those HTC
phones you had a couple of ink phones
yeah like in cloud many things that was
running really nice pretty handy phones
if you want a thoroughly integrated
Facebook experience they had those but
but once again exactly like the HTC
phones they had insufficient specs to
really compare people like it was just
below the threshold where people feel
comfortable using the phone and didn't
feel any deficiencies it had
deficiencies and that has been
Facebook's mistake so far it's getting
itself investigating his brand invested
its phones which just weren't good
enough so but as Dan says now the
hardware is so good that you pretty much
have to screw something up on top of it
to make it efficient so let's not get up
that's the top of the let out yeah I'm
not ruling it out a tour I've seen sense
okay I know
and um but but they're being the case
facebook as much better opportunity to
make it as previously to have the basic
hardware stuff and then to layer up some
compelling stuff on top what I was going
to point out was however first of all
when you get excited dita your whole
webcam shakes and you be in San
Francisco it's a little bit disturbing
because I this is what happens over
there back every two words yeah exactly
ah jelly jelly vision DITA um and
finally to actually try to press your
question which clearly is a big passion
I'll software I mean I personally really
like this idea of a branded facebook
follow ya guys Facebook already has a
home on its web interface it's a
paradigm the people familiar with so the
idea of a facebook home screen which is
very likely i guess to include a bunch
of widgets for like new strains and junk
like that i don't expect to be really
revolutionary in terms of you I
innovation I hope it's not I mean I hope
to keep it relatively simple as long as
it looks better than the Facebook
widgets that they've offered before
right right so I mean functionality is
always the most fun right i mean i'm
imagining something like like blinkfeed
i guess like you've got your new stream
you got your apps and then you've got
like your messaging I don't know I've no
idea i mean i can't really envision it
being useful to me but then I don't find
Facebook itself useful to myself so much
exactly its target audience but like to
say I can't find the idea of facebook
home okk poem that make sense to me is a
starting position centroids a whole
thing it's where i go back to and it's
key to my mobile experience this is a
big Facebook user yeah i can i can get
with that yeah that's all idea is very
accessible to people it might be so I
mean one of the ways that I think about
this is people like oh facebook trying
to take over phones I mean one they get
to go on like top shelf hardware if they
want to because they're just going to
offer the app presumably to
people are thinking of it as you know oh
it's Facebook vs samsung Facebook vs
Apple Facebook versus you know whatever
phone manufacturer you want I actually
think that this is just as much about
Facebook versus Twitter as it is about
Facebook versus these phone companies
because right now on your phone Facebook
and Twitter are basically equal citizens
I can't hear what you guys are saying
back to me so I'm just going to keep
talking haha you got an icon for
facebook you've got an icon for Twitter
you might have some widgets for but you
basically get to choose but if Facebook
can take over the home screen then it
becomes the first class citizen on your
phone and you're much less likely if
you've got 30 seconds to jump into
Twitter because you've got facebook
right there and so this is a this is I
think just as much about making sure
that they take on Twitter in the mobile
space as it is about them trying to beat
Apple I mean it's not about that and in
a Google puss that is something i can
write yeah yeah exactly taken off but he
has amazingly deep integration into the
latest versions of android like Google
and it's got one of the best looking
apps on iOS but ironically yeah goo is
forcing plus a new at every opportunity
that it gets everywhere everywhere it
goes is like google plus it's you're not
talking your google plus talking you
having a Google+ Hangout etc yeah like
every chance that it can hook into
google glass and get android users to be
aware of google plus and then to become
users of it it's doing it so absolutely
azita says faithful versus twitter
facebook home is a step ahead of twitter
but it's actually the step behind
google+ so facebook is simultaneously
catching up and trying to get ahead
right only one of his competitors
matters and get a one doesn't yet but
yeah any thoughts that yeah sorry i'm
looking at something else dan can jump
in i I agree I'm sorry I'm like totally
under the weather today so I apologize
but no I'm
I'm with you blood uh I don't have
anything creative to say he's not a
Facebook user that's it I mean I I do
use Facebook actually and I find that
you know from my own personal needs I
connect with my family a lot on Facebook
that haven't be all over the country and
they all have to be on facebook so
that's where we go to catch up with
cousins and whatnot um I don't use it
all that often on my phone though so it
would be interesting to see if this new
software or a new device encourages me
to use it more on my phone you know
Facebook like day before yesterday just
like put out a study that they had
commissioned from IDC about how people
use facebook on their phone and like I
think that that is not a coinkydink they
put on the twenty-seventh and it was
like you know such-and-such percent of
people use Facebook every day and such
and such percent you know post photos
and yadda yadda yadda so I mean I really
think that uh we underestimate how much
people would be interested in replacing
their crappy touch with skin on their
galaxy s2 that they're still using with
the Facebook skin be like oh well I can
just act like this is new phone I think
that it could potentially be really huge
and anecdotally my wife almost
exclusively uses facebook on her phone
like she she never uses it on the
desktop she's always using her phone to
check on facebook and things like that
so there's definitely a lot of people
that it's it's already a purely mobile
experience for them and then uh Facebook
exclaims or IDC claims that Facebook is
the number third most used app on a
smartphone at seventy percent behind
email and web browsing accordingly this
study yeah yeah you being consistent for
a while the facebook app is being one of
the top uses of phones in general with
phone calls progressively going further
and further down the list until they
just disappeared yeah which is a lot
which is the way it ought to be hello I
kind of say I like phone calls lately hi
man I know I know it's not cool to like
getting on the phone but you know what's
faster than having a five minute chat
conversation having a one minute voice
conversation such a I can do with a
hangout or skype well yeah you know you
know it's funny um the fitnah think we'd
skype include it to a great extent is
that people are now using them almost
meanness terms almost at the same level
as Google yeah thank the BBC I mean I
mentioned it before the BBC which tends
to not promote any I mean though it does
no advertising most channels and steamy
channels Tenzin also promotes any brands
it automatically identifies newsreaders
Twitter account and people say you can
get in touch with us Twitter Facebook
email etc the thing with skype was i
watched a news broadcast on channel 4
here in the UK and i was saying we spoke
earlier over the internet or always kind
like skype is a different thing from the
internet you know it would be struck me
that uh oh skype not over the internet I
get in that ya SE and it just kind of
become this kind of a common language
terminology now the way people say
google it instead of search for it on
the internet which is neither here nor
there but i thought mention it well I
mean but I mean facebook wants to get in
that game right cuz you can make calls
with facebook now you come here VoIP
calls with facebook does it have have
either of you of it actually use that
like for a minute I guess what have oh
yeah okay goodbye like if that's what
I've done I don't even know is that
that's available well funs over IP I
guess it's not yeah it's not worldwide
it's it's US canada new cloud I know it
did longer yeah yeah it's just I don't
think I don't think Facebook has at
least to this point made that a very
visible feature like I think right but
the vast majority of the people that
even even know about the facebook
Messenger app that's apart from the main
facebook app know that the messenger app
can make and receive phone calls through
it yeah but I mean tell me there
kind of push that Oh totally yeah i mean
that's that's their their angle yeah i
guess um well anyway we'll find out on
thursday oh sorry yeah it was gonna say
we should move on because we're going to
be discussing this facebook home
scenario the rest of our lives every day
all we do is talk about facebook home we
finally got release dates and prices for
the HTC One on sprint and AT&amp;amp;T and uh
close enough for t-mobile and 1 99 99 on
contract or on tmobile on for unfair
contract for a 32 gigabyte version at
that so I'm a pretty pretty aggressive
pricing to come in at the two hundred
dollar level on contract for a 32
gigabyte model and then att's got the
lock on the 64 gigabyte one for a
hundred bucks more so it looks like from
what we've been able to tell that their
undercutting the galaxy s4 which we
learned also this past week that that's
coming out on ATT for 249 to start but
we don't know what capacity that model
is yet but either way when you walk into
store you'll see the one listed at a
lower price um I mean I Gandhi do you
care about capacity I mean 16 yeah
that's a little bit short but like maybe
our user definitely does i think someone
to do it how are you guys are does he
cares even less because they're they're
streaming all their music I don't know
man cap today the plans I'm I'm
constantly filling up the storage on my
Nexus 4 and I have the 16 gigabyte lan
all right and you know as soon as you
get on a plane and you like one load up
some TV shows and then boom you hit your
limit or you load up a couple hours of
music and boom you're at your limit
because you don't have data access or uh
you know your your don't want to use up
your 4 gigabyte data cap and then I'm
sorry it's just worse than a photo
program I have 16 gigabytes and a conf
it enough music I'm just saying it's a
zero world problem the the power users
that are right i Gaga about the HTC One
like to have more storage but how do you
how do you append ordinals or whatever
to do imaginary numbers like I say first
second third for
I guess you'd say zero with but what
about I do you add a th at the end of it
and rd and st iced I mean we can say the
nth degree so and yeah I i I'd sounds
but yeah yeah just imagine you're saying
eyes and you have a lisp it's done so
the other part the other half of the
story is that the one is indeed actually
looking to be hitting shelves before the
galaxy s4 rise yeah by like what two
wheels three weeks to maybe yeah it's
kind of a bummer for HTC that they
couldn't get together and get it out a
month ago so what is not going to be in
the US it's going to be in stores on
sprint and AT&amp;amp;T shells on April
nineteenth and coming soon to t mobile
tmobile has not announced a date yet
yeah and we're still in this weird
nether zone where we think it's the
rumors from Yuna Frieda at all things D
she's like no it's coming to verizon and
HTC denied it on Twitter and then
deleted their denial and so we know the
rumors about the DNA plus the more
recently so I mean who knows he's gonna
be called the drone every code that
would be HTC grown coming to verizon
yeah I like it no I know in essence it's
tourniquet quick mention that 18 te
announced its going to rolling out HD
Voice which yeah they actually had our
mention that at CES and then they just
confirmed it a tad what will be ah so
you know fine I I mean then then told me
this morning that it's old and used but
I'm still excited in so far as I thought
you hated phone calls didn't we just
have this conversation no you said you
hated phone calls but ATT is a big
carrier and when they can push things
like this and I like HD voice like every
time I've seen and used it every time
seen on the phone and use that I've
enjoyed it and I like the idea of
getting the benefit of having a good
solid connection you know when actually
making clothes uh yeah I mean
so this has been around in the UK for
quite some time and sprint has had it in
a very limited fashion here in the US
but I highly doubt there's any real a
large number of Americans who've ever
actually used but it's just it's just as
limited in the UK i have to mention oh
is that really yeah i do know that since
we're on the threat of HD voice maybe we
can transition here a tmobile had quite
a few announcements and one of them was
that it would be carrying the iphone and
the iphone that it carries will indeed
actually support HD poised just as it
does in other parts of the world outside
of the US um so that's how you want to
lean into adam keys but that means new
t-mobile will be supporting HD Voice s
implication right then yeah well
t-mobile supporting HD voice on on the
eyes like it's like the worst transition
I know oh it did it yes Lana TZ doesn't
make living into talking about Pearl
Harbor by talking about specs on a zero
zengin it's like did you know that
Melissa the important point is that
they're gonna have HD voice when the
iphone launches and they get some other
things too i don't really know at all
they get some other little things
whatever man look the point the point is
this it doesn't it doesn't matter how we
transition to the tmobile discussion
like I just you know got a bit more
comfortable in my seat I wish I had
popcorn which I wouldn't eat but at
least you know just a certain see
because I really want to hear about this
this has been such a crazy crazy thing I
need something awesome about it so full
disclosure we are going to swear it's
going to happen so if your ears if your
children's ears or delicate can't handle
it uh t-mobile's John Legere score so we
are too he is a dynamic CEO he's crazy
bounces around and like he got on stage
and cursed like three times before he
got to like the main thing he wanted to
say which is I think fisheries dynamic
definitely uh so yeah he's like is this
thing's stop the he wants to be
the uncarrier and he like ripped into
the other big four here again to sprint
and t-mobile and Verizon most optimal
ATT and Verizon most of
all and unveiled these crazy new plans
that we had seen before and so they you
know we're basically what we expected
and it's it's like I mean I was like
immediately like yes I'm with you let's
storm the castle yay and then you know
I'm down off of that high and I'm not as
sure that I mean I'm not switching to
t-mobile because I can't because the
signal isn't good enough where I live
yet but I might so basically the idea is
no more contracts but you do sign like a
contract for the phone that you buy and
so you can still get a subsidized price
but once you're done paying that subsidy
you don't have pain anymore and then
it's not built into the cost your plan
in theory which is great and then if you
want to upgrade more often they're
toying with the idea of being able to
turn your phone in and they'll pay you a
fair market price for it for the rest of
the money that you owe for it which
which is guaranteed to be less than what
you expect it to be well I mean will be
yeah then you would be able to upgrade
to a different phone right away so if
you already have a phone like it's cheap
right if you're not paying a phone
hardware subsidy for the vast majority
of people even people that need to do a
lot of heavy tethering which sounds
really dirty even people that need to do
heavy tethering it's cheaper and that's
awesome but if you want to be buying a
phone every year that means you're gonna
be paying the phone non subsidy subsidy
thinger and it kind of ends up being
complicated about whether the other
carriers have essentially gotten rid of
that every phone every year upgrade from
your phones i know verizon got rid of it
eighteen t got rid of it and sprint
cover doing so now you're the other
carriers you're in a minimum of 20
months before you get a discounted price
on your new phone so if you wanted to
upgrade every 12 months with say 80
you're going to be spending you know
full price for that phone in 12 months
if you you know decide to upgrade early
so I don't know how much different the
t-mobile thing is from there the only
thing that I can think of that's
different is that uh the when you cancel
your plan with say AT&amp;amp;T and you have
your $300 ETF or whatever
if you bought a hundred-dollar iphone
and you put it with a
three-hundred-dollar etf you're out like
four hundred dollars in the phone is
yours right whereas with tmobile you're
going to be spending five or six hundred
dollars regardless whenever it turns out
to be because there is no ETF you're
just paying the full price of the phone
so if you are looking at it from that
route it might be a little more
expensive for you I think that's kind of
an edge case scenario that not a lot of
people are going to encounter but maybe
an early upgrade ER or someone who
upgrades frequently or jumps carriers
frequently might be in that situation
well for me the the best thing is just
the issue of fairness that if I'm if I
have paid a phone off I shouldn't be
paying for a subsidy on that phone built
into my data plan they should be
separate things and that's awesome
that's how it ought to be and so I
really hope that they get enough
popularity where every carrier feels
compelled to switch that kind of model
but wait let me just check dance numbers
because that doesn't seem to make sense
to me is the ETF with it let's assume
I'm looking at an AT&amp;amp;T contract now and
we're just looking at that iphone that
you mentioned we're not from a cost of a
hundred dollars being with the ETF
really be three hundred dollars I mean
your people rated it usually starts at
three hundred it starts at like 325 I
think it goes down by 10 or 15 bucks
every month that you stay in your
contract so like five months or six
months down the line it's going to be
under three hundred dollars but when
you're you're paying it out well because
here in the UK a lot of the time I think
carries just make you pay a few contract
like you say I want to leave my contract
early and they say that's fine with us
just pay us everything you owe us in
terms of market feats and then they
actually stuck up the monthly fees you
get a pretty large number yeah it's not
it's not broken doubt like that in the
US it's like they have a flat fee system
and then as you stay within your
contract for a period of time it goes
down every month that you stay in your
contract I mean that yes Ben yeah I
guess it's it's actually advisable to
you I mean the mat the mathematics of
this doesn't make sense me because then
people would just buy up the phone for
like four hundred dollars paid including
pain of DTF early and I'm going nothing
using phone
right I'm glad no no that's because you
can go elsewhere in the UK and he was 99
percent of the time your networks are
compatible so are you gonna go oh that's
actually one of the things that's
awesome that's changing is starting next
month the iphones that are sold in AT&amp;amp;T
will be banned compatible with t-mobile
right now they're kind of not they are
little but it's complicated just like
this pricing crap but they'll actually
be for the first time since edge was the
hottest fastest network around actual
genuine ability to bounce between two
carriers in the US without having to
switch phones like we haven't had that
since like what when was at like
2005-2006 yeah I mean so that's that's
with the iphone 5 though and that's
really only with the iphone 5 that is
the only LTE phone that i could think of
that actually ya know but I'm snack pack
karam term there they're both of both
t-mobile is working hard I think to
build out a network that it feels is
largely compatible sprint and like I'm
sorry with 18t and i think that like
we're gonna see in a couple of years the
ability to switch between these two
networks pretty seamlessly if you're not
on a contract and like it's like it's
been like not i don't know how long when
one like a decade eight years a long
time and that's another reason why this
is potentially exciting is like we're
finally moving to a place where maybe
we'll have a little bit less insane lock
in based on you know your bands and
maybe look a little bit more like Europe
like I'm I'm not interested in do I save
50 bucks or a hundred bucks over the
course of two years if I pick this
subsidy model or that subsidy model or
if I buy my phone early how much does my
ETF and what's the prorated la like I
don't care about any of that like it's a
few hundred dollars over the course of a
couple years most people are too stupid
or don't pay enough attention and I
count myself in this group to like think
through my savings over two years I just
get the phone I want right now and get
the plan I need right now what I'm done
but what I am excited about is like
making those decisions with team
mobile it just seems like there's fewer
like trying to screw you over closets
it's like it's moving us forward to
something closer to what our wireless
industry should look like yes but the
the problem is like it's easy to be open
when you're losing right this is like
it's easy to be open source when you're
in last place it's easy to be awesome
when you are about to die right and i
don't know i'm not saying t-mobile is
about to die I'm not sure I buy this
argument I'm saying oh it's easy to be
the white knight when you are you know
when you're not the big guy on top I
always in Gaza there's something Batman
live to be the villain something's how
is it haunted to be the hero and to have
these things if you have big reserves of
cash and a massive network verizon
they'll tell you the answer because you
make a lot more money by being a jerk
about being open yeah obviously to that
difficulty I i consider that an economic
imperative i guess not what i'm saying
is it's just a wholly don't beat
yourself we can't give t-mobile like too
much credit for like storing them a
steal okay I mean it's easy to storm the
Bastille when you're poor like not easy
but you know what I mean like it's like
they what other options do they have
here no I think t-mobile deserves the
credit for this and I think we shouldn't
under state particularly because to go
back to your point dieter about the less
interested consumer right cuz it
particularly like thinking about myself
I've been away from the site the last
week or so and an aqueous rack and then
coming back I felt like things like The
Guardian here in the UK dating roundups
of news stories check these terms and
and to me when I'm not working when I'm
following the news on a daily basis I
find those really redundant because like
I've seen every single one of these
stories seven times yesterday right but
it's somebody who just coming into it
has been away for a week those are the
most useful things because I don't
actually want to go and read seven
different articles I want to read the
round of utmost importance
so a lot of the time people operate with
very limited information like imagine
yourself you go to buy a new sofa you go
up to find a desk you don't need to be
or you don't want to be a specialist in
those parts in order to learn about them
kind of have to be because there's a big
pit Falls but a 10-point applies to
mobile contracts you most people operate
with the superficial tier information
that is given to them and most carrier
contracts like you're saying building
subsidies for phones which carry on even
after you've actually penfold which
isn't fair to the consumer isn't good
and t-mobile's push you in the right
direction and there's just one other
example want to cite which really
frustrated which i came across recently
and that's decaffeinated tea however I
guess look at an entity why are we
talking ok I went to college you well
you will do you will be with you yahoo
you and I would like circle back
together and be together no it is
because d cabinet it doesn't actually
mean caffeine free right whereas i
assume decaf mint it's tea without the
cafe there's logically exactly it's
reduced cafe right this is what the
mobile industry does to you it uses
technology like that that lets you make
that assumption that lets you make that
extra step where you think you're buying
something that you're not 4g mama yeah
exactly exactly so now everybody has a
safe for LTE 4G so we know it's actually
like the relevant pedagogy as opposed to
the old cat 4g but but that's it that's
it all these guys are kind of setting
you up so you fool yourself whereas
t-mobile is pushing declaration so I
already carry out there you know the big
guy that's Pro guy or if it's their only
option I just cared of this happening I
can the CEO swore and he didn't have a
stake fashion and will say I was sitting
in the audience for that and you know
I'm doing my thing and I'm taking notes
and you know prepping for the
announcements that we expected to happen
and then all of a sudden it's just like
torrent of foul language comes flying at
me and I was like this has got there
suddenly rapidly changed it to the most
interesting press event that I never
attended so it was quite a trip to hear
somebody be so candid upstate on stage
and just like not care this is the
biggest crock of I've ever heard in
my entire life do you have any idea how
much you're paying like was great I mean
that's that's nothing sacred that's
that's hold no bars yeah and I mean I
this the only reason I'm excited at all
for ctia in May is I hope to see this
guy on the stage with ATT and Verizon
like yeah that happens and they get to
like talk to each other directly oh my
god well then I'm sure if won't the past
couple of years at ctia have been round
tables like that no last year they did
this ridiculous thing where we were
expecting a round table we were all
geared up for the power the CEOs and
then they just trotted them out one by
one in sequence and that was it and yes
and what heavily scripted and who's
terrible yeah but yeah CJ's in May guys
gear up the semo apart by the ctia I
know I mean I know all the other big
guys are but they're talking a lot of
trash are they still part of the
wireless alliance does anybody care
about what I'm talking about no nobody
cares nobody cared an cares cuz he's
looking it up CJ zza it's the it's the
lobbying group that they throw you know
convention about phones I used to throw
to a year now this year they're only
throwing one but they're the lobbying
group that like you know carries water
for the carriers and says don't address
my eyes t-mobile USA is listed as a
member of the ctia stone now see how
much longer that last Oh what does it
stand for say to the telecommunications
industry as America and then the logo
looks like it has an old-school flip
phone between the TNA I if you look at
the negative space they're nice yeah
yeah yes not anachronistic tool nope
it's a look at some fedex logo action
right there negative space um I have
nothing else to say about you I want to
switch but I can't because yeah I my
contacts AT&amp;amp;T I don't have any
compatible hardware and I don't have
good signal so like I'm gonna metal
their business is screwed still I
actually little hardware though because
my nexus 4 is compatible with t-mobile's
hspa+ network well I was I'm tired LTE
here yeah I don't I don't have it well
my iphone 5 technically will work on
t-mobile's LTE network um in the seven
or eight city said it's available in but
uh t-mobile's regular everyday 3g signal
where I live is nearly useless so
unfortunately I'm stuck with the big
blue um man who could these shows
together we're blasting through stuff
and we've got two weeks worth of news oh
no something jerk you suck yeah um you
guys want to talk about rim or the
company formerly known as room sorry
right the company formerly known as room
so they they had their earnings they
surprisingly turned a profit I believe
which hooray for them and they sold
three or million Z tends which may or
may not include that shift sorry kicked
big difference right but that's that and
that also doesn't include the US launch
which was like just the other week so
right right so like hey they're not dead
they're hanging on and they got lots of
cash in the bank so yeah and Mike
Lazaridis has left and hopefully the
door didn't hit him on the way that's
not fair he was he was a giant among men
when I came to smartphones and winning
days I think he just mean physically
he's also a big guy yeah big hair
beautiful locks just imposing hair I
don't know you're the one that put these
notes together what good
we talk about John Legere san marcos you
know Mark more quotes from him uh sure
we've already gotten no just different
people to say we've already got a super
curve oh yeah you haven't you definitely
need to go take a look at the super cut
what for are you guys using these days
my sim jumps back into my nexus 4
earlier this week really I was using the
HTC One I just kind of got bored of it
and went back to the iphone I also
wanted to check out mail books I wanted
to check out my books which I was a lot
of that last dude it lasted about six
minutes yes it is is I was being very
obnoxious on a previous podcast might
have been the last 12 weeks ago we're
also do have my phone and I was just
pointing out to people them like number
379 thousand on the mailbox waiting list
I'm gonna say the most useful war
exciting parts of the whole experience
was actually getting from half a million
to the front of the line and getting to
use the app but the app itself is like I
mean you have to bind to this entire new
paradigm about later and archiving in a
different fashion and then later in two
hours later tomorrow it's like this
stuff doesn't need to be changed the
whole paradigm of email doesn't need to
be changed labels and archiving and all
that stuff that goes to gmail I'm happy
with I want you to just give me a
rock-solid ey and one that actually
maximizes the information for me the the
Google's own iOS app for gmail is pretty
much trash in so far as showing you like
the most using the real estate on your
screen properly and maximizing it when
you can see about six emails at a time
and then you can see a line and a half
which email it's very limited you have
to get into it well I mean what do you
want I mean no I mean you need to have
touch targets man now that I mean II UK
you can use that space of a better okay
use a little bit it won't be as pretty
it won't be a sparse but
be more useful to somebody who wants to
scan multiple emails at a time mailbox
actually gives you less information
think Google's iosa ran and is i mean
III will give mailboxes the you know the
act of reading messages and sending
messages and things like that it's very
fast and i wish that you know google
would just release a proper native app
for iOS instead of this web app rapper
garbage at the gmail app is so that we
can have that kind of performance
because that i do like about mailbox I
don't like the whole paradigm kicking
the can down the road and I don't like
the whole idea of putting my mail
through another server not named Google
um that's required with networks but as
far as a UI of the app itself I think
it's very very performs very well so i
just wish that was in regular gmail app
do you keep I mean doesn't man books
keep any messages are flying on your
phone no well like kinda but not
reliably well that's that's my biggest
complaint with the iOS app with the
google io SI o mail this mailbox keep it
up i think mailboxes I thought your
gmail yeah I'm pretty sure mailbox does
yeah mailbox does okay so I'm right am I
give it another chance just for that um
I guess as long as we're talking about
iphone we should mention the rumors from
The Wall Street Journal today what's
more iphone rumors yeah look look man
there's gonna be a Joan Rivers the world
go round there's gonna be a new iphone
this year did you hear largely the same
now it was it wasn't until today wasn't
through this very moment that I didn't
know yeah it turns out this year new
iphone I'm sure looking at you I just
have something in my and then the
low-cost thing is also not going away
the rumor is it'll be the 4 inch version
with a different casing I mean I'm
expecting though they'll make it look
like you know a ipod touch which I
malicious that would be yeah that'd be
great especially with the the multiple
colors that was you well that'd be
pretty fantastic I could I would be very
happy with the cyan
my phone just so yeah well I mean I'll
be really happy with an iphone that
actually does something with
Notification Center oh yeah actually I
went on a huge gigantic rant on the I'm
or podcast last week about the
Notification Center how terrible it is
and how insane but it's like not even
the worst on the market which is like
like it's terrible compared to android
but it exists which is more than other
platforms in somalia if you care to
blackberry hub it's way better than
blackberry hub in my opinion yeah well
black reihan Salam final product my
long-standing theory is that Apple was
aware of how ugly that stupid patent on
the Notification Center is and he's
decided to make it completely useless
you never have to look at it oh because
I never do it I never drag it down the
only times ever drag down the
notification in sort of a iphone is by
accident then I'm like oh look at this
thing it still has those gmail emails
which I address left two hours ago and
hasn't cleared them away ultimate yeah
which android has been able to do since
Anna so just fast and furious yeah free
since Tokyo Drift keeping the Zika
spirit alive guys on that wonderful fast
and furious note I think I'm going to
