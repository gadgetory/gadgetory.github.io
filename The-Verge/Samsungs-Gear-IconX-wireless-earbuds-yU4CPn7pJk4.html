real big buzz topic we've seen a couple
of companies a couple of startups try
their efforts and now we're looking at
Samsung's new gear icon X and these are
truly wireless earbuds they just sit in
your ear they can stream music to your
ears and they can also track a whole
bunch of Fitness things really the
fitness angle is what Samsung a big
pitch here is they can track your
distance your heart rate it can
interpret your calories burn stuff like
that and it syncs with Samsung's s
health app on your phone but it can also
do all that stuff standalone now these
little earbuds come in a case like you
can see here which charges them provides
2x battery charge on there but then they
pop into your ear like so when they'll
automatically turn on you got some basic
commands on your touch pad here very
similar to the biragi - in terms of
shape and size but they are really small
really light and they're really easy to
fit into your ear now battery life on
these when they're in a bluetooth
streaming mode you're going to get about
an hour and a half of battery life but
Samsung says that if you use the
built-in storage you can get up to 3.6
hours of battery life for just playing
music which is not too long it's not
going to last an entire flight certainly
not across the country but you can wear
them for a little while especially
certainly during a workout pop them back
into the case and charge back up and
they should be good to go
Samsung says that these are going to be
available in q3 of this year for about
$199 which is a little less than what
we've seen from other companies and will
be certainly taking a look at more of
them when they hit the market I dropped
one see look at this you just threw me
such a loop okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
