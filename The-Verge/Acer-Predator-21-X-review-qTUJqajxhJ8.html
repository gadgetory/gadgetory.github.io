Acer predator 21x it's the biggest most
powerful most expensive gaming laptop
ever made
it's a $9,000 behemoth with 21 inch
screen that literally Dwarfs any other
computer and while it's certainly an
impressive looking and massive device is
there any real reason to justify buying
it or even for it to exist at all I've
been using it for a couple weeks now and
the one thing I can't emphasize enough
is just how big this thing is like
breathing really big it weighs almost 19
pounds which is about as much as six
MacBook Pros incidentally it's $9,000
price tag is also the cost of six
MacBook Pros despite the size it is
technically still a laptop it has a
screen it has a battery and at least on
paper it works unplugged and away from
the wall the predator 21x checks all the
major boxes for gaming computer blowing
LEDs huge plastic vents a giant roaring
dragon a cutaway to see inside the
computer all here just you know bigger
subtlety is not exactly this thing
strong so with that kind of firepower it
would be surprising if anything didn't
run well in the predator and fortunately
anything from rocket League to the
incredibly graphically intensive
battlefield one runs great just simply
go to the menu hit maximum settings and
you're ready to go
performance does take a bit of a hit
though when you're unplugged
and using this as an actual computer it
works but using this thing for anything
other than playing games is a lot like
using the Lamborghini to drive to a
grocery store it'll get you there but
stop really what it's for could you use
it to get work done on the subway or
take over a table at your local coffee
shop
sure but you look ridiculous while
you're doing it and there's really much
better ways to use this computer Acer
only ships in one model an overclocked
core i7 processor dual GTX 10 a graphics
card a one terabyte hard drive 2 500
gigabyte SSDs and it completely
unneccesary 64 gigabytes of RAM the
screen is a curved 21 inch panel which
is a first for a laptop and has a Toby
eye tracking rig attached to the bottom
that can track your eyes while playing
games to aim light of UI elements at
just under 2 hours battery life is a bit
lower than you'd expect from the usual 7
to 10 that you'd want from a regular
work computer in canticle keyboard is
really loud and gets really
uncomfortable to use if you're not using
the optional palm rest the trackpad is
actually surprisingly good for windows
computer but it's a bit small for
navigating the giant screen fortunately
it flips over to become a number pad
because if you're using the trackpad on
this thing you're already missing the
point and yet is a bit bulky to carry
around when you're out and about I
highly recommend using two hands to
carry it pretty much at all times and
that's not even factoring in the
Chargers that's right
there are two of them each of which also
weighs a couple pounds
and while the predator itself is bigger
than my entire backpack
fortunately acer includes a custom
wheeled case so that you can take it to
commute or to a nearby coffee shop and
it's that carrying case that really sums
up the predator 21x it's out of place
and impractical to an extreme it's not
really meant to fit in your bag on your
desk because it's supposed to stand out
the predator 21x is a trophy of a laptop
it's for people who needs to have the
biggest best thing out there if your
regular computer user or even a serious
gamer there's still no reason to
consider buying one and yet I'm glad
that something as ridiculous as the
predator 21x exists because it's
expensive and impractical as it is it's
nice to know that at least at Acer sheer
overkill is still in style
$9,000 the case is giant it's like a
giant plastic suitcase</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
