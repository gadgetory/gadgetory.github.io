here with the Nokia Asha 200 this is
actually Nokia's lowest price 40 device
ever 60 or over for taxes the notable
thing about this is that it has a SIM to
slot on the side and the key there is
that it's hot swappable so there's an
internal SIM that's always present but
the second one can be hot swap you don't
have to reboot the device so if you have
a second account that you say change
between States or provinces you can do
that with that with that slot there the
back is also very interesting very
bright I don't know if you can really
make that out on camera but it's
seriously like neon green and it's
coming up in a bunch of bright colors
for launch it also has a very nicely
designed bezel along the side this isn't
a very cheap looking device it feels
light
it's plastic all the way around but it
has a premium feel to it camera
obviously no LED flash speakerphone on
the bottom that's the Asha 200 there's
also a single sent variant that's the
201 same price 60 euro next we've got
300 which is a step up from the 200 and
201 this has a numeric keypad on the
bottom and a resistive touch screen on
top there's been a lot of bad memories
about resistant screens in the past not
so here it has a very dare I say
capacitive feel to it no real give at
all when you turn on the screen you get
a swiped unlock motion down here and you
go like that you're in this is 85 euros
and it's a 3G with full HSPA like the
202 on its stylized on the back not
quite as cool of a bezel but still kind
of a premium finish on the back there's
satin has kind of a metal look to it no
LED flash at the top but 5 megapixel
camera finally we have the Asha 303 this
is her the high end device in the Asha
line full QWERTY keyboard along the
bottom capacitive display up top
curved back with a metal battery cover
sort of a brushed appearance to it 3.2
megapixel camera and like the 300 when I
turn it on you'll get a oh no you don't
get a swipe down lock that time but what
you do get is a swipe gesture to launch
different functions and that's
configurable you can change what that
does we go top to bottom now looks like
you can't do those but you can do side
to side one of the thing I want to point
out is that has Angry Birds lite
pre-installed you can buy the full
version from the store but this is along
with the announcement of these devices
is the first time that Angry Birds has
been available on a feature phone runs
in Java and of course you get the
typical Angry Birds experience thanks to
that touchscreen so this is 115 euros
and it's launching this quarter</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
