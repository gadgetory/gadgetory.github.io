shareholder meeting in Mountain View
California and the timing is super
important
Elon Musk almost lost his chairmanship
of the company and he faced serious
questions about Tesla's finances and
future that's because right now that
future is looking more uncertain than
ever my trust in Tesla's timelines could
sort of eroded a little bit with the
model 3 ran for this is like I tell you
the most excruciating hellish several
months I've maybe ever had we've made a
lot of mistakes with Walt's reproduction
that but we've we recognize those
mistakes and we're confident we know how
to address them reliability and
capability of autopilot will increase
exponentially over the next 6 to 12
months I think I do have like an issue
with time this is something I'm trying
to get better at so I'm trying to
recalibrate these these estimates so why
are investors so nervous well first of
all the rollout of the model 3 isn't
going well
this is Tesla's cheapest car yet and
it's the key for the company to go
mainstream the model 3 is also Tesla's
best chance to make its first-ever
profit it says it right here and Tesla's
quarterly financial statement our future
business depends in large part on our
ability to execute on our plans to
manufacture market and sell the model 3
vehicle and then a little further down
it reads we have no experience to date
in manufacturing vehicles at the high
volumes that we anticipate for model 3
but so far the model 3 production has
been a mess
Tesla failed to hit several important
deadlines there have been major
bottlenecks in the factory as well as a
few fires forcing the company to shut
down its assembly line so it can fix the
problem meanwhile almost half a million
people who have reserved model 3s are
left wondering when the hell they're
going to get their cars so the goal was
to be making 2,500 model threes a week
by the end of the first quarter but as
of April Tesla was barely managing to
make 2,000 cars a week the new goal is
to make 5,000 cars a week by the end of
the second quarter and that deadline is
coming up fast meanwhile there have been
a bunch of investigations into unsafe
working conditions at Tesla's factories
and the company is burning well over
a billion dollars in cash every quarter
prompting questions about Musk's ability
to keep Tesla afloat without raising
more money its stock price is trending
downward and musk is complaining about
big media on Twitter the stock price
suggests investors aren't happy and some
stock holders have even filed a
class-action lawsuit claiming Tesla made
false and misleading statements about
the model 3 and we haven't even gotten
to autopilot
that's Tesla's super advanced version of
cruise control that takes over a lot of
the driving from the driver there have
been a handful of nasty car crashes in
recent weeks involving auto pilot
including one that resulted in someone's
death the feds are investigating in
these incidents are raising the question
is Tesla marketing autopilot correctly
or is it possible that the system isn't
as safe as the company says musk is
struggling to produce a mass-market car
if the model 3 fails to live up to its
potential
that means Tesla's valuation is all out
of whack
which will probably cause its stock
prices to fall even more and if the
stock price Falls more than musk might
not be able to raise money Tesla will
run out of cash in the dream of a
mass-market electric car will be dead if
he succeeds then all that skepticism
will shift to one of Tesla's other
future products like the Tesla semi
truck or the next version of the
Roadster or the solar roofs or the
mysterious model why Tesla can barely
manage to handle model 3 production how
well do you think it's going to do with
the rest
I think Yvonne would appreciate that if
I recycle this right and I got turned
into like a beautiful paper bag or like
a hat this could be a future Elon Musk
