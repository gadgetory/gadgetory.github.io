here in Berlin and Aoife killed the
bezel we've seen a ton new laptops and
now it's different size different form
factors different shapes but there's no
one thing that they have in common
build these incredible displays that
have basically no screen borders at all
you hate bezels
I hate bezels bezels are dead Oh mostly
they're mostly dead from acer swift v
and swift 7 to assuage news n books
Lenovo's updated yoga laptops it seems
that every new computer this year has
just ditched its bezels at the door and
it's not a new trend in tech either the
bezel this revolution has been sweeping
through smartphones for the last year
and we're devices like the essential
phone or iPhone 10 were once eye
catching they've quickly become the norm
across the industry and now that the
smaller screens of smartphones have been
solved it seems that we've decided the
next step is laptops this year's crop of
laptops pushed the treasured screen to
body ratio even higher the Swift 5 is
87.6% screen while the newly T Swift 7
checks in at 92% and Oster's does n
books have its new ergo lift hinge
design which in theories for improving
typing but really just cleverly hides
the lower bezel so that it can claim to
be up to 95 percent screen it's not just
about aesthetics though I mean sure
bezel with screens look fantastic but
their actual real benefits here take
something like the Acer swift 5 which
takes a 15.6 inch screen and puts it in
the body of the old 14 inch model or
Isuzu Zen books which go in a different
direction it takes a 13-inch laptop and
it makes it so much smaller than it used
to be almost an unheard-of size for that
class of screen there are a few kinks
ironed out though while company has
gotten really good at minimizing the top
and sigh Bessel's all that tech that
powers the screen needs to go somewhere
like the cable connectors and hinges
which means that that bottom bezel is
gonna be a lot harder to get rid of it's
a similar issue that we've been seeing
with smartphones already with notches
and Chin's everywhere and think of
webcams the bezel is typically where the
webcam goes and while companies like
Huawei and Dell had tried various
solutions like hiding the camera at the
bottom of the screen or inside the
keyboard there's still no great solution
yet
Dells XPS 13 kicked off the bezel is
screen design and laptops with its
infinite display all the way back in
2015 Dell didn't sit on visa this year
either slimming down the bezels on it's
cheaper inspire line to bring the
edgeless displays to even lower price
points given apple's mostly on board
with its recent MacBook Pros featuring
smaller vessels although the company
does still sell its older MacBook Air
with its massive 2011 error bezels
intact but this year's wave of laptops
is really just the start we're already
at the point where this feels like it
should be the norm and laptops with full
bezels are already looking like giant
cumbersome dinosaurs compared to their
sleek and slim cousins it's really hard
to imagine anyone looking at something
like aa Seuss's news n books or Dells
XPS 13 and then choosing the old last
year's model over it it's that
significant of a difference so yes
bezels are dying and if laptops really
are following smartphone trends then
Aoife is just showing us with the
beginning of what the future of
computers might look like thanks for
