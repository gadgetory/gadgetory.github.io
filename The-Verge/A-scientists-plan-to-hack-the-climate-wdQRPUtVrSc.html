the debate over climate change research
shows that even sharp cuts in fossil
fuel use would no longer be enough to
avoid environmental catastrophes likely
including widespread famine mass
extinction and hundreds of millions of
climate refugees but despite these
growing risks world leaders and
politicians continue to resist hard
commitments to change or deny the
problem even exists it'll get cooler
it'll get warmer to cold weather enter
the climate hackers a growing number of
scientists and researchers who are
taking matters into their own hands
they're exploring ways to seize control
of nature itself to reverse climate
change by altering clouds changing ocean
chemistry making the atmosphere more
reflective and other forms of what's
often called geoengineering it sounds an
e to some and reckless to others but
with millions of lives and entire
ecosystems in the balance
ignoring any opportunity to limit these
mounting threats could prove to be the
most reckless action of all so doing
this could cut the actual risk we care
about of climate change
cut them say in half this century at a
low cost and that's a big deal
Harvard scientist David Keith has a
cheap and simple plan to prevent the
earth from overheating as global warming
takes off in the decades ahead the most
basic idea is by making the earth a
little bit more reflective by reflecting
away some sunlight you can reduce some
of the warming and other climate changes
that come from the build-up of
long-lived greenhouse gases like co2 the
way to do this that scientists
understand best is to fly planes into
the stratosphere where they would spray
particles such as sulfur dioxide over
time these particles would combine with
oxygen and water in the atmosphere to
create sulfuric acid which traps water
vapor that would otherwise evaporate
small droplet of water vapor like a
cloud droplet would reflect sunlight
back to space and cool the earth just
like a thin cloud dumps
done on a large enough scale it could
offset much of the warming and store
this century and Keith estimates it
could be done for a few billion dollars
a year that sounds like a big number
until you consider the trillions and
estimated climate change damages
annually Keith didn't invent this
concept known as solar radiation
management but he's arguably done the
most work to date figuring out how it
can be done safely and effectively using
sophisticated computer modeling he's
looked at various particles in various
quantities to test the climate reaction
far more research is needed before
anyone actually deploys this kind of
technology at full scale but Keith
argues it's time to move from lab
research to limited trials in the real
world it might or might not make sense
actually do solar to measuring at this
point all we're talking about is
research but if it makes sense to do it
it might make sense to do it quite soon
wall we're also cutting emissions
because it actually reduces the risk
substantially we do know the basic
science is sound because Nature has
already done the field work major
volcanic eruptions in the past have
markedly cooled worldwide temperatures
by blowing tens of millions of tons of
sulfur dioxide into the sky the most
often cited example is the massive 1991
eruption of Mount Pinatubo which ease
global temperatures by a fool degree
Fahrenheit the following year but there
are known risks to mimicking this
natural phenomena the downside of
shooting software dioxide into the sky
is that it also eats away at the ozone
layer as it is the world has been
struggling for decades to patch a gaping
hole in this protective layer caused by
earlier chemicals used in things like
refrigeration and hairspray
some research has also suggested solar
radiation management would reduce
rainfall in certain areas and that could
have disastrous effects on food
production according to will Burns
co-director of the Washington climate
geoengineering consortium I have some
serious concerns about solar radiation
management approaches because whereas
they they could potentially
substantially cool the planet they also
could have some extremely serious
negative impacts that would make the
you're worse than the disease you could
potentially alter precipitation patterns
which could shut down the monsoon in
South Asia on a regular basis it could
create large droughts in sub-saharan
Africa it could create die backs in the
tropical Amazon region in addition
geoengineering at the scale of an entire
planet presents thorny international
political challenges another concern
with solar geoengineering is whose hand
is going to be on the thermostat it
might be that Russia or Canada might
prefer to see a little more global
warming than in places like in India or
equatorial countries that gives
potential for international conflict and
a new nuclear age international conflict
can be very dangerous Keith's first came
across early proposals for solar
geoengineering as a doctoral student in
physics at MIT in the late 1980s he had
grown frustrated with his fields
obsession with abstract issues and
became drawn to the dawning real-world
problem of global warming he's published
a series of papers on the subject
throughout a rapid rise in the academic
world that landed him at Harvard in 2011
where is now a professor of applied
physics in public policy much of Keith's
recent work has focused on limiting the
negative effects of solar radiation
management last year for instance he and
colleagues found that swapping software
dioxide for other materials such as
alumina or diamond dust with
significantly less than the ozone impact
in the case of diamond dust you would
also significantly increase the cooling
effect Keith also says that research
following the work Byrne sites has found
that solar geoengineering could actually
increase food production in part because
it reduces heat stress on crops if you
take any modern climate model and put in
a moderate amount of solar to missionary
not enough to calm
stayed away all the effects of co2 which
would almost certainly be crazy but
maybe and enough to cut that in half so
imagine if a gradual ramp in the amount
of solar geoengineering that cut the
rate of warming in half if you do that
in a model essentially every single part
of the world is as far as we can tell
better off as the threat level climbs
other scientists and policymakers are
also calling for more geoengineering
research jane long a senior consulting
scientist at the Environmental Defense
Fund notes that major climate
projections show that global
temperatures this century will rise well
above the 2 degrees Celsius threshold
that researchers have long warmed we
shouldn't cross the only models that
predict the globe will avoid this danger
zone includes some form of climate
intervention which could include the
method keith has in mind or new ways of
removing carbon dioxide from the oceans
and atmosphere I think that means we
better know more about intervention we
need to be able to decide whether these
things are effective whether they're
advisable whether it's a good idea to do
them and whether they're actually doable
if there's ever a real climate crisis
the pressure on a politician to do
something now that can act within a year
can be really intense and so it's
important that we do the research now so
that when politicians are faced with
this question they have good scientific
information and are not just engaged in
wishful thinking Burns for his part
remains skeptical that lab research and
field trials will ever tell us enough to
be able to safely roll out the
technology at full-scale we still won't
know what its real impacts are until we
fully deploy but if you fully deploy of
course and you shut down the monsoon
then it's going to have dire
implications Keith is the first to say
that solar geoengineering isn't a magic
bullet it can't address all the impacts
of climate change and nothing about it
means that we don't still have to
transition to a clean energy system as
quickly as possible there's a line of
argument that says we can never
understand Soler's you know assuring
perfectly we can never predict exactly
what will happen so we can never do it I
think that's absurd it really
misunderstands the choice that humans
face both uncertainties matter so you
can't just focus on the uncertainty
about solar gene sharing because you've
got the uncertainty about co2
and that's the thing that we know is a
big risk but I believe it's my job as a
scientist both to warn about the foolish
choices the worldwide make if it sees
this as a get-out-of-jail-free card
but it's also my job to say what the
science seems to say well the science
seems to say is that moderate amounts of
solar geo reduce climate change in
almost every way that we can project</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
