are exhausted I'm Josh Topolsky I'm
actually ross miller and we actually are
exhausted this is a week and we
completely bone the intro we're very
tired yeah it's the the end of a long
crazy hall we're almost at the final day
here there is yeah there is today and
tomorrow the shower but really we've got
a lot done we've got a lot done we've
seen a lot there's still more to come we
actually have some really interesting
stuff going up today but there's been a
bit of whirlwind week it's been a
whirlwind use a lot of their lot of sick
people a lot of tired people lost a few
good men lost women several good men and
women and yeah I'm just like yeah I'm
pretty bird yeah there's there is so
much I've in it it's just thursday by
the way it's just thursday but i'm
pretty sure we've been six to 12 days
doing yes no yes sir there's so much
stuff in the shore floor and we barely
been up keep track and Josh look I know
you're a turn shoot the site you see
everything we cover and everything goes
on there yeah I mean it's been I mean
yes that's the you know I try to keep
track of everything but we've published
a lot right a lot of news and I
challenge you a challenging now with the
new segment that we like to call five
from the parking lot of the Las Vegas
Convention Center
CES 2014 it that run off
hello and welcome to name that product a
brand new game show for today and today
only this is the pregame show we ask you
just what the heck is that thing each
contestant will have 30 seconds or less
to figure out just what this product
does now we've got four gadgets tonight
we want to show off and we have our
first and really our only contestant
tonight he is an editor in chief for The
Verge com Joshua Topolsky Josh how are
you doing uh I guess I'm great I don't
really know I don't know what's going on
here but horrific are you ready to play
uh no but I guess I'm going to have to
so I I accept tournament whatever
challenge it is that you have for me
great that's wonderful Josh here's your
first product okay this is a this is a
okay this is a medical this is for
doctors this is a device for doctors to
be able to see inside just underneath
the skin this is for nurses and medical
technicians when they have to give a
shot to someone they are that use this
to see is that correct that is correct I
really wow that is the V embarrassing
I've never seen that before yep the
veena veena glasses t through the skin
I'm it's crazy stuff very interesting
all right what I just want to point out
how how incredible my understanding of
technology is that I was able to just
know what that was just by looking at it
don't sell yourself Jess yeah we've got
three more of these sir by the way is
there a reason why it looks like I'm
sitting in a sex dungeon of some type
it's terrific TVB on back here here's
probably Brazil ok
this is a this is put you insert this
into the rectum and it tells you it's
another medical device inserted into the
rectum and it tells you what your pulse
is no you wear it on your head it goes
on your head it's a device it tells you
how hard your be no I'm so I'm so sorry
that was actually the Reebok check light
it goes into athletes helmets and checks
the impact not does it go the rectum so
were you telling me not the rectum ah as
I was I pretty sure that's a rectum all
right same item yah right you've got one
out of two okay here's your third
product yep let's do it let's do it this
is it a paper airplane this is that note
this is a paper airplane with a
propeller on the back of it I'm just
describing what I'm seeing right now
okay this is some new like paper drone
that has an app that you control using
an iphone you can make your own paper
airplane then you put this little clip
on the back of it or something and then
you know I think I think it's this close
up it's a bluetooth powered paper
airplane okay that's perfect I don't
feel like I've been greatly challenging
oh that's with you this is actually I'm
clipping on the paper airplane and you
can control us don't my telling you but
I'm at a technology expert you know I
think I think we might have I'm just
already I'm owning you so hard right
outside even funny alright well let's
see how does it feel to be owned this
hard it feels like everyday you out of
two out of three months just like the
often as meatloaf said that ain't bad
alright this is it this is for pure
domination job okay here we go here we
go so I win something oh wait hold on
that's a circuit board does her hands
it's a hand it's a person's hand this is
a breathalyzer this is a open source
breathalyzer that anybody can it's got
an open API oh no it's a fake this is a
vaping product open source vaping babe
digital paper is what this product is
all right you know what yeah that's
that's close enough they were two gates
it's actually it's a biometric vaporizer
and what it does is I called that yes
it's basically doesn't like kids to it
basically locks your fingerprint in I
don't think it could be I don't think my
dominance in the technology space can be
can be challenged you know I think I
think when we came with game shall we
thought is really thought we hit a
little bit less sleep so no I know I my
own nightmare I mean I i I'm not clearly
bowed down baby maybe I need to be on
i-12 more often maybe that's the key
here is this the end of the show so that
is that is it for a product and look at
all in all seriousness we've had a lot
of crazy crazy gadgets out there but the
one that we think the last couple years
has really does change how they perceive
the industry has been the oculus rift
virtuality heads has impressed a lot of
people they're back this year with a
brand new version and you know for fun
we thought we'd let the entire staff
just kind of try it out and of course we
filmed the reactions take a look good
boy no my god oh my god oh my god what's
happening oh my god oh my god oh this is
this is this is I have to say this is uh
I'm not able to do words right now holy
crap wait wait wait
wait wait wait a minute what the
not good i'm totally hungover in this is
sneeze a stupid this is like Hanukkah
haha sorry I'm so giggly just whoa this
is like being hugged but by a video game
these guys are really cool got big
bellies hmm hmm could you put them
together I really want to pick these
guys up like but I can't this is very
disorienting because I can see my hand
it's like I want to kill it
hmm score from the Hayes Waits how do I
kill this thing okay I killed someone
you guys saw it all right ok I just want
to kill things yeah yeah yeah oh I can
shoot poop oh my got one I got that guy
dude dude that's a table oh ok there's a
table there this is amazing and I never
want to take it off I mean I'm not going
to take it off oh I don't want to leave
this is the best thing no but no but no
no no I feel amazing right now I really
don't want to take this off of me
welcome back to Vegas
oh wow that's uh pretty incredible say
I'm really jealous that I get to do the
oculus rift this year yeah you were too
busy Oh way there's a jet landed in the
parking lot please excuse us you're just
David products left and right I be
really think you just use a airbus 320
actually outfitted with a dual hydraulic
cylinder boost and that's not a thing I
made that up that's it made up product
well I think the 320s an actual plane no
but really interested to see reactions I
actually when we brought the new version
in first off I like had already
experienced at obviously a bunch of
times so I wasn't expecting to have much
of a reaction and a bunch of there were
a few people here who never used it
before right but several people had used
it and so I thought well we'll see with
reactions aren't and there definitely
was like I I was actually kind of blown
away because of the detail some of the
stuff they've done the latency stuff
they've addressed the resolution still
not you still see some of the pixels but
it's much higher resolution than last
version and the the positioning the
positioning tracking and now it now
requires like a separate camera to write
like yeah it has it has well it has an
external yeah camera that kind of senses
your your that's what those white dots
are they write our communicate
information to that sensor but but I was
actually really impressed I I thought
that it wouldn't be that big of a jump
and it was a big jump and a lot of
people here what was interesting is that
the reaction was not the this like raw
surprise of having never done it before
but it was like they were so immersed in
it there were a lot of people came out
there like I don't want to be out here
and I don't want to go you know I want
to go back in and also there's a part of
the demo where you see stuff flying
around where people are like dodging it
right and I think that because of the
changes in latency and the resolution
that feels so much more visceral than
the previous stuff did right I'm curious
like how how diminish the motion blur is
too and like we've we did we have people
on staff who do suffer from like
cigna stuff we didn't get you a try it
unfortunately yeah it was loved and seen
the reaction ah actually it went bad I I
mean the latency is greatly reduced
which helps that there was very little
blurring in to my eyes and you know it
was interesting that the game that we
were playing was a stationary game it
was essentially like a tower defense
game Ryan I think that and I spoke to
the oculus guys and they really wanted
to show off the rift as a device that
you can use for gaming that isn't just
FPS because there's a because there's a
certain segment in fact the CEO Brandon
told me there's certain segments of
people that are just they're always
going to feel some bit of motion
sickness no matter what playing playing
a really fast moving game like a
first-person shooter and so I think
they're now trying to get into this get
to this point where they're showing hey
look there's a bunch of different things
you can do with the oculus rift you know
there's it doesn't isn't just about like
you're playing quake although you know
quake pretty great in the oculus rift
nothing they want to commission with the
the the new virtual x2 we're like you
can just run that place yeah we actually
that's actually really cool that's
something that we put up a report about
this yesterday ellis hamburger went to
try out this device we checked out last
year which in it i think was in a much
within much rougher shape it was i think
was easy to connect since the virtuix
virtuix omni yes and they are pairing it
with the dev set of the oculus the
current oculus rift which is much more
layton and lower resolution right and
doesn't have the position tracking and
but now they're getting ready to ship
this thing and it actually looks a lot
better though ella said that he was
extremely nauseous on it and like you
keep you if you watch the video you
could just see him like running in place
a little bit kind of like disoriented
like it yeah I do you think it's it's
definitely looks like a better
experience and it was last time yeah I'm
sure the new heads that would probably
help but now we're getting to the point
where like I remember I was growing up
in the 90s like there was a blockbuster
arcade where I was living yeah and like
they had the big virtuality machines
this is a big deal for when I was
growing up and it was just it to me it
was super impressive like it was
definitely some like you walked away
just wanting to like throw up yeah so so
that was so that's that's something we
did yesterday we should talk a little
bit about t-mobile had their
their press event yesterday just by the
way we should yeah we should I wish you
a statement here we've been pronouncing
CEO of t-mobile's name as John Legere
yes it's apparently John ledger leisure
yeah which sounds frightening Lee
similar to John Legend right and both of
them are at CES so it's a little
confusing ah but one is an insane maniac
CEO and the other is John Legend so it's
pretty easy to tell them apart usually
yeah but so yeah John I can't say it
leisure John leisure tells us has like
leisure yes John leisure or ledger got
onstage yesterday denounced the tmobile
was going to do was going to pay for
your ETF your early termination fee if
you're on AT&amp;amp;T right now he will give
you three hundred fifty dollars to leave
or whatever your etf fee is to come over
to t-mobile right and also / lines if
you have family they'll do it for up to
five people on a family plan which is
pretty crazy but you have to turn your
device into them so they're going to
take that device and refurbish it and
resell it make it fully committed right
exactly but you know what's interesting
about what they announced yesterday
which was really the only big
announcement yesterday really was i mean
wouldn't store the end right we're
almost almost done with the shovel
what's the interesting thing is they
don't really talk about how they're
building out their network you know dan
seifert who is actually at the show got
up and asked him a question about the
network he was like why what are you
doing about your net right being so bad
and I think you know Neil I was like
going crazy about this on the verge cast
last night but I do think they what's
interesting about the t-mobile stuff is
that I think they have some really good
ideas and it seems very exciting but
they do have network issues like a
tmobile stinks in my neighborhood and
they're not talking about how they're
going to address that part of the of the
process and which i think is really
important not to echo too much but Neil
I was saying yesterday but is a chicken
egg problem they need customers and
money to make more antennas to get more
customers and break right and then to do
this they just need some catalyst to
like get out of the chaos of course was
these uncarrier plans was the brashness
of the right it's this attitude which
isn't just John ledger anymore it's also
what's his name I think
Neville his CT oh yeah Nevel what's up
sorry what's his uh I like it I like his
wardrobe here he's just like you know
guys I'm gonna wear the pink t-shirt
yeah like I don't you guys are gonna
wear I mean he's got like this chain on
it was a lot more dresses dudes wearing
a t-shirt to like it's very casual look
for the t-mobile guys they want you to
know they're down-to-earth regular bros
you can have a beer with them right a
big deal me I has this theory that this
is all put on that like you know a year
ago he was this executive in it like a
rating some short corporate raider like
a in a suit with a short haircut he let
his hair grow out became the John ledger
that we we know and love and like the
tough thing is like whether not he is if
you're gonna be cynical about it are you
gonna be hopeful but like the end
results still somewhat the same yeah
like it's still a more compelling plan
ya know my creation is if you're right
if you're in a great cover chair and you
never travel like slam dunk right so so
I haven't asked you this you and I'd
like to know what have you seen at the
show what's the most interesting
exciting thing you see the show what's
the lamest thing you've seen all right
um well actually to be four of you guys
I have been on the show for yet yeah you
know the verge com I've seen the first
time ever a show had I done the game
I've been disputed closed because I'm
owning everybody in my knowledge of
technology uh you know I think the
lamest thing is more is more of a
category ideas just like it's this
smartphones in journal because it's so
ubiquitous so same see and it's not that
it's bad I'm just it was just boring to
me you know I was like him some more but
the most impressive thing was was his
idea and like it was it was Cosmo rise
keynote is the very end we started talk
about livestream UX and then he got at
that speech about what Sony wants to
represent like no more commodity where
you know we're here for the high end we
hear from aspirational I thought that
was just a beautiful moment for
something getting back on track yeah I
mean it makes it a Kuenn I for the first
yes I came here was when I Howard
Stringer key knows where he brought dr.
oz out he showed like classic very
classic things and Kelly that was like
well that was like peak CES like let's
just throw that Liberty on stage and I
used to love that stuff because it was
just spectacle but now i'm really loving
the sony stuff because they're actually
trying to get back on track yeah and
you're using the xperia phone I've gotta
say I I'm a little little jealous about
I have to say I really I really have I
was
get about this last night I really it's
funny because we went to I went to a
meeting with cause and there were a
couple other journalists there I was the
only person with a sony phone which i
think is interesting but uh you know i
think if they put the marketing in for
this i think this actually could be
really successful product i think it's i
mean unfortunately they're only carrier
right now for it is t-mobile but I
actually think Sony is capable of making
good products and this phone while it
does have some bloatware on and some
stuff that I don't like which you can
pretty much any disabled all of it it's
really good right you know and and it's
well made and it's got a great camera
you know there's some issues with the
screen but they're not deal-breakers in
any way but but Sony is capable of
making amazing stuff you know I think
whether you think the games are good for
the ps4 is is clearly a successful
console and it's actually an unfair
president it's more successful there's
one even though a large margin even
though I would you know if you gun to my
head like which one would you get I
would get the xbox one's I think it's
more of a cohesive solution and I know
what I what but what caused her i was
describing and what he talked to me
about this this idea of the cloud TV
service and uh and playstation now and
things like that they really are talking
about creating this this sort of
completely connected entertainment
experience which i think everybody talks
about but i think sony could actually do
based on the lessons they've learned
over the last ten years of what not to
do and go and what was so impressive
like so obviously something had to press
conference almost the very boring here's
our new phones here's our new cameras
whatever like that was a very
disappointing press conference but the
Asura thing was like look we think
projectors in the home high screen
images you can change the like what your
wall looks like like that's crazy
stephanie goes up by the way that is
real and we are going to bet money and
release it yeah i mean they they
definitely got he definitely got the
right the message right which is sony
needs to be a leader we need to try
crazy things we need to innovate and not
just copy what everybody else is doing
and I do think like for most companies
that should be a lesson right it's it's
you know the more the more Android for
example got different from what the
iphone was doing the lesson became like
a grid of icons and just trying to ape
what the iphone was doing the better it
became as an operating system I think
Matthias too aren't they had a lot
do with that sort of pushing the design
forward and I think like you see Google
own in its own sort of design concepts
in its own path and that's how they've
sort of grown into the company they are
right now I think Sony for a long time
just sort of languished sort of didn't
really know what it wanted to be or who
it was and now they're like oh we're
Sony we invent amazing things and I hope
they actually end up doing some amazing
things because of that that mindset I I
agree with you that's it that was a
really cool um that's really cool moment
I have to say I I think this is this
show was you know last year the talk was
before the show buddy was like man it
can be a terrible show CES is over why
does it matter it was a really exciting
show this year I think proves my eye
brown editorial the last day of the year
the upgrade the age of the upgrade which
was about the our awareness of
Technology and how it's become a really
normal part of our lives and how we
expect things to be upgraded you expect
a phone to get a bigger screen or a
better camera you expect your TV that
there's going to be a new TV next year
with smart TV functions or whatever and
I think that my point of the editorial
was what what interests me and I think
what is increasingly interesting to most
people is not the hey my phone got
enough it's like you know they release
new stoves all the time but you're not
like oh man what are the stoves doing
this year right because they become like
a product that we're familiar with them
are used to and my point was innovation
doesn't happen on product release cycles
and this es is a great example of
innovation not happening on a product
release cycle you know pebble they
introduced a new SmartWatch last year we
were really excited because they had
this Kickstarter project that became a
real watch and he's goodbye and it was
really cool that it never really never
been done before this year they have
version 2 which is nicer looking and
they comes in a couple of different
styles but it's really the same watch
right and they're just making iterative
changes to and it's also like it's the
same watch in a functional standpoint we
are talking about form and the form the
form has improved but but that that's
the incremental stuff but then you see
like hey we're doing curved TVs this
year or everybody's got their fitness
band because that's become a thing that
is incremental that's not really that's
not
kind of innovation that you want to see
but you can't do that crazy innovation
every you can't have the new oculus rift
every year and so I think we are in this
period where there's going to be a
little bit of a push and pull we're
going to go through periods where there
you know your smartphone is even get
dramatically better it's going to get a
little bit better but on the flip side
we're going to have things like the
Model S and you know bullet trains and
doing infrastructure and energy
initiatives and things that are like
really big I think that you know that to
me is reflected really well this year
because everything here feels really
small to me all of the innovation all of
the announcements feels like totally
incremental totally small totally not I
would not say inconsequential just not
deeply meaningful and that's like my
takeaway from the show basically I'm
just like I on a complete rant now no
this is you're just sitting here comes i
attain look I'm tired any I just feel
like yeah we're both really burst we've
done she's got a million shows while
we've been here and and I think we have
to wrap up because we're probably
reaching our 25 minute we're a little of
wherever are we over it okay I'm doing
well well we did start 10 minutes late
though still I am exactly 25 minutes
according to my clock at any rate I
think Roger Baba but um so so today
we've got a lot more news that's going
to happen we got some really interesting
reports going up today and tomorrow so
in-depth reporting on what's happening
here to show some stuff that you really
haven't seen yet and maybe haven't
thought about and then tonight we've got
a virgin mobile show right Virge cast
I'll give us these because it very say
the first cast after hours which will be
the last one of CES unfortunately we are
setting down the studio yeah so after
after thursday night we tomorrow on
friday to the kind of studio breakdown
so thursday with this today will be our
final shows from here from CS and you
know it's a little bittersweet but also
i'm extremely tired and so I'm very
happy to not do any more shows you know
we come to CS ever going week I can't
believe doing this I'm so angry we come
here we fall in love with it you're so
happily by the Friday like this is great
and then we go back to 11 months of
dreading yeah I don't know i think by
the end of cs I'm like I
don't ever want to do this again by day
bite by whatever let's see it'll be dave
six for me or something tomorrow okay
you know six days of CES is of doing all
the planning and all the work and all
the dryness of Las Vegas all the dryness
yeah I'd like so much blood coming out
of my nose down control and not from the
coke abuse so okay I think that's a
great way definitely no that's so that's
the first thank you guys so much for
watching we really appreciate the fact
that people have tuned in like lots of
people we've had a huge audience this
year and that's awesome and there's a
lot more stuff to come today so stick
around Ross it's been a real pleasure
Josh it was nice knowing you and that's
our show I get there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
