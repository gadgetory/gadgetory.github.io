just taking a cup Metron m which is
basically a dream board theme for
jailbroken iPhones so what you see is a
similar to Windows Phone you've got the
notifications down the bottom there and
the controls for music at the top and
there's also notifications for messages
or phone calls and you can't swipe those
away and but they will launch the sort
of inbuilt apps so those some of the
themes looks like Windows Phone and you
can obviously see the Start screen to
windows 8 here you've got live tiles at
the top for music and Mail on the left
there basically they will provide any
sort of the default information from iOS
and launching any of the apps will
launch the default iOS app if you swipe
down the tile you get options to move
the tile around we can also unpin it
from the start screen moving around you
can pretty much move them up and down
you can also change them the tiles from
life to non-life and going back to
desktop and you get a swipe on the right
path which is very much like Windows 8
there's also an option to change the
username or to actually lock the screen
which brings you back to the lock screen
here we can pair it with Windows Phone
and as you've got the music options at
the top and the date and time are very
much in in a similar place and you get
notifications down the button there as
well so wiping into the Start screen you
can obviously notice the differences
between the two unlike windows 8 its
implementation there's no app bar that
you can swipe from the back bottom
upwards if you have to touch the start
button that will give you the all apps
option which obviously you can then go
and pin tiles back to the start screen
or you can launch apps straight from
there there's also a settings option
that allows you to change the colors in
the background here as you can change
that from the default blue color down to
green or orange and also on the charms
bar there's a search function it just
takes you into iOS search will just show
you exactly how this charms bar works is
very similar to the windows 8 experience
you can get back to the desktop and you
can swipe it from the right and you go
straight back into the Metro user
interface on Windows 8 is pretty much
the same you can swipe them right and
you get the start button and the air
settings there you can also access a
desktop pretty easily and swipe back
other settings include the salt
background picture that you can change
here so you've got a few options there
from circles and bubbles very again very
similar to the Windows 8 Start screen
and there's also an option to change
some of the notification settings so you
can change the default apps that provide
those lock screen notifications ok so
that was a quick look at met room for
iOS which is available in the cydia
store for jailbroken iphones at one
dollar fifty</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
