announced that he'll be retiring within
the next 12 months I dieter bohn senior
editor for The Verge and with me is our
resident Microsoft expert Tom Warren hi
doin tom hey not too bad so this is a
this is a pretty crazy announcement yeah
9am friday moaning boom yeah actually
let's talk about the timing of this so I
mean these things typically happen on a
friday but they did at the beginning of
the day very early on yes coast yeah
stokes going up because of it and yeah
strange timing strange timing all around
really um yeah 9am on a friday and but
then like just as April ones about to
ship and windows 8 so has he been around
and all the executive changes and stuff
it's a is very curious timing well we've
seen a lot of executive changes yeah
it's had the whole I just left here
there and then more importantly it
wasn't that long ago that we saw the big
giant one Microsoft letter yes Steve
Ballmer yeah and that's basically shaped
the whole senior leadership team and so
now its constraints a boom has basically
been working with the board and they've
shaken up the whole leadership team now
there's this team in place but now balls
going right so it seems like a it seems
like this was kind of planned but i
think it's just what's going to happen
now let this really the question and but
yeah the timing it's just okay now
Ballmer said that he would retire within
the next 12 months after a successor is
chosen so do you expect that we're
looking at one more year of bomber in
charge or you think he'll be shorter
than that yeah I think he's going to be
a while because I mean if you if you
look at the the way that they've worded
this like within the 12 months it seems
as though they've they potentially
looked internally and they've obviously
done this senior leadership changes that
we just talked about but it seems
strange that they wouldn't have
identified someone out that leadership
to take over from boomer yeah the name
somebody's leaving you want to say this
next pressures coming into his la nuit
II and make BF feel comfortable in
canada and obviously investors a seem to
be at the moment seemed to be happy that
boom is going right up yeah so let's
talk about that i mean it's palmer not
been a good CEO for Microsoft and I
think he has for like not on the numbers
in the sky
all the financials then if you look at
it like based on that purely then you
know he's done what a CEO should do he's
there's been growth it's been steady but
I think a lot of investors was always
called for them to that growth hasn't
been in the particular areas that that
really hit the media like the consumer
stuff they've honestly struggled over
the last sort of five five six years on
the mobile side and now they're
struggling to really make an impact on
the tablet sides and these are both key
bro quieras the emerging to take over
there they're like dominance in the in
the pc so basically the microsoft is
doing fine quarter-to-quarter but the
big question has always been with what
steve ballmer particulars does he have a
big vision that he could execute on that
actually is going yeah they're not
taking advantage or the particular
growth that's out there at the moment so
well as the android and iOS dominating
in mobile windows phone still struggling
there is that and it's all because they
were kind of I think born was slow to
react right he laughed at the iphone
initially he's laughter Android and it
was yeah he's publicly he said some
silly things when you look back now who
kind of looks it looks a little crazy
but I think for the numbers and growing
like their enterprise site like they've
done pretty well with us office in the
services right well I mean it's
important to remember that like
Microsoft doesn't have to be Apple you
know at things like and they can build
their own kind of business and Alma has
built a certain kind of business yeah
but they're having problems so yeah
we've mentioned Windows Phone a couple
of times is that essential for Steve
Ballmer and whoever is going to succeed
him to finally like crack that and start
gaining big market share yeah that
they've had I mean I think it is the
poem they have at the moment is that the
majority of those sales on these low end
handsets and you know if if if Apple
goes into that silveria soon like it's
rumored to be it's going to be even more
difficult to grow that that marker ship
I think it's there's a key there's a key
thing and I don't think boomer has
particularly really pressed upon is
essentially internally like how
important that is but grow like Windows
Phones been slowly developing even even
though
released in 2010 and so I think they
need to get I mean looking at who could
possibly succeed and like like yeah well
this is inning they've got a recruitment
firm its Hendrick and struggles and
they're they're looking at both internal
and external candidates right yeah I
think I think personally and the the
next see it will be an extent one oh
really yeah I mean I think just from
looking at initially is the fact that
they haven't identified any one
immediately internally and the recent
executive changes people leaving
Sinofsky going even you know back in
November a while yeah I think they that
this whole strategy in this whole like
leadership stuff it's it speaks to the
fact that I think they need someone to
come in externally and just shake things
up a little bit like really push up on
this strategy and like streamline
everything into this hole one microsoft
go well so actually that was my next
question is do you think that this one
Microsoft set up and the executive set
up that bomber has put in place he's
going to leave are we gonna see yet
another big shake-up of how Microsoft
organizes itself and who's in charge of
what once the new guy comes in or near
going to bring somebody in to just
finish the plan that Ballmer started
yeah I don't think so i think is
literally like finishing the plan that
the fullness died I mean it's curious
that he's leaving now but I guess you
want to leave in the middle of a verb so
its grave either way there's no good
time for him to really leave on the
strategy but yeah I think they need
someone to come in who who's obviously
experienced and you know it's kind of a
unique company right it's gone they have
a lot of employees and they're in a lot
of different markets as no there's not
many companies that do a similar thing
to what most of us so it's a difficult
role to fill in a difficult one if
you're an external candidate it's really
go for and I mean it's going to be
interesting but I don't think I don't
even give me someone internal okay well
we will keep an eye on that and all the
rest of the developments in this story
check out the verge calm including Steve
Ballmer's full retirement letter thanks
