are here checking out the asus padfone
their three in one set essentially the
first part of course being the phone
right here to 4.3 inch Ice Cream
Sandwich device it's expert it's
decently snappy enough it's got a 1.5
gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
processor it's not actually not too
thick actually feels pretty good for
lightweight got the camera the headset
your various ports and dogs are all
along the left side it's actually
becomes important later because what you
can do and once the big trick is once
you plug that in to the tablet right
here through the back it actually
becomes goes from the 4.3 inch phone to
the 10.1 inch tablet so if you look at
the back of the tablet you hit the
little switch off it opens up and the
phone goes here just basically all the
ports connect on the right side and
you've got the little other connector
right there basically just do what the
design says push in there close it up
and you should have a tablet if you've
ever use the Transformers it looks very
familiar in fact you just feel right at
home couple little things here you can
see the charge or the PadFone the
PadFone station that's what this is and
from there you can actually also look it
into this of the dock actually honestly
think it's this transformer prime dock
so basically the same ideas their tablet
goes into the keyboard you get a little
laptop asset the other big trick here is
your stylus which like to note like the
like the flyer you just theoretically it
there we go it's actually takes a little
more pressure than I expect and if you
can see the front is very plushy well
actually need to make a little plush and
I say this like so the other thing that
Johnny she was dancing around on stage
happily showing it was a stylist there's
actually a stylus headset you can see it
from here it looks just kinda like the
HTC Flyer stylus or any of us else for
that matter
you've got the USB plug here you've got
various little buttons on the important
thing though is while you're typing or
you're sketching out if actually it's
pretty soft well it's fun just trust me
if you get a phone call wires doing your
sketch work or whatever you can use this
in the heads that you actually just
talking to the pin like this I'm not
crazy I'm crazy but not because of this
and that said that is the PadFone in a
nutshell</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
