technology editor with the verge and I'm
reporting here from CES and very excited
because right now the founder of ohm
signal Stefan more so is joining me on
stage to talk about a really cool new
wearable that we've seen this here at
CES I don't know about you but I tend to
wear a lot of wearables yeah me too what
I where I mean I've we looked at the new
Fitbit earlier this week under armour
now has a band i wear pebble and the
always testing new wearables but this is
I think one of the coolest ones that
I've seen so far this year here's your
product dr. here um it's a bra so right
now i have with me a sports bra i have
to say that maybe some of the
demographic of the convention center
wouldn't appreciate this quite as much
as i do but this is the new umbra career
new product tell us a little bit about
it how does it work well first and
foremost it's it's a sports bra it's a
very high quality sports bra it's a
parallel so that's the first thing about
it and then there's the digital magic
and the biosensing in the wearable stuff
you know so the philosophy of this
product and of the company really own
signal is to turn your clothes and to
you know connected objects that deliver
value to your life actually this part
right here is where the technology lives
right this is your black box actually
not quite a lower indeed the bra is the
sensor so that yes exactly so the
textile is the magic that captures your
biological signal which captures a very
very deep cardiac signal captures
breathing as well which is tremendously
insightful in any context and movement
directly on the body so it's very good
place to capture movement and then it's
is this so what does this actually do
this is the bluetooth well just
bluetooth transmitter their storage in
there there's the battery this will send
it to the
signal app yeah correct data from there
to the cloud and your app is available
on iOS yep core android its iOS four now
okay so here this basically when you're
working out this is what you're seeing
course I'm seeing that's your heart rate
your we're wearing a gnome shirt right
now this is happening right always
connected it's animator 12 I'm not
making you too nervous media interviews
do that to me you're holding it down
quite well and then this is your
respiratory rate over here and that's
the calories that you've burned today oh
you you've done a great job with the cs
is a lot of work as you know you started
out making sure compression shirts for
men wearing one now tell me a little bit
about that is that basically this you're
getting the same experience the same
kind of material same data it's the same
core biometrics that we capture and the
shirt we've been at it for for several
years now so we're still at the
pre-production stage with with the broad
that's why we're launching in spring
where we're finalizing the the final
details on the product and for men like
we launched our own collection room
signal we also have a collection of the
market in partnership with ralph lauren
ralph lauren large polo tech shirt it is
powered by biome signal and we wanted to
do what I went to that event I did I
went to that event in New York City I
was surrounded by male models wearing
the arm signal compression shirt it was
really it was a very tough day at work
really was so much to you someone had
hope you appreciated the event how much
will this cost the startup kit will be a
hundred and forty nine dollars that will
include the bra and the box correct and
once you have the box you can transport
the box to the different bras and
additional bras will be $59 so once you
have to start up kit which is a very
competitive price relative to other kind
of wearable products and it captures
very deep biometrics you actually buy
additional bras at the price of a bra of
a high quality sports bra right I mean
you guys are a relatively new company
you're based in Montreal I've been there
for four years four years and some of
the apparel makers of course bigger
apparel makers are getting into
connected fitness now and doing this
type of thing if someone were to say you
know I don't really know um signal i'm
not super familiar with that company and
I'm I might be giving them a lot of
biometric data or a lot of
data right now how do they know that
they can trust that what you're doing is
accurate and that it's going to be in a
safe place but we take privacy very
seriously like we developed a data
architecture where the data is d
identified so in other words I can't see
your data unless you want me to the
signal we get we get it directly from
the torso level where the action happens
like the vital signs don't happen on the
wrist you know so you get a much much
deeper signal and it's it's a three lead
electrode that we have and we capture
not only your pulse we capture the the
electrical signature your heart your ECG
so it's a you know very very deep and
precise signal one of the things I've
been hearing a lot about at the show is
that this is the next stage of wearable
technology it's not necessarily going to
be accessories that we're wearing in
different parts of our body it's going
to be built into the things that we
already wear every day anyway but I also
hear from a lot of apparel makers and
wearable tech companies that there are
challenges serious challenges around
making tech that complicated and you
know they even someone asked me the
other day well how do you wash the thing
which is that that's usually the first
questions yeah he asks me how do I wash
it what would you say are the greatest
challenges this just being but from a
user your sweatshirt and I blazer
my shoes that you know how yeah I don't
well from a usage stamp or you can wash
it like we designed this to be standard
clothes you know so that's that the
paradigm like eventually all of our
clothes are going to be connected
objects so we want for you too don't you
know not change your behavior ultimately
and get all this this data it is
complicated to master smart textile at
scale like we work with very
sophisticated partners in the apparel
world and we try to bring so the
discipline of agile software development
to the textile world so there's a
convergence of disciplines that's not
easy to master for anyone this industry
doesn't exist yet Stefan I have one more
question for you Conan O'Brien pokes fun
at your bra on his late night show the
other night I'm not going to repeat the
joke here but you can go check it out on
conan show what was your reaction I've
got a segment
I woke up and I had hundreds of emails
of people sending me the link to his
show in in a nutshell I mean I must've
felt pretty cool yeah yeah yeah just the
punch here but you should see the bit
cuz you Conan's funny I'm not he says
that the on Brock could have been called
the tit bit you know that's what he said
in an oven it's gonna know bryan said it
you know you're not just repeating gonna
know right now thank you so much for
joining me on the bridge stage it's like
chatting with you and thanks so much for
