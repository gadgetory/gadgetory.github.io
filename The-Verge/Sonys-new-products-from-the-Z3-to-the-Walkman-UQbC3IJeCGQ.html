Aoife today including three new phones a
couple cameras and a $300 mp3 player
that appears to be directly from 2006
dieter bone you know all what's going on
to get these phones so it's three new z3
devices there's the the z3 which is I
think a 5.2 inch mmm-hmm device maybe
it's a little bigger though there's a
four point six inches III compact which
is sort of the ideal sweet spot phone
for them I think and then there's the z3
tablet compact which is an 8 inch device
but the streak of awful names any
it's insane right
so the tablets cool it's super thin but
you know it's an Android tablet so
whatever but the the z3 compact is the
one that I think is most exciting
because unlike most compact phones or
mini phones it's just fully Specht out
it's got the full megapixels a full
processor speed a really nice screen so
like if you want a good Android phone
that isn't gigantic this is the first
one in a while that there hasn't been
some weird compromise for so it looks
it's not like directly at the iPhone
Yeah right and if you want to enter it
from the good camera Sony's been kind of
the place to go yeah they've always been
a little bit better than everybody else
and there's always been like just one
little piece it's like aw man if you
guys will just fix X in your software
then we know you could be as good as the
iPhone so I'm really interested to see
what these do
it may be scaled back their software
crazy yeah they scaled it back a bit so
it's not I mean it's not as bad as the
super early days it's still not pure
Android but it's way better and so the
most exciting thing about all these
phones is that they integrate with the
ps4 yeah so it's I think it's a ps4
remote play so you could just if you are
on the same Wi-Fi network as your ps4
you just take the DualShock controller
that you've already got because you own
a ps4 and they sell a little plastic
mount for it you can I think you might
be able to do some touchscreen but they
want you to do with the data shock and
you just can play your PlayStation games
and if I have a ps4 and I'm going to buy
an Android phone I'm going to see if I
can get a Sony because that's awesome I
don't have to go buy a Vita I just could
do it on my phone and not only is that
super cool and it's one it's the first
time Sony's ever actually succeeded at
using its PlayStation brand on its
phones remember they used to they tried
to during a PlayStation from PlayStation
phone and there was like the store then
they had I tried this garbage like now
deal with HTC for a while like never one
anywhere who's doing they should ever
know anyways yeah so no this is great
that's like that that's what I want to
offer you Microsoft like you've been
making this promise for a long time
right and you can't well they've never
made the promise have they I mean that's
what it smart class this is off there
you ever got to the place where Sony has
gotten very quickly it seems like yeah
like the Microsoft should have been
doing this for years like I don't even
think it's on the horizon for them right
now so yeah like more bad news for the
Xbox one
Wow rough so speaking of cameras so
anyway they continuing through lens
cameras yes big mouse you can mount them
like an iPhone or any other phone you
get a better sensor in lens
yeah so it's just like a giant lens that
you would normally see on their little
alpha line of cameras you speed no the
NEX line and there they're like they're
basically the e-mount lens that's their
small format so there's a new one that's
the qx30 it's like a super zoom it's you
know it's a big-ass lens that you
strapped to the back earphone the thing
that I'm excited about is the QX one
which is still pretty expensive but it's
basically the mount and the sensor but
not the lens so if you're already bought
into Sony's camera ecosystem you've
already got the glass sitting around you
can just attach it to this and I was
really excited about the previous
generation of these but the software is
a little janky like yeah Sony they've
gotta make better stuff right and it's
the same stories always like oh we've
gotten better it's getting better it's
getting faster but is it faster than
pulling out the phone their camera
that's like not that much bigger than
this lens yeah yeah I think I mean but
the idea of having a great lens you can
take your photos directly to your phone
yeah is like awesome
yeah that's whether it's a super great
idea Sony's just to figure it out
what else they did watch is the only
Sony products today it is watch three
they finally switched to Android wear
it's just like a little puck that you
put into these horrible colored bands
yeah it's the they might have some
special software on top of where some
day but like it's a pretty uninspiring
Android wear device and then they've got
a fitness band that uses ePaper it's got
a curved display it's something
something talk and you can you can make
phone calls on it you can snap your
fingers to start and stop your music it
seems terrible so speaking of I mean
like this the last three products here
smartwatch yeah like it's just like
why'd you do this well at least we don't
have to watch Sony try and like cram
Android onto a tiny screen anymore right
like there used to be home and back and
like many buttons on these things but
that was fake Android
well it's like whatever so they just try
harder at this Sony and then lastly this
is my favorite of them all a $300 mp3
player the a 17 Walkman yep Sabri Mac
Walkman line it is literally as though
there was a caveman frozen in a
warehouse who woke up and was like I
have to do this it has no click wheel
has no touchscreen it's the four buttons
that failed in every product in 2006 and
it plays it sits up samples your music
yes
claims it's super high-end yeah there's
no syncing software you if to drag and
drop music onto it over USB I mean it is
just the perfect product for 2006 it is
and the whole claim is like Neil Young
is doing this pono thing that's like
really high-end audio there at Sony has
a high-end audio line of like receivers
and amps and all this like audiophile
stuff yeah meanwhile everyone else is
just listening to music on their phones
like through beats audio streaming and
it's I just don't or Spotify or whatever
and it's I don't understand this product
except for the odd like the audacity of
existence yeah like it's here the only
thing I can think is that it cost them
nothing to make it as so they're like
well look people are buying our ear
eaters so maybe they'll whatever yeah
yeah for a while likes it like they took
the e-readers and like the best that
Yeti reader staff was like what if we do
an mp3 player
sure why not Sony artists do you know
right subscribe
