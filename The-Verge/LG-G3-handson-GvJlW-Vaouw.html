right here is the LG g3 this is the
brand-new Android 4.4 handset that's
been introduced as the company's 2014
flagship and the thing that makes it
different from all the other ones is
this vast 5.5 inch display with quad HD
resolution 2560 by 1440 and extremely
small bezels on the side LG says this is
seventy six point seven percent display
out here on the front which is actually
even better than the company's previous
flagship the GT last year that's one of
the highlights the other one is this
metallic skin that LG has on the back
it's not actually metal it's
polycarbonate with a very thin layer
which OD says makes it extremely scratch
resistant otherwise in terms of specs
you're kind of looking at a really
standard configuration now Snapdragon
801 processor quad core 2 free gigabytes
of RAM 16 or 32 gigabytes of storage and
LG has a new simplified user interface
this is first time with the device
there's a lot of Korean software on here
so it doesn't feel too simple
immediately but you can see some of
these flipping and card animations that
LG has added and it's also made a big
deal out of the circular motif which
comes from the company's logo obviously
another big highlight here is also the
13 megapixel camera that LG has it
actually uses laser auto focusing system
now and as you can see a very simplified
interface so when you tap to focus it
captures at the same time and once the
capture is done you can come up here in
the top right corner for preview and
take a look at the image and border
focus and performance with this camera
seems to be extremely fast LG claims
it's the fastest
in world we suffer like 276 milliseconds
to focus and capture a picture where is
everybody else's apparently about 300
and a seconds the big new view is this
massive display fast performance laser
Road folks in the camera and this new
metallic skin around here on the back</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
