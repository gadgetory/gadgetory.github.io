low-cost version that's expected to have
a plastic body with a number of

encrusting new iphone cases and rubies
and diamonds how difficult is it to get
ahold of Mark Zuckerberg turns out not
so much at all the self-professed IT
expert recently discovered a
vulnerability the let him post links to
people's Facebook walls even if he
wasn't friends with them after the
social media giant ignored the issue he
reported the problem to Mark Zuckerberg
by posting about it on his facebook wall
within minutes Facebook began looking
into the issue which has since been
resolved moral of the story is that if
you want to get something done you gotta
do it yourself and contact one of the
most powerful men in the world via their
facebook and finally you know who likes
mysteries JJ Abrams whose mysteries do
we like most JJ Abrams today his
production company bad robot posted a
