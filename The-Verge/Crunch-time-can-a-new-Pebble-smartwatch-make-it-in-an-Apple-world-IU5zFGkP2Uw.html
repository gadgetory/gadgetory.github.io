my smart ball and this is my pebble back
in the spring of 2012 a small company
called pebble launched a project on
Kickstarter promising a new take on
smartwatches the project proved wildly
successful both legitimising Kickstarter
as a platform and establishing the
modern SmartWatch market
three years later pebble is going head
to head with the tech industry's biggest
players CEO Eric midget Koski doesn't
seem particularly worried though
2014 was a massive year for us we grew
our developer base from just a few
thousand developers to over 26,000
developers by the end of the year we
launched an app store going from zero
apps to over 6500 apps now and we sold
our millionth unit following the
original pebble smartwatch and the
pebble steel that came in 2014 the
company is now launching its newest
product pebble time pebble time has a
color ePaper screen it's still always on
that means you don't have to tap a
button or flick your wrist just to see
what time it is the battery life is
still up to seven days and it's daylight
readable that's that's really important
to us like we're taking the spot of the
watch on your wrist and so one of the
primary functions that pebble always has
to do is be a really damn good watch
when we started this project one of the
issues we wanted to address was are we a
SmartWatch are we a phone on our wrist
or are we our to watch there's all this
talk about fashion or technology and I
don't believe pebble is either and so we
try to avoid one of the other yet strike
our own path the new watch is a logical
progression of the pebble design
it's slimmer lighter and slightly more
attractive than pebbles earlier models
but it's not likely to be mistaken for
an Apple watch or Samsung gear it almost
looks like a tamagotchi on your wrist
and it has a playfulness that makes it
closer to the original pebble than the
pebble steel there's a slight curve and
it sits on your wrist nicer than pebbles
previous designs but perhaps the biggest
change pebble made to this watch was a
switch to a color ePaper display it's
not nearly the same kind of display as
Android wear watches or will find on the
Apple watch but it lets pebble
developers work with 64 colors instead
of just two
it's more like the screen on a gameboy
color than a modern color smartphone
display there's also a new microphone
which lets you dictate quick replies
incoming messages and create voice notes
the markets expanded there's a bunch
more people making smart watches would
be crazy to say that we don't try every
single one of them and and see what
works you know works well in particular
you know we've tried before some other
smart watches the best feature that we
found was responding to notifications
the issue with a lot of other products
is that it doesn't usually work we
wanted to make sure that we would be
able to build a system that works we did
that by constraining it down to
something that we know we can deliver
but the time is just one component of
Pebbles broader ambitions the company is
also launching an entirely new software
platform that throws out all of its old
paradigms and incorporates a new
structure based on an idea of a running
timeline there's this urge to do more
with your watch to control things in
your life to perceive information but
the structure that we've put together
for pebbles operating system didn't
really enable them and so we constructed
a completely new operating system around
the concept of your own personal
timeline I'm here on my watch place it
can be our watch face or any of the
watch faces you love and I want to see
what's coming up next so I just clicked
down in 10 meeting minutes I have a
meeting cool sunny reminder to pick up
the kids there's a movie today so I can
click and see that we know that a lot of
people not only care about what's coming
up next but you're out of a meeting you
want to see if you missed something so I
can just click up
Oh super-important email or a game that
was interested in or I just know didn't
my eight thousand steps they're all here
now how do existing apps watch faces
integrate with this new timeline so it's
still the same way you click in and you
can see what we call app phases so this
is the music player you can see the
stocks app and whatever apps you've
installed there will be here we have no
limit right now in apps so you can stall
how many ever apps you want and over
here pal says that all the thousands of
existing watch faces and apps that
developers have already created will be
able to integrate with this new timeline
but developers won't even have to go far
is building out specifically for the
pebble a new web interface will let them
inject data right into the pebbles
timeline and let the watch display in
the most logical way it can all of this
makes pebble less of a specific
SmartWatch maker and more of a wearable
platform provider along with this
refocus on pebble as a platform has come
a new focus on whimsical and informative
design it's a stark departure from the
utilitarian look of pebbles older
software it looks like from what we've
seen in this new platform that pebble is
introducing the design is a much bigger
focus than it was before why is that
well the main reason for that is
actually I think the screen and it has
it brings with it a lot of character of
its own even without design you have
this things that looks look a little bit
like you know e paper glitches you know
and little it stretches a little bit so
we took that and actually work with it a
little you know push it a little further
another thing was orientation when you
look at the actual transitions they are
morphing instead of like taking you from
one place to another place which is a
lot of I think mental burden when you
start looking at this and it's a very
very small port for the company is
actually going back in time for the
launch of the new watch it's making it
available via Kickstarter beginning
today the time will be available to
early backers for discounted price of
one hundred and fifty nine dollars and
it will cost one hundred and ninety nine
dollars when it hits proper retail
channels in May the importance of this
launch for pebble can't be understated
it's coming amid an entry by Apple into
the wearables world last year's launch
of Android wear failed to make its
biggest flash as many we're expecting
but there's no doubt that Google is
working hard to change that do you think
that there is room for a third
SmartWatch player one zap
and Google hit their stride I think the
answer is 100% yes I think it would be a
disservice to the world to say that
there's only going to be two smartphone
operating systems and by definition
those are the two SmartWatch operating
systems as well when we look at the
problem of how do you build software for
the for the watch we're not thinking
exclusively of how it works with Android
or how it works with iOS we don't have a
legacy of developers and thousands and
millions of apps that we have to support
out of the box we can think about what
deserves to be on the wrist
we're still in the very early days of
smartwatches and wearables much like the
pre iPhone smartphone world pebble is
hoping to use its early mover status to
its advantage and establish itself as a
major player before the market really
matures the time and its new software
lean into pebbles established strength
long battery life always on display
cross-platform compatibility and rapid
software iteration whether those
strengths are enough to hold pebble up
in the battle to come
remains to be seen but major Kowski is
more confident than ever that pebbles
approach is the right one you know
trying to put yourself back in the 2007
you know smartphone era you try to ask
2007 Eric what features he'd be using on
his smartphone in 2015 and I would
probably get a lot of them wrong we're
probably in the 2007 days of
smartwatches but when you think about it
there's years and years ahead of us and
improving the technology and building
new functionality and building new you
know ways that we can interface between
your SmartWatch and the rest of your
life and that's why we're here we were a
bit surprised that it took some people
two years to actually get into the game
after we published the entire project on
Kickstarter back in 2012 but sure enough
and other people have arrived and we
take it as a continuing challenge this
is what we do
