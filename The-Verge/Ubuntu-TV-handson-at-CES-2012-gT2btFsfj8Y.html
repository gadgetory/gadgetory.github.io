looking at a boon to TV which is running
on regular boon tubes running on regular
Adam hardware right now it runs on arm
as well it's kind of a proof of concept
right now but as you can see it's
basically a full-on media center they're
hoping to integrate it into like TVs
that you can actually buy and so you can
just you can navigate through movies
they're going to have their own movie
store you can also view movies that
you've recorded from from live TV
they'll work with cable card or whatever
service your your country is partial to
go in here you can rent and buy we'll
just play the trailer right now they're
just using a boxy remote but they'll
obviously have their own standard they
use a bluetooth so it should be pretty
generic for control you can get into
settings here there's a thumbnail
preview and also you can go through
chapters if you want to skip around and
let's get out of there and also while
you're while you're watching TV oh no
I'm gonna get this I'm gonna get this
you can also pull up the browser so you
can browse through things while the live
TV or movie is still playing in the
background they've got a kind of a demo
of let's get out of here oh so we've got
a demo of their TV guy this isn't live
data right now but you know it looks
pretty pretty standard and also there's
a search interface let's slot it's not
like regular unity if I can get it over
to it
there we go
so you can just search uh men there we
go really what a lot of searching for a
bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
