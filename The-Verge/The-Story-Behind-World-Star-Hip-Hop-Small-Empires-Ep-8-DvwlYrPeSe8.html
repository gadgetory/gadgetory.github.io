means st. Diego is home to things like
Navy tech biotech fish tacos and cue the
founder of WorldStarHipHop not a lot of
people in tech talk about this startup
and yet it affects millions of people
every day even the phrase world star is
itself a mean this is the front page of
all this stuff on the internet you won't
find anywhere else
and now the queue has developed this
huge following I'm here to find out what
are you gonna do next I'm Alexis Ohanian
start-up founder and Y Combinator
partner over the last year I went on a
200 event book tour and met people
building small empires all across North
America now I'm back with a new season
revisiting some of my favorite stuff
short old entrepreneurship is not
typically a solo endeavor many startups
are founded by duo's and even trios and
even solo founders usually have
experienced advisors and investors to
ask for advice and give them directions
the company grows however some founders
like Q the creator of WorldStarHipHop
choose to go it alone and brave the
challenges of starting a business by
themselves and that can really pay off
namely when you don't have anyone's
opinion to sway you in one way or
another you can take big risks and
create exactly the type of company you
want on your terms
if I got this right you started the
website for like mixtapes it was a
spinoff from my original website NYC fat
mixtapes which I created in 2001
originally it was it was a mixtape
download website how did that turn into
like worldstar what was it that really
kicked it off that means you realized
forget mixtapes this is the future we
got half that was down literally for
like eight nine months no sort of
packing up and then saying forget I was
real imma come back and we wanted to
snap videos when you were coming up in
Queens did you expect to be doing this
nah I thought I'll be a stand-up or
definitely new acting and that was my
first passion I never thought I'd be
doing internet stuff instead of being in
front of the camera you're the guy who's
built a network that everyone wants to
be on what what has inspired us I think
worldstar establish yourself as a you
know Internet phenomenal with its
content
you know no one was given that
in-your-face news but I feel like it was
my my duty to give awareness to everyone
you know like the Ferguson situation and
I felt like you know camera is great
it's a positive and a negative with it
but you know you have to look at the
good the bad and the ugly in one page
and I noticed that you know this is this
is our community this is this is what
this is what's going on what are the
things you think people don't understand
the people who don't get it what are the
things that they don't understand that
they should worldstar does so we like to
give what's happening and our daily
basis of what's going on and music
entertainment sports funnies we show it
all you know we're not just going to
show 100% fights or 100% music videos or
you know we felt like entertainment just
like cable TV you got all types of
entertainment it's what suits you I'll
tell the people that you have the
control of the remote you can either
watch someone tighten or you watch
someone you know picking flowers you
know it's your choice to point me out
just because I'm hip hop on black I
think is biased you know I'm saying
because I can create fight so I didn't
create porn I didn't create none of this
stuff which everyone seemed to blame me
and point things out when you look at
how far world star is coming it's a it's
a phenomenon right you know I mean like
you just hear you hear people say
worldstar right here's a me
on camera now so battlecry yeah
wolf star roll star yeah well stop yeah
you played a Rasta how does it make you
feel like shit Minh I feel like I'm like
you know it feels good it feels good
that um you know that worldstar became
like a battle cry you can say this and
also for something funny like if you
step in for our stuff so it's not just a
fighting what to go down you know I feel
like it's a compliment
how's that for badass started I was
initially you how many people are
working on it now right now we have 10
staff workers still still pretty lean
yeah and then where are they oh we have
the most spread out the country man I
mean you've been able to manage and grow
this entirely remotely yea remotely no
office how do you build how do you build
a culture in a company how do you build
accountability mentally mentally
stressed you know because I can't
monitor them I don't have a supervisor
I'll try to find self motivators those
are driven to to want to work and very
passionate and I'm known for firing a
lot of people don't say so I don't have
a no-nonsense policy man you don't say
I'll treat you like family
but as soon as you disrespect the
company brand you're walking into it you
know to Disneyland you know we're we're
already established we're already been
number one five years in a row in BP hip
hop so you know I just tell people to
come in with great passion and really
want to work hard you know whenever a
video gets uploaded to a worldstar is
anyone reviewing or it just goes up yeah
we we have we have a staff a few guys
that just look at the videos and pick
and choose which one which makes sense
um you know we want to constantly look
at the videos because it's a lot of sick
stuff out there that we don't want to
put out you know I read someone fight
and grab a gun
you know I sure like this you know
people want to complain about the fights
uh fighting is not the answer but some
people need to just squat it out - so
don't get that aggression out I mean
people love it I mean our country is
built by violence we love watching
violence I mean you know we love it so I
just think that I'm pointing out a lot
of blame because I'm black I'm hip-hop
us as a culture always getting blamed
and they don't want to blame the
community leaders or the parents you
know say like why you blaming me for I'm
just the messenger you know recent
American culture last 20th century now
in the 21st has largely been black
culture which has been exported all over
the world that's still one of America's
biggest most influential exports yeah
but oftentimes more often than not there
was someone in the middle
usually a rich white person who
delivered that message and profited from
it what does it mean now that the
creators of the culture are empowered
enough to sort of control its
dissemination no it's great that we are
now taking control of oh you know our
sound our culture you know many years
you know you know we we couldn't take
control singing the past and how it was
it made us smarter you know sometimes it
keeps you because this makes you more
humble and appreciative now today of
what you have the technology today you
can all we can all make it you know I'm
saying it's an even playing field right
now
worldstar gets a lot of traffic and
those servers cost money most sites with
lots of traffic get advertisers to pay
for those servers but advertisers tend
to shy away from controversial content
which is exactly what worldstar is full
of they've embraced it in spite of that
cue and his team have somehow managed to
court some really big name advertisers
you know you've managed to grow a really
devoted following lots of viewers yeah
you you haven't shot away from
sometimes controversial content and yet
you've still been able to get brands
like Walmart big money brands who
advertise and want to partner how do you
do that with the advertisers I never
wanted to reach out to them I felt like
if advertisers want to want to do
advertising with the company they have
to go by our rules notice I don't need
your money you know this is who I am
this is what is what I like to be
entertained by and those that like it
know come join and advertisers felt like
you can't beat them join them
he's not going to change and they can't
deny the numbers so they just work
around some of the you know
controversial content who your mentors
role in this business be honest ain't no
one helped me yes there's no one you
know I said during my own tough you know
and I have that mentality I like to owe
anyone anything so I don't like to ask
for favors or actual all my knees I'm
poor
I'll work to get out of my person is go
for my handout or playing the government
or blame my parents
blame blame blame blame and that's how I
am I I'm just driven you know there's
this whole world of tech now that
everyone's talking about everyone's
hyping it up tech startups but I feel
like worldstar hasn't been a big part of
that conversation what what do you think
of peers like BuzzFeed and what do you
think of worldstar not really being a
part of the mainstream tech discussion
oh we like that black sheet you know
we're you know where we grew up fast
we did it we did it differently than
most we didn't go that that route that
most do I like to have my action speak
you know I don't really need support or
others to give me the thumbs up that
we're doing okay I just look at the
scoreboard you know I tell them about
you know but I felt like yeah we should
be in topic conversation with them
because you know we grew organically we
didn't have no capital investors and
there were no VCS
ah a lot of these cloud you start up
these big companies have investors and
they put millions into their into their
projects and I never I never took any I
turned down a lot of money the most was
15 million and I'll I don't want to give
me money but then they want to change
world star and make it into a you know
sugar-coated site and I didn't want it
to sell out and we're that that's that's
our attitudes like nothing controversial
is fight sex this is what we are and
we're real like to like to be reporters
for the streets you know I mean that's
what world stories reporting live from
the streets you know the idea of
building a brand first and a business
second is not something you hear often
in tech pitch meetings but there is a
precedent for this entrepreneurs like
jay-z Russell Simmons and Diddy all
build brands for themselves first and
then build businesses around them so
what is next
well we have a movie with Paramount
right what's the circus or Simmons
dancing yeah how did that happen
it's been over a year process they've
been talking to us about finding a good
script and get put a bunch of riders in
and and I wanted something to be more
80s style where you know have a good
storyline what are ones in particular
you mentioned there in those production
meetings you're like it's got to be like
I mean I said I'm fast I'm Richmond High
Ferris Bueller Porky's zap and is this
gonna be the story of world star no it's
just one of those movies I met just
mentioned anyway 2015 version got it
where young kids today are on their
phones and they recording and like
thinking about it but doesn't work sorry
what do you think it means to that
generation to get a video on worldstar I
mean it's like the biggest stage right
now for them they they want to be on it
because they know all their friends on
it the audience is just it's just so
it's so big you know we have a big view
stage it was like a Amateur Night at the
Apollo know if you can make it there you
can make it anywhere and if you can
survive world star comments which is
brutal they're gonna haters gonna talk
about you and push your buttons and you
can withstand that and if you really
really shine on world star you're a star
that we got the hardest critics so one
of your users described world star as
like being back in the barber shop you
know why is it important to have these
online forms for people to just freely
discuss like they would if they were
back now you can talk about things
what's happening in the hood without
even being the hood so now it's like you
know the hood is still there you know
you can get a picture you can get a
glimpse and what's happening what's
going on because you know there's a lot
of people that leave the hood you know
they they um you know their hearts to it
like my heart still hood you know I'm
from the hoods of Queens and you know
even though I live now and California I
my heart still is still that you know I
mean like I loved when I came from so so
thankful to come from that from that
environment
so we'll start keeps me keeps me there
keeps me in the loop what's happening
so what was the moment
you know you the site was growing yeah
but at some point it became a business
what was that point I was getting calls
from labels and they wanted to advertise
more and more and I'm getting calls from
the labels as well as artists to post
their exclusive videos and I started
noticing that you know we were growing
we need to take advantage of this so I
know it was a business then I was one
the first guys to tell advertisers that
no net 30 no net 60
I want my money upfront and they didn't
and they said okay that further like we
never do that crazy where I'm like okay
then I guess you don't with my business
hung up but then they'll call days later
and say okay what are we going to check
so that's what I know that you know I I
knew it's a business but again you know
this is my way you know you want to come
to me I don't haven't come to you guys
and and I was sales team which is myself
and one other guy and I was just doing
business the way I wanted to
mmm I say you want to be on my website
pay me you know simple as that you know
that's just the way it is malignant man
and I mean you know the the ad manager
the ad rep for Walmart probably had
never heard that before
mmm they don't they don't get that now I
have to ask you didn't spend any money
on advertising but how did you start
spreading the word early on because it
was I mean just you right so what did
you whether any clever tricks that you
used any any things you did to spread
the word now key thing you know we is
watermark I'm really big on that
I'm saying so you know I want to first
to always push that watermark you know
it wasn't a hashtag you know whatever it
was more like the logo or your your
website in the bottom and we were the
first to really push that out there and
when we get these exclusive videos you
know yes exclusive but someone can
easily take the video and embed it and
put it on his site so if you know what a
market and how does how's that exclusive
for us so I'll very important to me is
always water market and people see that
logo they you know automatically knew
okay where who is this guy which was
well star and they stopped coming to our
site organically because we watermark
our stuff you could be just about
anywhere but you said it's a remote team
yeah yet you're here in San Diego I love
it cuz what is it is the fish tacos the
weather why San Diego's a long way from
Queens as peaceful you know the beach is
right there you know is clean fresh air
I love the city and on city city San
Diego's just amazing to me know this is
a lifestyle choice yeah not too far from
LA and I think I'll be doing lot of
stuff in LA now but now I can live away
from LA and raise my children and you
know they have better schooling's here
and the area we live in San Diego and
it's a win-win you know cuz I can work
anywhere I want yeah so why not work
somewhere would have better schooling
and for my children so that they have a
bright future social media has clearly
had an impact places like Ferguson what
are your thoughts I mean how do you
think technology will continue to
hopefully empower like marginalized
communities now we could document and I
really hope people accounted for now
everyone has camera phones you're being
watched and
I'm trying to let people know with with
my website it's bringing awareness to
everyone that I'll be careful because
everyone is watching and I'm saying you
got to be careful
can't go hi was back in the days you
know you can't kill somebody and streets
and not think about someone filming you
you know it's gotta be very careful that
with technology growing you can't get
away with much these days and you know
that's the way it should be you know we
might have a better a better better
future if you all kind of like just
think twice now before it's doing
something that you can
makes you more humble and appreciative
now today of what you have look at me
you know say I'm a black man I did it
you know I didn't have no help no banks
no no family help no friends help I did
it by myself you know saying so I did it
I'm sure he wants to Oscar door too
she was an entrepreneur unlike nearly
any other I've met he was born poor in
Queens was a high school dropout didn't
have any kind of a network didn't have
any investors or mentors maybe because
of that he's been able to do business
his way and as a result of the success
that world star has had advertising
merchandise and how even a movie deal
it's clear that WorldStarHipHop is here
to stay
I get nervous in freely
yeah camera see all right San Diego
named after Saint Diego I'm sorry I
won't do it oh it do it sorry
let's do one what's the what how does
how does will ferrell do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
