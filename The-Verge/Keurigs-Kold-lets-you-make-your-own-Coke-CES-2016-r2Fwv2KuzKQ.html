the verge at CES 2016 and tonight we're
going to be taking a look at Keurig Kold
brewing machine which is appropriately
called the cold with a case so yeah let
me walk you through how it works so in
terms of functionality this is pretty
similar to curate hop ring machines
you've probably seen them at your office
in your house something like that you
have these pods which are made by
coca-cola or by curate itself and the
only main difference is that they have a
little foil thing on the bottom that you
need to remove and then there's a groove
within the machine itself that you have
to line up with so I'm gonna take the
little foil seal off of this and then
I'm going to pop it in there we go
and I'm gonna hit brew here and it's
gonna start and this process takes about
60 to 80 seconds so it will take a while
for the machine to pull the water and
spit out the carbonated drink within the
pot itself are these little beads
carbonate or beads that contain the co2
that makes the drink fizzy so once the
water contacts them that's going to make
the drink pop and get that that fizzy
action no one likes a flat pop right so
as you can see the machine is spitting
out my coca-cola classic here it's
carbonated and it looks like the right
color and in addition to coca-cola
products like ginger ale sprite coke
things like that it also makes cure eggs
in house cocktail mixes some other cool
beverages so yeah I'm gonna give it a
try
it takes I mean it tastes like Coke I'm
I'm more of a diet coke man myself I
probably should've grabbed a diet coke
puffs but it tastes like regular coke I
I can't complain so in terms of
availability in price point the Curie
Colts actually been available since the
end of September you're looking at
anywhere between 299 and 369 depending
on the mandible stuff like that and for
the pods themselves they run at 399 for
a pack of four so compared to regular
Cola cans drink and stuff like that the
serving sizes are a little smaller and
depending on where you're buying your
cans of Diet Coke they may be a little
less expensive but that's the price for
the pods themselves yeah so that's
Keurig Kold machine I hope you liked the
video thanks for checking it out if you
