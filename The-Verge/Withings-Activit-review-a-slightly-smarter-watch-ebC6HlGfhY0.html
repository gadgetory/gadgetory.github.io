the Withings activity first is that it's
pronounced activity not activity or
activate or anything else activity its
French second you need to know that the
activity is not a SmartWatch it's just a
slightly smarter or watch for four
hundred and fifty dollars the activity
combines a really handsome stainless
steel and sapphire wristwatch with a
pretty basic fitness tracker it tracks
your steps and your sleep using the
accelerometer to figure out what you're
doing even works as an alarm buzzing
your wrist to wake you up in the morning
it syncs by a Bluetooth to weddings
health mate app which is powerful and
useful if not terribly beautiful
activity support is iPhone only for now
by the way but Android support is coming
soon I like the app and I like that it
takes your data and yells at you to do
better or go to bed earlier or drink
more water but really none of that has
to do with the watch itself the watch is
just a watch that there's nothing else
to say about it is exactly the point
it's beautifully perfectly assembled
made in Switzerland and stamped with
that oh so important Swiss made label it
is a really nice calf leather band that
I like a lot though I don't understand
why it comes in only one size and why
it's not a universal band so it's easy
to replace it's clearly designed to work
for both men and women and so it's right
in the middle of the size spectrum it
worked fine for my average sized wrist
but it'll be just physically too small
for a lot of people the Sapphire front
face of the activity has this cool
rounded glass which bulbs out a little
above the face it looks nice like it's
expensive and difficult to make but it
causes some awkward reflections and can
make the watch hard to see in some light
the whole watch has a little of this
curved aesthetic which looks really nice
but can be a little awkward and loves
catching on my jacket sleeve when I try
to take it off everything about its
design is simple and understated twelve
dashes and two hands show you the time
and a second small dial shows your step
count progress from zero to a hundred
percent there's really no evidence that
there's technology inside here it just
looks like a watch everything you do all
the settings even changing the time all
happens inside the app the watch is just
a watch and a basic data collection
device there's one downside and two big
upsides to that approach the downside is
that there's just not that much data on
the watch you have to do everything on
your phone the upside is that you won't
need to upgrade your activity for years
the software and algorithms will get
better without needing new hardware and
you already have all the sensors and
tools you
the other is that since the watch isn't
actually doing very much it doesn't need
much power it runs on a watch battery
and only needs to be replaced every
eight months every supposedly smart
watch should be that way everyone should
be like the activity in a lot of ways
actually it's clear that it doesn't take
much to add fitness tracking tech to a
simple wristwatch and that it doesn't
affect things like battery or design in
a detrimental way four hundred and fifty
dollars here buys a watch you'll
actually want to keep for years which I
really can't say about anything else
you'd call a Smart Watch it's expensive
yeah but if you're willing to spend this
much on a watch this is a totally solid
option this isn't the future of
smartwatches it's not even a Smart Watch
don't buy it instead of a moto 360 or an
Apple watch when it comes out buy it
because it's a really nice watch and
because it's just a little bit smarter</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
