best show about dental hygiene on
YouTube I'm assuming there are no other
shows about dental hygiene on youtube I
hope several guys show I'm the I've saw
the energy for the birds Paul Miller's
here at all hello
we were just we have it loaded show
today so we're just gonna get right into
it Ashley Carmen is here and you have
brought us toothbrushes yep I brought
you a bunch of connected toothbrushes I
feel like by the way the chats going
asked his questions in the chat about
the segments and we'll answer the
questions she asked unrelated things I
will look at them you might see a smile
across my face and then I won't answer
them so a segment at the end we'll do
open questions but Ashley I feel like
your beat is basically we put a chip in
it and now what happens yeah and
proprietary things and proprietary lots
of proprietary boats if you put a chip
in a toothbrush what happens tooth
brushing sucks more than it already did
but I'm very excited about these
toothbrushes okay so this is the play
brush actually saw us at CES okay and
instead of a full-blown smart toothbrush
which are these over here this is
literally just a bluetooth dongle if I
can it's a dongle for your toothbrush
yes you can put any regular plain
toothbrush inside this dongle okay and
then it has a companion of course right
so I could show you guys the companion
is a track your brushing data and send
it to Google your parents will know
that's a big brother
it's a Paul yes one of the big things
about this toothbrush is it's for kids
and kids hate to brush their teeth and
you want them to brush for two minutes
so you have to play games to get them to
do this what did this two minute thing
come into play touch all the surfaces
right so this is my avatar yep this is
you Paul wearing
nice night's outfit how do I know what
to do now
okay so I'm gonna press play somebody
says Gabe says how do you dongle a
toothbrush you literally just stick it
on the end of the tooth yeah there's
just a literal Bluetooth chip two
minutes okay so I'm gonna press play not
gonna brush for two minutes that's for
sure okay it's saying brush twice a day
cool all right three let me see if I can
get this volume up to okay there's some
great music so see there's some like
enemies coming up you gotta figure out
oh you're going the wrong way
see I see if you have the toothbrush in
a very specific direction mm-hm
now I come over there you got it you
gotta figure this out no I'm just
brushing the side of my tongue that's
what they want to be Oh No yeah so this
is the thing about this the play brush
is it's not too I don't think it's super
accurate I don't think it gives you the
best clean but if the whole point is
just you want your kids have a
toothbrush in their mouth for two
minutes then you're killing I'm killing
it when I fake it
yeah I feel like kids love to fake it
when you're a kid don't you fake washing
their hands anything responsible no
thing my niece and nephew just turn on
the water and then turn off clever full
minute and a half ago how did you on
score you got seven of nine rewards you
did a terrible job though so caught you
run so then what I really love about
this is they've gamified the entire
experience these are just random kids
from around the world you're first in
your own game Michael Singletary says I
can't wait for the first smart
toothbrush company data breach oh yeah
yeah so it's just show people that
dongle here is people are asking about
it so just it that's all it is
mmm-hmm it it just accelerometer is
rubber you can take this out and then
there's a little micro USB
my god are you charging yeah Wow Wow
yeah and it's all just a moment and
accept what this product is and that you
have to plug it into my well and then
they want to sell you on a subscription
service so you get one game for free but
if you want all the games you can pay
$2.99 a month and then they sell another
service where they'll mail you
toothbrushes I feel like your beat is
also the darker side and there is one
free game there is a free game yeah okay
we'll work our way up okay so this is
the Colgate one right here you've made
me heard about this because it's apples
first like health type product that
they're selling them there for you so
this like connects to like health kit on
an iPhone right yeah yeah yeah well I
don't know actually if it does I don't
think it does but it's just there it's
only on iOS like you can't buy this for
Android yeah yeah so this is an iOS only
toothbrush I want everyone to be
extraordinary that makes an Android
version a Colgate has branded the iOS
version in Apple stores only runs Apple
music yeah okay you've got another no
this is another and this one's a little
bit more like they accept that parents
and kids will play this so you have
coach Plus like coach this will guide
adults through their brushing and then
you have the kids games which obviously
you're gonna play okay we're gonna do
this game go pirate all right I feel
like when I want to start brushing my
teeth I like using an iPad app yeah well
that's the whole thing I've been using
it says put to threat so we did that
fresh in my mouth then you turn on and
then really do the same so yeah down
here this visualizes it for you I'm
winning yeah you're doing great really
use this kind of visuals
oh good already a lot of spit and we did
plan
for that there you go
there you go and then you'll basically
go for two minutes you'll keep we'll
just go ahead and assume that yeah it
wants you to keep going you're gonna
this is just like a really basic yeah so
this is just again like an accelerometer
inside and then it's just one type of
brush head mmm wood you'll see it with
our next toothbrush is kind of a bummer
yeah it's not really how much is this
situation
that one's a hundred dollars a week is
there like an epidemic in America of
people not brushing their teeth what are
we trying to what sort of game of fight
Nilay yeah yeah and I think for kids it
makes sense I don't know if adults
really need this much particular help
maybe they do okay I mean I just like I
grew up in the 80s and I was taught to
brush my teeth did you yes John says at
least there is an argument for a
dedicated bathroom tablet now oh yeah
you build it into the Oh finally a
reason to use the smart mirror yeah you
load the toothbrushing app into the
smart mirror and it tells you how good
you doing yeah positive reinforcement
but what if you actually are I would say
a fancy person a fancy person well then
I have a $220 smart toothbrush for you
this is the Sonicare DiamondClean smart
time and these have different brush
heads these all do different things this
is the tongue scraper mark and every
brush had the smart ones because you can
use regular ones have a little RFID chip
inside so when you put it on top of the
handle it recognizes immediately so this
brush head is for whitening so you can
see it immediately lights up like it's
in the white program if I did the tongue
scraper it'd be a shorter program things
like that so there's always an app I've
been actually testing this for a month
or two now and I never sync it with my
phone because I don't bring my phone in
the bathroom in the morning I'm just
like I just need to go brush my teeth
that's not a thing it's a means to an
end yeah is for adults there's no game
no there's no game this is truly like
just you need to brush this is the area
you need to brush if you want to set
goals for your plaque or
it doesn't measure knee that though it
keeps track of it for you other modes if
I just take this off let's do the tongue
scraper yeah which I have already seen
Ashley put on our tongue tongue mode
yeah and what does that change exactly
there we go well so now if I use the
tongue mode which I can hit horrible
disgusting things that were on yours
yeah can I just be very honest with you
so I'm scraper is like a very Indian
like Indian families have them they're
just like little loops of metal that
cost like five cents a lot of Instagram
influencers have really been pushing the
tongue scrapers regular manual
toothbrush on Amazon and it just has
like rubber scrapey parts on the back of
yeah but what you want is an app with an
animation and a timeline so this is 220
bucks yeah are they making any of these
people making medical claims beyond we
will incentivize you to brush your teeth
I don't think so I think they say you
can work with your dentist like if
you're Dennis s - hey you really need to
focus on your lower teeth sit down also
each of these smart brushes cost more
than ten dollars and they want you to
replace well so this is the reason that
we care right that's right so this is
its wireless charging hub popping in
there that's was charging and I was like
okay what is it about this Wireless yes
already cut do you like me Oh cuz I have
an iPhone 10 yes so it's cheap that's I
don't know if we've solved any problems
here today but I do like this I just
throw my phone down on this electricity
yeah you're charging cuff great do you
think I'd feel good about so you have
you've been using this one yeah are you
into it so I've actually been using
electric toothbrushes since
forever my parents are very big on the
electric toothbrush for you yeah it's
definitely better than a manual tsearch
but I just don't want to sink a nap
I don't I'm not gonna look at my screen
I don't bring my phone in the bathroom
with me right when I wake up in the
morning I just go straight to the
bathroom and then brushing my teeth so
it's like I'm not gonna look at my
thoughts tell your phone about how you
did yeah you can go back and revisit
like oh you missed this spot you can
tell it's in your mouth if you don't
know where you missed when you brushed
your teeth you need to just pay more
attention to your sign says I like it so
what you got one customer out there we
actually have a super packed show for
all of you yet we got to move right on
I'm Garten burgers gonna join us we're
gonna take apart an iPod and replace its
hard drive with some SD cards mm-hmm
Donny's gonna be here we're gonna play
with some blue to styluses and see where
that leads us but next Ashley's gonna
run over there to the a circuit breaker
corner and Ashley and Jake are gonna
answer the questions that people have
been sending in all this week that's
right we have a new segment asks circuit
breaker the news actually literally
nothing happened this past week so this
is why we had to fill this in but we got
some questions from people over the past
week we had some good questions Twitter
came through we may or may not answer
them we've only promised that we will
ask the big questions but our first
question is about smart homes and how do
you get started with them which i think
is a good question something that I
think about probably a little bit too
often for just my own purposes even
though I advise should I give but I
actually think the answer for this is
getting like easier and easier so first
things first is an echo dot you can get
one for like thirty dollars on sale
basically all the time and that will
give you a sense of whether you like I
mean voice control is basically the way
to control smartphone products right now
and that'll give you a sense of if
you're comfortable with that if that
feels natural to you and
you know you'll get a sense of if it's
gonna become a thing yeah gonna make
your brand I I thought I'd be very
uncomfortable with it and I'm still a
little uncomfortable with it but it's it
grows more and more natural and then I
would say the second thing to get is
some smart lights my favorite are the
Philips hue they are really easy to set
up they are very reliable which is the
most important thing here and they're
very expandable so if you decide that
you do really like smart lights there
are a ton of different options you can
get I would not necessarily start out
with the multicolored ones that are like
really expensive
I don't you think you should you like
them but I think they're cool I don't
but you have to know what you're doing
with color that's I'm not like a
multicolored lighting extra I can manage
to like Bluto orange ones they're like
choose your tone relax I mean I have a
light at home that I've been testing the
sole from GE and it has an Alexa
actually built into the light and I love
the smart light aspect of it but only
because I use actually its app so when
I'm on the way it's my apartment I'm
connected to my Wi-Fi so I'm like
walking up the stairs
and I turn on the light from the hallway
which feels like an act to me I'm like
it does face you've made it yeah I don't
use the odds I actually amuse the Alexa
mobile that's your goodnight I mean I do
feel a little creeped out about the
always-on stuff but it's just so
convenient I never open the app yeah and
if you're gonna get started with a smart
home it's like get a smart speaker just
try it out see if you like it you're not
putting that much money up front for the
dot for sure and then there's some like
obvious next steps if this is all going
well for you Nest's thermostat and smoke
detector are really cool ring has you
know doorbells so there's some really
you know natural places to expand to if
you decide that you kind of like what's
going on there yeah so our second
question of the week a circuit breaker
is do we think that phones are getting
more delicate over time I really love
this question too because it's something
I hadn't really thought about exactly in
this way and it's interesting because
you have the media phone in case my
iPhone time because like oh my god you
don't want to drop that thing the glass
on the
it's more expensive to replace an actual
screen and that that's the same with
Apple care too so it's like okay that's
a really delicate phone that you just
cherish it hold it close to your heart
at all times maybe even put a base on it
same with the other knife knife on eight
but then at the same time you have a
bunch of phones now that are waterproof
and that's a really like great utility
use where whereas before if you dropped
it in the shower of the toilet the pool
whatever your phone was dead it was gone
now it's like you could take photos like
me waterproof I think it's like a great
argument for phones being more sturdy
because this is like a serious quality
of life improvement people were like
constantly worried I like what if my
earlier phones nearly died because I was
I got rained on and there's just not a
thing I had where I was like taking
pictures outside the other day with my
pixel because it was raining and was
beautiful did not have to worry about it
getting dripped on that's great yeah and
I think to like our phones now are kind
of our main accessories right and so
back in the day when we had our big
bulky plastic or whatever our massive
phones that we could drop from rooftops
and they would survive it's like those
didn't look good yeah even if you could
get that now as a smartphone you
probably wouldn't want it because you're
like I'd look no it just doesn't look
good our design sensibilities have
changed also now phones are just
infinitely more expensive so whether or
not they've got more delicate you
definitely want to just take care of it
they're scary
yeah exactly like where's we really good
right the cracks okay now it's like no
that cost me a thousand dollars yeah the
answer is like yes and yeah it's a
little bit of both yeah you know they're
always just saying there's new gorilla
glass no it's like I'm so excited than
you gorilla glass yeah
so that's ask circuit breaker be sure to
send us your questions write them in the
comments as you might notice YouTube
people these were all tweets this week
do not be upstaged by our our Twitter
followers this is on you many good
questions in the comments YouTube on
this video if you're watching it right
now we'll see you next week
and that's him all right hime hello
Thank You Ashley and Jake by the way
we had a question in the chat by the way
it said Union upgraded router force more
time stuff I'll say that until I got a
mesh network system
I haven't here oh but I think anything
would work all of my some experiments
failed they all have tiny little Wi-Fi
antennas hidden in tiny little spots so
you need the coverage they can't pull
the weak signal anyway hi I'm here I'm
here you have brought us a number of
iPods in a state of disarray mm-hmm and
I just want explain what is happening
here we're gonna take out the hard drive
of these iPods in real time mm-hm and
replace it with this custom board it has
micro SD cards in it yep it's basically
an SSD upgrade yeah so here's the story
here's why this is happening this week I
am just like this story by the way it's
called my friend ryan johnson i'm eli
patel for weird old gadgets and I was
looking at iPods I noticed there's this
huge proving market for upgraded iPods
and I tweeted I might buy one of these
because I'm a sucker and I will buy
anything and ryan johnson who directed
the force awakens tweeted back to us mmm
Lester I'm sorry
when John Hsu directed last ride I
tweeted back at us he has won any
scheana's picture of it and he loves it
my beautiful beautiful cloudless light
sorry but just chatting about how much
we like not having shooting services in
our lives and like having music so we
figured we got to just show people how
this works so Haim show us how this
works all right so we're gonna start out
with our ipod which we had you select
which is fifth-generation 32 gigabyte
iPod the iPod video this was the last
generation before Apple switched to thee
generally in my opinion inferior
aluminum front did you know boring iPod
Classic this is still your you know
classic platonic white iPod right click
wheel whatsoever here so this is the
first one with a mechanical quick mule
this is where they've the landed this is
a classic yeah what you want is a fifth
gen yeah because the 50-round had the
best DAC I had a Wolfson people liked
the fifth and the best of all these and
apparently is very hard to open this
yeah the fifth generation also has a
big advantage which is this is really
hard to take apart the classic is just
bolt it on here so we're actually just
gonna go get right in we're gonna take
our trusty iFixit makes a repair kit
which is this beautifully arrayed thing
for tools for cracking open your devices
so we're gonna take this bespoke plastic
iPod opening tool and we're gonna just
crack open the case here you've already
got it's for yeah I started this because
this is a bit of an annoying process
will sound like you're breaking your
iPod don't break your iPod is my best
advice and be patient this is this is
why we do this live because this is not
terrifying I mean I'm I'm not even doing
it I'm afraid for you so Neela when
you're hanging out with your best friend
Ryan you guys like to talk about we
today we shared each other photos of a
record players oh it's a very early
stages it's just planning on streaming
sir would you say this has something to
do with being like sort of like a
Luddite or like like a hipster or what
does this come from you know I think for
me in particular with music it's I hate
being walked in I've always hated DRM I
love the iTunes store in the app I came
out so remember Steve Jobs wrote an
entire letter that's like against DRM
and he convinced the music industry to
drop DRM there was just a sense that you
would you would buy files they would own
them you know they were they were
standards right like they were you know
some sort of Amazon sells mp3 is iTunes
stores whole day ACS and you had them
and you just play them on any device he
wanted but and apples big advantage was
that this was a better music player and
all the other music players and that was
what they had to compete on it's what
they eventually won on but it wasn't hey
you're an Apple music subscriber now you
can just buy this one thing or hey your
Spotify there was news today Spotify was
working on its own hardware right like
all that just lock-in and I like that to
me I'm over it
I just want to point out I don't want
yeah we've got distracted the audience
with our arms trying to be radical open
ideology so I actually open this missing
the corner over here is the power supply
which I actually got it this corner
right here
about to yank the power supply from the
base very carefully it's a bathing I
mean I'm so nervous right terrifying in
here with our tweezers oh my god so that
what are you what are you disconnecting
here so now we're disconnecting power
which is this tiny little great thing
over here and the goal is to get it out
without ripping out the entire board if
we mangle this cable it's not a huge
deal though because while we're in here
we're also gonna remove the battery I'm
just like holding my breath
I know I'm pretty excited all right
nailed it okay I'm everybody could you
possibly believe that this is actually a
more convenient though than just putting
songs onto your iPhone with like I think
convenience is this principle it's about
print it's also about focus oh I I why
what's the string music service so
there's like zone out in the playlist
all right so here we go now we have the
we are inside an iPod right over here
this big chunk is our hard drive do you
think Johnny I've picked this shade of
blue very very healthy and Steve Jobs
like I don't know can we see 10 more
shades so we're gonna peel with these
rubber bumpers now the next thing we got
to do this court over here is super
important this is the headphones hey so
if we break that this basically becomes
useless we're gonna undo this little
latch right here and just slide that
right now yeah look at that
so this is your back of an iPod case
again growing with the 32 gigabyte for a
few reasons one is they're just like one
minute this is I mean this is a lot
mm-hmm
I mean this hard drive is huge we have
one here this is like all of the weight
of our drive if you think about the size
of the components in your phone now it's
like all battery and this board powers
everything that a phone does we're bored
of this size basically even smaller in
some cases it's like kind of remarkable
but remember this the iPod is played to
break out if they had the one this is
the video iPod
holy stuff okay so you just took out the
battery which is literally just glued to
this board we went to I fixed it and
bought a reputable new battery how much
so the replacement battery is about 15
bucks okay yeah not that bad
so I'm just gonna get this lined up it
comes pre-made with with good old
fashioned 3m adhesive okay you're just
gonna kill that sticker and slot it into
place press down yeah all right so now
battery replacements done now I get to
the fun part so this is again this is a
30 day bite hard drive there's two
reasons we're using the 30 gig one is
that it's thinner and lighter and two is
here we have over here this is an 80 gig
video iPods you can see it's like much
chunkier yeah I always bought those and
I never bought these and yeah owed me
this one and it's kind of way smaller so
we're gonna get rid of this hard but I
was always the person who bought the
biggest iPod they could yeah did you
fill it I came cause I definitely never
had 30 gigabytes of music on yeah any
one device uh it was as I started
ripping my CDs into higher and higher
quality hard drive out hard drives out
so now we're gonna take this this is the
eye flash quads this is a company that
actually makes these bespoke boards as
you can see perfectly designed to fit
right here into this iPod but they they
basically sell a whole bunch of these
they have ones for SATA hard drives
they've ones for full sizes to you cards
with micro SD cards because my christy
cars are super cheap yeah so we're just
gonna slot these in these are two 128
gigabytes samsung micro SD cards uh and
now this is a 256 gigabyte hard drive
Wow
this was 30 that's crazy how far we've
come how far we've come in a previous
life Paul and I would write posts all
the time like a new bigger micro SD card
is gonna do it's a little known secret
of circuit breaker you know if you
didn't know this by the way people are
watching on YouTube circuit breaker is
also a website that you can go to if you
go to the verge comps our circuit
breaker we
right about technology - and storage
posts are big weight loss every time
large there's like a hot new SSD right
now like a 30 terabyte 2.5 inch SSD yeah
top of the site it's a huge hit for us
I'm everything you're doing is filling
me with dread
it's like absolute now we're just like a
position that you need to know that
you're in no I'm just on the cable
without ripping out the cable so this is
an in okay so one of the reasons this
hack works so well is if you look under
this board we're not touching any of the
the core circuitry here
yeah so that's how the screen connects
but this is still the same memory same
firmware what we're doing is we're
taking this just hard drive and we're
just kind of swapping in this yeah
exactly like replacing a SATA drive so
at the end of the day when we plug this
into iTunes at the end and yes you you
have to use I see the one downside one
your one side it's just showing up as oh
this iPod has a lot of storage but it
shows up the same actually I guess
systems one the weird quirks here which
is you can put as much storage as you
want you have a terabyte worth of micro
SD cards thurman here yeah there's
actually a track limit though of how
much how many songs you can put on
quantity yeah which is basically defined
by the iTunes database size like the
metadata yeah so this is the third
gigabyte 1 so this can take about 20
thousand songs give or take a few for
metadata regardless of how much storage
if you feel like a terabyte of storage
on here you're still stuck with twenty
thousand as the hard limit one of the
weird quirks this process actually the
firmware on this has a hard cap of 120
gigabytes of storage on almost all
classics with a couple with exception of
a couple yeah which is another reason
that the fifth gen is good for this
project is that this does not have that
limit so you can put you know as many
songs as many songs even for 20,000 an
interesting thing was the 80 gigabyte
version because it was designed to hold
more stuff
has more memory this actually can fit
like 50,000 if you have the storage for
it
walkers I think 20 the 20,000 songs on
my custom SD iPod yeah that's all you
need at the party then yeah I mean so
for for 250 gigabytes we ran the numbers
you can get like 14 megabytes of song
hit the 20,000 limit which is already in
like Apple Lossless kind of territory so
you should be fine
iPods do play up a lossless they do not
play flat they don't play flat so now
we're going to reconnect our headphone
cable over here again very carefully
Alexander says I like my Windows Phone
it's out there meet you there's one
there's one stand and every chat they do
that
so yeah that's already reconnected
hopefully now we're just gonna take this
bumper from the hard drive I'm just
gonna wedge that in there so that this
doesn't Bank around since generally
mysterious rattling noises coming from
your iPods is bad
yep you're saying the foam on these
originals was because you're actually
trying to reduce the the motion mm-hmm
because this is a spinning platter yeah
so you'll notice ours doesn't really
need the foam because there's no
spinning platter this is all all flash
and the iPod have like a cache for like
skip protection like you would spin down
32 Meg's of skip protection Lane answer
because yeah they put it out at a time
when people understood CD players okay
so your CD players that like three
minutes that's good protection that was
a real arms race yeah so then Apple when
they put out the iPod they're like
that's five minutes of skip protection
what are you gonna do CD player moving
discs all right so now we're pretty much
done way to do is this is our battery
cable it just need to slot into this
terminal over here okay and then
literally just snap everything back
together all right
what about that pad right good call
we don't need the phone mmm the foam
over here was again to protect that from
bouncing around first good protection we
don't need this but there is this pad
that
gonna stick on which is just literally
just going to space against the back the
iPods that we've removed a lot of volume
from this thing
alright so now I'm just going to flip
this over it is fine I've held the ones
with the harddrive and I'm held one with
these SD cards it's surprisingly lighter
and also why I point out that iPods fit
in your pocket better than a phone does
yeah much smaller the link baguette
phone I thought you were with the real
problem this is terrifying everything
you're doing is terrifying I mean I
really want to do it because this is
sort of thing like doing but I think
what I'm discovering now is I like
watching you do it here's what I really
like is wait what's the overall cost of
this hobby if you just like ripping open
iPods and putting SD cards in them
that's it
nailed it started so now you just plug
this thing like that Wow all the clips
package Wow so now you just plug this
thing back in iTunes so now it's going
to turn on is going to tell us that it
is going to have a freakout and that you
need to restore with iTunes because we
just basically took out the entire
that's why fully recognize it so to cost
before we get into it before we pull in
a computer and start forming in this so
cost you need to have an iPod which
generally can run you for the fifth gen
for the fifth gen 30 somewhere between
30 and 60 bucks on eBay yeah you need
the board yeah which was roughly $45 on
also eBay
the battery is 15 from iFixit if you
want to replace the battery which while
you're in there might as well I get a
fresh battery this also will get better
battery life then the hard drive right
because these pull less power so the uh
you'll get roughly 20% more battery life
okay but all in what's the number so
almost number probably around 200 150
200 well things
SD cards I think is remarkable yeah one
that works works so yeah magic we
did magic
we don't have one that's format we don't
have time format this but this is a
finish once the circuit pod one you can
see over here we're not lying this has
240 gigabytes memory yeah yeah you know
what's remarkable thing about this so
you think about Apple through the
clothes company everything sealed this
was the product that started at all
right like it literally everything in
consumer technology is descended in this
moment is descended from the iPod and
Apple strategy the iPod but this is just
a little Linux computer right look it's
running that portal player OS it is you
can just crack it open and put in
standardized storage and you plug it in
the computer the computer isn't doing
it's almost like a weird hardware DRM
feels like it's your own iPod yeah man
this is like wait people are asking in
the chat why I'm so into this this is
why because it feels like something it
belongs to us hmm like yeah what are you
doing to celebrate times amazing
achievement it's here oh my god I pulled
this is a whole product I like to call
the home this is this is the Apple -
check this out check this out it's good
audio in who would have thunk it was
possible yeah but it's got a little talk
right up here no it's it's not it's a
spatial place in in the room I mean I'm
just gonna play something that's gonna
get us it's in the room is to rock the
party so while you're looking for
something the other advantage to the
salsa drives is we had our producer
cretin who is a huge iPod fan yeah we
had him take this for a test drive over
the last day and he says that it is much
snappier yeah then the hard drive loads
things faster well in honor of the home
pod reviews repairable it's not that in
there
that sounds beautiful all right we have
to stop it cuz we're good soon thank you
so impressed I'm super into this I'm
very happy that this is inspired so many
people on our staff to buy iPods desert
they're starting to flow into the office
now and I'm weird rate Paul yeah you
have started making videos mmm and no
one seems able to stop you yeah yeah
last last week I premiered a new series
that's called explain yourself
and I can say without a doubt glowing
reception across the internet this week
did a different video that has nothing
to do with explain yourself but it's
also great and I think they're gonna
really like what happened
hello I'm Paul Miller and today we're
gonna do the one thumb test everybody
knows you're supposed to be able to open
a laptop using only one thumb and no
knuckles that's why I have bandaged my
hands to make sure that I don't cheat
this is my personal laptop this is how
it's supposed to work
put the thumb right there we had a
little bit of sliding but we're okay
the the chui we're gonna get to two
attempts per that's a fail okay that was
one nope that one really doesn't count
cause it's for old people this is a
Microsoft Surface laptop so this is a
pretty important one hey good job
Microsoft way to go how about Lenovo
nope try number two nope got a pixel hey
there's a kickstand on this one that's
not gonna that's never gonna fly but we
got a Spector 360 nope nope the original
Chromebook little bit of wobble but it's
safe sliding well it's cheating if it's
got the back stop
let's put that at half half mast this
one's interesting this guy actually has
a latch that works this is not gonna
work at all I don't know if I could get
this open with two hands there we go
that's the future of laptops not not
really pixel book mm saw that little
slide they're gonna dock points for that
I'm gonna say half-mast Oh getting tired
the entire just go fight through the
pain keep going
the slide slide is always what gets ya
when we got here
a lot of Chromebooks it turns out that's
not a Chromebook
it's that Chromebook I don't even know
that worked
we got a why away NSA hates them oh no
nope
Samsung its end on a classic ThinkPad we
got latches on the side this is back
before we knew this one's a kind of a
like a trap because you you open one
side yeah this is never gonna work so we
just tested 21 laptops eight of them
full point great job everybody five of
them you just kind of imagine five of
them got half points that's not that bad
that's not that bad I think in a couple
years with the you know the forward Mark
Moore's law and the forward march of
technology we're gonna get a hundred
percent very soon I'm convinced thank
you for watching enjoy the rest of the
show
welp alright dami is here I want to
we're at the start asking questions is
the end of this we're gonna take your
questions to wrap up the show it's
thinking of some questions you want to
ask but first Tommy you have brought us
I think this is the most circuit-breaker
of all circuit breaker segments
accessories that plug into headphone
jack yeah it's a really novel conflict
one that I missed dearly today I'm here
to talk about the sonar pen which is a
headphone connected stylus and what
makes this better than the Apple pencil
is Apple pencil is $99 and it only works
with iPad pro this one is only $30
granted it is a Kickstarter project but
it it's really cheap and it works with
all iPads really
after 2011 so I specifically had to buy
this way yeah just to use with the
stylus but before I begin with this
let's go back and take a look at all the
other headphone connected accessories
that have paved the way for this so
first thing I think everyone probably
pretty much knows what this is is a
square card reader mm-hmm
they release this little thing for free
to like business owners just because
they can take so many iced coffees
what's that thing so this is really
interesting it's a smart guide er
counter and it connects to usually would
be a headphone jack but my phone doesn't
have one but also and it helps detect
the radiation in your home so dedicated
to detecting radiation highest radiation
thing you found in our office so in the
office so far it's not much it's if I
just put it up to this iPad here it
should flash like a warning bright red
and it's like slightly high point that's
what helps that's what happens when you
put the Geiger counter up - he's fine
we're good but yeah basically
nobody should really use this as like a
real Geiger counter the reviews on
Amazon we're not great people were like
I have this next to my TV and it's
giving me super high readings and I
should be dead by now so it's not super
accurate it's just use this as a toy to
gauge like okay so let's go back to the
stylus and this stylus for 30 bucks it's
really hard to find oh you're so it's
really hard to find styluses at 30 bucks
that can also like detect pressure
sensitivity and also have palm rejection
so right now it only works with two apps
this is an app called Zen brush 2
kind of mimics like East Asian
calligraphy and it's a really cool app
but the only downside is that it only
works with two colors but super simple
to use I'm just draw like so you guys
should all know how is Donny in addition
to working Virg is a super talented
cartoonist her he's called as per usual
she should follow an Instagram she won't
let me plug her book book forthcoming so
is this better or worse someone you used
to make for usual this is definitely
worth it I mean the app is worse the
stylist I think works great there's no
Bluetooth you don't have to charge it
yeah I do have this cable it kind of
gets in my way sometimes but it does
have this advantage over the pencil
where you can remap like a little button
here so you can do like undo right now
it's undoing my strokes but yeah it's
only 30 bucks it's really great for kids
or any iPads like old iPads you have a
flying around so you don't have to go
out and like buy and you I would you
switch from your Brittany the back home
is everything yeah you switch me walk
onto this thing the this yeah no you've
been coming on the show with different
drawing devices for a long time and
nothing's replaced the wax the top it's
the best but if you want to find a
really cheap e stylus is only thirty
bucks
anything else like we have this like
Adonit jot Pro this is all the same
weird oh yeah it's like this weird like
plastic disc but these work as dumb
styluses meaning there's no pressure
sensitivity or palm rejection and though
charging no charging but it works with
any app but this is 30 bucks if you want
to get something like with actual
features you have to go up to at least
75 you can find those with like the
welcome into it was creative stylus or
though John it picks a don''t pixel yeah
so that's basically it does this Pikachu
yeah today we're gonna be sued by the
Pokemon people and doodles
this is the best loss this is a remix
remix there we go we're sorry to the
Eagles I would say we were playing a
remix of Hotel California as well yes
you are the Eagles lawyers yep this is
great this is beautiful so here's here's
the thing we had a lot of fun when we
found out about the Geiger counter it's
like what else is there for the
headphone jack
did you do something else turns out not
a lot there's a laser pointer for the
headphone jack we couldn't get in time
but it's fine and there's an app for
this saw this sonar pen thing is like it
works in a really cool way definitely
the most interesting thing we found but
I also found a my favorite category
which is basically devices that allow
you to use an iPad and yeah yeah how do
you need help to do that
this is called the iPad this is put my
wine glass well this has a little slot
right here slide in your wine this will
go across the bathtub but I don't share
kind of guy but I just want to register
my own fleet disapproval
all time along the fact that you're
doing this and then look at the
convenience put all your snacks right
here Oh what are you doing in the bath
this is not good enough no this for the
bed here we go
this one we've called the spice this is
a tablet do you put your tablet in here
with this right imagine you're the human
posture right here you have to be almost
upright and when I'm watching Netflix on
my iPad I want to be fully prone okay a
lot of questions okay well this is the
ie geek tablet phone stand so this has
an adjustable little holder here see and
put stuff in this is a company that
tried to be a tripod company and failed
what you're looking at I feel like my
dad had like the world's cheapest tripod
and it was made by these people for sure
see they invent these for like
previously for books like when people
read books in bed where they like try
this book spider yeah absolutely so this
is adjustable no I don't think they made
these for books is what I'm saying
so you think iPads made us horrible and
lazy and now you can buy an iPad look
your iPad right how convenient but best
of all solves the fully programmable
Tommy he's got the pop can see so you
just put this all right past your head
that looks super comfortable oh wait oh
yeah oh yeah have you seen the new
Netflix show altered carbon while I want
fall
[Laughter]
all right will you just stay there we've
got a few minutes a show left we want
your questions we can see you let's see
what you got what do you guys ask first
questions will answer and we're just
gonna leave Paul Martin says this is the
stupidest thing I've ever seen I want
you to know that okay Michael says Paul
is clearly an Amazon seller Chris says
Paul Miller 2020 that's happening yeah
what you don't know is I'm I'm in all
your affiliate links Josh what's your
editorial well all of these all of these
iPad stands were between 20 and 40
dollars yeah so less than your your
stupid iPod you could find this at Bed
Bath &amp;amp; Beyond shoes get that like 20%
off coupon which of the four of these
would you would see most convenient
store my goldfish Paul this is a real
question for you Sam Church says what do
you think of Mike Ross Mike Ross is the
open source voice assistant that you
wrote about over the weekend
here's the thing everybody knows that
one of the big advantages that companies
like Google and Amazon have with AI is
vast amounts of data collection and
that's like the scary thing but it's
also one of the reasons they can get
good yeah and it's actually one of the
things that holds Apple back because
they do a lot less data collection so to
do an open-source voice assist and this
mycroft thing is a it already exists a
software but they're doing their second
generation of a actual hardware you can
opt in to let this open-source project
collect your data but it's definitely
almost positive positively not going to
work as well well I just want to try it
out I want them to send me one one there
it's gonna ship in December of 2018 yeah
and I'll play around with it it might be
super bad I'm just like this um but you
know we were talking with the iPod it's
nice to have a computer that you own you
could take it apart you can put it back
together I want similar things with
software so I'm gonna check this out and
see how works Tommy jr. asks is this a
Titanic what someone asks what are the
best in your headphones with the
headphone jack that's an impossible
question and because there's just too
many but the one yeah
but the ones that we have recommended
that most are the zero carbon to nor
cheap they like I blad wrote them about
them a long time ago now we're all
locked into whatever Bluetooth nonsense
we're all locked into yeah I was trying
to use those and then my dongle died I
want a new dongle and that one died so I
can't use this headphones anymore but
they're great yeah I'm still here we had
a question how many practice attempts a
time have to do that iPod upgrade one
that's the answer
the 1-yard in his pocket is the one he
did yeah before we bought four of them
we went three for the show and the night
I bid on one eBay and accidentally one
okay that was a mistake
so if four of them mine is I think way
in from China but we bought a whole
bunch too made all the classics and
other things I think we can all agree
that was an impressive it was one of the
most terrifying moments of my life
okay da me and you don't talk about what
John says where can we buy it on this
book or when where and when August out
in August pre-order should be available
soon we follow you on Instagram yes
you'll hear about it first it's my name
Tommy underscore ly yeah someone keeps
asking me future keeps asking what are
the favorites from Black Panther
I thought see what I couldn't even get
tickets to it like I went to the theater
and there was like a super long line and
I couldn't see yeah I saw shape of water
that was good we got black panther
content all over the site so look at the
verge you'll see some black panther
stuff hopefully I'll see it soon a
little
phones in them I don't know what newer
phones are unknown so I can't answer
that question all right bring back the
scissors vodka t-shirt a lot of urge
cast fans in the chat what else we got
Wow the Black Panther question just
keeps coming we got some black panther
astra channel all right that's all
question like what is your favorite
notes taking up mmm I always like to
plug Google keep it's a really good one
I read on all my comic ideas on their
tweets that can't make it out onto
Twitter I'm just like every is you using
things that's on the web yeah I feel
like it's important to plug the Google
services like a little-known Google
services you use so they keep them a lot
yeah like well Google keep is gone so
how do you use Google key it's just like
a little post-it notes I would show you
guys if I could but I don't want
everyone reading my thoughts but it's
just like a post-it note I kind of I use
simple note which has a website and also
native apps for everything but it also
used to seek with notational velocity
but nobody updates notational velocity
anymore and then the new version of Mac
OS broke notational velocity and I
usually simple note it's great and the
people who run it they run it because
they want it and they're all like well
it's affiliated with like the WordPress
people and then all that PHP word
prosperity it works for me Paul do you
think the purism laptops are worth it
given worth the price given the added
security features they're shaken a
Chromebook so you're actually reviewed
the purism on top yeah they weren't
worth it for me and the default OS that
it came with was kind of for the sake of
security kind of like stripped-down so
therefore like kind of harder to use
actually like spent more time with Linux
since then I feel like I'd be better at
it now but it's it's definitely not
nearly as convenient as using like
or Mac laptop so you have to know that
you need and want those security
features otherwise I mean Chromebook is
not Linux that's important to know you
can do some of the stuff you can do on
Linux but it is pretty difficult as well
if you want a true Linux laptop there's
a one system76 or something like that I
think though and then there's also
people who like will just help you like
put Linux on your Dell XPS 13 some
people are really asking at home pods
and echo dots and home axes try whatever
you like man just turn it up get homes
in California buy it from the actual
store just listen to that one song over
and over again I can't tell you like the
answer is by the thing you're locked
into an ecosystem yeah look around at
the prison walls around you in the small
cell that you're let's see one more
let's see this one's for me this is for
G news it's impossible to agree on the
headphone jack problem the world should
be wireless don't you agree and I do not
sir I do not agree I think we need
standards and I'm living a bluetooth
life I'm just disappointed almost every
single day about something breaking
alright that unfortunately is our Shiva
thank you so much for watching
we're back next week we don't have that
combo on this week the crazy AI remote
control thing because it's just really

time because yesterday was a holiday so

that'll be a fun demo we have a bunch of
other stuff going on Tuesdays 4 p.m.
