launched its first ever hardware product
this week I'm Shauna came to the verge
and these are the spectacles the
spectacles are pretty simple they're
just sunglasses with a camera inside the
camera sits right up here in the corner
of the sunglasses and then there's a
button over here on the left side that
lets you trigger to record video a
little light will spin around to let
people know that you're recording and
then those videos get sent over
Bluetooth to your phone so you can send
them to your friends on snapchat or post
them to your stories
now spectacles lasts about a day with
minimal use but stop selling them with a
pretty neat charging case that offers
for more full charges all you have to do
is take the glasses off fold them up
throw them in the case and they
magnetically lock into the charger and
charge while you bring the case around
there's a ring of lights on the side of
the case to show you how much charge is
left in there and you can double tap the
glasses to see how much battery is left
in them but it's kind of finicky to pull
it off every time so the good thing is
you can also see the battery level in
the app now those lights on the glasses
are actually a pretty important part of
the equation with spectacles because
when you tap to record a video they
light up and spin in a circle to let
everybody know that you're filming snap
did this to make sure that everybody
knows that you made a choice to start
recording it makes it a more public
thing and it helps break down some of
the awkwardness that can happen when you
have a device like this on your face
now pairing spectacles to your phone is
actually pretty easy all you do is throw
the glasses on open up snapchat and
inside the app there's a code that you
just point the glasses at and hit record
it'll start you through that pairing
process pretty easily and then once
you're there it'll send all the videos
you record to your phone into the memory
section of the app so it's not posting
them automatically it gives you the
choice over posting the ones that you
want to send out to your friends or
putting stories or do whatever you want
with now you can also send HD versions
of those videos over to your phone
because there's a Wi-Fi chip in these
glasses as well but it takes a lot
longer to transfer those files and it's
not really that much better-looking than
the ones that are automatically being
sent over to your phone but what's
important to know about the video that
these glasses take is that they're not
like the vertical or horizontal video
we're used to these glasses record
circular videos not 360-degree videos
kind of like VR but they actually record
them in a circular format and the reason
for that is that when you're viewing
videos that were shot on spectacles in
snapchat you can actually rotate your
phone and see more of the video than if
it was just shot vertically or
horizontally
snapping selling spectacles for a
hundred and thirty dollars but they're
only selling them in vending machines
that are showing up around the country
and they're being very secretive about
when and where those will appear so if
you're really walkies you're gonna have
to keep an eye on their website to find
out when a vending machine might show up
in view and that was part of the plan
all along when spectacles ever since
Snap announced them they said it was
going to be a very limited release kind
of product and that's probably a good
thing for now because it's a very new
kind of idea and it's not really clear
how we're going to use them or how
people are going to react to them we'll
have more thoughts on all that in a full
review so until then keep it locked to
the verge comm and youtube.com slash
converge and all you have to do is tap
and it'll show you you have them on all
you have well double tap on the side on
the side it'll show you how much is left
yeah we have to really zap it you just
tap on the side I was trying to
rush cause he's comin in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
