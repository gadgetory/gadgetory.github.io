Microsoft model shop this is where
Microsoft's actual products are designed
and built we're talking to Carson a
guard you're a model maker here and you
guys basically build this stuff from
scratch with your bare hands sometimes
sometimes with 3d printers and you go
from just prototype to prototype to
prototype into an actual product so this
is where the actual projecting so we
basically try to build prototypes in
real time when they want it
five o'clock they dump their files we
get it running 8:00 in the morning they
come in it's ready to go we just got
this a couple of weeks ago this is the
one that prints multi materials there's
four print heads and each print head
will can be dedicated to two different
materials and they will mix kind of like
color you have RGB and you'll mix
different colors what is the material
that you put in here what does it look
it's a it's a UV cured epoxy so it's
actually a liquid
this is a 3d printed wrench that you
printed in one piece yeah so that shows
the ability to be able to print multiple
parts together as an assembly right
that's incredible this chain was also
dying also as a single it's it's able to
support basically suspend parts in space
the support material traps it and holds
it when you remove the support material
they're free-floating so this was this
was printed not in one piece right not
in one piece we had some some issues
with a mouse in production and we built
a four up sized one so they can actually
see the physical movement of the wheel
very early concepts with like this yeah
so d tinted wheel wow that's incredible
big so they can play with it see all the
little details and you were saying so
you this takes you said this this wrench
took about 35 minutes to right about 35
minutes you can do an entire Mouse in
how long does it take the house about
three hours three hours and then you're
starting to be able to use different
materials yeah there's a soft rubber
compound with a hard harder plastic
light compound the mix between the two
will give you different drama ters you
can then two-shot the Wow
the parts so this is kind of hard you
got hard plastic here then you get rid
of rubber like we're representing the
side grips of a mouse so you actually
have a couple of mouse prototypes here
we should look at them yeah so once they
create all of the bosses and features
inside they're able to load components
and do their testing and how long will
something like this hold up I mean if
you if you put together you've got
obviously the space for the electronics
and these mice correct you could go and
use this as your absolute main device
these these don't have a whole lot of
thermal integrity if you were to warm
this up and bend it it would stay in it
let it melt down yeah so over time the
thing would tend to kind of sag yeah
that's like a human stirred basically
yeah we also do test test fixtures so if
the mouse has to go through a life cycle
rather than spend thousands of dollars
creating a fixture that holds the mouse
and
and then like a robotic finger whatever
we'll do life testing on the buttons
will create the fixture in 3d do you
have a robotic finger here though I'm
interested to know if that exists did
this morning actually if you thought
weird the robotic finger out of the lab
we did build actually a hand really is
it located just as this all is a fully
what is this clear windows this was an
example of when we first released
Windows Phone they didn't want to show
the phone they just wanted to show the
cool menu interface this is incredible
oh this Navis makes me wanted a clear
phone yeah as are you guys working on
anything like that
did you tell you probably took away all
your clear phone for all those other
forms are oh yeah this looks great
visible yeah I don't know why I'm
touching like it's gonna do something it
works why isn't this working alright
thank you so much this is really very
cool thanks for taking us around let's
appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
