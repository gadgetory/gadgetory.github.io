here at CES i recommend the hot dog
stand in North all this is 90 on 90
presented by for televisions are a CES
mainstay and Samsung is showing off what
it calls the world's first curved OLED
TV the 55 inch display has improved
Ewing angles over its flat counterparts
and it's got to come out in the second
half of this year we've also seen some
impressive 4k OLED prototypes from Sony
and Panasonic but those designs are flat
like a traditional television but don't
have released windows just yet either
way the 4k OLED TVs are the more vivid
and Kristen what we used to sing he
wants it ZTE is throwing its hat into
that 1080p smart phone rang we took a
look at the grand s an Android phone
with a 5-inch Tandy p display with a 1.7
gigahertz quad-core processor an LTE
it's a nicely SPECT advice not that
we'll be able to buy one much like busy
as new phones the grand s will only be
bait available in China ZTE such a tease
and in case you missed it welcome had
the mother of all bizarro world keynotes
last night and a wide-ranging
presentation CEO dr. Paul Jacobs brought
on Steve Ballmer director-general del
Toro and the actors playing Carol Marcus
in the new Star Trek movie why and
that's something to do with Paul calm
but we couldn't pin down the direct
connection there's the also the matter
of the maroon 5 performance being dubbed
over with some chill time music on the
web stream but really who's complaining
and those are the top stories joining us
in 90 minutes we'll be talking about the
perils of CES cosplay
