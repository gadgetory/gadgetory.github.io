Adrienne Jeffries and I apologize if I'm
a little bit off today I just got these
screws put in my neck and I think one of
them is loose this is 90 seconds on the
village the Winter Olympics kicked off
today in Sochi with the spectacular
opening ceremony but just like the
events leading up to the games things
did not go quite as planned instead of
the five iconic Olympic rings viewers
saw four rings and what looked like an
asterisk when the top right ring failed
to expand while that may be a glaring
mistake in the ceremony the full show
was apparently quite impressive
you can watch for yourself when the
ceremony airs tonight on NBC GoPro is
going public the extreme sports camera
maker announced it's filed a
confidential IPO the company has been
expanding its brand adding its own
editing software and original content to
its name but now it seems GoPro wants to
be a media company the confidential IPO
process allows the company to keep
financial details private until a few
weeks before their shares begin public
trading GoPro was valued at around 2.5
billion dollars in December of 2012 so
the IPO would be expected to value the
company at several times that figure and
finally the upcoming fourth film in the
Jurassic Park series will be filmed in a
surprisingly prehistoric way despite
more and more films opting to film
digitally Jurassic world will be shot on
film this move means the sequel will
visually match the three earlier
Jurassic Park films and not go all
George Lucas honest Jurassic world which
stars parks and recreations Chris
Pratt's is set to be released on June 12
2015 that's it for today's top stories
coming up tomorrow I get this neck issue
figure oh no here it goes again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
