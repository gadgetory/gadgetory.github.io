- Hey, everybody. I'm here at
Samsung's Unpacked event 2019
in San Francisco, holding
the new Galaxy Watch Active.
And this is kind of a
remarkable little smartwatch.
If you're an Android user,
getting a smartwatch
can be kind of a trial because
Wear OS is problematic.
But Samsung has a new
version of its watch
that's running in a demo mode.
And the big new feature on it
is that the heart rate sensor
can also now apparently
read blood pressure,
which could be interesting.
It also can now automatically
detect up to six
different workout activities,
which I feel like
auto-detected workout activities
is kind of table sticks.
But you're probably wondering
about the physical body,
you can see it here running in demo mode.
It is remarkably light.
It weighs way less than I
would have expected it to.
It still is running Samsung's Tizen OS,
it's got a 1.1-inch
screen and it doesn't have
a rotating bezel anymore.
So in order to interact with
it, you need to swipe left
to go this way, swipe
right to go that way,
to get to all your little
extra widgets and stuff.
And then you can hit
this button down here
to go to your apps.
And then to launch an app,
you need to tap on it once,
and then tap on it again
to open up the app.
And then this button up
here takes you home.
Samsung says that there are
up to 60,000 available
watchfaces for this little dude,
and that's too many watchfaces, man.
I can't pick from that,
just give me one good one.
They do have some good ones, though.
So they've got this here,
you can go to this one
that looks very much like
a Wear OS watchface,
they've got a little pinwheel.
They've got this watchface,
which looks quite a lot
like Apple Watch's Breathe watchface.
And actually, speaking of the Apple Watch,
here it is compared to
the new 44mm,
fourth-generation Apple Watch.
And it is just a little bit thinner
and it definitely feels way lighter.
And overall, I would say,
if you are on Android,
this is probably the most
interesting wearable around
right now.
We're going to need to
give it a full review,
but it definitely seems
like it's a little bit
more performant than most Wear OS watches,
which isn't necessarily saying much.
Now maybe the coolest
feature of the watch
isn't actually a watch feature.
If you have an S10, you can go here
and go to Wireless PowerShare,
tap that on,
you have to tap it on manually.
And then when you flip
it over, you can just set
the watch on the back and
it will start charging.
Unfortunately, it's not showing here
because this watch is stuck in demo mode
and they won't tell me the pin.
But if you want to top
off your watch, you can,
and that might be really useful.
Especially since this thing
also does sleep tracking
and you want to make sure
you've got a full charge
before you go to bed.
It's going to be available
on March 8th for $199.99
in the US and it'll be
a little bit different
in different regions.
Thank you so much for watching.
We have much more from Samsung.
We've got hands-on with the S10,
the S10 Plus, and the S10E.
We don't have the Fold, though,
but stay tuned to The Verge
because we'll have it, hopefully,
at Mobile World Congress
next week.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
