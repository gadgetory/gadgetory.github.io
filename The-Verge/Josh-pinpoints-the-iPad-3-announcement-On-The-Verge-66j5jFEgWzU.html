iPad 3 there have been a lot of rumors
about it recently I actually wrote a
post because we had some information and
I speculated in the post that the iPad 3
would be announced probably around the
first week of March and all things D
said March All Things D then can
basically confirm these copies I think
they have like a red phone that goes
right to Apple I don't know but they
seem to always know they basically said
it's gonna be the first week of March
but after I wrote my post I realized
that there's an extra day in February
this year there's a February 29th
because it's a leap year and apples they
can get pretty clever and I was like oh
this is a perfect opportunity they'll do
something like it's time to leap ahead
and I saw that tweet I was like oh did I
miss an app right yeah you actually
thought it was a real thing by the way
I'm thinking about just quitting and to
think of taglines for Apple of notes
it's time to leap ahead you guys are
gonna love this um no but so so I
started kind of thinking doing some
research on on what that and if that
lined up and and I looked at when the
last when the last two iPads were
announced right and do you remember when
they were announced the the last the
iPad 2 was in March and the iPad 1 was
January yeah so the iPad 1 was announced
January 27th and the iPad 2 was
announced March 2nd that you know days
they did those events on Apple normally
does its events on Tuesdays yeah and I
thought they were on Tuesdays but those
were actually on Wednesdays and February
29th which is a day that you know
normally does not appear it's a
Wednesday okay once every four years so
actually um I've actually been working
on something if I can just show you hang
on a second
because I think I think I do I think I
figured this out so as we just said iPad
1 announced January 27th right iPad 2
announced March 2nd wednesday's what's
interesting is 27 plus 2 equals 29 29 as
in february 29th 2012 a leap year right
you know something else is interesting
in about 2012 20 plus 12 equals 32 now
by itself that doesn't seem very
interesting but minus 3 as in ipad 3 and
you're back to 29 i think that's a
coincidence
i I didn't think it was a coincidence so
I was starting to get pretty confident
here but then I realized something
Microsoft announced that they were going
to do their consumer preview of Windows
8 on than 29th which kind of throws a
monkey wrench in the plans but then I
started researching the number 8 and it
turns out 8 is a lucky number in China
you know you know you know it comes from
China iPads and and you know it's
definitely coming from China the iPad 3
now something else comes from China a
lot of the time for us which is rumors
and we actually reported on a rumor from
a supply chain in China and they
described the iPad 3 display which they
apparently have seen as a quantum leap
and display technology quantum leap as
in leap year just wait because there's
more evidence here quantum leap is
interesting actually the interesting
phrase quantum leap was a show that
aired on NBC starring Scott Bakula now I
don't know if you know about the show is
about a guy who time travel have jumps
into people's bodies to right wrongs it
started airing in 1989 on March 26 26
plus 3 is 29 I pad 329 February 29 2012
now when quantum leap started airing it
wasn't immediately a hit it they put it
on Fridays and it was kind of flopping
so they had to move it they had to move
quantum leap to a different day and you
know a day they moved it to
what day they move it to yeah Wednesday
they moved it to Wednesday now sure that
that seems a little weird considering
all the other stuff we've seen but the
rabbit-hole goes way way deeper on this
one quantum leap aired during a leap
year 1992 guess what day 1992 started on
Wednesday Wednesday Wednesday 1992
that's the first day right and in
February of 1992 there was only one
episode of quantum leap one episode
there should have been four I don't know
why there's only one but there wasn't it
was at the end of the month the last
Wednesday in February the 26th 26 plus 3
equals 29 just wait okay just wait now
that episode season 4 episode 15 a song
for the Soul was about Sam leaping into
the body of a girl in an R&amp;amp;B trio a trio
of singers and and his goal in that
episode was to get them to not sign a
contract you know it doesn't have
contracts iPads with data plans they
don't you don't have to get sign a
contract with the data plan and as we've
heard about the iPad 3 it's gonna have
LTE 3 letters no big deal I'm not gonna
get into that but you can be sure that
when it does have data it's not gonna
have a contract did this gets even
weirder and actually when I figured out
the next part I got I really got chills
as I said the main character in quantum
leap was a guy named Sam's played by
Scott Bakula Scott Bakula was recently
in another series called men of a
certain age men of a certain age airs on
TNT which is a Turner station Turner
also owns TBS which is the station that
Conan O'Brien is now on now who took
over Conan O'Brien's slot when he left
the 12:30 slot on NBC yeah Jimmy Fallon
Jimmy Fallon took the slot and you know
what the first date of his first show
was March 2nd the same day the second
iPad was released so I think if you look
at all of this data
I think it's fairly obvious what's going
on here clearly on February 29 2012 a
David should have never existed Tim Cook
is gonna walk out on stage joined by
Scott Bakula in the cast of quantum leap
and he's gonna introduce the iPad 3 any
questions Paul any questions the numbers
all add up I rest my case I rest my case
and
I knew I knew you would see how clear
this empirical data was</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
