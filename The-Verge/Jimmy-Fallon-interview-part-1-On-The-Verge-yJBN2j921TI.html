what I do all of it yeah so I got the
virgin calm which is a different sign

the Lighting's bad idea no Tom you know
I'm talking about from MySpace nope Tom
DeLay the who did I introduce you to
your new best friend Oh Tom Cruise yeah
oh yeah Cruz comes on the show we're
going start talking backseat we're good
they started throwing e-mails back and
forth we're we're we're friendly you
know
Tracy's guys life I mean I you know talk
to me when he comes to New York we do a
little babysitting with Sri Sri I didn't
know that was an option
no that wasn't that was amazing by the
way so the thing about Tom Cruise and I
think I told you this backstage I had
for like about six years ago I started
telling everybody the Tom Cruise is my
favorite actor he was great kind of as a
joke though oh you know cuz he's over
the top oh I disagree no but like three
years after that I was like actually
he's pretty good like I started doing
cuz I had to follow through on the joke
so I started watching all his movies
I've seen a lot of me Rain Man I mean if
it wasn't for him he sets up Dustin
Hoffman's character Magnolia I mean they
make the best cupcakes man are you segue
into food I didn't know what was going
on I am a little hungry I'm a little
peckish
you know I just want to say like Jimmy's
aggression is is worn at night I came on
a show last time and I told that his app
was overpriced and a nightstick I'm
sticking to that it's a great up I
really I'm really hurt right now I do
have an app I will show you I can show
people the Jimmy has an app developer
now so bug reports the resent bug report
Center to Jimmy Fallon
are there Jimmy Fallon calm yeah that or
just I think policy at the verge duck
it's actually Josh with the verge I'm
not embarrassed you can know my email
address there because it's a tiny pack
look here's the app right here it's uh
it's called it's called wake-up call
this is cutting edge technology what it
is is to and you see this yeah it's an
alarm clock that dude classy Downton
Abbey type of vibe you can flip over to
hims liked Ron's like what's going down
then you go over to his the old flip
dude you're at a cheap motel saying went
down that now we flip sideways what
bigger numbers that's exactly it Sam age
and this is the whole point of this is
it's an alarm clock it's an alarm clock
where I call you you revolutionize the
alarm clock industry you set the alarm
for whatever you want and then I can
call you and I won't like like I will
just call you and it'll be your phone
will ring and it'll be like this is you
yeah or you go yeah it's like this is
like this whatever you want to wake you
up
that seems really good no no it's it
seems like the the ringtone the fake
ringtone if you want it
what I'm most impressed with is that
you're not using your fame you know with
Tim P now you're yourself you're not
using your prestige to sell an afternoon
that's no that's what's important best
background you've had all night that's
pretty good pattern a shirt you know you
don't here's why this would be fun -
yeah I was wrong having fun yeah
the people have already that is true
well you know I I set this thing because
I wanted to create an alarm clock
because I was tired of you know you set
your alarm clock and and and and they
tell us the rules you I don't know man
you pressed it the biggest button on the
alarm clock is this news button yeah
you've clearly yeah you gotta lose you
lose I don't know it's always what it's
like nine minutes or ten minutes or
something
he says that tree 90 left like seven and
ten what so this I set it five minutes
ten minutes fifteen you can go up to
seven hours news that's good you go
screw this I wake up tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
