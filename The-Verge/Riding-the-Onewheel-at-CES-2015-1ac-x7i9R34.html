I'm back with yet another rideable this
is the one wheel I actually rode this
last January at CES and I was a
prototype board it was really hard to
ride I didn't really know how to stop it
was pre wobbly felt pretty dangerous but
the company actually just shipped their
Kickstarter backers the final product
and that's the one I'm riding now they
redid basically everything in the board
reprogrammed the way this thing works
and it is awesome it is not a skateboard
this thing is like a futuristic of her
board asked thing with a giant go-cart
wheel in the middle and like I said the
the first board I rode was pretty
difficult to ride and the first time I
stepped on this thing I was able to go
in order to ride it you have to put your
back foot on then place your front foot
on which out you know deactivates the
kill switch you come into balance and
you sort of just lean so easy to just go
over anything I'm gonna go up the middle
mounds
right back down
this is what I call off-roading
you could really take this thing on any
terrain you want we're on a college
campus here and most of it is cement but
there's also like grass mounds
you can go up and down curbs and it's
really smooth the entire way I went down
a curb with no problem on my first try
so this is one wheels app and the first
thing that the app shows you is battery
percentage so we're down to about 40
because we've been riding for a while
and I guess the main part of the app the
reason why you should download this is
because the company has something called
digital shaping which simply lets you
change the mode your board is in right
now we're at extreme mode and has a top
speed of 13 miles an hour and for
beginners you can put the classic mode
it slows down the board sort of helps
you find yourself they say it has a
range of four to six miles so it'll
probably take you about an hour until
the battery dies but there is a charger
that it comes with that will take twenty
minutes to charge this thing from zero
to a hundred which is basically unheard
of I've really never ridden anything
like this and this final production
version is very cool so that's the one
wheel it is one of the most fun rideable
I've ever ridden 1500 bucks is a lot to
ask for but this thing self balances you
it goes forward and backwards got
headlights and tail lights that
dynamically change and it's really
awesome
stopping is actually pretty easy you
sort of just slide your front foot up
off the patent unveil like that just
like that actually yep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
