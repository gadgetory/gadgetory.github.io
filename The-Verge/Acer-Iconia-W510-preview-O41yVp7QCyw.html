and we're taking a look at the Acer
Iconia W 510 it's one of a sirs first
Windows 8 devices it's a convertible
which is a hybrid of a tablet and a
laptop and it's one of the first Windows
8 design devices we've had a chance to
use for more than a few minutes on the
one hand this device is a tablet it has
a nice black and white look it weighs
about 1.3 pounds and it looks just like
most Android tablets we've tested it is
a 10.1 inch screen again like a tablet
but it's 1366 by 768 resolution is much
more like a laptop there are plenty of
other laptop like features here too from
the Intel Atom z to 760 processor to the
full size USB port on the side again
this is very much a mix of a tablet and
a laptop and it's trying to be both the
same time there's also a dock which is
what turns the W 510 into a full-fledged
laptop the dock has a full keyboard a
trackpad and a big battery inside and
when docked the whole thing weighs a
little less than three pounds so it's a
pretty light laptop the dock has a big
kind of clumsy hinge it can rotate 270
degrees and act like a viewing stand
which is pretty cool but it's really
hard to move and it kind of feels like
you're going to break it every time you
try to move it there are two cameras on
the debate 510 an 8 megapixel camera on
the back and 2 megapixels on the front
and though I bet you won't really use
either one they're pretty good cameras
as tablets go we're going to see a lot
of hardware like this in the next few
months so this was a really good device
to use to really test Windows 8 the
biggest thing that jumped out is just
how easily it makes the transition from
touch to non touch environments whether
you were typing and then picked it up to
use on the couch or vice versa it's a
really smooth operating system kind of
no matter what you're doing Acer did let
us know that this isn't final software
for the device and a few things like
trackpad gestures aren't available yet
but Windows it really does feel at home
whether you using it by touch or with a
keyboard there's a big learning curve
either way as you figure out which
gestures map to which keys and which
menus you bring up and how to switch
between apps and things like that but
once you figure out a lot of the
navigational stuff it's really easy and
pretty smart I will say I found myself
tending to default to touching the
screen rather than mousing around even
when it was docked like a laptop Windows
8 in general is also just really really
smooth the W 510 isn't particularly
impressive hardware and the OS is still
really responsive and fast there are a
few stutters here and there launching an
app for the first time can take a while
and switching between them can be a
little clunky every once in a while but
the vast majority of things work really
really well and that's really the
overall impression I'm getting from the
w5 10 it's a good device there's nothing
particularly special about it but it
seems like on a lot of hardware that's
going to look and feel just like this
Windows 8 is going to run really really
well they're going to be three different
models of the w5 10 starting at $4.99
you'll get just the tablet with 32 gigs
of storage and you can get 64 gigs for
$5.99 for 749 you'll get the tablet plus
64 gigs of storage and the keyboard dock
and that's really when this starts to
become interesting we're going to be
curious to see what happens in the next
two weeks as we get up to the launch of
Windows 8 on October 26th but if the W
510 is any indication there's going to
be a lot of good stuff on sale this fall</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
