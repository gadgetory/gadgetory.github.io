blackberries had a rough few years
nobody's buying its phones anymore and
the new BlackBerry 10 operating system
has pretty much been a flop so to fix
all that blackberry is releasing this
phone the $700 Prive and guess what
it runs real Android but it still has
some of that classic blackberry DNA this
is the phone that's supposed to save the
company let's see if it's up to the job
let's start with the great stuff this
might be the best hardware that
BlackBerry's ever put to market it
starts to the lovely 5.4 inch curved
AMOLED display the pixels melt away and
you can tweak the color settings to your
liking the Snapdragon 808 processor and
three gigs of RAM usually keep things
moving at a steady clip and there's
expandable storage here too blackberry
put a really grippy material on the back
that makes this big phone surprisingly
easy to hold even with the keyboard open
the battery is huge and it usually gets
me through the day but you want a
blackberry for the keyboard and so the
screen slides up to reveal one and
BlackBerry managed to do it without
making the phone feel thick or even
awkward and it's open and is it any good
yeah it is look here's the deal with
physical keyboards on phones I like them
I think they feel great to type on and
yes
I know you can type way faster on a
touchscreen but you know what you can
optimize for a lot of stuff on a
computer that doesn't necessarily feel
good and typing on this phone I think
feels great and really that's all that
you matter
the keyboard also has some neat extra
features you can slide your finger on it
to scroll you can double tap to move the
cursor around and there are handy
shortcuts in some apps you can swipe up
to autocomplete words swipe down to get
a big list of symbols it's almost like
the perfect melding of classic
blackberry and modern Android and it's
that almost that gets me blackberry has
a lot of really good ideas about how to
make Android better but it falls down on
the execution I've had this thing get
crazy hot I've had it hard crash on me
pocket-dialed people and a bunch of
notifications just aren't
the prim is just too buggy but beyond
the bugs there are other problems with
the software take the BlackBerry hub it
lets you take all sorts of incoming
messages email text Twitter or Facebook
and combine them all in customizable
views so you have a one-stop shop for
all the stuff that people throw at you
every day but it doesn't work well with
Gmail it kicks you out to other apps all
the time and realistically BlackBerry is
never going to get enough third-party
support to make it a real success the
hub should be great but it's just not
there yet you can turn off all this
blackberry stuff and just use it like a
regular Android phone and if the company
can kill these bugs it would be a great
phone the camera actually takes pretty
good photos even in low-light but it's
just embarrassing ly slow and that's not
okay anymore this thing is called the
Prive which is short for privacy and
blackberry nails that it's better than
your average Android phone and helping
you know that it's secure that's thanks
to a little piece of auditing software
called D Tech BlackBerry security and
privacy tools seem really smart but
beyond the Wall Street set I'm not sure
many people are actually clamoring for
that perv is also short for privilege
which I don't even know what that means
except that I guess you have to be
privileged to be able to spend 700 bucks
to get a phone that has a physical
keyboard but a lot of the time this
phone doesn't make me feel privileged it
just makes me feel frustrated I still
have a ton of nostalgia for blackberries
the Privy is supposed to be the phone
that gives me permission to come back to
participate in the big world of apps and
Android while keeping all that
blackberry stuff that's a good start
it's the right start and I really do
love a lot of the things that BlackBerry
is trying to do here but too much stuff
here is either slow or unfinished and
even though it could all be fixed in
software updates waiting for blackberry
to fix it software is a really old story
and nobody should be a nostalgic for
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
