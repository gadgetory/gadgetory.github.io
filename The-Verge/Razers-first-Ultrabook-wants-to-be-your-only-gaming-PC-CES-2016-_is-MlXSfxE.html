we're looking at the razor blade stealth
this razors first ultra book so you
might be used to seeing sort of like a
little chunkier razor gaming laptops
this one is 0.5 2 inches thin and it's
only about 2 275 pounds so it's not it's
not really that heavy at all and it's
literally an ultrabook and so what's
inside it you've got a core i7 processor
on any of the models that would be
available 8 gig of ram and a 12 and a
half inch display and the top display is
4k which is this one here and you will
be able to get other variants and so
what is this really so it's literally an
ultrabook and it's kind of designed to
couple with something else which I'll
show you in a minute and but you've got
the obviously the Chrome lying on the
keyboard here if you hit the function
key you get the keys up the top here
light up and every single key is
actually individually lit by an LED
which is kind of new so you could do
some cool stuff of that and but really
the the sort of aside from the fact that
it's a regular ultra brick you've got
your USB HDMI on the side and a type C
port and a USB on the side really the
key to this is the type C so what
happens is you could take this this
ultrabook you'd be out on the road you
get home and you'll have your own gaming
machine set right here and the
racecourse set here is basically a PCI
Express graphics card enclosure and you
put your own card in here and then it
hooks up to the laptop and turns it into
a gaming rig d you'd use at home so you
can launch up the fallout 4 and front of
that sort the games you wouldn't
necessarily run on the Ultrabook itself
and so in terms of pricing and you can
start at $9.99 for the actual ultrabook
and the razer call and it's not priced
at the moment and obviously you have to
put your own graphics card in there and
both are actually cnc cnc aluminum or
aluminium if you're British
4 for $9.99 you're getting like a really
competitive price Ultrabook and really
nice build quality not incredibly light
but and definitely Finn and definitely a
capable ultra wit so if you want to see
