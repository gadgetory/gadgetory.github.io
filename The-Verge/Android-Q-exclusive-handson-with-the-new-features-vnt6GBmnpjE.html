and we have the exclusive first look.
It's finally time for Google to do
what it does at every Google aisle lately,
tell us what all the new
features that are coming
to the next version of
Android actually are,
and we've got 'em right
here on this phone.
There's new gestures.
There's new notification stuff.
There's always that kind of stuff,
but Google's doing some other things
that they don't do every year.
So for example, there's a
new way to get OS updates,
and there's an amazing
feature called live caption.
Let's check it out.
So the first features to talk about
are probably the ones that
most people are gonna notice,
and maybe even be the most excited about.
Number one, fan favorite,
everyone's been waiting.
There is finally a dark theme.
You just pull down the notification shade.
You tap that dark theme button,
and ta-da, it's in dark theme.
The thing to notice about dark theme
is it has true proper black,
so that will help save battery life.
If you turn on battery saver,
it defaults to turning on the dark theme.
Also, a bunch of Google apps
are gonna support it natively,
so for example, photos, dark theme.
We can go and look at calendar.
Now you may have noticed
when I was showing you
all those dark theme apps
that I was getting around the OS
in a completely different way.
There was a new gestural
navigation system.
Google will try to take a baby step
towards it with Android P.
With Android Q, it's
finally going all the way,
and it's not that different
from how an iPhone works,
so if you're inside an app, you
swipe up, it takes you home.
Pretty basic.
If you're home and you swipe up,
it takes you to the app drawer.
But you'll notice that
all you see on the bottom
of this thing is just a little white bar,
so how do you go back?
Well, you swipe in from
either side of the screen,
anywhere on the side of the screen,
so if I just swipe in from
the edge of the screen,
that serves as a back button.
Swipe in from the right
edge of the screen,
the arrow shows up, that
serves as a back button,
and that new back gesture is interesting
because a lot of Android apps
have a app drawer over on the left,
and now they're gonna have
to decide if they want
the first swipe to open up
the drawer or to just go back.
They can decide that app by app.
Now, if you want to do multitasking,
you've got a couple of options.
You can still just quickly
swipe along the bottom
of where that little home
button lozenge bar thing is,
or you can swipe up and over
to get into a proper multitasking view
where you can swipe
between different apps.
So dark theme and the new
gesture navigation system.
It's a thing you're gonna notice.
It's a thing everyone's probably
most excited to talk about,
but I don't think they're
the most important things
that Google is doing in Android Q.
When it comes to Android updates,
the biggest problem's always
just getting the updates.
You never know if your
phone is gonna get it.
You gotta wait for all these approvals.
It's a mess, and every year,
Google tries something a
little bit different to fix it.
This year, they're trying
something really fascinating.
Google is going to start
delivering OS updates,
specifically security and privacy updates,
not really big giant feature updates
via the Google Play store in
the Google Play infrastructure.
So I ask Steph Cuthbertson,
the Director of Android
to explain it to me.
- Project Mainline is
about enabling us to,
especially for say those
security sensitive updates
to deliver them to you very rapidly.
In fact, as rapidly as I
can update a Google app.
So let's say for example,
you've got a security
sensitive part of the OS,
which is where this is
particularly useful.
Say media.
With Mainline, we can now
deliver those updates
directly over the air.
- If you don't have a Google Play phone,
say you're in China
or you've got some weird knockoff thing.
You might miss out on that,
although it is an open-source project,
so it might also be able
to help those phones too.
All that security stuff is great,
but you're probably wondering about
the big major feature updates,
and whether or not
they're gonna come faster.
- One of the things that we announced
in past years was Project Trouble,
which is a great advance towards updating,
updates and the release,
and one of the things that
we're seeing with Android Q
is the update rates have accelerated.
In fact, for Q Beta Three,
we're gonna see 21 devices
from 13 OEMs all running Beta Three.
- So that's the update story on Android Q.
It's a little bit of like
they're getting better
on getting it pushed out to
more manufacturers faster,
but the bigger deal is
they're gonna get those
security updates pushed out
much more quickly to much more phones.
Google's making privacy and security
a big part of its push for
Android Q, and I don't know,
they're gonna have something like
40 or 50 different updates
that are related to that,
but the one that you're probably
most likely to see is in settings,
there's a new top level privacy option,
and that gives you a bunch
of different controls for
managing your data on your phone,
and that includes both Google stuff,
like clearing your
Google location history,
but also permissions on the phone itself.
So if you go into the permission manager,
it shows you all the different
pieces of data you have.
Microphone access, calendar access,
call logs, all that stuff,
and how many apps had access to it,
and you can just dig
in and turn off access
for any app individually.
- Location reminders are
also a great feature,
because you're also maybe wondering now,
which apps did I turn location on for?
I'm not sure I remember all of them,
and what's helpful with reminders is in Q,
every app that accesses location in Q,
it will remind you and say,
look, do you want this app
to have location access?
So you don't have to
wonder if there's some app
running in the background
that has that access.
- All those permissions
and data privacy changes
are super, super important,
but they're are still a few more
user facing features to talk about.
In notifications, if you get a message
from any messaging app,
you'll see that there
are these new buttons
you can press to reply to it,
and what's happening here is Android
is actually locally on the
device reading that message.
Nothing gets shared,
and then figuring out how to reply to it.
So there's a context relevant reply
like show a time or sure,
or there's a button for open map,
so if it sees that there's
an address in there,
you can just tap that open map,
and it'll jump to the
address inside Google Maps.
Google's able to do that
because it's figured out
how to do a bunch of
local machine learning
on Android itself right on the device,
and there's another thing
that it can do that it's just,
it's frankly flat-out amazing.
So I'm just gonna open up photos here.
I've got a presaved
video here from Google.
Start watching it, a person here talking,
but you can tap this button
and once you hit the volume button,
and it starts showing you a live caption
of what's being said on the video.
You can drag the caption around.
Use a double tap to
get more text on there.
You can even resize it if you want to.
What Android is doing
is locally on the device
listening to the video
that's being played,
and then showing you a live caption
of what is being said on the video,
which is legitimately amazing,
but also a real human good
if you're deaf or hard-of-hearing,
you've got more access to more videos
because you can use this in
any app, it doesn't matter.
Also if you're not,
you can still just watch a video
and not annoy everybody
else that's around you
by turning the volume up.
There's a new mode called focus mode
which is sort of like do
not disturb, but not really.
Basically what you can do is you can say,
I'm in focus mode now,
and turn off these apps that annoy me,
and then they get grayed out,
and you can't open them
without a little popup
saying you don't want to open this thing.
It's exactly what I want
the digital well-being app timers to be.
It keeps you from opening
them instead of waiting
'til you run out of time
when you use them too much,
and speaking of that digital
well-being app timer thing,
Google is finally integrating
its family link software into it,
so it's now combined app
timers digital well-being
and parental controls
all in the same space
right built into the OS.
All right, so after all of that,
what do I think of Android Q?
Well, we'll have to review
it to know for sure,
but I have two things to say right now.
The first is that a lot of the stuff,
it just feels a little bit overdue.
Better gestures, dark mode,
and especially better permissions
are things that I wish Google had done
one, two, four, five years ago even.
So I'm glad they're finally here,
but I wish they had come
a little bit sooner.
The second thing is that Android Q
doesn't have any big grandiose huge ideas
about what an operating
system on a phone could be.
Last year's Android Pi had all the stuff
about slices and actions,
blowing up apps, and exploding them
all over the interface of the phone,
but Q is a little bit more well,
it's honestly it's iterative,
and that iteration is super important,
but I don't think it's gonna fundamentally
change the way that you
think about your phone.
Hey everybody, thank you
so much for watching.
We've got a ton more Google IO content,
but I want to know in the comments,
what do you think the Q should stand for?
I think it should stand for Quibble.
- [Man] That's not a dessert.
- You know what?
Let's not argue about silly things.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
