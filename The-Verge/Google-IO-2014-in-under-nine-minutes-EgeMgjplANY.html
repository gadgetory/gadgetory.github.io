computing platforms Android and Chrome
we are very excited as of this year's
i/o we are over 1 billion 30-day active
users they take around 93 million
selfies every day the team tells me
about 31 million of these are duck faces
user experiences are evolving rapidly
and we wanted to rethink the user design
experience on Android to have a fresh
bold and new look Android Chrome and
across all of Google to craft one
consistent vision for mobile desktop and
Beyond and this led us to a way of
thinking that we call material design
those scenes and shadows provide meaning
about what you can touch and how it will
move and we've also updated our system
font Roboto
so that designers and developers can use
one typeface designed and optimized for
every screen from your watch to your
laptop to your television so another
area where we've improved the user
experience on al is errata notifications
I can double tap on a notification to
launch the corresponding app or if
there's something I don't need I can
just dismiss with a single swipe and
unlock the phone well this is just a
notification shade so you just swipe it
away and you're straight into the device
so from here I can keep going or if I
want to act on it I can answer it or if
I'm busy swipe it away and what you're
about to see is epic
Unreal Engine 4 desktop rendering
pipeline running on android l on the
latest Nvidia tablet hardware it was a
little flicker here
and we've worked hard to make sure that
the battery keeps up with the
performance so battery saver allows you
to clock down CPU the refresh rate even
turn off background data to conserve
battery so battery saver is really great
if you're about to embark on a lifelong
hike or maybe along the protest and to
say you with the battery to last even
longer both with elder leaves and chrome
we are bringing a whole set of new
experiences to many connected screens
around you we're right at the beginning
in a new phase in the miniaturization of
technology which means that it's finally
possible to make a powerful computer
small enough to wear comfortably on your
body all day long here's a live demo on
the LG G watch you can see that it
hasn't always on display that at any
given time Suz you the most important
thing we know for you
swiping up and down navigates you
through this stream of cards which
includes information from google no apps
running on Jeff's phone and apps running
directly on the wearable itself you can
see that there's a broad selection of
analog and digital designs in a variety
of styles to suit your tastes when you
swipe away a notification on the watch
it disappears from the phone and when
Jeff receives a phone call you can
either swipe to reject the call from his
wrist or swipe up to choose from one of
these quick SMS replies now you'll see
that Jeff has music controls on his
watch you can see what song is playing
he can pause the music or skip to the
next track Jeff can see how many steps
he's taken today
along with a step hunt history for the
week on devices that supported he can
even check his heart rate after a job
Pinterest can notify him but he's near
one of Suzy's pinned restaurants
allowing him to quickly glance at the
details then swipe to see a map and if
he likes it he can start navigation
right from his wrist
today we're making a full Android wear
SDK available it enables you to write
code that runs directly on the wearable
itself and here I'm presented with a
beautiful interface that lets me confirm
the kind of food I'd like today let's
stick with pizza and then I can quickly
swipe to see and repeat my last order
just one more tap to pay and the piece
is on its way when a watch is connected
the wearable portion of the app is
automatically installed and kept up to
date on that watch the LGG watch will be
available to order later today on the
Play Store we're very happy that Samsung
is joining the Android wear family with
the Samsung gear live and the Samsung
gear live is also available to order
later today the Moto 360 is the first
watch to adopt the rond Android wear UI
and it will be available for sale later
this summer those are just the first
three watches cars are an integral and
essential part of life and today we're
happy to announce Android auto it looks
and feels like it's part of the car but
all of the apps we see here are running
on Andy's phone
the first thing Andy sees is the
overview screen which shows personal and
contextually relevant destinations
reminders contacts and music from Google
now and other apps
Andy has access to all of his curated
playlists radio stations albums and
artists he can also use voice or the
steering wheel controls to control the
music in the car how late is the DeYoung
museum open today
the young museum is open from 9:30 a.m.
to 5:15 p.m. on Wednesday navigate their
navigating to the young museum new

with a full set of api's for audio and
messaging applications and the Android
auto experience will be available to
users with the public l release later
this year the first cars with Android
auto will be rolling off dealer lots
before the end of this year so I'm gonna
talk about a different form factor and
that's TV today we're announcing Android
TV and Android TV requires just a d-pad
with voice input and that can be made
available as a hardware remote control
as a game controller or even a virtual
controller on a phone or tablet and the
UI provides a unified view of your
channels in a familiar channel hopping
UI the channel information as I scroll
down you get immediate access to
applications ordered by how often you
use them Breaking Bad Google interpret
the results get me a result for the
popular TV show now with one click I can
then watch you to Google Play movies &amp;amp;
TV or any other service that I have
installed so from here I can actually
enter I can interact with the TV when I
brought TV we enable you to take your
games to the biggest screen in your
heads
I'm Tomorrowland so don't worry
Android TV includes full Google cast
support so you can use it just like a
chromecast I'm super excited to announce

new Google cast feature it allows you to
mirror any Android device to to your
television and we're actually gonna
mirror in live action it's a little
nervous in live action all of you on the
big screen our journey here began with
Chromebooks let's say you get an
incoming phone call you will start
seeing those incoming call notifications
on your Chromebook if you get a text
message you would see those text
messages on your Chromebook as well we
are very very excited about bringing
important favorite Android applications
for users straight on their Chromebooks

million queries per second today we're
announcing a platform preview of google
fit we want to help users keep better
track of their fitness goals you can
choose who you share what with and you
can delete your fitness activity
whenever you want adidas has a
collection of smart sensors that they're
opening up to developers for the first
time and we're thrilled to announce that
Nike is allowing other apps and fitness
devices to integrate with Nike Fuel
