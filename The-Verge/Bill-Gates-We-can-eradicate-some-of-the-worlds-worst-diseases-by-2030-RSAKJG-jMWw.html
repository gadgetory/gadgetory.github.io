two and 1/2 virtually all children were
vaccinated had sufficient nutrition and
received proper treatment for common
illnesses like diarrhea and pneumonia
the number of children in this half who
died before they reach the age of 5 was
well under 1% in the other half of the
world about 15% of these children died
before they turned 5 in some countries
the percentage was even higher but the
progress made in health care in the past
23 years indicate that we can improve
child life expectancies bringing these
two worlds into balance health is where
we've spent the most money the majority
of our work has been there part of that
is is the upstream science inventing new
vaccines and part of its been the down
stream once you have those vaccines how
do you get them out to all the world's
children this system has had a tendency
to get medicines to rich kicked or less
at risk of hitting disease and not get
them out to the kids who need it most
and slowly but surely understanding
cold-chain and measurement systems
working with the countries that's
getting a lot better we've worked with
countries like Ethiopia have had a big
commitment to get their healthcare
system working we used a little bit of
technology but just getting people to
fill out the tally sheets having the
people who do the deliveries take a
photo of what the inventory currently
looks like and getting those photos all
collected up so you see very early on
when things are going wrong we can get
high performance even in in very poor
countries some will be tough Niger's
health systems not good Pakistan's is
not good but we have people and our
partners there applying the lessons of
Rwanda and Ethiopia to those places
we're raising the money so that the
limited budgets of those countries don't
block them from getting even the the
very latest vaccine so one for diarrhea
called rotavirus next five years we'll
get out to all the kids one for
respiratory disease called pneumococcus
I will get out to all the kids and those
two alone will save over half a million
lives and that's why we think we can go
from the 1 and 20 kids who died before
the age of 5 15 years from now get that
down to be
one in 40 in 1980 smallpox was
eradicated the first and only time in
human history a disease was eradicated
to say that destroying a disease is
difficult is an understatement but it's
neither impossible or impractical in
2030 polio and other major diseases
elephantitis river blindness and
blinding trachoma will be completely
eradicated from the earth all these
major breakthroughs give you a picture
of how much progress we can make in the
next 15 years life will get better
faster because the number of innovations
reaching the poor will be greater than
ever before the world won't be split in
two any longer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
