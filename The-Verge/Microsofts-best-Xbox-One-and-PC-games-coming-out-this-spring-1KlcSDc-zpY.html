we're here at the Xbox Spring Showcase
in San Francisco Microsoft has brought
so many most anticipated games of 2016
here and we're gonna get to play them so
quantum break Dark Souls 3 below
minecraft for the oculus rift they're
all here awesome for Xbox some for PC
and we're gonna get some exclusive
gameplay footage as well let's get
started
this is Dark Souls 3 the newest action
RPG by from software it's not too much
different than the other Dark Souls
games and that's kind of the point the
game is still punishing they difficult
it's still gorgeous in a horrific horror
kind of way and it's still a ton of fun
to play essentially you're a nameless
character you get to create yourself and
you're put into this world that you
don't really know much about everything
nearly everything that moves wants to
kill you and you essentially have to
stay alive if you die and you're gonna
die you're gonna die again and then
you're gonna keep dying over and over
and over again you get better and better
you get better at the game and also the
game remembers things that it helps you
level up by killing enemies taking the
experience from them and even when you
die you can then stay trying to save it
and level up Dark Souls 3 comes out on
March 24th for PC Xbox one and
PlayStation 4
so this is below it's a new indie game
from toronto-based Studio capybara games
I've been excited about this for a
really really long time because well it
looks really gorgeous the game is
employing a kind of tilt shift effect
for its art style basically parts of the
screen are blurred out and other parts
are really in focus so I guess what the
developers are trying to emphasize was a
kind of smallness of your character
everything else seems really ambiguous
and large and you're this really tiny
little character who has to fight his
way through a dark cavernous area that
you don't really know anything about we
don't really have a release date for
below yet we know what's coming out of
2016 for both Xbox one and PC although
it's xbox exclusivity is not permanent
so it'll come out for PlayStation 4
sometime in the future this is quantum
break it's a new game coming from a
developer do called remedy entertainment
it's out on April 5th for Xbox one and
Windows essentially it's kind of like a
movie video game hybrid and that makes
sense too because it has a digital
live-action TV show component Remini
says that your choices in the game
should affect what you see on the actual
television show and there's actors who
are in the game they're also in a TV
show can't tell you their names right
now though I do recognize them as Iceman
from x-men there's one of the hobbits
from Lord of the Rings and Littlefinger
from Game of Thrones so they've got the
whole modern fantasy cast the game is
about some sort of quantum anomaly where
you can control and stop time and you
can fight enemies as if you were some
kind of superhero but it's supposed to
be based in real-world theoretical
physics right now I'm playing Minecraft
in the oculus rift for Windows 10 it's
right now in beta but it's gonna be
launching with the oculus rift in the
spring when the headset starts shipping
for being a pixel-art games the VR
experience right now is incredibly
immersive actually it takes a little bit
getting used to because sometimes you
have to kind of reorient your body
essentially just
just the full Minecraft experience in VR
I imagine this is gonna be hugely hugely
popular for lots of minecraft players
Marga's life has given us a pretty good
preview of what's to come in 2016 for
more information check out the verge
