much stuff out there and there's a lot
of really great stuff out there there's
magazines there's newspapers there's
tons of blog posts there's movies whose
books there's art and then there's a lot
more and of course my long-term memory
is terrible if I don't know things down
in some way that I'm probably gonna
forget it
dr. Bush has been called the Dean of
American scientists one of the great
mathematicians electrical engineers and
research administrators of our time back
in 1945 Vannevar Bush imagined a
hypertext information machine the
analytical machine which will supplement
the Lambs drinking method and has never
made but he called it a medics and he
described it in an essay called as a
mythic so the idea was that the system
would keep track of what you read and
what you write and then you would be
able to pull that back at any given time
so if you know I was reading something
now and then 10 years later I came back
to it I would be able to see what I read
and what I wrote about what I read and
then you know not much happen in between
and then what happened is I had a hard
drive crash that you know where I lost
everything
it finally convinced me to put all my
stuff online and ultimately I'll and oh
I never know you know a lot of people
get confused or overwhelmed by it
because it can do a ton of different
things but what I tend to use it for is
you know keeping track of notes keeping
track of things I've read or places I
want to go or restaurants I want to
check out it's a lot of different things
you know a basic list of tags that you
can add to any single mode and then over
on the left side here there's a lot of
different folders that you can set up on
your own and sorry I've Boulder that's
you know a breakdown of things I found
on the web you know annotations and
highlights for books notes from short
fiction notes about movies and a list of
music that I old plenty we'll get around
to listen to another great thing about
ever noticed it has a really great image
support and so if I see something online
that I really like I will you know just
save it into here and then come back to
it later when I'm working on on a layout
for The Verge or a story or coming up
with the design of my own so the number
one way that I pull stuff in here is is
via Crom and so let's say I'm reading
this piece about jellyfish and the
secret of immortality and I find a line
that I really like I highlighted pull up
the Evernote Web Clipper and I clip this
ledge
pretty simple and then I can jump back
over to Evernote
click my inbox and it will show up there
what I tend to do is add tags during the
week and so if this is like one of the
top stories I read during the week I'll
give it that tag and then as I'm working
on on a column of the best reads for The
Verge I can come back at the end of the
week click that and I can see all the
things or the you know among the best
that I've read for the week and so let's
say you have this really great
illustration and you want to save it
it's the same thing so you right click
it click the image and Evernote will
save it you can come back and then here
it is and then because this is sort of
like a weird art sci-fi thing I will
drop it into that folder and then
whenever I want I can come back
so yeah I usually like to read during my
commute and there's a lot of stuff I
want highlight and save for later
usually I would use Evernote mobile app
but unfortunately it's kind of terrible
so instead here's what I do so here's
the Evernote app all of your notes are
here you get your notebooks here tags
here places here but ultimately I really
hate using it what I usually do is
actually just email stuff to an Evernote
specific email account so if I'm an
Instapaper and I go for that same
jellyfish article so I'll highlight it
the entire thing click share email link
the selection email it's myself it'll
send it will appear ever done okay
that's a bit of a workaround and it's
not really perfect but it works for me
so it's not just things on the internet
that I'm finding and saving and
annotating what's really important to me
is saving notes from books that I've
read whether they're physical or ebooks
on my Kindle and so usually what I do is
you know I'll have you know highlighted
and save things and then afterwards I'll
just manually type them by hand and pull
it into Evernote with ebooks it's a
little bit easier on the Kindle it lets
you go through and highlight passages
and so as I'm reading I save those it
doesn't sync directly but we can do is
plug it directly into your computer and
then save those highlights into a text
file and then you know a couple years
from now I can look back and I see all
the highlights from everything that I've
read so the system would be kind of
useless if there was no way to get stuff
back out of it really easily and
fortunately in in the new Chrome
extension you can search Google and in
the side row will show up results from
your Evernote library so let's say I
want to look for jellyfish it's a couple
months later you know I get the usual
list of Wikipedia entries and jellyfish
are calm but then what I also have is a
note from Evernote which is that story
cannon jellyfish unlock the secret of
immortality and so this completely
changed the way that I use Google so
essentially on the left side I have the
world's knowledge in Wikipedia and all
of that but over on the right side I
have my knowledge and all of the things
that I've read and all the things that
I've noted and I'm able to dive back
into that in a way that Google simply
can't do
so maybe Vannevar bush didn't get it
quite right Steven Johnson didn't either
and to be honest I've got a long way to
go but so far this is the best system I
found for augmenting my rapidly fading
memory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
