I've tried pretty much every method
imaginable for navigating the streets of
the Big Apple
so when my next door neighbor rolled up
in an ER B electric scooter I was
intrigued I had tried out an early
prototype back at CES in 2014 that
vehicle was fun but too slow and slide
to be taken seriously on rugged streets
I decided to take the finished product
for a spin trying to navigate through a
day of errands and my commute to work I
started on Brooklyn where I live the ER
B is front-wheel drive so the steering
can be a bit jumpy especially if you put
your feet on the front pegs but I never
fell off while learning to ride my wife
had forgot her lunch so I went to pick
her up something to eat the ER B was
ideal for switching back and forth from
the sidewalk to the street and the
optional basket made carrying her
sandwich a breeze it even held my eyes
coffee
it was definitely my ultimate hipster
Dada moment the ER B has a top speed of
15 miles per hour which feels great when
you're accelerating not quite as speedy
when you're getting passed by a bicycle
on the straightaway still I left my
camera crew in the dust by slipping past
traffic a lot of the time the ER be even
handled well on cobblestone streets
although that was a pretty bumpy ride we
then made our way into Manhattan I took
the Brooklyn Bridge which is always
crowded with tourists snapping selfies
in the bike lane it can be a nightmare
of starts and stops but with the ER B I
could start and stop with minimal effort
and even weave between pedestrians its
agility and flexibility really impressed
me on this leg of the trip as I made my
way to midtown I spent some time weaving
in and out of traffic on the RV you sit
far too low to be seen from a large bus
or truck even most SUVs wouldn't spot
you in their mirror but I actually felt
safe if not safer than I do in working
my way through similar traffic on a
bicycle because the erbia is much
nimbler and faster to accelerate the ER
B relies on a 36 volt lithium ion
battery for power it takes about 4 hours
to get to a full charge but you can get
a whopping 20 miles on that single
charge giving you more than enough juice
for a 45-minute commute to work and
so this is our last shot of the day and
it's a fake one because I beat the video
team back to the office by a mile I was
really impressed with the
maneuverability on the Irby and
especially the battery we wrote it for
like five hours before it died this is a
new one I'm riding now if you have
$1,700 to spare and you have an urban
commute that doesn't work for a bike or
a car this is a really interesting
option</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
