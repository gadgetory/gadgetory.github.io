at South by Southwest on a roof with
foursquare CEO dennis crowley how's it
going Dennis yeah well I go doing very
well things so it's been a few years
since you guys made a big splash at
South by Southwest what's changed for
you guys since then uh well for us I
mean we launched four years ago and you
know we're a big company now we've got
160 people across three offices we've
got 30 million people using our products
and it's just like four squares big now
and so we came down here for years ago
just to introduce what we were doing and
really just to see if anyone even
thought it was interesting like hey if
we take game mechanics an overlay it
with the real world with check-ins like
is that something you guys like and to
come back four years later and to still
see you know all these places trending
with hundreds of check-ins like it's
awesome for us seems like you guys have
started to really focus on
recommendations and I mean I found an
amazing coffee shop yesterday yes oh
that's great like when did you kind of
start to think that maybe that's where
you need to dad actually we um we
started thinking about that when we were
still doing dodgeball while we're at
Google and we had all this check at him
when I say all this check and data
without well it wasn't a lot it was
probably you know tens of thousands of
check-ins as opposed to the three
billion we have with with Foursquare but
we always knew that there was really
good data in the signal that you know
these place these people go to these
types of places and this is where their
friends go and these are the places they
go back to and you know we knew we
wanted to do that with Foursquare we
just knew it was very difficult to get
on a lot of that check in data in order
to do that and so that was one of the
big original ideas of foursquare it's
like you know let's try to turn it into
a game initially to see if we can get
people to give us a lot of that a lot of
that data and then we'll be able to kind
of flip the switch on it and it took us
a couple years to do it before it's like
you know all those check-ins that you
thought you were just giving us as part
of this game well it turns out that you
know they go into this recommendation
engine and you've basically been telling
us what you like for the last two years
and now we can tell you guys like the
places that we think you would like and
the places that your friends like and I
know you guys this week launched an
update so it makes it even easier to
check in you know maybe from ten seconds
to more like three yeah what was kind of
the impetus battalion behind making a
move like that i mean our people having
check-in fatigue or you just try to make
it as easy as possible to provide that
data do you guys even if it means you
know taking the check and experience for
15 seconds down to 10 seconds it's great
and then a lot of the work that we're
doing
now you know trying to like understand
the passive signals that come from your
phone like you know can we do things
where we buzz your phone and we remind
you to check in or we just automatically
check you in if you you know if you've
been in the convention center for for 10
minutes or so if your phone's been there
I can we take those signals and turn
those signals into an easier way for
people to share I think that's one of
the big questions of our age is how to
not be annoying with push notifications
yeah yeah is that is that in part a
hardware limitation because let's say on
iOS you can't be constantly pinging to
see what somebody's up to or or is it
something that you guys kind of need to
work on with with science and algorithms
um it's a you know like the background
location stuff is a little bit tricky
just because um it drains the battery
very quickly this is true on iphone it's
true on Android and so you know we
launched a feature in 2008 2011 called
called radar and the idea is like you
turn radar on and as you just walk
through the city foursquare just tells
you about the things are interesting and
it works but like it might not be worth
the you know the forty percent battery
trade-off that you get from it but we
like I think we all recognize internally
as a company like this is the direction
that all this stuff is going you know
there's a great example that I reference
all the time like I've left the office
back in New York at like nine o'clock
once and then as soon as I you know as
soon as I leave the office and as soon
as my phone was two blocks north like
Foursquare can sniff that out it's like
oh you're on the move and you're heading
in this direction did you know that five
of your friends are checked in at the
karaoke place three blocks away and it
buzzes and I look at my phone Mike of
course I want to know that and of course
I want to stop by just for a second so
here at South by people discovery apps
have been popular and you keep seeing
iterations but nothing that really makes
a whole lot of sense like well won't
buzz your phone because this person
knows your cousin and you also like
madmen like because that worker is are
we going to reach a point where this is
really valuable for people that you
don't know or is it just on foursquare
where you want to find people that you
do now yeah it's good it's tricky right
because I'm you have to sniff out
someone's context and so you can't just
be buzzing people all the time about
every little thing that we think might
be interesting so one of the things that
we're getting good at is like
recognizing hey
in this city in this neighborhood are
you a local REO Taurus is your phone
spend a lot of time in austin well no
but it spends a lot it's been four days
a year and so like Foursquare has like
it can it understands which
neighborhoods I know about and so if I
can go outside of those neighborhoods
maybe that's when it turns to dial up
it's like now we're going to start
telling you more aggressively about the
things that you know are interesting in
this neighborhood but once you get back
to someplace familiar it just turns the
dial down a little bit we're here at
South by this year where's Foursquare
next year that's not by what does it
look like so you guys update the app
every two weeks it could be a leader
animal from a u.s. perspective it's hard
to tell because we're always doing so
much work there but you know like a big
part of the the Foursquare journey has
been telling the story to people as it
evolved that's why we come down here
every year because it's like a different
chapter of what we're doing in 2009 it
was you know points and badges and in
2011 we showed what we were doing with
the Explorer recommendation engine and
the MX deals for the first time and you
know now I think people are starting to
really understand like the personalized
local search and the social maps aspect
of it and i think a year from now
that'll be a lot more commonplace at the
same time i'm still psyched that I can
pull up my phone at any moment and see
that hey there are 600 people checked in
at the driskill and there are 200 people
checking the convened Convention Center
and use that as a guide for where to go
next like that that's always a lot of
fun thanks so much for coming out with
us Dennis yeah thank you for having me
appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
