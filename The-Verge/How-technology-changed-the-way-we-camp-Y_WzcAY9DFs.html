campers and that's okay seems a little
ironic to me I thought people on camping
to get away from technology but now we
have chargers you can put in the water
to generate power just using the current
there's solar panels that come as
standalone gadgets and as things you can
put on your backpack there's even a
stove that will charge your phone using
the fire you're already using to cook
your food so in honor of the hundredth
anniversary of the National Park Service
we have the birds want to take a look
back and see how camping evolved with
and for technology recreational camping
begins in the Adirondacks and at that
particular point camping is really the
province of really wealthy individuals
they'll be you know merchants from
Boston and New York and these are
individuals who basically are traveling
to the Adirondacks and who are hiring
local guides to fish and hunt and prep
all their food for them so these people
are not really doing much of the work
they were being surrounded by this team
and so I if you left these people in the
woods by themselves they would be
completely unprepared they would
literally not survive in the early
nineteen twenty is the Model T all these
really inexpensive cars allow for
tourism and travel to be much more
democratic I think a lot of the
interesting year that I found is really
outfitting the car itself is great
illustrations from the 1920s of hammocks
that were specifically designed to be
strung inside of the car so you're in a
hammock in your car in a campground
Sophie strange i'm not sure why you
would want to do that people began
taking their cars out for camping trips
and with that came the rise of the RV
but of course RV camping is totally
different from tent camping many camps i
started segregating them from tent
campers due to noise but once these
campsites were established in the 1930s
they really didn't change much what
campgrounds are about is assisting
people in very subtle ways so when you
check into a camp site that allows for
you to have the illusion that you're in
nature you can
with nature but in fact there's this
whole set of infrastructure that's there
to support you but over time our
lifestyles changed and with that the
infrastructure at campgrounds had to
change too we got why five bathrooms and
showers but now what I think we really
want are our devices and chargers with
us at all times even if we unplug and
leave our phone behind what about our
camera or a kindle the phone is creating
a demand for technology to support the
phone people are connected into their
stuff you know and so there's a need for
power I think powers become a really
really important consideration in gear
so either portable battery packs and
solar panels is really a big deal now
and it's a whole new realm of equipment
solar panels can be found on anything
now from tents two backpacks people
going out for a hike can always charge
their phone or any other electronic
while they're out on the trail well not
for everyone these products can make
camping more accessible safe and
enjoyable modern camping is designed to
be easier and to make us more
comfortable outside without the need for
local guides we're in nature but we're
always within reach of our friends or
emergency responders we're out in the
wild but nothing scary can really get us
on a campsite so how will camping change
next maybe we'll all wear VR headsets
and we'll go virtually camping or a our
glasses will take us around on a hiking
trail I'm sure there's always going to
be people who want to rough it outside
and leave their gadgets behind but
inevitably as the world technologically
advances our hobbies will too when you
go around campgrounds in the evening
you'll see little kind of glowing
screens you know inside of tents and
this is not unusual it's a kind of line
or you're constantly walking between
forgetting for a few minutes and being
completely into the experience of being
in a place and then suddenly you see a
scream and you snap out of it uh why did
I wear long sleeves</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
