and this is the samsung galaxy s Y&amp;amp;5 4.2
it's kind of an odd to buy samsung
already makes a bunch of them in other
sizes three point six inches in four
inches and five inches and it's
basically just a galaxy s phone minus
the phone parts and we've reviewed a few
these before and didn't always say great
things but this is a huge improvement on
what they've done so far it has a four
point two inch WVGA display which looks
pretty nice it's an LCD in seven Super
AMOLED but it still does look pretty
good and design wise it's a huge huge
improvement it's got stereo speakers
here so when you use it sideways you
actually get pretty good stereo sound
and the speakers are really great and
they've also got you know Samsung
standard there's TouchWiz on the device
to you get the same standard music app
as always there's a physical home button
which personally i'm always a fan of and
then it's just a regular Android device
as you'd use any other it has full
market access all the google apps
everything and it's as you can see it's
super thin the white bits look really
nice it's just a really solid hardware
it's been changed a little for most of
samsung's other devices but it looks
really good again it's it's a really
hard sell this device over something
like an ipod touch which has so many
more apps and the music player tends to
be better and but for someone who really
wants an android phone without the phone
and the data plan and all the prices
involved this is easily the best option
we've seen samsung has announced pricing
for the device yet but it'll be
available in mid-march in europe and
then we'll start rolling out around the
world and that is the galaxy s Y&amp;amp;5 4.2
