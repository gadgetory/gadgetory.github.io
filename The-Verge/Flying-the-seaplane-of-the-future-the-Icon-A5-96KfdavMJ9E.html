you spend all your time filling your
garage with exotic playthings $200,000
is an afterthought you want something
with great design but performance you
could add another Ferrari to the stable
but I have another proposition for you
the icon a5 basically a sports car for
the air it's made by an outfit called
icon it's based in California and they
are exploiting a new FAA rule which is
meant to encourage new pilots get in the
air it's less than $250,000 in my world
that is a drop in the bucket when you're
talking about a plane so instead of
buying that Ferrari you could buy the a5
spend 20 or 30 hours of flight time and
potentially get your sport license it's
got all the carbon-fiber it looks great
great design aesthetic and it's very
simple apparently now you can't fly
during night you can't fly over 10,000
feet and only in good weather and these
conditions but basically I could take
this out head out five hours someplace
and have an amazing time
obviously it's amphibious you can land
on your private lake in Wyoming or here
on the Hudson the wings fold back so you
can transport it on a trailer really
easily and best of all things go badly
it's got a parachute dude I am going to
cause as much trouble as I can they're
gonna give me the yoke in
brought the rope
Joey Nichkhun is mostly visual right
here okay you're not that much to our
contact we stay away from that stuff we
stay away from control towers you can
take this airplane there and you can't
go there
dividuals it's obviously designed to use
really you know how much you can
actually see is incredible right is
awesome yeah just like whole wide field
of view oh it's so good it's so good
that the plane is such an unusual shape
you know hey Abby it's decide to have
that visceral emotional risk all right
and this the windows are open now
Gabby you can fly with those out
actually I'll do this this airplane to
go to a stop pressurized right so yeah
yeah if you go really hide it's getting
cold yeah you gonna let the widows in go
in really about the ceiling height on
this or what gets out 15,000 it shows a
sport pilot obey to the vertical the
free if you're on it we're on the water
we were considered a boat okay yeah so
literally when we're on the water with
those so we follow the rules of boating
if we're foot off the water or higher we
have to follow the FAA rules just glide
it on it oh that is so cool yeah but oh
good yeah that's no fun at all why would
you want to fly like a bird around New
York City I you know you're skipping all
the traffic it's like kind of like a
sports car at a really fast sports car
but it's all it's everything I want to
do awesome I want more
all right so icon a5 is uh it actually
felt easy it's sort of drama-free was
not how to talk to the tower I just
making sure you don't run into stuff but
the good thing is in the air there's not
that much stuff to run into so that is
the best of both worlds in so many ways
dude I totally want</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
