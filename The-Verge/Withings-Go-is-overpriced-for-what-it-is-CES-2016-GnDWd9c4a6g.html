the verge and we're taking a look at the
new winnings though activity tracker so
one thing that's different about the way
things go from LEDs from other activity
trackers that have them into sway
value of that is twofold not only is it
great for battery life but it's also
always on that was the point of using
eing you can see right now that this
particular tracker which is not mine I
have to admit you know person has been
pretty active today although they're not
quite at their goal yet if you press
this in the middle actually changes mode
modes and goes to a regular watch face
and you get a little bit of haptic
feedback when you do that which is kind
of cool I can actually kind of feel it
clicking when I press down this is what
the strap looks like it's kind of a
standard you know railroad strap for an
activity tracker this parts rubber
it feels pretty lightly honestly it
feels a little bit cheap and it's not
cheap other devices that are like this
when jawbone makes something that looks
very similar to this called the jawbone
up move and that I think is $50
Fitbit also has one that looks kind of
similar to this one of the earlier
trackers this one costs 69 dollars and
it's shipping sometime this spring and
it shares all the data to the widows
mobile app as you might expect so that's
a quick snapshot of use with the
go from more CES videos be sure to check
out our version too</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
