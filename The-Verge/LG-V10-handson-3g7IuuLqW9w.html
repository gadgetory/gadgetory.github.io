Verge and what I have here is the LG v10
it's the company's newest premium
smartphone now the first thing you
notice when you take a look at this
phone is that there's this little extra
screen up here at the top of the device
and basically think of this second
screen as kind of like how you use the
edge screen on the s6 edge or on the
note edge you can quickly launch apps
like you can get into the camera you can
also use it to access contacts you can
use it for multitasking you can leave it
on all day and LG says it will only
affect up to 5% of the battery of the
phone or you can turn it off and right
next to that second screen you see two
front-facing cameras these are both 5
megapixel cameras and the difference
between the two is that one has a field
of view of 80 degrees and one has a
field of view of 120 degrees so LG
saying that basically they want with
this phone for you to be able to remove
the need for a selfie stick and that 120
degree camera capture everybody that's
in the shop that you're trying to get on
the back we have the same 16 megapixel
camera that we had in the LG g4 so you
can expect the camera performance to be
very similar to the g4 you know fast
autofocus really great detail really
neutral colors but it will all probably
run a little bit faster there's a
Snapdragon 808 processor in here but
there's 4 gigs of ram this time around
as opposed to what's found on the g4 one
thing you'll notice is that the curve
and the display is gone this is a flat
display and where LG has made a lot of
phones with plastic before this one has
stainless steel along the sides and
throughout the body and then a silicon
back that actually looks a lot like what
you'd find on motorola droid phones it's
got sort of cut in throughout here and
it feels kind of rough but it definitely
feels like it wouldn't slip out of your
hand you also have a fingerprint sensor
on the back which is pretty standard
these days and LG puts the volume
buttons back here so there are no
buttons along the edges so you have this
nice smooth design that does feel good
in the hand it's also 191 grams so about
the same way this is I phone 6s plus and
8.9 millimeters so it's not too thin but
it's also not too thick now LG really
wants to sell the v10 to
you creators where it looks at the
phones like the G for the G flex 2 as
phones for consumers of media and so
some of the things that they've done
this time around is some software tweaks
that'll play to people who really want
to use this phone to make media on the
go one of those things is a whole suite
of manual controls for the video so a
lot like how there were manual controls
for photos in the g4s photo shooting we
have a whole bunch of stuff you can see
the left and right audio channel here we
have different frame rates that you can
shoot at you have optical image
stabilization as well as a chip inside
that should help with the software
stabilization you can control things
like ISO shutter speed all within the
video controls and that was something
you could never really do before if you
were shooting video on an LG phone and
then some there's some other software
tweaks set should play into this creator
role as well there's a high quality
32-bit audio digital analog converter in
here as well so basically you're going
to be getting a lot for what you're
going to be paying here for this phone
it's also got a 3000 milliamp hour
battery which is replaceable but you're
only going to be able to get one variant
as far as a storage goes with the v10
LG's selling it in a 64 gigabyte variety
but no more and no less you can however
use a micro SD card to expand the
storage and LG says they've tested it up
to 200 gigabytes so this phone is going
to be released pretty soon in Korea and
then it will make it to the US in early
November there's no detail on pricing
yet and that will be dependent
definitely on the carriers here in the
United States but expected to be about
as much as an iPhone 6s plus for more
