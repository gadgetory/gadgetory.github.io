- Hey, I'm Vlad with the Verge.
Here at CES 2019 and I'm
here with the Razer Raptor
27 inch monitor that is the latest edition
to Razer's Chroma family of
RGB LED illuminated products.
It's a 27 inch 2560 by 1440 display,
IPS one millisecond refresh time.
It has AMD FreeSync support.
Razer's working with Nvidia
to add G-Sync support.
It is intended for gamers.
And it does add a little
bit of Razer's own brand
of extra design, so what you
get with it is you get aluminum
on the frame, then you get
aluminum framework on the back,
and you get a forged aluminum stand.
And here's the cool thing.
You can pivot this thing back 90 degrees
to give you really easy access
to over the cables back here.
It comes with five green cables.
They come bundled with the monitor.
One of them is for your choice
of HDMI or Display Port.
One is USB-C, two of them
are USB-A pass throughs
and one of them is power.
So, this whole tilting
thing is just to give you
easy access to plug things in and out.
Around the back, there's
a routing mechanism
that kinda makes it look like
all the cables just flowing
out of the back of the monitor,
which is just a cool design feature.
So there are no buttons on the bottom, top
or sides of the thing.
There's only just analog
joystick over here
which turns it on and off.
Gets you into the menus,
on-screen controls and so on.
So let's get the thing I don't
like out of the way first.
I've seen better displays than this.
I've seen deeper blacks,
more saturated colors.
Better contrast.
Razer says there's 420 nits
of brightness in this display,
so it's bright enough,
but it doesn't impress me
on first sight.
That being said, I do like the flexibility
of being able to adjust the height.
I like the system that
Razer has implemented
with all the cables and
just the way that it's
color themed and synchronized.
I'm not myself a fan of Chroma,
but the fact that it's here and
the fact that it can sync up
with, it's currently run via USB-C
via this Razer Blade laptop.
You can sync it up with a laptop.
You can sync it up with your desktop
and the same mousepad and mouse and so on.
There's definitely a sense of an ecosystem
and a family of products here.
So even though I criticized
the contrast of this display,
I do love the fact that it's matte,
so maybe that's part of
what loses some of that
punchiness of the color.
As somebody who hates the glare
on his 27 inch iMac,
I do really appreciate
a large screen display with a matte screen
which handles any light in the room
with ease instead of giving
me a mirror reflection.
So, unfortunately we weren't able to do
the most important thing
that you can do with
a gaming monitor, which is
play some actual games on it,
but we can talk about it's price.
The 27 inch Razer Raptor will be available
in the first half of 2019 for $699.
