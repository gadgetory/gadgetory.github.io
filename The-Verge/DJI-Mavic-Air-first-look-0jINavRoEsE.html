Verge and we are here in New York City
taking a look at the brand new DJI Mavic
air now this is the newest drone from
DJI and it looks a little bit like the
DJI spark and a little bit like the DJI
Mavic pro and it's because it's
basically a little bit of both of those
drones all in one package it's got a lot
of really great features from the Mavic
Pro that cinematographers are gonna like
and it comes in this really portable
size that fits in basically a really big
pocket like the spark let's talk about
some of the specs it can shoot 4k
footage at 24 or 30 frames a second it
can shoot 1080p footage at up to 120
frames a second for really good
slow-motion footage DJI says that it's
got a 21 minute flight time which is on
the lower side but more than the spark
and obviously the battery is swappable
so if you buy extra batteries you can
fly as long as you want and it's also
not supposed to overheat as easily as
some pastor owns have DJI says that
they've created this whole new
ventilation system that's supposed to
keep the drone cool which is a good
thing because you don't want to
overheating in the sky and falling to
its death some of the other things that
DJI is done with this it's redesigned
the gimbal system that supports the
camera not really any different camera
as far as the sensor goes it's the same
size sensor as the Navajo but DJI says
that they've put a lot of software work
into making the footage and the pictures
that come out of this look a lot better
this time around there's other new
hardware on this drone too there are
these extra antennas now that also act
as landing legs that are supposed to
support up to 2.5 miles of range and up
to 16,000 feet for the ceiling on this
throne it also can supposedly withstand
winds of up to 22 miles an hour and has
a top speed of 42.5 miles an hour
in a sport mode which DJI says is its
fastest at least in its consumer drones
there are seven cameras on this drone to
help support a newly rebuilt obstacle
avoidance system which now not only will
stop the drone if it sees it's about to
run into something but can also try and
plan a route around that obstacle so if
you're heading for a tree and you
already have the drone sort of making
this really smooth movement filming it
can move its way around
that tree instead of just stopping and
kind of ruining your shot and there are
a bunch of other software enhancements
on this drone to gji says that there are
new shooting modes like a 32 megapixel
panorama mode there's this new sort of
tiny planet mode that it will be able to
warp the footage around and make it look
like you're you've got the DJI drone you
know thousands and thousands and
thousands of feet up in the air looking
down on the planet the gesture control
systems supposed to be a lot better for
controlling the drone with your hand and
DJI is also promising a lot of the other
sort of smart features that we've seen
on its drones in the past are all
getting improvements here the vision
recognition system the sort of way that
it handles itself in flight the
algorithms that control it for keeping
it from slamming into objects have all
gotten better on the Mavic air now this
drone not only slots between the spark
and the Mavic pro sort of specs and size
and everything like that but also on
prices cost seven hundred ninety nine
dollars which includes a newly
redesigned remote there's also a
thousand dollar combo packed like we've
seen in the past which will get you
extra propellers extra batteries things
like that my first impression of this
thing is it's a really smart blending of
the size and portability something like
the spark and the affordability of
something like the spark with most of if
not all of the pro features that you get
on something like the Matic pro sure
there are some things that are probably
missing that people will want like 4k at
60 frames a second but you get pretty
much everything else that you'd get in
the Maverick Pro in a smaller size
through this slightly shorter flight
time
the only thing DJI really has to worry
about is whether or not they're
releasing too many drones now this is a
lot to fit within a five hundred dollar
price range but this company owns 50% or
more of the American drone market right
now and considering that GoPro just left
the drone market two weeks ago
completely I doubt that's going to be
much of a problem keep it locked to the
verge comm for more drone coverage and
