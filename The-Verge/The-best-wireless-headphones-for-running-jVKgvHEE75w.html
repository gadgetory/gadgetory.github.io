headphones a little annoying sometimes
for the obvious reasons you have to
charge them and take the time to pair
them and all that but the one thing that
Bluetooth headphones are really great
for is working out they give you the
freedom to move around the gym however
you want to and you can just stuff your
phone in a pocket and forget about it
while you're out running and so for this
this is my next we're taking a look at
bluetooth sport headphones now there are
a lot of good Bluetooth sport headphones
out there now so how do you even begin
to choose which pair is right for you
I'll say this it's not necessarily about
the purist or absolutely best audio
quality yet when it comes to sport
headphones these are going to get beat
up they're going to be tossed in a gym
bag you're going to sweat on them so
really what it comes down to is
durability of course how well they fit
can they hold a charge and okay sound
after using more than a dozen different
pairs of sport headphones I've come up
with two pairs that I think stand out my
number one pick for Bluetooth sport
headphones RJ Labs epic 2 Wireless sport
earbuds J lab has made all the right
moves with this pair of headphones from
fit - sound - battery life -
waterproofing these are sturdy but light
with an adjustable cable and they come
with eight different pairs of gel tips
so they should fit a variety of ears
they do require a little bit of
adjustment because they go over the ear
and then you have to twist them in but
once they're in there they're in there
and they sound great they offer deep
bass with crisp clear vocals my only
complaint would be that sometimes they
sounded a little bit bright so I'd end
up turning the volume down like a lot of
other Bluetooth headphones they pair
with both iPhone and Android smartphones
and they have a standard three button
remote and mic attached to the cable
they have a ridiculously long 12 hour
battery life and they also come with an
IP x5 waterproof rating now does this
mean that you should go swimming with
them no but I've been sweating in them
and have spilled water on them from my
water bottle and the tap and they're
still fine
these are perfect though the plastic
earbuds themselves are actually pretty
big and while I was able to find a
comfortable fit eventually the sheer
size of those might be an annoyance to
some people now if you want to spend a
little less money a close second or
Plantronics backbeat fit bluetooth
headphones what really sold me on these
was comfort and convenience
it just felt super comfortable to me
they go over the ear like the jail abs
for a more secure fit and this cables
pretty thick but the best part about it
is when you throw it in a bag it doesn't
tangle the sound quality on these is
pretty good it's not super bass heavy
but there's enough for beat-driven
workout songs also the earbuds are
designed to let some noise into the ear
canal which some people prefer when
they're exercising outdoors and as an
added bonus the backbeat fits come with
a neoprene armband for your smartphone
so why aren't these my topic well the
main reason is that the remote control
technology is built into the earbuds
themselves it's not in a little remote
that comes on the cable now in theory
having interactive earbuds is not a bad
idea but in this case with the
Plantronics there's a learning curve and
they're also kind of sensitive so every
time I went to Goa just the ear buds of
my ears I would end up accidentally
skipping or pausing a song I just kept
wishing that it had a simple three
button remote on the cable like the J
labs there are a lot of other Bluetooth
sport headphones to choose from and like
I said this is going to come down to
personal sound and fit preferences for
you but there are some other things to
consider that might be deal-breakers
first do you really want to spend 150 to
200 dollars on a pair of headphones that
are basically going to get beat up it's
kind of how I feel about the Beats
powerbeats2
wireless headphones or the brand new
j-bird freedom sport headphones they're
both really nice and offer good sound
but that's a lot of money to spend on
sport headphones you'll also want to
determine whether you can deal with neck
buds while you're working out like the
kind on JBL's reflect response Bluetooth
sport headphones some people find is
really comfortable I find them to be a
little
doing especially when I'm running there
are also some sport headphones that
require you to use a mobile app to
experience the full benefits of
headphones like Jabra sport pace or
sport coach but personally last thing I
want is to have to download another
fitness app whether or not you want six
hours of battery life or 12 a flexible
cable or an unbending one interactive
earbuds or a three button remote noise
isolating buds or ambient noise and of
course how well they actually fit you is
really going to come down to you but you
can't go wrong with jail abs epic -
