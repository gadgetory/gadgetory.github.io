Google i/o taking a look at Android auto
it was just announced we're inside a
Hyundai car and it is hooked up by a USB
to a nexus as soon as you plug it in you
get this interface you can see that it's
navigating right now but we can close
that we're in the overview screen now so
this tells you everything that's going
on with the phone you can tap over music
you can tap over to phone to make phone
calls and you can even tap over to look
at you know actually information about
your car if the car provides that to the
android phone this also works with
third-party apps if you were to tap on
the music icon again you could choose a
different third-party app for to work
with and of course full google maps
navigation is all here and that works
pretty well and I mean it's actually
really straightforward it's safe so
you're not using your phone in the car
it's just all here on the screen and you
know full google voice search works as
well play arcade fire
there it is
so that's android auto it should be
coming out before the end of the year on
certain manufacturers there's a whole
lot of partners that are going to be
working with this and it's a pretty neat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
