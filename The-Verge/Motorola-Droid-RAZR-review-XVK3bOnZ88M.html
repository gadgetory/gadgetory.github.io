and this is the motorola droid razr it's
not only the thinnest 4G LTE phone in
the market it's the thinnest smartphone
market at just point to eight inches
thick motorola made that happen with a
stainless steel frame inside and a
Kevlar backplate it's really light but
it's also really strong and there's no
flex at all you can tell on your hand
that it's pretty sturdy device design
wise you can see if I was right in line
for the droid x2 and droid bionic
there's the classic Motorola hump at the
top with the camera elements but it is
very thin it's just not that small it's
about as big as the samsung galaxy s2 on
sprint which is also 4g device the s2 is
a little bit thicker but it has a bigger
screen 4.5 inches versus the 4.3 inches
on the razor the razor is 4.3 inch
screen and a huge bezel around it makes
it hard to use one-handed compared to
the iphone it's a giant monster the
razor uses the industry's first q HD
Super AMOLED display but it's not as
good in practice as it is on paper you
can definitely see jaggies in text and
images tended to store it when you
scroll around in the browser compared to
the Q HD LCD display on the droid x to
the razor is definitely one step behind
it's nowhere near the class of something
with Retina display on the iphone 4s one
of the best features on the razor is
smart actions which monitor different
settings and states on the phone and
take action based on them so here you
can see I've set one up for when the
battery level falls below ten percent
the GPS modified other sensors turn off
it's also really easy to create a new
one that's add one here i'm going to set
one up so when i plug in the headphones
audio launches that's the app i like to
use so i just scroll down here select
our do and i think i also want a
notification let me know that it plugged
in the headphones so add it there close
it out plug in the headphones and you
can see our tia launched I got a little
notification you can see Motorola's also
put the latest version of its Android
skin on the razor it's getting
increasingly overwrought with every
release and the animations on the razor
a particularly slow and sort of boring
well the droid razr is an impressive
piece of hardware engineering with
smartphones that's really the software
the cans and so I'd wait for the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus which will ship with
Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich and
arrive on verizon probably coming weeks
