we're sitting here with Stephen Elop the
CEO of Nokia
and we are talking about Nokia's new
products big announcements Stephen thank
you for sitting down with us my pleasure
you're here in New York you're you're
brandishing currently brandishing a
phone that is a new device tell me what
you're doing here tell me what's going
on with Nokia what is what is happening
well you may recall about 18 months ago
we launched a new strategy where we
partnered with Microsoft for our smart
phone efforts you've seen a series of
steps since then including last year the
introduction of our first Lumia products
were here in New York today to introduce
the next two members of our Lumia family
indeed the next generation of Lumia
products and that includes the Lumia 920
and the Lumia 820 two products that we
believe represent the most innovative
smartphones in the world top of the
smartphone tier absolutely globally
absolutely so tell me a little about
these phones obviously new colors
they're very brightly colored but but
what are the you've got kind of a you
were talking to me earlier you said
you've got a mid-range which is the 820
that's correct and then the the top tier
which is the 920 that's correct so give
me give me a brief overview of what's
going on with these devices so what
we're doing with these devices obviously
we're building on the Windows Phone 8
platform in order to deliver the most
personal smartphone experience and
already some information has been shared
about the new Live Tiles and how you can
make it a more personal experience but
nokia has taken it a step further than
that for example we've introduced some
amazing capabilities that allow you to
take absolutely the best pictures and
video the way we've done that is through
the extension of our PureView technology
you may recall we've done some lossless
zooming work with the PureView 808
device now we've introduced floating
lens technology where the lens is
actually floating in this device and so
it stabilizes the images now what does
that mean to a consumer it means that in
very low light conditions or if your
hand is shaking or you're on a bicycle
or something like that you can take
beautiful images that are stable or
videos that aren't bouncing all around
baby you're calling this you're calling
this pure view but your previous pure
view is a very high resolution
in PureView so is PureView now more
malleable that Purim applies to camera
general camera technology or how does
that your review is about the very best
pictures and videos and when someone is
trying to take the best images they may
be trying to solve the zoom problem the
low-light challenges the shaky hand
opportunity all of those things so
PureView is about solving all of those
problems in the 9:20 we've gone after
low-light conditions and the shaky hand
you don't have a massive megapixel not
on this particular device how many
megabytes 8.7 megapixels on this device
but a tremendous amount of processing
that goes on against that that sensor in
order to deliver just some fantastic
imagery so that's one element of it
second key thing that we focused on is
making sure that you can navigate
through your world better than with any
other device now traditionally that has
meant mapping navigation perhaps public
transport navigation to use the public
transport system but one of the things
that is a key element of our platform
now is something called Nokia City lens
where I can hold up this device and
through the camera lens be looking at
the world around me and overlaid on that
screen are icons that indicate where for
example if I'm looking for a particular
coffee shop or the Intrepid which is
just outside the window here I can find
it touch it navigate to it so a really
really enhanced experience to help
people get around the city and mapping
is something you said recently I think
on an earnings call that you guys wanted
to be the the we're company you wanted
to be really known for navigation and
mapping and have that ties in to your
devices are you gonna will you be
partnering with people on this is this
gonna be something where it's like
Foursquare wants to become part of your
this augmented reality view is that is
that a place where you see yourself
going to tie in other services or do you
feel like this is something that's
wholly owned by by Nokia so with the the
Lumia products we're introducing
applications that take advantage of the
wear platform augmented reality is an
example that we've chosen to build on
that platform you will see others we
recently announced Groupon as one
example who themselves will build
applications on that ware platform and
what you should expect to see in the
weeks ahead are more and more companies
saying we're
making a bet for our location-based
services on the Nokia wear platform
there's a lot more excitement coming in
that space right now I know we don't
have a ton of time so I kind of want to
you've got a lot of announcements you've
got wireless charging with these devices
correct just set the device and a way
though you have a doc that your work
you've done with JBL which is a some
sort of fusion of Nokia and JBL
technologies a fusion of technology a
fusion of design but it allows you to
set the device on the speaker and it's
charging you can NFC parrot and you've
got a beautiful sound system built into
it so just by setting the device down
you're connected you're charging
everything's working beautifully
and so you're not saying what carriers
here in the US you're launching with
that's correct but LTE you'll have LTE
devices that's correct so we can kind of
guess who that might be
you're not saying an exact date on when
these are launching in q4
you're not saying prices that's correct
so you're not really saying any detail
that a consumer might need to be able to
purchase one of these that's okay I
understand you've got to get your ducks
in a row here's what I want to know you
released the Lumia 900 just seems like a
few months ago what was the actual
launch date in the US huh it was the
Easter weekend
okay Easter is in April April that's
right okay so we're in September now not
that long not that long of a stretch and
you've got a new flagship phone what do
you say to people who went and bought
the 900 who just bought this phone
they're not getting fully upgraded to
Windows Phone 8 you've got a new front
of the market which looks sort of
similar but it's clearly way more
powerful what's the message to those
people I mean how did it do I mean how
do they continue to stay in love or be
in like with Nokia and with Windows
Phone when they just spent this money on
the phone and they just got into a
contract and you've got a new phone on
the market what is the message there the
message there is very clear and that is
we're continuing to invest in the Lumia
900 as well as the other original Lumia
products so certain of these
capabilities for example that new start
screen and the arrangement of tiles
which is entirely new and improved will
be bringing that back to the existing
Lumia devices
similarly the city lens technology will
be available on those devices and
there's many more examples like that
some of what we're showing with these
device
things like wireless charging things
like the floating lens technology for
that stable image those things the
hardware is not in the older devices so
there's there's only so much we can do
but where we have been able to make
those improvements and things that
really matter to consumers we're
continuing on that with the existing
product but I mean if you but if you're
a consumer wouldn't you feel a little
slighted that you guys just released
this flagship device and now you've got
a brand new one a few months later what
I would feel is that Nokia for many
years has demonstrated its willingness
to continue to support and invest in
existing phones even while new
technology makes new experience as
possible in the technology world there's
always that step forward that's what
makes it so exciting for us and for
consumers as well and so we'll do
everything we can to help existing
consumers while also bringing the next
generation of experiences to them okay I
know we have to wrap up Steven thank you
so much for joining us that's a look at
the new Nokia products and chat with
Steven thanks so much pleasure of
everything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
