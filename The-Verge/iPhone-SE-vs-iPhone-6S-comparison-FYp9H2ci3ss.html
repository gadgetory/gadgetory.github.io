assuming of course that your eyesight is
good enough to actually see it what is
that is that an iPhone so small I can't
tell you okay enough small talk this is
the new iPhone se it went on sale last
week and so far the reaction to it has
been pretty surprising let's just say
that some people are actually excited
about the idea of a smaller 4-inch phone
that also happens to be super fast and
takes pretty good photos other people
have said it's basically the iPhone 6s
crammed into the body of an iPhone 5s
and that there is not much that's really
new about it that's not exactly true so
what are the differences between last
year's iPhone 6s and this new iPhone se
the first and most obvious difference
between these two phones is of course
the size the iPhone se has a 4-inch
display the iPhone 6s has a 4.7 inch
display if you wanted to go really big
the iPhone 6s plus has a 5.5 inch
display the second difference is price
the iPhone se is only $399 for a 16
gigabyte phone wait wait only $400
really
okay so $400 for a phone is still a lot
of money for a lot of people but I guess
it's Apple's lowest starting price point
for an iPhone yeah but can we talk about
16 gigabytes really Apple are we still
making 16 gigabyte phones who still gets
a 16 gigabyte whoo yes no I hear you and
I feel your pain and maybe we'll we'll
talk about that in another versus video
but for now which probably go back to
pricing so how much is the iPhone 6s
okay so the iPhone 6s is pretty
expensive
it starts at six hundred and $49
another notable difference between the
two is that the new iPhone se does not
have 3d touch whereas the iPhone 6s does
3d touch means that there are pressure
sensors integrated directly into the
display of the phone and when you press
on it content pops out of certain apps
yeah not so much on this little phone so
what are the similarities between the
iPhone se and the iPhone 6s both run on
Apple's latest mobile software iOS 9.3
yep and both are running on the same
processor as well yep the iPhone 6s and
the S II run on Apple's aim-9 chip which
is the company's newest processor for
iPhones it is definitely faster than the
a7 chip which was the processor in the
iPhone 5s the iPhone 6s has a 12
megapixel rear facing camera with true
tone flash it shoots 4k video and it
also shoots live photos which is kind of
Apple's attempt to be hit with gifts the
iPhone se has the same rear camera as
the one in the iPhone 6s but selfie
takers should take note that the
front-facing camera on the iPhone se is
a 1.2 megapixel camera and it's not as
good as the one in the iPhone 6s you can
use your iPhone 6s to pay for things
with Apple pay at stores that support it
the iPhone se has Apple pay now too
oh and you can summon Siri by shouting
hey Siri at your phone yep and you can
now shout hey Siri at the iPhone se too
assuming that you want to question on
everyone's mind what about battery life
yeah what about battery life you clearly
a bigger phone over here means that I
get better battery right well actually
no the iPhone se does have a slightly
smaller battery than the iPhone 6s but
it also has a smaller display which
means fewer pixels to power it has a
faster more efficient processor and it
has new software so all those things
combined means that this little phone
gets surprisingly excellent battery life
in my experience it even lasted longer
than the iPhone 6s in some cases well I
mean I I still get excellent battery
life with the for the charging brick
so naturally when you compare the iPhone
se with the iPhone 6s the iPhone 6s is
going to have a few more advanced
features like 3d touch or better camera
technology and this is intentional
because at the end of the day it's
Apple's current flagship phone we also
don't know what kind of technology is
going to show up in next iPhone and it's
likely that Apple wasn't going to just
throw it into the mid-cycle iPhone se
which is really aimed at first timers or
upgraders but overall the iPhone se II
is a pretty kick-ass little phone so if
you're looking to upgrade from a 4s or
from a 5s or if you just like small
phones you probably won't be
disappointed with this one thanks for
watching the video I'm Lauren good with
the verge and don't forget to subscribe
to our YouTube channel which by the way
looks great on a bigger screen phone
know what I'm saying
Rarity's between the Iowa you to stop
now I can't tell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
