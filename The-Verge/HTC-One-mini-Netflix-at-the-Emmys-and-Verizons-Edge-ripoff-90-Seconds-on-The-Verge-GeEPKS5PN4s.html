hamburger as I was known in prison the
Hamburglar this is 90 seconds on the
verge is the HTC One too bulky for your
skinny jeans well your prayers have been
answered HTC introduced the one mini
today the phone offers the same
experience as its 5-inch counterpart but
technically speaking the processors to
step down HTC says the promise is the
compromises are only technical not
practical the Emmy nominations are out
and that means nominations for the usual
suspects AMC HBO and Netflix the mega
streaming service receive 14 nominations
across three different shows making it
the first time an online-only show has
been nominated house of cards received
nine nominations overall including Best
Drama and acting nods for kevin spacey
and robin wright netflix may be the
first online distributor to receive
nominations but it won't be the last
amazon has vowed to produce more
original content the coming year and
finally verizon has announced its
awesome new phone upgrade plan to
compete with AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile and it's
seemingly just another giant rip off
edge the new upgrade plan from verizon
divides up the phones cost across 24
months it also allows customers to
upgrade their phone every six months but
just like with a TNT's new next plan
you're still paying the same subsidy in
your monthly plan that you always have
on top of this new monthly fee it's all
a bit technical but here's the gist
you'll be paying more and your bill will
still confuse you and that's it for
today's top stories coming up tomorrow
the Venetian hotels top restaurant makes
its first expansion to Venus the
Michelin stars still apply in outer
space</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
