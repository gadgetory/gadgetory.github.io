this is the Wilson X connected
basketball Wilson X connected basketball
is a smart basketball that knows whether
or not you made or missed your shot
without needing to add anything to the
rim or to the net it connects via
bluetooth to an app on your phone that
can track a whole practice worth of
shots and there even a couple games that
you can play to help make yourself a
little bit better in the clutch and we
wanted to test this out for ourselves so
we came over to Brooklyn to play some
basketball I'm not very good at
basketball haven't played in a long time
so I brought my colleague Frank P out
with me because he actually can make a
few shots bottom line is this thing's a
lot of fun to play with but there are
some limitations first you have to have
a net on your hoop second you have to
shoot from outside seven feet this
thing's not gonna attract layups or
dunks even if that's not a problem for
you the app also gives you constant
feedback whether you've made or missed
the shot but you need a Bluetooth
speaker some Bluetooth headphones to be
able to listen to that while you're
playing setting your phone on the side
of the course just isn't gonna cut it
you're never gonna hear that feedback
it's really simple to use to pair it all
you have to do is flip the ball ten feet
in the air and let it rotate it connects
to the phone really fast there's no
buttons no USB dongles no charging in
fact Wilson says you could shoot this
thing 300 times a day seven days a week
52 weeks a year before it would start to
die but the biggest problem of this
thing might be the accuracy Wilson says
it's 97 percent accurate but it
definitely didn't feel that way while we
were out here on the court miss shots
didn't register as miss made shots
didn't register is made and the biggest
problem is the lag even when it is
working it takes a while for the
Bluetooth to register all the way back
to your phone and tell you that you've
made or missed a shot that's fine in
free throw modes but in the game modes
can be really annoying all that brings
us around to the price this thing is not
cheap for a basketball 199 dollars
gonna be out on the court shooting
hundreds of times a day every day to
make sure that you make the team maybe
that's worth the investment
but for that much money we'd expect a
little bit more accuracy this basketball
was one of the first of its kind and
it's only gonna get better it's already
better than some of the other ones that
are out on the market
Wilson's also gonna be bringing this
tech to some of the other sports like
tennis volleyball and baseball that is
involved with but it's the kind of thing
that could fundamentally change how we
play sports and how we get better at
them if your goal is to get better at
basketball this can definitely help but
it's not gonna do all the work for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
