motion we're making next-generation 3d
motion sensing device
tell me about what we're what we're
looking at here right here we just we've
got a bunch of different demos we
usually start off with something very
simple just some like some like 2d
drawing and you can see you know it's
fast it's responsive but but not just in
a sort of in a sort of very broad way
also in a very fine way so I can these
each squares just one centimeter and I
can draw something like hello within
just a few millimeters and this is all
being powered by basically a demo
version of this yeah and this thing
that'll plug into your computer yeah
yeah yeah yeah the the demo version is
nowhere near as good as the final
version Vetta
and how much will it recognize it'll get
10 fingers yeah we can get we can get
all any all 10 fingers we sees the
actual shape of your hand and so here's
the different fingers of it you know all
you can see all the different fingers on
my hand and you can see very very very
very subtle motions and of course I can
do something like draw draw some sort of
spirals in the air and then I can rotate
around then you can see everything's in
3d oh wow so yeah this we can track
multiple fingers we can do all the sort
of things that are normally I sort of
associated with touch and to get that
really you get you get the really good
pinch to zoom you get you can do more
than one hand you can sort of walk
around and zoom out and do all sorts
interesting stuff and you're saying it's
all about dynamic feedback rather than
particular gestures like you use
something and it shows you what you're
doing as opposed to mmm telling you how
to do a certain action yeah yeah exactly
I'm the backwards that will cite any
sort of application made for touch just
works this is sort of a famous touch
demo and in this case there's no actual
appliqu√© there's no actual API between
our software and this software this is
sort of a software that's looking for a
touchscreen and we basically give it a
virtual touch screen and we tell you
know there's you know what I do this
that's touching right there and so
basically you can get sort of effortless
backwards compatibility with sort of
legacy touch applications like instead
of having to develop for your particular
thing you just are basically projecting
a touch screen above yeah
here yeah yeah in this case if my finger
sort of laser points at the screen right
we're right where it would have touched
it you can you can use you know you can
do multiple hands simultaneously and
hands and tools simultaneously so maybe
like I'm drawing something with one hand
and rotating the page with my other hand
and you can you know you can detect like
what the various objects are so of
course I can
you know map a pencil to something like
drawing and map of markers and like a
marker and you know thank you you can do
lots of potentially very interesting
things that even on even if it's
two-dimensional are still things that
you couldn't personally do with
something like a tablet because it just
we're very limited in terms of what you
can actually recognize and there will be
a specialized app store for it right for
apps that are maybe yeah yeah so when
you get the device you can see like all
the sorts of really interesting things
they're actually made for that device in
particular I think the other people have
made compatible to that are also
compelling experiences mm-hmm I guess
it's interesting is to point out you
know the we were talking bout like
there's a female like a touchscreen in
this right in this case we're sensing
the direction of the pen to not just
them you know that's just the location
so you can see how as I rotate it around
you can you know that you could take it
imagine like writing the nice cursive
swish-swish you letters and things like
that and that's sort of one of those
things again that it touches not
particularly well-suited for so this is
a demo we often do where it's it's sort
of fast attacker but the interesting
thing is that it's actually a IMAP
basically you notice I don't have to
move my hand right now mm-hmm
because we've mapped a very smaller to a
very large area so other things that you
get out of this accuracy so that way you
get sort of the connectedness that you
get with something with touch but you
have the the sort of responsiveness and
sensitivity and affect ends of
efficiency of something like a mouse ah
and so but your think once your mouse in
the middle of screen you should be able
to sort of cover the entire screen with
just your fingertip mm-hmm maybe like a
little bit of wrist motion but not
probably too much I'm having trouble not
getting too excited about slicing fruit
I mean it really is amazingly accurate
imagine like reaching into a virtual
space and being able to sort of move
things around and a natural like sort of
very physical way whereas like otherwise
you wouldn't necessarily be able to do
these sorts of things know the idea of
reaching and moving things forward or
backwards and flipping things around and
moving to the side and doing things like
that don't necessarily make sense and
with this sort of conventional you know
interface device but here I'm just able
to grab space and sort of sort of move
it
and do the interesting things like that
imagine sort of just like reaching for
it and sort of grabbing the screen and
able to sort of flick it mm-hmm at some
point it's no longer it's no longer
gestures just like it's like you have
this object and it's in your hands and
you're able to manipulate in very subtle
ways that that's sort of very intuitive
in the back of your mind instead of
something you're thinking about like
okay well drop them and you do I do how
do I engage rotate mode okay let me
pivot here do this thing and and it ends
up becoming a it's a it's really
interesting it's a that's someone who
grew up with computers having having a
moment where you're where you're sort of
flicking where you're sort of moving
something between your fingertips is
very strange is like why wasn't I've
never had other insurance like that with
with a computer before that's what sort
of interesting exciting stuff yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
