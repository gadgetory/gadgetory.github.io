the verge mobile show this is a special
edition it's a day late because mobile
world congress is crazy the big giant
phone show in barcelona we are joined by
our reporters in barcelona also hosts of
the ridge bubble show Dan and Vlad chris
is here as well and we even have the
enesta bowl evan rodgers AKA quiz on
tata rack i doing guys that's not a word
cuz that's how to rock hello a good dune
joke I didn't let everybody say hey I'm
so and so and so inside said everybody's
name but that's because it's a crazy
wild show we do things differently the
second day so how is the house Barcelona
guys how's the show going for you it's
actually been pretty good it's a you
know than a surprisingly happening show
for things that you know are being
announced here there's been a lot of
products announced a lot of companies
are doing a lot of things which is kind
of like a stark difference from last
year we're not a lot of companies did
anything so we've been quite busy here
yeah last year was really very
businesses it almost so like him but we
she was kind of dying in terms of
consumer interest it was Oh
behind-the-scenes deals and things that
then panned out during the year which is
probably still going to happen was going
to happen maybe in the later part of the
week whereas this maker who had Sony
Samsung come out when you flex your
phone's stuff it didn't really happen
last year HTC also had an announcement
and a big teaser toward its event a
month from now so it's a bit more
exciting I think so okay I mean it seems
like the biggest news of the show has to
be samsung right even even though Sony
stuff I think looks pretty great Samsung
is you know the dominant Android player
and they've got their new flagship phone
and it looks like a band-aid that that
gold color is not flattering setting
aside a comparison I think
I mean honestly it doesn't just look
like a band-aid it feels like 10 frankly
it's like you took the galaxy s4 you're
like we need to give people something
new to buy so we'll just it would do
incremental changes to do comment to
upgrades that might not be the most
charitable assessment to give it because
the camera promises to living bhajan
proved it now has faced detectors
contrast detect auto focus from this is
a fast sort of focus on any spot for
camera no point three seconds that could
be a really big advantage over the long
term but honestly for myself I'm on the
world they just made the screen a bit
bigger 5 41 inches they gave it a new
physical design which is still very much
samsung gear and so far as its glitzy
and just on a paving I mean maybe my
taste a tube macho but you know the
curves feel a little wrong like where
the headphone jack is it kind of seems
like it's a break in the design or
something I don't know at the colors
mean it just the samsung said and this
is just so crazy to me they did research
and they said the number one thing
people demand for this platform is and I
quote a modern glam book haha and I feel
like they really match that demands with
what they've delivered it sounds like a
terrible idea and it looks like one
that's why it says nervous Venus yeah I
don't like what does that mean modern
glam look I like this this does not say
clam to me this says iterative update on
the gs4 which was itself an internet
iterative update on the gs3 and that's
not necessarily a bad thing but I mean
just looking at like this camera module
on the back and this you know what it's
stippled or whatever it's just super its
Nexus designed yeah so the other thing
that is super uninspiring to me is I
know they want to make it waterproof and
that's actually really great way we were
all super impressed with the galaxy s4
active but this thing flap over the the
USB port is kind of the worst yeah don't
they have the technology I mean we've
been seeing it for years at trade shows
they have the technology to like
hip phones in some coding that makes it
waterproof without needing these stupid
flaps right well there's a gamer's go
ahead then I was going to say there was
actually a couple companies I hear this
year showing off even more ways that
they can do that the same idea just like
a different approach of dipping some
other different chemical and then they
don't need to have the silly port
connectors and things like that you know
it's it's funny that there's a port
connector or report cover on the USB
port but the headphone jack is fine so
obviously they figured out ways to
waterproof those ports without requiring
a flap and you know we see Sony does the
same thing with its waterproof z1 and z2
they have flap covers over the micro USB
port so it's it's must be something to
do with those those connectors where it
really has to be kept free of water yeah
I was going to say is that there's also
distinction between bead waterproof and
water-resistant and the new galaxy s5
it's only water resistant it's ip67
rating which if you care to go read is
slightly lower rating than the
waterproof experience that too from Sony
and you know I've already made the jokes
I'm not gonna repeat it but okay I'm
gonna repeated facility should market
the exquisite to by saying that whereas
samsung's new phone can just get wet
Sony's can take hold I've you know yeah
okay okay you live that Jeff I would
like to point out that uh that IP 67
that in fact they spelled it out on
stage I P stands for ingress protection
and when he said that I was thinking it
there was some sort of tie into ingress
the game and it took me like a good
minute to realize that he was talking
not about some sort of like you know I
thought there was like some co-branding
thing or co-marketing thing where you
know the game that are that the phone
would come bundled with ingress and it
there'd be some like natural protection
for like a player if they were using a
gs5 but then I later realized that it
had absolutely nothing to do with that
yeah Chris you're the only person in the
world that made that connection no but
but they all they needed to say was ip67
because that's it like a acronym we've
before but no he's like ingress
protection 67 on stage like I bring this
information to the masses like they want
people to know it's not just acronyms
it's real in grass protection yeah so
what vibe at their unpacked event
because typically unpacked events are
totally batshit insane and this one was
like you know standard like Samsung gets
up and lifts off a bunch of features
well excited 15 minutes of orcas of
random orchestras oh well I mean that
the the orchestra was kind of like when
people were walking in and filing to
their seats the orchestra was playing
and it was I think they were having some
technical difficulties that push the
actual event back a few minutes so they
had they the orchestra play on but as
far as you know a samsung event this was
the straightest samsung of event as I've
ever attended they just played it right
down the middle as far as like showing
their products showing what their ideas
behind these products were what they do
what they're capable of and what they
their their mission with them or
whatever and they had people who you
know represented the products talk on
stage as opposed to having a Broadway
show and an actor try to represent these
things and you know as far as press
going to this event where you go and you
want to be there to learn about the new
products this is kind of something that
we've been asking Samsung to do for a
while you know there was no misogyny
there was no damn oh I totally failed
yeah laughing at dance so one of the
things I failed to mention at the top of
the show is that these guys are actually
at the press area in Barcelona at the
the conference center and so
connectivity is as it tends to be at the
mobile show in the mobile conference
really bad I think they're just missing
with us yeah i mean we're miserable so
the other thing is about the gs5 I mean
I know we're talking a lot about this
but it's like the most important android
phone we were like there'd been all
these rumors about they're going to tone
down the design and it just like they
didn't slather on a ton of features
other than the health stuff which we
should get to but they did like
basically keep the same Samsung
experience as you know it's not it's
totally the same it's a little insane
now you've done not just the same
software but the same ID which we
already talked about before like with
the exception of the back but like if
you look at the phone from the front
versus the gs4 and like if you looked at
them separately not literally side by
side but if you saw a picture of Jesus
for that picture of gs5 from the front I
think you'd be hard-pressed to tell the
difference and it's like it just feels
like Samsung is in cruise control right
now which I mean this is the classic
like complacent like company that's like
basically printing money and becoming
complacent you know and this story has
played out time and time and time again
over the past 15 years in the mobile
industry and Samsung kind of needs to
like step up its game I like it if the
GS 6 comes out and it doesn't look
significantly different I'm going to be
very very upset good thing I would say
is that Apple is kind of set
expectations with respect to that
insofar as you can have one design and
then you can pretty much reissue it the
next year but you're an out two years
you can't do it yeah yeah that's the
thing as Samsung has urged that sorry
Samsung Apple has done more to update
its iPhone design it iterates more often
than Samsung at this point which is
which seems counterintuitive and crazy
but that's totally what what's happening
right and the thing is Apple praised it
a bit more strained by saying this is
not the iphone 6 it's the iphone 5s all
right so it's pretty much like the old
one you just fortified it a bit when i'm
going to call it a six I think that's a
bit more faithful a bit more truthful to
do too much um hey I mean come on you
know how it is every year you have to
reassure your flagship phone whether
you're ready to or not whether you know
the silicon is ready one thing I would
say there's a Snapdragon 805 chip which
is looking amazingly powerful as you go
to sale today are they moving silicone
around into me but yeah it's time
driving at five it's a great chip but
that's coming this summer where's Sam
somebody needs to issue is the processor
and its new device now so we can get the
sales going so the
it's kind of forced into this corner
essentially I mean it's just the market
dynamics it's it's them is the carriers
everybody wants something you people
want something you so they kind of get
these overly incremental upgrades one
thing I'll say about that first penned
by the way um Jen says he's happy with
the iron man i'm kind of disappointed
that there wasn't a nice Michael Bay
interview to tell us about the phone
tell us about a five inch bike will
wanna display Michael so what place but
I'll a hundred wanted to celebrity to
just peace out that's what you wanted
and pretty much okay okay uh oh the
heart rate monitor like you guys tried
that how's that thing work it works as
advertised believe it or not it's able
to grab your heart rate in like five to
ten seconds I mean it's kind of a clunky
design because you have to hold your
phone and wait for it I am going to talk
about their wearables that they
announced and i think that the
implementation of the heart rate monitor
and those is a much better system but if
you don't want to buy wearable you know
now your phone can read your heart rate
if that's something you want to is five
seconds fast enough for a heart rate
monitor or a heart rate reading like
when would you be using this heart rate
monitor i would say probably in between
sets if you're working out that would be
my base um and if you get in freaked out
that you're about to have a sec that's
true yeah but it's not a it's not an EKG
it's a it's just a heart rate monitor
yeah so you can take isolated like
readings of your heart rate did they say
anything about like specifically what
kind of athletics or activities you
would use this in regard to SL ah i mean
the day they had a bunch of things and
all they didn't really go into that name
um yes Oh Dan Dan DRA know which and I
think it was so kind of overlapping with
a lag here yeah but what was going to
say is they had things in the background
they had icon showed people running and
cycling into how those things and as Dan
says I really think is something that
you can for example measure your resting
heart rate and then go into simpler
exercise and then come back measure
heart rate again then judge how
intensive that is and whether it's a
good idea maybe you can provide the
information to your doctor and oh I
don't know your trainer whatever people
do it's an extra piece of information
and tracking but to dance point I really
think that these heart rate monitors
make a ton more sense in the new
wearable to give to that get fit and
doing fun self right so actually let's
let's talk about these so the let's
let's talk about the boring ones first
and then move into the Icicle so there's
this there's the gear the gear fit and a
gear neo right and the gear the gear 2
and the gear neo seem like basic
iteration so like what's the difference
between these two what difference in to
get you in to get you neyo is that the
latter does not count which is awesome
because the camera is a silly feature
and I just rip is it'll also looks
cheaper it doesn't have the metal finish
on the top like the gear to does oh I do
want to our game paired with the camera
because that was basically the sole
thing that I should liked about the
original Galaxy gear is it's a it's a
quick little thing that you can you know
just take the quickest it's not just
with and it really doesn't get into
where you don't have to pour anything
out and unlike to browse you have to
have something stuck on top of your head
yeah but yeah I mean I looking for gear
to folks devices and I just from and
like to get a cig it wasn't terribly
good idea this is not either it is they
they fixed the software like with
minimal effort they basically just added
the ability they added a home button so
that you wouldn't have to like remember
one of the right which to me just
basically tells me tells you that this
is just from his bad display I've a very
important question is the display always
on on the gear to not if you way would
it would have no matter my god
now these are these are running Tizen
right that's correct so yeah that's the
biggest changes yeah so done any notable
difference with the these things running
Tizen that they seem faster it is the
software seem exactly the same was it
the the software experience is exactly
the same I mean they're running they do
feel snappier and more responsive but
that also could be because Samsung
probably upgraded the internal hard way
the the big difference here is that
samsung claims you can get two to three
days of battery life with this as
opposed to the one day that you got with
the galaxy gear whether that's
attributed to more efficient chips or
ties in being more efficient we don't
really know but you know it is
definitely a welcome improvement I mean
you you do you do not need let's put it
this way if your SmartWatch requires a
dual-core 1 gigahertz processor you're
doing something fundamentally wrong in
the design of your SmartWatch no no
SmartWatch should should have
functionality that requires that kind of
horsepower as it's just like it's so
Samsung that this entire product is so
Samsung I'm glad they refine this and
like took out some of the major pain
points from the original Garen actually
they were really like I thought that
they were almost apologetic onstage
about the original gear when they were
announcing the gear too but yeah that'd
be nice losses yeah but but that
being said this is not I mean I think we
can all agree this is not the gear to
get excited about right absolutist
estimation on the positive side of the
equation with the gear to did not have
interchangeable straps which again is a
step forward sorceress yeah but the
earlier point and it's a very important
one of these are bakes they put a home
button on it look that just tells you
everything you need to know you're
taking an interface that requires a home
button an interface that is usually fit
on for 25 inch devices and you shrinking
it down to the wrist and it's just wrong
you need something that is specific to
its physical dimensions in a way
something that if it needs a button it
should be a home button at the bottom of
it it doesn't that's the same plane as
the that's the same complaint is the
sony smartwatch to write that you know
it has basically the standard android
buttons below the display on the front
which is insane and the thing is you
operate these things with either your
fourth finger or thumb and they don't
bring right all right so the android pot
and stay the same size in order to 384
your thumb to be able to touch them
properly but then they are so much more
space on something that fits on your
range something that is essentially
supposed to be a watch right okay well
let's talk about the gear that's awesome
which if you're fit and it looks like
pretty freakin good like it you know
it's maybe a little bigger than I might
want to fitness band to be but if they
would just put the functionality of a
SmartWatch just put notifications on
this thing and have it be a health
monitor I would buy the hell out of it
well I did I'd also want them to have it
work with you know non Samsung devices
but this thing looks great I was gonna
say theater it actually does do
notifications you can get your calls and
your messages and your emails on there
but you know it only works with Samsung
devices so and like you said if I would
buy one of these but I don't really want
to buy a galaxy s5 or whatever yeah was
it so it was it's their initial slides
uh doesn't then that include like
openness and like cooperation with an
industry like weren't those the words
they used yeah they just they said that
they were the gear was an open platform
or something like that and you know is
kind of sun silly when it only works
with Samsung devices so it's an open
flat form for people to bring their apps
to but not but you can't take it to
other apparently that's what they mean
not or not only does it only works with
Samsung not only does it only work with
Samsung devices by the way I apologized
the light in this room timed out and
there's nothing I can do about it not
only does it only work with Samsung
devices but only specific Samsung
devices because we saw over the course
of the get the original galaxy Gear's
very short lifespan they slowly rolled
out compatibility two additional samsung
phone models it wasn't like on day one
it would work with any samsung you own
it originally only worked on the gear I
mean the note 3 I think and then they
rolled it out to the fore in the gs3 so
it looks sweet though yeah that's
literally cool well it looks sweet I
mean Vlad wrote a really great report
about it
like the thing that we were talking
about before and I'm going to steal his
thunder and then I'll let him yell at me
for it is this is Samsung when it's at
its best yes it's iterative yes they're
using technology they've got off the
shelf yes they're stealing ideas from
other companies but when they like every
now and then they do all those things
but they are able to turn something
around really fast that's remarkably
like compelling and you know sometimes
samsung samsung is it up and we get the
gear and sometimes samsung sang sends it
up and they do something that's like
whoa hey this is really nice yeah it's
been a long time since we've actually
had that latter experience yeah and but
what you said central to some psychology
of the show to do a community of the
Samsung show you know we mock Samsung
and LG to high heavens about those
curves with blazing smartphones and
we're still right we don't think you're
wrong because they don't make that much
sense in a smartphone but putting that
curve display on something that is
supposed to wrap around your wrist and
actually requires a curve makes perfect
sense and the thing that I would say
with the gear fit is that it's just
instantly recognizable to me it's the
exact opposite of the gs5 you know I'm
seeing people the gs4 all around mwc
shop for I'm thinking to this guy set of
GS five already you just can't tell the
difference whether it's gonna get fit
because it's super amoled if it is so
strong and because Samson for once it's
not something really google software
gets really simple and given it some
really bright colorful wallpapers
anytime some somebody is actually
worrying on their wrist like I spy it I
recognize it and I start MV okay and
that feeling of desire and essentially
gadget lust is something has been read
to the Samsung before a hotel other
manufacturers yeah okay so we've got
flagships are other companies do you
guys want to talk about you want to talk
about the Sony you want to talk the the
g pro 2 seems totally forgettable to me
I mean am I crazy that like with LG
stuff is not affection whatever yeah
it's just whatever and the g2 mini also
fine
so many stuff let me let's let's clear
out some of them would love to talk
about experience stuff wow this would be
a sexy the z2 there's a Z 2 which is the
new flagship than the z2 tablet which is
like look at us with me too thin tablet
if the z2 is really come on look if you
guys eat too seems appealing you have to
give visitez have a little bit more
Freddie yes is big asset importance it's
in this but I mean in terms of
technological feat engineering feat I
think Sony is really stepping back into
old habits which is being way out ahead
of everybody else like the feeling I get
with other phone manufacturers is that
damn meeting engineering limits before
although engineering limits than Soviets
by selling can touch things so much
harder and just such greater extremes
than everybody else please easy to tell
you have to holding out it's extremely
extreme again he's seen and it keeps the
same 6000 AF car battery as tablet Z
Jetta succeed it's waterproof and it has
this new display which really is the
highlight for Sony this year but of the
Z 2 + z2 tablet they have these lab
color LED displays and you know having
complaining about 72 place in this my
affection for years now and the fire
exit and the face of such quick fashion
I mean Jesus place right hey black
people they really are is Nora but glad
I just have a question for you and you
and I talked about this a little bit on
birch live on Monday but why is it do
you think that Sony has not been able to
make inroads and become a samsung level
competitor on android yet because by all
appearances they they are making phones
that are as good as any phones in the
industry right now yeah it does is very
much the case but i would say right now
um they just fixed data spec like the
phone but as they're also amazing
display isn't
there you just got an ounce ya know so
we basically to give them some time I've
been saying this for all that time the
display is probably the most fundamental
spec that you can have with your device
it's your April your Apple device is the
first and last when you see any use so
if that's thinks if the person doesn't
enjoy it they don't enjoy the entire
years experience so I mean I feel like
I've Joseph of prejudice against Tony
Tan Driscoll's just before just because
their displays in the bad so so glad
talk to me about this like the specifics
of this device a little bit I know on
the tablet Z they kind of use a material
that was similar to the Xperia Z and it
was like a polycarbonate kind of
material what is the outside perimeter
material on the c2 tablet it's a woman
like the z1 and z2 that's correct the
spot phone it has an aluminum frame
around the outside and has glass on the
front in the back and the template he
has a soft soft touch back which is just
I can't prove them that like I can't
think of a more way to feel sick and so
a good reason to use an android tablet I
mean the Dead Sea tablet would be the
one so the lot on the Z 2 i'm the Arak
weighing on you gotta you gotta come up
with a reason to use an android tablet
especially at this size these puzzles
are pretty big I mean I'm using a nexus
7 as my primary tablet right now and I
gotta say like android tablets you look
great I don't know I mean like I think
Sony is actually doing a super
interesting thing with their with their
tablet zone right now because the tablet
Z last year's model is actually super
affordable like compared to the ipad you
can get a Snapdragon I think it's the
800 in the sea oh so he's making a great
tablet here this this this z2 tablet
looks great look for any they're selling
but you're 16 you goodbye like the
hardware doesn't matter because there's
no support from the ecosystem for
Android at this size that's the problem
like let me like that's the only thing
that's how the ecosystem that Sony has
available to them yeah well I mean I I
mean yeah but it's like all right for
your luck guys like you're making great
stuff that nobody should buy right now
is this true sandy
astra so what's way more thing to me is
the z2 phone I think the z2 phone looks
awesome I agree yep Emily about it
what's there to tell me aside from the
display it really is more or less the z1
it keeps the exact same footprint but
close to five point two inches which
means that much of a braid it has a
Snapdragon 801 which is a very
incremental upgrade on the 800 basically
the same chip which it's no bad thing
chip cameras basically lift same and
that is for the video recording but
again it's one of those upgrades plays
like I don't have anything that plays
back for K not even the phone place back
for K so who care about the damn video
being at that resolution and it really
is what about that display because it is
very nice it's great color fidelity
beautiful view language I mean they
claim it has the widest color comic of
any mobile device which is something
that you all need to measure I just as
part of the very federal one of the
better ones the market right now which
is much as Oh needs doing I mean then it
still got the glass back that's fine i
mean not hearing that the cameras been
improved much is a little bit
disappointing to me but I gotta say like
looking at this comparing it to the
nexus 7 that i'm using now and even you
know the HTC One which is generally
regarded as one of the better design or
best design android phones like this
seems really nice like and you know as
long as they haven't screwed the
software up too much and it sounds like
they you know they've continued their
trend of like like doing what they doing
a soft work with the z1 which is not
being totally overbearing with it this
is an interesting phone to me like this
is the kind of phone that like if this
doesn't have any success then I feel
like like there's something
fundamentally wrong with the Android
ecosystem that Sony can make a phone
this good and nobody cares yeah but the
same could be said about the HTC One
right yes yeah but I mean you can always
like you can chalk up HTC to know
getting money being that Sony does not
spend market monies us right well that's
the other thing I mean I hopefully they
can get some success with this in some
other markets I think it's great i will
say that sony is one of the few
companies mobile phone makers whose
mobile phone division is is making a
profit but yeah they do have trouble
breaking into the u.s. they bring their
devices to the US far later than
anywhere else in the world so I and
they're only on one carrier so far so
you know it's really hard for them to
really make a dent in the US market with
these devices even if they are really
excellent than attractive devices and
also let's not let's not overestimate
the difficulties that HTC as I become he
just announced this week that issue one
and the one family ladies most
successful phones in terms of sales
mostly smart folks so they have been
doing okay in terms of sales is just
they haven't had a portfolio around the
one you know they had one flagship phone
and when people can't afford to buy the
Frenchie phone HTC just hasn't really
had the compelling lower price point
device to find out if you know then they
end up consuming coffee from Samsung
what yeah what about the one mini oh and
he's not a one minute that's exactly the
program it's a 1 minus a couple of his
most fundamental advances like what if
they called it the one if they called it
the one minus that would be like a
religion game for the box so frankly
they shouldn't have done it she should
have done a better phone yeah now I
totally agree we the other insane thing
that happened at Mobile World Congress
is nokia has announced android phones so
that's the nokia X the XL can the X plus
so I mean how are they are they fast are
they any good as it is a terrible is it
awesome job tell me about these fun so I
got to play with all three of them and I
guess the the ex and the X plus are
pretty much the same thing the X plus
just as a dual sim and you
you know I I keep coming back to the
point where nokia has a Windows Phone
already at this price point that offers
a better user experience in the nokia X
the X is running a forked version of
Android that's based on Android 4.1 so
it's like two years old it's really
dated software and you know the
performance is very apparent that this
is older version of Android when you're
jumping into third party apps and you're
trying to bounce around between your
apps and things like that there's a lot
of lag it's pretty sluggish it's just
not a really pleasant user experience
with a bird right they they your inbox
them are mimicking the home screen
interface of their Lumia phones but they
kind of missed like it looks like the
home screen of your inner of the Lumia
phone but you know it loses all of the
animations and all the other Beauty
parts of Windows Phone so it's just like
very surface level similarities and the
main navigation is pretty fast as far as
swiping up and down the home screen but
you know once you're in apps things get
pretty pretty dicey uh and then it's
it's hard to say that this is going to
be Nokia's Savior they they're really
using this as like a Trojan horse to get
people onto Microsoft's cloud services
but I'm not sure I fully by that
approach i think it'll give people used
to using android apps instead of using
Microsoft services I think the biggest
thing here is at least the vibe that we
get is that essentially it's a windows
phone with a shortcut into running
Android apps that's what's happening it
isn't really an android phone because it
doesn't have any of the Android
applications in tries replace it with
Nokia Microsoft alternatives and it's
like we have on this bone we can't get
traction with it we also can get it
cheap enough so we're going to run the
cheaper platform as a much wider a
vehicle scott i disagree i don't think i
don't buy that they can't get a cheap
enough and unlocked lumia 520 is $69 in
the US yeah this is going to be named
that is going to be launching 489 euro
that's that's considerably more
expensive
520 is right now and you know this thing
looks like Windows Phone but it does not
perform like Windows one it's not a
Windows Phone experience so like it's
it's very surface level you know nokia
said numerous times that they plan to
keep pushing this price lower but you
know they're already lower with Lumiya
don't get it so I the only one who
thinks this looks like an unholy monster
like this has none of the advantages of
Windows Phone and all the disadvantages
and ugliness of basically square and
rectangle you lie okay let the first
this is this is though this is the worst
of both worlds there's just a lot of
confusing things with the UI like when
you install a new app there's no app
tray or app list it just gets thrown
down at the bottom of your home screen
and so like you can put it in folders
and stuff like that but there's really
no great organization there I they it's
got this like second home screen called
fast lane which nokia is kind of like
combining your your most recent apps and
notifications into one feed which they
say is very popular on there Asha phones
but I'm not sure it really translates
that well on Android and then you know
it it no keys always known for putting
great cameras in their devices and these
have like these particular ones have
like fixed focus three members that are
terrible so it's like there's there's no
advantage to the only advantage that a
user has when they buy this is the fact
that it has a nokia name like you're not
getting no keys great design you're not
getting Nokia's great camera technology
you're not getting Nokia's great
software here you're getting like the
scraps that's really like it doesn't
even seem like a good this is like a
sadist vendor lock-in ever like for
google it makes sense that they are
pushing devices that really bring people
into their you know their service
ecosystem because their lock-in is so
great but this is like oh well introduce
people to Microsoft services but you'll
still be running Android APIs but
there's like but Microsoft doesn't make
a huge amount of money from these
services I don't that another google had
anything to do with this or any
participation or anybody go Google when
I would you mind if we did a really
garbage Nokia
such services running on top of Android
and but I think the biggest issue here
and also from Microsoft's effective it's
just kind of his head scratches I see
one microsoft acquired nokia there's a
lot of reasons to think you know if
Nokia was going to pursue this plan
anyway Microsoft wouldn't have liked to
have its main windows phone
manufacturers split its focus between
windows phone and Android that would not
have been a good hit once Microsoft just
drinks acquire not gay and I know that
dealers associate anybody should have
put a stop to this because what is it
safe to Windows Phone developers like do
we carry on making where his phone apps
there or do we switch to android knowing
that Microsoft is going to support
android apps now it's really confusing
situation for isn't it yeah no it's
totally confusing and I mean honestly to
me it just seems like what nokia has
decided is they don't believe that
they're going to get the apps that they
think that people want at the low end
anytime soon and so they just said look
we're gonna do android on the low end
because we want people to nail the side
load those apps on there like the UI is
whatever it's not great it's a little
like i can't decide if I think it's
patronizing like there's like the
simplification of just having a single
home screen but then there's the fast
lane which is a little complicated
whatever it's it's like fine it's not
that interesting to me what's
interesting to me is that nokia somebody
inside nokia felt that in order to do
what they were trying in order to
achieve what they're trying to achieve
in the emerging markets that they're
trying to tackle that Windows Phone
wasn't going to get there and if we're
right that it's not really about price
it's not really about driving down the
price of Windows Phone driving down
driving windows phone down to work on
lower and lower hardware because the 520
seems to prove that they're relatively
close and they could get closer if it's
not about the hardware and it's not
about price it's got to be about
software it's got to be that like inside
nokia they had a fundamental wrong
weren't going to get what they needed to
get in terms of app support in order to
drive it in emerging markets
gotta be your answer that make sense I
said this I said this before but it
really feels like to me that you know
nokia had a group within that was
working on this for a long time and it's
very apparent that they were working on
it for a long time it's based on android
4.1 which is a two year old version of
the operating system and they were just
like you know this microsoft deal is
closing soon we are pushing this to
market we've been working on it for so
long we're not having this scrappy and
so there's there's that part of it the
other part I think is that it like you
said theater that's a tacit admission
that when this phone does not have the
apps that people are looking for and
that people buy phones because of the
apps you buy a smartphone because of the
apps that it could use and and that's
why Nokia initially explored this
android project for however long ago
when they started developing our I think
most people disagree with me on this but
I think there's a very real possibility
that that Microsoft will Ken this and it
will disappear within like 30 days of
the closure of the acquisition so I
would really that i would say that
you're you you I would believe you more
if if nokia had announced one phone but
they announced three and they announced
the line of them and they announced the
nokia store that they need to maintain
and all these other things that are like
pretty you know entrenched ideas i guess
and entrenched services that they need
to offer with these fellows yeah well
but ken was two devices and an entire
cloud network devoted to them so I mean
that's fair but it was also two devices
sold on one carrier that nobody let her
literally nobody bought yeah right well
on the other hand nukka didn't Zack to
spend I don't know even five minutes
remaining these devices they just a bird
ACC's things for like two years ago well
let's let's put it this way i think that
if you if you want a collector's item
you should strongly consider picking up
a nokia X because i can't see Microsoft
continuing to put our d dollars into
developing android devices so even if
these last say a full year on the
marketplace I don't think they're going
to get successors that would be my guess
but you know what else this basically
disproves
Oh gates because he said the world is
getting better all the time roars aah 23
years ago the collectors device from
Nokia was the n match which to this day
is one of the prettiest and nicest
devices even though it's kind of left
but these these are no headlines that's
for sure these are these are no and
nines that's my point that's my point
the collectors device is getting worse
it's not getting better so the other
thing i really really need to hear about
because you guys have held it and i have
not is a project tango which is google's
i can see the whole room and space thing
out spatially mad right on the phone
better than a connector like a connect i
know it seems insane so like yeah he'll
tell me about this thing so so i
remember talking to you guys like a week
ago or so when when google announced it
and I was pretty pretty mad on the whole
announced when I was like oh so they're
announcing another phone to give us
augmented reality games but then you
know I got to see the thing in person
and it is pretty wild what it can do
it's got these multiple cameras and
sensors on it that capture a greater far
greater amount of data it can measure
distance it can measure spatial
awareness and things like that and then
it's got a custom processor inside that
can crunch all that data feed it into an
API and spit it out to a nap and then so
it can do things like you can hold up
the phone and then it can just literally
start to build a 3d model of the room as
you move the phone around the room in
real time and so like you move the phone
around and you can see the object in
front of you get built in a 3d model on
the screen and so like this technology's
actually been around for a long time the
founders of the company mph idiots that
developed this particular device
compared it to the what the Mars rover
does when it was on the surface of Mars
mapping things out but they've now
shrunk it down into a thing that can fit
in the palm of your hand and run on a
smartphone battery it's it's pretty wild
it's quite a trip to you did it work
yeah like work I mean it like worked
like they they had the they built this
thing it's a developer's device that
Google is going to give out to
developers to build
to actually make use of all this data
but they had a couple of demonstration
apps to show the capabilities of it and
like so this one that is playing on the
video right now is a distance heat map
so items that are further away our
darker blue items that are closer to you
are orange and as you move things that
it adjust as you move the phone around
so it's everything pretty much worked as
they they said it would it was able to
build a 3d model of the table in front
of me right before my eyes and things
like that so it was quite impressive i
came away far more impressed with it
after seeing it in person than I was a
week ago when I just seen that google
announced it so okay I mean obviously
the hardware's super janky but that's
like because it's developer device and
they're only making 200 of them did they
talk about whether or not this was going
to turn into like like they have plans
to do production or is this just a crazy
wild experiment what the hell so so they
were really cagey about that I think
they were really uh we were talking to
my videos we were not talking to kona
side of things so I think lavinius was
very concerned about spilling Google's
plans and things like that but the the
CEO did hint to me that this could be in
consumer products in the very near
future but he wouldn't say like how much
it cost to build these developer devices
or you know an exact time when it'll be
like in a smartphone on a shelf in a
story mom I mean well if something you
need to pay more for this thing Oh what
app would make me be like you know what
I want to spend an extra 50 bucks you
know super tengo powers like I've so i
put the killer app i I mean I think we
need to wait and see what the killer app
is e like that's why these developers
are going to get it you know some sample
applications are very obvious things
building a 3d model of a room or a set
very quickly and easily but they also
say that you know they could put this in
like a neck worn wearable device and use
it as something to assist the visually
impaired since it can detect how far
away things are if an obstacle is in
someone's path that can give them an
alert or an audio clue and then you know
there's the visual effects industry that
could use this
build 3d models for movies and things
like that I don't think it's an
application that everybody would make
use of why they're definitely things
where this would be a useful device so
then let me ask you this like they it
kind of seemed like the the fact that
this is this technology is bundled into
a smartphone is actually not the most
important part just that they can get it
down to the size like they have it in a
smartphone for the convenience's sake
it's a mobile computing platform
essentially and if they're going to do
that like why not just make it a phone
but it's like were they also were they
also talking about having this in a slew
of devices that weren't quite as good
but computationally powerful as my
friends I mean that that's a that's a
fair assessment I mean the thing that
the key development that they did they
wanted to stress was the fact that they
have this processor and will develop
that can take all of this data and
analyze it and crunch it and manage it
and they've made this processor small
enough and we are efficient enough that
can run in a smart perform back so
they're using this one it's like a
vehicle to show it off but you know
there's no reason that it couldn't also
be applied in other small size things
like a GoPro camera with this type of
technology or something like that right
i mean like the not only could you have
it in a gopro you can have it in
something like glass and I mean I'm sure
they I'm sure goob was very interested
in that for indoor mapping like I said
in their announcement video um but this
it seems like this is something that you
can possibly go into all sorts of other
products but it is interesting to see
yeah I don't see why they couldn't apply
it to a variety of different form
factors I just wonder if there if there
if that was what they were most vocal
about at mwc uh you know they did they
were really kind of caging as you know
what future plans would be to be honest
with you but they it's not really they
didn't make it seem like it was limited
to just smartphones what else is going
on out there guys what else did you see
uh well I don't know what else we saw
that we could talk about uh okay stuff
firefox
and we wish talked about for the new
firefox OS the new uh so they updated
firefox to they showed us version 1.3
which is the latest version it's on a
couple of devices that will be hitting
market in like a month or whatever and
it's a faster much much more refined
interface than the firefox we saw a year
ago really felt like this was Firefox
growing up quite a bit in the past year
it's still definitely very low end and
definitely it gets lit like a device
like the Moto G with android 4.4 run
circles around it but it's a lot it's a
lot better than it used to be and you
can have devices with higher resolution
displays and faster processors and
things like that that make it an
actually usable smartphone I remember
last year when we first saw the the
first Firefox phones you would open up
the dialer and then you'd wait and then
you'd push a button and then you'd wait
for it to receive the button command and
then it was like when basic things like
the dialer were virtually unusable it
was like a non-starter but you know
they've addressed though as a
performance for those basic core
features is a lot better but it it's
hard to see this really competing well
against the the cheap Android phones
that are really flooding the market
you're the cheap I mean the cheap
Android phones let's be super clear are
not good right like I guess there are
the moto moto g's excellent phone the
Moto G is the is the counter to your
organizer yeah but the Moto G
unsubsidized is what a hundred and 180
bucks $109 yeah and I mean Firefox is
going to move a lot lower than that yeah
but there's no reason that like you know
the monetary is just like the first of
like a really good low end yeah right
i'm feeling that motorola motorola has
said you know that it plans to go even
cheaper and still maintain the quality
so right i don't think i don't think
firefighter has a long time to hold that
slot without being really challenged
yeah yeah and i also feel like to dance
point and your phones are likely to
trickle down into lower price points
quicker then Firefox OS is supposed to
be able to really build out any sort of
app ecosystems and really get stuff to
sort of responsiveness that
can hope to match device elected moto g
link just this week it was revealed from
motorola that the moto g apparently is
one of his best selling phones and that
the company is making a profit would
ever say so it's not a law sleep also I
know motor itself has been losing money
but the Moto G has right I mean mozillas
ultimate goal here is a thirty-dollar
phone which is pretty remarkable when
you consider that Nokia on stage this
week like their first announcement
before they got into nokia X was the 220
which is a 29 euro phone that has a
keypad a tiny color display and like its
headline features that it can get on the
internet so the fact that that Firefox
wants to actually produce a true
touchscreen smartphone for thirty
dollars is pretty remarkable no it's not
to say that you can get a headline
experience on that i would say i would
say you have to put a heavy quotation
marks around smartphone very heavy right
i mean there's no se me than i even
crush what like what is most aside from
price what is mozillas competitive
advantage in the market right now there
isn't one well though no I'll tell you
what it is it's the fact that they cater
to the needs of carriers so you're
seeing what you get where you're seeing
a lot of wins for Mozilla and I think
were you going to continue to see the
most wins is in carriers that operate in
emerging markets and maybe you know
European countries where r poo is a
little lower I think correct me if I'm
wrong but I think that Poland was one of
the first countries where they released
a device last year on vodafone i believe
so i have my guess is that and these are
countries where like and these are
carriers where they're really keen on
like branding the experience top to
bottom so it basically looks like a
vodafone phone i don't know if you guys
remember but a few years ago vodafone
released basically it's an operating
system that lasted about a month but if
that releases the new feature phone yeah
it but it well yes and no i mean it but
it's worse the preacher phones this is
the problem with it is worse than
feature phones I
I should go to try out the 25 total
concept and it really proves nothing
into I mean to to dance point the new
phone out so much more mature the last
year and so much more usable the last
year with file photo of West but here's
the other thing that I can tell you and
it's the thing that gives me no hope for
this OS nobody at Firefox's presentation
nobody at firefox of booty or at mwc is
using a Firefox of West so if it's
not good enough for the people who are
making it and for making the software to
use the regular basis it's just not
going to happen because you need those
people to essentially be testing it for
you I'm just flood markets that can't
afford the higher end smartphones and
hope that that will somehow give you
success I take Chris's point about you
know being friends carriers but you know
I just don't i'm not that was not sure
this bar box of us has anything to offer
consumers like I would look no but I
don't think no but I mean he is a thing
this 25 votes Marco but i haven't had
booths at today he has accomplished
display and he has amazing lag like his
almost is like it's like an anchor man
where he's dug ate the whole wheel
chains you can't even get mad at alive
because it's so crazy so so yeah you
feel bad for the boat yeah so I don't
take those $25 i would add you know five
dollars extra somehow and i would get
the cheap nugget because of that the
team at least get me litter today but I
mean to be super clear the Nokia
referring to the 220 is just a candy bar
like a candy bar straight out of 2005
the 220 looks great though you're
smoking I don't know what you're smoking
you're smoking some powerful narcotic
well here's the thing if you want a
disposable phone for example and you
only have thirty bucks you guys are
nokia because that thing will get things
something if you will be frustrates to
the high heavens you played it 25 though
is if you get the five books of us Bob
and you get nothing done like um see if
you don't worry about those in you can't
afford I spend more
and I don't know save you money instead
of sending telegrams didn't Thea is the
last telegram network in the world just
shut down last year if I'm not mistaken
it was in India yes but yesterday we
cover telegram the new security focus
mobile messaging app that's true that's
the underlayment our transition yes
maybe but no it's not goods completely
unrelated all right okay so also to hold
on us yeah I know just I need to loop
back to this Chris it is in fact you
aura who is on drugs because the the 220
is a beautiful candy bar bone and these
Firefox phones look like garbage ah cool
story bro that's where I stand on it
okay yeah so HTC had some like random
announcements like you're gonna be able
to share your processor power from your
phone which story guys but now it's good
I'll come on it is good I mean I I don't
be one of the big fan boys been engaging
ever since set at home and so those ones
are a big deal on PC and I think wait am
so what kind of work they doing and
where depends I think you can pick your
own project but they do basically doing
scientific research um and they're using
you know this year's like our cycles
from your phone to contribute to it it's
like folding at home that was sweet
whatever and it doesn't it doesn't
affect battery life or consume cellular
data it only works when you're connected
to Wi-Fi and plug into the wall I
believe hmm so I don't know maybe this
is too nerdy but like one of the big
things one of the most important factors
of distributed computing is floating
point performance and like our processes
are really bad at that so I would love
to know what kinds of projects are
available for you to choose it's because
the legs the performances for Watson's
bed it's worth noting that Samsung is
doing the exact same thing they they
launched an alarm clock app like a week
that does the exact same concept so
there's they're obviously applications
for it I don't know how much or what
specifically they are but they're both
both companies are pursuing is almost
the same exact idea okay I'm see the
course all this it's just total alright
Yusei horse swallow the key I don't know
my name is vini escalated it's bull crap
okay let's let's just remind everybody
that evan is from Kentucky I thought it
was cotswolds I didn't know that horses
had swallow what does it's all up I'll
of you sense of public responsibility
and communal cooperation guys like we
get a little bit a bit of a trigger
confusing and contributing to good
causes and discoveries and whatnot and
then that's convincing what was not know
what I'm not like sure that's fine and
like I'm I want everybody to do is
tributed computing really well unlike
you know and accomplish the goals and
like do the research but the thing is
like if this is a PR stunt because like
you get to feel good about doing
something with your family that's great
but if it's just wasting electricity and
like wearing out your parts and it isn't
actually react yes now no haven't you
totally right it is way under 50 because
all the other battery power that you use
on things like flappy bird and whatever
that's a you know productive well it
will Elise that's entertaining no that's
right yeah that's providing you utility
like in the means that you wanted to be
like you want it to do believe this is
well I'll wait to see which projects are
on glad every time I break 30,000 and
threes on the iphone another angel gets
its wings and i have given where at
least six angels so humble brag that
wasn't even a humble brag goes just a
break let's just say the bread regular
alright i'm not ashamed of that straight
up rags at all that is the definition of
holier-than-thou I i used to uh-- I used
to be
a big contributor to distributed net in
the search for prime numbers back in the
day but and actually my roommate
installed covertly installed study at
home on countless workstations at the
University of Michigan and was
eventually caught and got into some
amount of trouble for it so I understand
the appeal of contributing to
distributed computing efforts but I
don't know like there's there is a I
think that this is indicative of two
troubling trends one is the trend that
maybe we've topped out we've topped out
at least in the short term we've topped
out the need for additional process or
power and phones because you know you
look at me never mind the gs5 you look
at the gs4 or the HTC one from last year
they're perfectly fine and fast and
there there's no there are no new
capabilities coming to Android short or
something like project tango that would
that would require a a sea change in the
amount of processing power that's
available to you so now you're just
sitting on this massive excess of of you
know gigaflops that that you know you
might as well contribute to a
distributing distributed computing
effort that's problem one then problem 2
of course like Evans says the i mean the
the additional power consumption is a
very real phenomena like I my power bill
went up when I when I had distributed
that net running on my desktop PC like
it was it there was a measurable impact
in my bill so it just becomes a big
thing that's going to be something to
consider okay yeah I agree that's the
worst transition ever is there anything
else that you guys want to chat about I
mean we the HTC the new HTC One leaked
it looks like we thought it would look
it's got an extra camera sensor on it it
comes in several colors and seems I
don't know it looks like a slightly more
rounded one yeah it does look slightly
more agile
Oh excited I let's say sorry dear nicole
say about the HD one is that it looks a
little bit more forgivable in light of
the galaxy s5 yeah true yeah good point
well I don't know like like the I really
hope that the the new one has a regular
really great camera like if the if the
main camera is so far and they try and
kind of like that with whatever could
possibly be going on with the second
camera I'm gonna be so dissatisfied i
presently I can't even Evan that's what
the Sony qx100 is for bro oh my god it
is the Serbian well ladies Jenna I'm
calling it that is the virtual show
Barcelona edition 2014 I want to thank
lad and Dan especially for joining us
from the show or in Barcelona pretty
awesome you can follow them on twitter
as ec seaport glad Sabba you can also
follow the rest of us i am back on chris
is e power evan is evan rodgers with
addy although i'm sure the guy without
for the g is also nice but you should
follow evan because he's awesome we are
all at verge you can leave a comment on
this very post when you could do it
right now you do whatever you want you
