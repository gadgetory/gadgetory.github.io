announced that two of its biggest things
were coming to virtual reality that's
fallout 4 and the new doom so this was
kind of a dream of people who arranged a
virtual reality you can just put on a
headset boot up your favorite game and
enter the world but instead of using the
normal game pad you're actually using
vibe and motion control so we get to
check it out oh so I am right by the gas
station very early and fallout 4 and
right now a lot of I'm sorry shoot
something shooting at me just decide I'm
sorry so they wouldn't let us shoot the
screen for any of this and these games
are still very very rough but we managed
to get in and play something that
actually feels like it could be turned
into something real very sad that you
can't pet the dog you ran away but it is
really neat to be able to teleport
around this followed is the more
complete of the games and they've
actually promised you will be able to
play VR fallout next year they can put
you in something that is definitely the
fallout world and you can move around at
my teleporting you can look at your
pip-boy and interact with it
using the vibe controller and you can
shoot what you can't do is pretty much
anything else you can't talk to people
you can't craft and we didn't really get
to go beyond this one very small part of
the world so these are things that are
going to be kind of difficult to do and
if they do them wrong then it could
really mess up the game but it does give
you a new perspective on fallout
so the big difference between the our
follow up for a normal fallout 4 is that
you're a lot more deliberate in here in
the wasteland and fallout 4 there's a
tendency to run around really quickly to
just try to cover as much ground as you
can to try to find that one tiny things
out there somewhere I mean here I have
to think about absolutely everywhere
that I move so just going like here
clicking through this I have to actually
sort of pay attention to my surroundings
in a way that I think it probably
wouldn't otherwise
is that something you won in an open
world game where everything's really
spread out I don't know but it is
interesting oh god the cyber demons huge
doom we don't know if there's actually
going to be a full game there and what
you get are a lot of short experiences
the most fun one is basically a shooting
gallery where you're in a hallway and
you're taking down demons with your gun
and a grenade so we're going to hear
more about this at QuakeCon but they
definitely seem committed to making it
something more and I like shooting
galleries a lot I'd be pretty happy if
they did that see how far I can throw
this grenade so there's a lot of dangers
of porting a game badly to virtual
reality obviously you could get sick but
if it also just not be very much fun it
could not fit the format of the game and
we've already been promised to be our
doom and had that fall through a few
years ago so now it's kind of anyone's
guess as to whether they'll be able to
nail down those last bits of the puzzle
and there are very many of them but if
they do what's a huge deal for virtual
reality and hopefully we'll hear more
about in the coming up
