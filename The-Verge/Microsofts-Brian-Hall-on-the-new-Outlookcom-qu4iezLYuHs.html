this week Microsoft relaunched hotmail
is outlook com hotmail still exist
they're going to transition everybody
into outlook wild new interface looks
like Metro basically it's a full-screen
web metro app and as it happens brian
hall who is the program manager if GM of
windows is on the phone with us so we're
just going to cut to brian c is it this
button it's got a checkbox I think
you're good that button hello Ryan Hall
I yeah hi this was brian hall hey man
it's this is nilay patel on the verge
cast north ross miller in a live
audience of thousands of people and
we're just talking about starcraft i'm
here for you what do you know what
league are you in what's your building
oh my god okay that's about all I know
yeah so hey let's talk about outlook in
hotmail uh what'd you do why'd you do it
why did you have it described released
this week we released a new email
service outlook.com it's a it's a new
service is really focused on supporting
the cloud of apps and devices people use
for email and connecting with the other
services that people use like Facebook
and Twitter and we did this we've had
we've had hotmail for an operator
hotmail for about 16 years we obviously
have exchanged and outlook and the
people use at work and we we just
decided it was time to do something new
and to bring the best from each of those
put them together and and release it
right in time for the new wave of
products that we could have coming out
with windows 8 with the new version of
office with the new windows phone and a
new xbox so i have a lot of questions
about the interface and what you've how
you're doing the service on the back end
to serve all these devices but the my
first question is very simply the name
why why not reboot hotmail which is you
know a huge brand has millions of users
right the most popular email service
what mean are you're killing hot me is
gone for good after this ad you more or
less you'll be anyone will be able to
keep using their @ hotmail.com email
address but we will be over time
upgrading all hotmail
users to outlook and and the hotmail web
interface that you that you know Anna
probably use for years and years will go
away at that point so you can the main
reason to go ahead sorry so if you have
a hotmail com that'll just always work
you're not can you say well upgrade all
users to outlook that to me sounds like
Oh upgrade them all to match that looked
up because the UI right yeah that's
we're asking just the UI yet more the
more the UI in the back-end
infrastructure that we're using because
today for instance if i go to mail.com
sign in using my app hotmail.com email
address i can go up to options and say
upgrade to outlook yeah and when i do
that i get all of the new functions of
about look calm it's just that the email
but i'm sending from a receiving to is
my mail dot com address and so in my
case for instance you could choose to
just keep using your email address on ad
infinitum but in my case I chose to also
get a nap outlook.com address and now
I'll still receive any email that goes
to my hotmail account but it goes off
into a folder and and when I reply I can
choose to reply from my at outlook or my
aunt Mel but I'll clearly more likely
use at outlook and so for people that
have used hotmail for a while they're
not going to lose anything all they get
is a must much better experience more
forward-looking experience for doing
email using the same account same
contacts name say nails that they've had
for a while right so let's talk about
this experience you're building in skype
you're building in what is a really very
streamlined kind of Metro design have
you made any like big changes for the
web as opposed because you know we've
experienced Metro on devices thus far
right on the phone yeah on the on
obviously with windows 8 it's coming you
have it a little bit on xbox but it's
never really been native on the web in
this way have you made any like big
changes to adapt to that or no um yes
and no I mean certainly the biggest
changes that we made were deciding to
remove the things that people didn't use
most of the time and that you know
probably sounds kind of obvious but just
go look at the other email services
throughout their is that you'll see that
it's not
that obvious or for that matter and so I
think that was one of the biggest
decisions that we had to make we also
had to had to decide to go all the way
and figure out what was the right
application of the design principles
from Windows 8 or Windows Phone for the
web and I think you'll see one version
of it with with outlook that looks great
and is clearly designed for email but
you'll see another one that that as we
in the next month upgrade the SkyDrive
experience you know that one's much more
of a picture first give people snapshots
of what documents they have that kind of
thing and it looks beautiful but but
it's a you know still still the same
design principles so there have been a
lot of tweaks on the email formula
bringing in rosters mute switch me value
such there were a lot of tweaks and
pulling in social and you know
integrating more services and chat you
know for instance gchat is in gmail a
lot of people use it through that are
there ways you're rethinking actual
straightforward email or or plan to
rethink it or can it be rethought I'm i
think there's we have some i think some
smart and pretty powerful tools but
there's definitely a lot of runway
emails a funny thing because for the
most part email messages are email
messages are email messages and you know
they each get a place in your inbox or
in your folder and it was was only until
a couple years ago that we started to
realize and and deliver features that
treated different messages as you know
trying to accomplish very different
things for instance you look at the
email that people receive today about
fifty percent of it is commercial yes or
at the newsletter or a daily deal or a
shipping receipt and or a shipping
update or anything like that each of
those you kind of want to treat a little
bit different me like annoying annulus
groupon deals I do Ross all five fedex
notifications it's very strange how does
one forget how can you fix that me your
addresses and i'll start I'll start
getting you some more of those if you'd
like oh good
and uh into what what we found is you
know for instance I I do a decent matter
shopping on Amazon and I really want to
see shipping updates I don't really care
that about the receipt that they send me
and I certainly don't want the email
that comes it says do you want to review
the seven product that you bought
because if I want to review my review my
don't need an email and so I'm able with
with outlook.com to treat each of those
differently and take the shipping
receipts put them off into a folder
where I want to store them uh so I can
check them whereas the other things just
automatically delete them or me keep the
latest latest version or things like
that similarly photos like photos is an
area where we put put a bunch of work in
because uh people send photos in
different ways I get I you could send me
a bunch of JPEGs you can send me a
flicker link you can send me a skydrive
album so we've been working on how do we
make sure that we recognize every one of
those as a photo mail and let you have a
beautiful view of it without having to
leave your inbox so I think there's one
we think so that's I think what's really
interesting to me there is that to me is
what you do with the web UI the web
version of Outlook right that's the
that's the main interface here's all
these exciting new features and here's
all this stuff but I don't want any of
that on the phone I don't even know if I
want to believe that in a local client
of a machine where I want to be focused
on like blasting through an inbox right
how are you are you going to change that
for the phone interface is there going
to be a native hotmail client are you
going to build into the windows phone
mail client and what's what's sort of
the plan for all the other devices that
come into the ecosystem yeah like a
native windows 8 app yeah yeah with the
with the windows 8 mail app with new
versions of outlook on the desktop and
with Windows Phone will keep pushing the
envelope to make sure that outlook.com
works beautifully between them and that
some of the best features are surfaced
in the in the built-in app are you gonna
go to Laura are you going to go beyond
like mail protocols I mean that's like
what I'm asking is you can write all
kinds of mail clients and they run on
imap or maybe they run an exchange but
but what you're doing with Outlook
sounds like at least in the web client
go
a little bit deeper than here's a bunch
of mail will filter it locally or we'll
do some local operations once it comes
through the pipe yeah are you gonna are
they are the apps going to go deeper
than just sinking over on map in
exchange to outlook I think is really
deeper integration and what kind of a
standard yeah there's more that we can
do there uh we just released outlook for
the first time this week and so I'm not
going to go into more the things that
we're thinking about but we certainly
think we look I'm just exciting will I
be emailing over pop3 with my xbox oh my
god you'll be apparently going through
your friends group on okay I'm curious
for you are you getting things done guy
what's your actual personal approach to
email i am a i am win a against an email
no I'm a Pilar now I'm I'm someone who I
leaves things in my inbox uh who I I'm
pretty Zen about I am always kind of on
top of things and if I see something
that I need to do LG TD that thing but I
don't worry about filing things off in
the folders or anything like that and it
turns out that most emailers are Tyler's
yeah which is probably why we built so
many tools to just keep automatically
cleaning up your inbox for you one of
the features that I've actually liked
the most and in outlook is the way that
I can flag things because when I flag
something it just pops to the top of my
inbox and I have a rule set that anytime
I email myself either from my work
account or from my personal account it
automatically flags into that in the
Barbara for the things that I'm worried
I might forget about that's the way that
I stay on top of it it is their point
you mentioned sort of reconciling these
different apps between the phone and the
windows 8 and the web is there a point
where those start to converge and be
literally the same app in a running and
silver lighter or html5 or something
like that um I don't know they're
sharing we're sharing more and more code
between them but I think the thing that
you also have to remember is most of the
people today that use use email on their
phone or their
using the native mail client and so you
know the vast majority people that use
mail on iphone or using mail hmm and so
what we've done is we've made it so that
through exchange activesync you can get
all of your stuff there but also all of
these power features i was talking about
are partly there to keep stuff out of
your inbox so they're just the things
that you want your inbox are there and
you can quickly triage through your mail
the stuff that actually matters on your
phone on is well I know your kind of
short on time so I just want to rat I
mean I think my biggest question yet oh
you got time you can stay on the whole
time yeah an hour about the whole time
rollin uh well you know my question is
we're talking about all these features
we add to mail and like new interfaces
and just to me comes back his email but
the right solution right ultimately like
when I my parents interact with email
like I'd fear for them because there is
so much crap in their inbox and that's
the that's like the primary attack
vector for people right now look you
know you send an email click this link
and like you automatically have fished
off into the world um is that this is
the right solution is a more real-time
solution like Paul saying the more of a
chat integration you've got skype is
this the right thing will wave is
open-source yeah yeah you can takes
another step it's rest google but you
know i mean like it oh yeah yeah yeah
we're like yeah my brother-in-law is 20
he never he doesn't use email it doesn't
have any mail address he just uses like
Facebook messaging know is that is that
yeah living in the past were living in
the future I don't I don't know yeah
it's just man about let's ask with us
Brian what if it being I think I think I
think that um everybody people are gonna
use multiple tools there's no question
about that and for certain people like
when I want to get in touch with my
younger brother I text him and doing
anything other than text him texting him
would probably be kind of a dumb way you
get in touch with my younger brother
because I know how he communicates and
so for certain people they'll do most of
their things on on on Facebook or on
Twitter or or the like but the thing is
emailed is
part of the solution because it fills
the center needs of people have
obviously some of it for communicating
with other people like if I just want to
share a set of photos with a limited set
of people emails often the easiest way
to do it or if I want to let people know
an update about my kids birthday party
it's pretty easy to do via email but
also matters a lot for commercial mail
and we may not love commercial mail but
it but it plays an important role and so
we're going to keep doing doing hard
work in order to make me her that but
that's on the smart way and you can say
on top of it and all that kind of stuff
but we definitely see more opportunity
to blend them in the right way and
that's why we have the facebook and
twitter integration into in doubt look
and that kind of thing and totally it'll
be interesting to watch but let me ask
you where does your where should your
contact list live where's the canonical
store for your contacts because I I want
it to be local like I want to maintain
but that's a very power user like i'm
going to manage this list of contacts in
that's not workable for most people i
know a lot of people who just want it to
be facebook because that's the friend
list they're managing anyway but that
doesn't work for work so that need kind
of like maybe i'll use linkedin for work
and you've got now you've got all these
competing canonical contact stores how
are you managing kind of that how are
you telling me because email is I think
the place where you do the most
interaction with your contact list
outside of like a phone dialer um our
approach and point of view on this one
is that almost everyone's going to have
multiple contact lists and so the key
isn't try and create one grand
unification theory of contactless
instead it's to make sure that they
connect together in the right way so
when you want to actually use your
contacts you can do that and so for
instance I have my print of personal
work connections and LinkedIn I have my
friends in facebook I have my official
work contacts in I'm exchange and then I
have uh the kind of closest friends
information in my phone yeah uh and so
what it which ends up being meaning
really in my email because my the items
that I save on my phone
are going into my in my Outlook account
and so our approaches to say let's
figure out how to connect all of those
together so that you have the stuff that
you want when you want it and so for
instance I have facebook and linkedin
connected telecom and because of that I
can access any of the contact
information from those yet and they're
nice because I don't have to keep
updating things they just automatically
sync whatever slate is mmm and until
favoritings everybody say that again
until facebook makes everybody's default
email address at facebook.com/ that's
ruining your contact list right i mean
is it not the danger they fixed it
though they did well they died I wish
they did say V it's off they pushed a
different less crappy button basically
our Robert go then at that cat that
instance maybe we you know more people
will start putting their contacts in
their email we can certainly do live
contact an email and so you know there's
a there's a pushin pushin poll I gotta
say for Neal eyes question whoever owns
my canonical list is whoever gives me
the best you I to weed through it right
and and and what's what sucks is that um
my best UI is the dress book but every
time accidentally or for whatever reason
end up getting synced up with gmail yeah
it gets totally destroyed and now my so
the core list is in the worst interfere
I don't know but I have a contact list
anymore I just have a lot of services
that compete there's like a the first
entry in my list is something like ABC I
don't even know we are you not done the
TVC ocean just like a v8 your plumbing
or sell your contact list is now like a
phone book from the 40s yeah I synced
with the yellow pages but aunty pony
somehow um oh shoot I had it oh so you
excuse my ignorance but but are you guys
putting a fuse the other day and are you
guys putting any features in outlook
that are you know a business outlook
style like meeting invitations or like
you know calendar invites or uh
something that happens to me all the
time is somebody will send me an email
and and and then they'll attempt to
it yeah using outlook functionality that
obviously is you mean they'll send the
read that message real quickly signal
yeah yeah yeah yeah so the the drunk and
then I'll send them the I don't use
outlook signal which is here I'll saying
I'm sorry I read the email awesome LOLOL
oh wait are those features you know you
know I mean that's a frustrating thing
for me i don't i never used facebook a
lot and but i'd get invited to things
all the time in facebook and and so I
yeah sometimes I would notice them I'd
RSVP but then you know that information
never makes it onto my calendar that a
you know that never makes it into my
address book like where I'm supposed to
go you know it's not connected to any
map being serviced it's just stuck there
and Facebook is that something you guys
are working on yeah I'm some of the yes
some of it we saw work to do like in the
case of the Facebook example when i
connect my facebook account with outlook
all of the calendar entries on facebook
show up in my outlook calendar and one
of the one of the things that's
important to remember is that outlook
account that i use is also a Microsoft
account which is moving forward what you
use to sign into Windows 8 or Windows
Phone or xbox or anything like that and
so when I connect those that same
calendar that same contact list is also
showing up in the capital people and
calendar app on Windows 8 or in the
calendar on in Outlook and so when I'm
at work I have one calendar that is
overlapping all my work stuff as well as
my personal stuff whether I put them in
there or my wife put them into our
shared calendar or they came from
facebook and I think we're doing a
pretty good job of pushing forward on
making the scenario of I want to invite
someone to something and and they
actually get it accept it and it's on
their phone or wherever they keep the
primary calendar I think there are some
things that we can keep pushing the
envelope on that exchange and and
outlook do really well and we'll just
keep looking at what do people like the
most with the new outlook desktop app
what do they like the most with the new
outlook.com and you know pick the best
features and implement Amann dough but
so actually that I think that's kind of
my biggest question is you have an
exchange
desktop app you have an Outlook desktop
app I'm assuming you have an Outlook
desktop app for metro in Windows 8 and
now even a metro style web app with
which one is the right one I mean which
one which one is the one that people are
supposed to use it is is the right
question um I think it depends on on
where you're where you are what you're
using and what you're doing and so in my
case for instance I have a Windows 8
desktop a Windows 8 laptop and the
windows 8 tablet do you think when I'm
Simon is completely back yeah yeah and
if in the case of I have it I haven't
decided to avoid the interwebs this year
yeah I'm working hard on my desktop on
my desktop I use outlook you're both my
personal email in for my work email and
i love it on my tablet i use the built
in windows 8 mail app hmm because it
works so great on touches not that
outlook.com doesn't work well on touch
but this thing is just built for the
windows 8 environment i love that and
then and that one has both my exchange
my work email I microsoft.com address as
well as my at outlook.com email going
into it and then on my laptop I tend to
use outlook for my work and outlook.com
outlook yeah alikom for my personal just
because I'm used to doing webmail on
that machine and so I think it'll kind
of be common then people are just
picking what's the best tool for the
different device that we're using yeah
and we're not trying to say that there's
one that's best in all cases is it just
wouldn't be true yeah I mean I only
really use web interfaces for mail when
I'm away from my computer because to me
you know email such a primary thing that
I do with a pc that I want I always want
the native experience so if I'm sitting
my desktop and I'm opening gmail.com in
a browser I'm like why didn't I open a
mail app or actually know what I do i do
you sparrow do you use what's the lowest
unveiled I don't you
what's also multi Loggins but the web
interface uh fluid you use that I do
yeah so that's a that's a web interface
it is so Brian here's what here's what I
do and tell me if this sounds crazy or
if this is possible or smart with the
outlook web app on OS 10 I use gmail we
used google apps for business google
apps for for cash money and i run fluid
on my mac which is you know it breaks
out browsers into their own instances so
I basically have one instance open of
WebKit for my work gmail one for my
personal gmail one for my my spam gmail
that I just used to email Ross um is
that something I mean is that something
you're gonna want like Outlook users to
do or are you going to say well we built
a native app why don't you just use the
native app um because to me that that's
actually a really common gmail use case
that I see everybody at the verge except
for Paul doesn't use the internet breaks
out gmail into a nap because we use
Google Apps for Business yeah but you've
kind of have to do that because you had
the hack around the fact that otherwise
you'd have to sign in sign out sign
in/sign out yes right now then go from
your work to home and so you're not
you're not solving some you know or
email problem by doing that you're just
hacking around how gmail works yes is
the IR blasters of email i have you ever
considered using one of microsoft's 5ml
products and will now I mean I think
Ryan agree in our case go ahead in our
case our approaches you use different
accounts for working for home yeah and
you can either pull them like I have my
work account in my home account I'm
going in doubt look for me or if I
wanted if I like the web interface is
better I could be signed in the mode
office 365 using at microsoft com as
well as uh signed in to outlook.com and
I don't have to use something like blue
in order to create different WebKit
instances or whatever right I can just
be in there in whatever browser I have
and some people do that amazing to me
sometimes now how many people only want
to use webmail yeah that feels a little
uh to be a sensible backward-looking but
I
also like webmail so I can get that yeah
the other half that people have to do
sometimes around gmail is there's a
native apps for a for a given mail
service or not uh not good bad or
anything like that but people always
think oh you need the you need a
outlook.com app on iOS and part of that
is condition because of the way Google
does priority inbox and stars it doesn't
work with any other mail client and so
if you don't have a native google app
your gmail app you're getting a weird
gmail experience whereas for us we've
worked hard in order to make sure that
we keep the crap out of your inbox that
you don't want as well as use things
like flags and it will auto create tasks
so that you don't have to have a
separate app for the way that you'd
expect alright last question what's the
next move for outlook and what's your
favorite thing about gmail don't listen
to Pope Paul polishes he doesn't get to
troll people in real life no my favorite
thing about gmail is how easy it is to
forward into my Outlook account Oh
smooth Brian hall is smooth oh the for
outlook.com are one we're getting a
bunch of feedback and so you'll see a
post from us shortly but here's a bunch
stuff that we've heard here's what we're
going to do about it or here's here's
the what the real deal is and so the
feedback super helpful we look look
forward to getting more of that and we
definitely have some fit and finish and
clean up and finish the design work on
the work in a release as I mentioned new
version of SkyDrive out this month it
looks beautiful we have to do the
calendar the calendar calendar can feel
pretty retro when you click over to that
I recommend doing it only once or twice
and then mod at Penn I and then we're
very excited to get skype yet rated him
right and so those are the those are the
main things in front of us but we're
gonna learn more great well it's really
exciting it's it's I will say seeing a
company like Microsoft with this going
through a huge range of changes abandon
a brand like hotmail and say we're
starting over starting fresh I mean
hobby has a lot of baggage
and to say we're starting over new
interface new brand new ideas what email
is is very exciting I don't know that
you'll pull me away from gmail just yet
I mean there's I guys have a gmail
addiction problem yeah but I'm you know
I've register oh I have one actually
have a real last question why did you
not register Ballmer and do not reply to
outlook.com what happened there you're
like let's see what they'll it's not the
morons do why that do not reply might
have been an oversight hahaha he but the
good news is nobody will reply on the
others you know it's someplace just have
to decide that it's not worth trying to
outsmart the interwebs and so you just
kind of let let let things roll yeah but
all I didn't want like did you did you
did you pick up Brian hall and
outlook.com before I went live I thought
you did not well I have I have his
banana yeah vice about yeah I didn't I
didn't go pick a whole bunch of a whole
bunch of different uh different
variations or anything like that cuz I
got an email address that i wanted it
will work great yeah but nobody was ever
like Steve what's demo that let's demo
they're not look for you by creating an
account but never a just wild have you
seen bomb Iran balma is that I bet
that's you there you yourself I have jet
I have seen it yeah um one again once
again never never tried out out with the
interwebs the uh what I will say partly
nope less than a hundred people probably
inside the company yeah knew what we're
doing a branding perspective okay and so
there wasn't even a like internal
company only go reserve your names kind
of a thing back where we released it
when we released it it was um game on
yeah I mean it was crazy I mean
