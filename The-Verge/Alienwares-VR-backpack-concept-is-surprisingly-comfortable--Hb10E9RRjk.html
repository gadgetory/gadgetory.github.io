birds it is III 2016 I am just outside
the LA where booth and right now I am
wearing alien where's concept V art
backpack this is actually a full desktop
pc you've got USB ports throughout the
top you've got little accessory bags
right here there's like extra batteries
or so and the idea is this is a fully
functional PC designed to run an oculus
rift or ACC five level kind of headset
untethered you can be able to walk
around an arena
question why would you want that so
right now there's basically two
different kinds of VR Hardware
experiences on one side you've got
cardboard you've got gear VR you'll be
self-contained machines very little
power but you can just pull everything
in one spot the other category very
high-end your oculus rift vibe the best
of the VR you can do they require really
big machines so anywheres the art
backpack is trying to the best of both
world is taking the full desktop
component and putting in a very
comfortable well adjusted sized thing
that you can wear for an extended period
of time
obviously the high end VR headsets like
five and octaves right now have cameras
can track where you are positional II
can't really do that that backpack if
it's with you at all times that's why
you have companies like zero latency who
are using more of like a rougher version
of this kind of idea they've got cameras
located all over their warehouse so you
can kind of walk around it much bigger
space and honestly something that big
you can't gather yourself to a wire
you're gonna trip over it that's kind of
where the big use case for of your art
backpack is right now at least until
technology gets such a way that you can
make everything into one headset that
you can like basically carry without the
huge components meantime got this and at
some point everything you want for a
high of your experience will fit in the
headset itself we're not quite there yet
so in the meantime what you've got is
this kind of high school backpack
experience that you can take oculus
rough with you wherever you go because
you really really can't get enough that
you Valkyrie</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
