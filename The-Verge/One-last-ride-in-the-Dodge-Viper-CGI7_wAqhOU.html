to the Dodge Viper when you think of an
evolved sophisticated piece of machinery
it's probably not thinking of an eight
point four liter v10 that just murders
gas with two sort of semi comfortable
seats no Headroom little way creature
comforts and not much digital love there
either forget it
why shed a tear for this stupid silly
masculine car right let's just write it
off and forget about the whole thing
because it's not good at okay it might
be good at a
there's more place where the diaper
should be happy it's out here on the
racetrack because the lawns disability
don't pretty matter out here do they
you won't be stuck in traffic there is
no traffic there's no stoplights is to
see you your ego your silliness and this
huge honking engine
the thing is you gotta try but like you
stolen and you know there's nothing
there's no nice and eat us all there's
no civility here
it is just ill-tempered really fun yet
all right so why the Viper well because
it's ridiculous
and we all need a little bit of
ridiculous in our life there's places to
be ridiculous in fact is the normal road
is not one of them so it's gonna be
ridiculous go to a place like racetrack
anyhow so forget the niceties forget the
digital stuff forget you know I know
anything that really matters on a normal
day
who's the extraordinary abnormal day hey
go ahead get yourself a bike burger
make it a race track boy what did you do
I want to spend a bunch of time in the
piper in traffic god no do I want to
spend it here on the racetrack yeah I do
because get its company cars aren't
always comfortable and they're not
normal sometimes and they're just crazy
fun will I shed it to here for the Viper
oddly I will good news is they've been
making them for a quarter of a century
so you can probably pick one up for used
and pretty cheap possibility rationality
even you know all the haters because god
dammit it is fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
