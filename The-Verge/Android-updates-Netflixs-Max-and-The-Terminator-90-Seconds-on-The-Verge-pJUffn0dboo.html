jeffries and communism was just a red
herring this is 90 seconds on the verge
Google is developing a gaming console a
SmartWatch and much more in a major
Android expansion that's according to
The Wall Street Journal the next version
of the operating system codenamed key
lime pie is set to launch this fall and
will feature official support for a
broad range of devices from laptops to
wearables rumor has it Apple is making
its own SmartWatch probably just a
coincidence don't know what to watch on
Netflix you don't know max the company
has begun rolling out max he it is a
suggestion engine designed to offer
viewing options more in line with what
you want to watch max was created by
jelly vision known for the you don't
know jack series it's available first
for us playstation 3 users but should
come to other devices in future max even
talks when it asks you to rate things
which is what I always wanted from
netflix and finally he'll be back again
and again and one more time paramount
has announced that a new Terminator film
will arrive in 2015 the movie is said to
be a reboot and will kick off a new
standalone trilogy I'm putting my money
on a Star Trek style alternate timeline
preferably with Benedict Cumberbatch as
an old John Connor talking to a young
Kyle Reese but then goes back in time
and learns the importance of family
along the way that's it for today's top
stories you
tune in tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
