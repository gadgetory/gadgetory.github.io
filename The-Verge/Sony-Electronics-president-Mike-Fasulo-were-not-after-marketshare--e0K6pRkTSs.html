here at CES i am joined very excited
Mike Fasulo the president CEO of sony
electronics North America is here with
me thanks for joining us well great to
be a lot so I gotta say you had a pretty
quiet set of product announcements
yesterday I love Ivan live audience and
he knows like eight years now it's one
of my favorite CS traditions is to come
to the big sunny show the estuaries a
little quieter than normal there it's a
TV show where all the tiny think it was
quiet at all maybe my voice was a little
a little quiet you know everyone's going
to talk about tvs and and we talked
about tv's last evening and look all I
can say about Sony television is and
with our 4k upscaling and now with high
dynamic range yeah customers should go
to the retail shop and visually look at
comparisons everyone's gonna talk about
speeds and feeds and technology but
really it's a bits look yourself at the
picture and then choose which one you
like best I'm very confident you'll
judge Sony the deviance trees are
looking for an upgrade cycle kick off
and we for a minute it was 3d that kind
of didn't happen 4k was here and now
it's really HDR and from my perspective
it feels like HDR is the thing that will
kick off the big upgrade cycle is that
how are you looking at it are you kind
of looking at more broadly well I think
porque is what's kicking off the upgrade
cycle HDR is taking it to it yet another
level yeah and you know when you look at
at the content and HDR it's really how
the director intended it and just you
know it's its lifelike so yeah that the
cycles in play now but next this coming
year 2016 is can be a great year your
television okay so from the pinnacle of
visual technology to the future of the
paths of audio technology to it so i
gotta say record players like a theme of
the show we've seen a couple of
turntables you guys just put up this i
would say beautiful turntable it's very
sleek and designed and it's kind of a
hybrid product right it's go go through
it with me it's really cool so what I
thought I
the road is everything about what's
happening right and innovative so I
thought rather than then carry
television I bring some really need
innovative products you know vinyl LP is
is such a resurgence and it's what's so
great about it is it's hitting all not
only John Rizzo music but segments of
population yeah lana yells love it just
as much as I love it so with this device
here it's a really cool device because
it doesn't number of things one you can
listen to it as a record player in
analog stereo and it has capability to
rip yeah through DSD in high res audio
so you can actually take it with you on
your smartphone on your PC on your
tablet and have high res on the go what
do you think is behind this there's a
there's a boom in vinyl sales con sir I
was telling me yesterday that Sony Music
had to go and find some refurbished
vinyl cutting machines because the
demand is so high what do you think is
driving that it's one the one time on
the ones I were talking about how the
television cycle is accelerating because
the content side can be streaming so
much more easily and on the other hand
we're saying people are buying vinyl
records again so much of the it's CES
2016 you're putting on record player
yeah what's behind that here who would
have thought right now it's cool I mean
you know the texture of vinyl it's
different it's happening it's new its
new its new I mean so so I'm proud of
its it's catching on with a huge trend
so any price to release date on this
point out really surprising at the show
but this will be shipping this spring to
summer yeah I think it's fascinating
right it is such a 2060 interactive and
then onto the and then it's like the
crazy stuff so what is this not so crazy
well this one this one these two are
particularly that you're holding it in
your hand you're holding an 80 inch
projector yeah in your hands so that's
our ultra short throw projector and it
projects the screen size from 22 inch up
to 80 inch yeah and you can see that
it's portable yeah you literally hold it
in your hand guys can't see this but it
has this like texture it's mean this is
a beautiful little device it's I mean
it's Sony it's like very well made it
has this beautiful texture on the side
built-in battery it's long as bad
ah good question I got to get back to ya
now okay so what is this for that's for
either living spaces that you know can't
accept a large screen television or
portability if you want to project in
the office at a meeting you want to
project in different rooms in the house
it or if you just want to you know
project content on a wall for artwork or
right now just and so how do you how do
you get content into here found you yeah
you get you get an hdmi it's Bluetooth
cool and pricing least eight on this guy
he'll price so this these two objects
right here this is a projector this is a
light bulb as a Bluetooth speaker and I
love this this is so cool yeah well talk
about this in second but these are part
of the life spice mix which a few years
ago was a bunch of really high-end
concept products projectors built-in to
speak as in like sofas it was like a
whole separate room of dreams he had
like book an appointment at CES to see
and now it's several years later and
where the stuff is in my hands we're
delivering and it seems like these are
kind of Sony's experiments and what new
kinds of consumer electronics to look
like yeah I mean you know we still put a
significant amount of resources in R&amp;amp;D
and we're always testing and listening
to customers and trying to understand
trends and what customers needs and
wants are and some of these are
novelties yeah you know some of them
will be massive ass products i think
that turntable is gonna sell in huge
quantities you know the ultra short
throw projector maybe not but it still
shows that you know Sony does lead in
engineering and innovation style and
design I mean look at the style and
design of that no talking about tell me
about this this is funny because you you
there's a little cube Speaker I had on
my desk little sunny cube seeker and it
looks like you guys took that speaker he
said what if we just put it in a light
bulb a mud sure that wasn't good but
anyway we'll go with it but I love that
little speakers yeah this is a speaker
like bowl yeah so the power when you
screw it in
that's the power source and then it's
Bluetooth so you can don't take your
music from your phone and put it into
light bulb from your PC or tablet take
it with you to a party take it with you
to another room take it with you eat let
me just walk through the take it with
you to a party snatcher so you Mike
fasulo have arrived at a friend's home
for a party and your first move is to go
to the nearest lamp and surreptitiously
screw in a different light absolutely if
I could screw your attention to the door
I dunno all right so I mean you'll be
seeing missing light bulbs of people's
like I always say technology changes
culture and if we can get to the point
when everybody has their own light bulbs
and they're just sneaking around parties
that'd be great so these two and I just
wanna focus on the life say stuff for a
second it really does seem like he said
some of these are going to be big
products some of these are going to be
novelties where do you see the line like
are you are you are these experiments in
the market that you're seeing where the
consumers respond and then you'll invest
more or are these like this is this is
Sony's vision well I I think it's a
little mixture of both their call them
experiments because we are seeing the
life space you know how people live
change and there are trends to smaller
living spaces and you know flats and
studios metropolitan areas you know that
whole American dream of a big house with
a white picket fence that doesn't
prevail cross whole generations so it's
not only experimental it's actually
building devices and innovative devices
that can get you audio video good audio
video in difficult spaces to get
equipment into with these type of
devices so from that point of view you
know it is following trend from a point
of view of how mass the market is then
maybe experimental a little bit of
novelty yeah one thing that I noticed
both you and cause said yesterday which
was very interesting in sort of the con
in the context of Sony you mentioned
being profitable and wanting to run a
profitable business cause mentioned
wanting to run a profitable business
there have always been questions about
how can sony re tvs i think i've been
Shin how can they researcher profitable
which are profitable why was that theme
president yesterday was it more about
investing in the areas that are growing
was it more about convincing your
investors in the broader public that
Sony's a force where did that thing come
from a couple years ago the theme came
from our financial performance all right
so and what we've done is we've other
causes leadership we've changed our our
direction to be what customers give us
credit for a premium brand that brings
premium quality innovative products to
market the only way to do that the only
way to get back to significant rd
investment is to be profitable so by
moving back to our core in NC e this is
by the way and consumer electronics yeah
particularly in television but moving
back to our core capability of providing
the best audio and visual quality on the
market in a wonderful beautiful elegant
design we're now able to capture a
premium it's a value in the product but
it's a premium versus entry-level market
share game right so we're not after
market share right we're after
delivering to the customer the best
experience through audio visual quality
and by doing so we're making money
awesome and well thank you so much for
good measure yeah always push forward to
next year yeah we'll be back well with a
next generation of turntables amazing
all right thanks everybody we'll talk
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
