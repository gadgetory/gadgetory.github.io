here at CES 2014 in Las Vegas checking
out the new Samsung line of tablets the
company is now launched its Galaxy Pro
line of tablets which include the Galaxy
Tab pro in three different sizes and the
Galaxy Note pro in a twelve point two
inch size the focus for these particular
tablets is a big emphasis on
productivity and multitasking the
company has done a lot of things to make
multitasking easier on a tablet than it
has before enhancing its multi window
features and other business-minded
features Samsung expects this to be able
to replace both a tablet and a laptop
for a lot of consumers this is the
Galaxy Note pro it's got a 12 point 2
inch 2560 by 1600 pixel LCD display
there's really little to complain about
with the display here the device is
relatively thin it's about the same
thickness as you might have seen on a
note 3 or other earlier Note 10.1
tablets and it has the same kind of faux
leather finish as the note 3 unit down
to the fake stitching on the back it
really just feels like all stretched out
elongated Note 3 that's been made quite
a bit bigger but it's pretty hefty
especially if you're trying to hold it
with one hand and interact with it it's
definitely not something that you can do
for a long time without having to rest
it on a desk or a table powering it is a
Samsung Exynos processor there's for the
Wi-Fi mode version the LTE version we'll
be using a Qualcomm processor chip and
they both come with three gigabytes of
RAM as you can see here samsung has a
new home screen that it's calling the
magazine UX it allows users to put
different sized tiles around for
different information you can have your
email tile and news and weather and
things it really feels like Windows 8 or
Windows 8.1 live tiles with constantly
updating information and things like
that and you can have up to five
different screens and default there are
three some of the other cool features
that there are the enhanced multitasking
you can now have up to four apps open at
once and then you can actually resize
them
two different configurations there and
you can even have two instances of the
same app so if you want to compare
side-by-side to websites or to Excel
spreadsheets or something like that you
can open them up both at the same time
it really tries to emulate more of a
desktop experience than ever before and
the exercise that you get extra screen
real estate with the twelve point two
inch screen kind of enables that that's
going to be exclusive on the Galaxy Tab
12 point two and the Galaxy Note pro the
smaller 10.1 and 8.4 inch versions of
the Galaxy Tab don't have as many
multitasking features otherwise this is
Samsung's custom interface on top of
Android 4.4.2 kitkat Samsung will be
launching this entire line later this
quarter but it has not yet announced any
pricing information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
