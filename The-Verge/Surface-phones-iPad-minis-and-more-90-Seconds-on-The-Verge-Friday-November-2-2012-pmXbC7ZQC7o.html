ellis hamburger and it has been a long
week this is 90 seconds on the verge the
iPad Mini is now on sale at Apple stores
Apple's 7.9 inch tablet has a fantastic
design and build quality and can run any
of the 275,000 ipad apps in the App
Store the tablets priced at three
hundred and twenty nine dollars which
makes it clear that Apple isn't aiming
for the lower price market where the
Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire reside this
comes as no surprise though Apple hasn't
exactly made itself known for shooting
for the bottom of the barrel turns out
Apple did revise its public apology to
Samsung as requested by UK courts a
print version of the letter appeared
this week in the Daily Mail in the
Guardian Apple originally posted an
earlier version of the letter on its UK
website with several paragraphs that the
court deemed quote untrue the public
apology is a consequence of Apple losing
its patent infringement case against
Samsung but apples quick to note that it
won a similar case here in the US
Microsoft surprised the world this year
when it built its own Windows 8 computer
hardware and phones could be next
according to The Wall Street Journal
Microsoft is currently testing a
smartphone with Asian suppliers sources
tell the verge that any so-called surf
this phone if it exists would likely be
deployed as a quote Plan B should
windows phone 8 fail to gain significant
traction windows phone 8 ships this
month on a batch of new devices from HTC
nokia and samsung that's it for today's
top stories on a personal note hurricane
sandy hit pretty close to home this week
while we're all okay here at verge HQ
not everybody was so lucky we'd
encourage you to donate to the Red Cross
if you want to help out see you next
