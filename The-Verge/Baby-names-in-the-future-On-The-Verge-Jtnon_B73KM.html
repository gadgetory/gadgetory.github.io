office or agency or whatever they call
themselves these days they they released
administration yeah that's what it is
it's the ministry of social status for
Social Security they released the most
popular baby names and Joshua's livid in
the office yeah I was screaming yeah
because the natural like the names that
like the hot names are celebrity names
people are naming their there's like oh
it's a kid I'll name it after Adele or
Jaden yeah jayden is a popular name and
the rising star this year was a Mason
based on the child from the kardashian
show what is it called me like I have no

I'm Kim is a goddess and an angel but i
watch her shetty how the kardashian
child you were the one who knew that
Mason was yeah I know of course I follow
Mason story but anyhow so so so you know
right the verge we you'd like to say
that the technology culture is becoming
pop culture and so we got to thinking as
we were want to do in the offices and we
thought if celebrity names you know our
kind of moving into the mainstream then
it's surely some stuff from technology
would move into that leech into the
mainstreaming of baby names inevitable
it's inevitable scientific fact
basically and so we wanted to gaze into
the future and maybe think of some names
we might see in the upcoming years that
are I think we came up with some very
accurate I think these are these are
real names that are probably and we're
going to see because of the the how
technology is just becoming a part of
our lives everywhere it's everywhere so
let's take a look at a few of these
possible these future babies as i like
to call them
