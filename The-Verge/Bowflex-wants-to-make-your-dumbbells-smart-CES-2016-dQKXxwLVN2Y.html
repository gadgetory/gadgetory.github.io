the verge at CES 2016 I've been here for
a couple of days now one thing about the
show it's really tough to get a good
workout in thankfully I'm here with
Bowflex and they've got the Select tech
SC 560 dumbbells and yeah I'm gonna try
to get my pump on with these so the st 5
60s are the world's first smart dumbbell
but they're actually building on
adjustable dumbbell technology that
Bowflex has had on the market for a
while now there are a couple differences
with this model they're square instead
of round they're a little smaller than
they were before and you adjust them in
a slightly different way but obviously
the biggest difference is the inclusion
of this smart tech that's what takes
these dumbbells to a whole other level
so in terms of this smart tech the big
thing is that there are accelerometers
included in the dumbbells and these
accelerometers which are like anything
you find in a standard wrist wearable
contract the number of reps that you're
doing the total weight that you're
lifting and the calories that you're
burning so it's a good way to keep track
of exactly how much work you're doing in
your workout one cool thing about them
is that when you're doing a new exercise
they will take the first motion first
complete motion that you perform and
that'll be enough to give it a pattern
and then for the rest of your set if you
have to perform the same motion or else
it won't register you'll hear a beep
that's how you know you've done it just
like you did it the first time and then
within the app itself there are
instructional videos and built-in
workout programs so if you get a set of
these and for some reason you're not
really sure what kind of workout you
want to do I feel like these are kind of
an enthusiast product so that's probably
not likely but just in case it does come
with built-in workouts and instructional
videos so it'll show you exactly what
kind of exercises you can do
so in terms of price for the SC 560 if
you can get the base set for $4.99 if
you want to add this stand that's
another 149 and then you can add extra
weight for another 249 in terms of
availability it's going to be on the
market in a couple weeks so keep an eye
out for that if you want a new game a
fide way to work out that's about it
