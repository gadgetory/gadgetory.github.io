verge and today we're checking out a new
gadget called fur bow which is basically
like a Dropcam for dogs except it's way
cooler because you get to toss your
dog's treats even when you're not home
so I don't have dogs but luckily our
creative director James Bear ham was so
nice to let us borrow Georgie and Monty
for the day even though they're really
great stunt dogs it took a while to get
them used to the fur bow we had to hold
the treat behind it to kind of train
them that the fur bow was their friend
and not just a scary robot sitting in
the corner but once they got used to it
they literally couldn't take their eyes
off it
so while fur bow is obviously supposed
to be used when you're at work or you
know away from the house and your dogs
are at home alone it's kind of just fun
to sit here and chew treats with them
and see what happens
although the tree tossing is definitely
the coolest thing about the fur boat it
also has a couple other features one
thing it does is it sends you bark
alerts so if you're out and all of a
sudden you get a pop of notification
saying your dogs are barking you can
pull up the app see what's going on if
your neighbors get angry that your dog
is barking you can actually talk to them
through the app to make sure that they
calm down
Monty Georgie oh hey guys so now they're
paying attention and I'm going to shoot
them a treat and they're both right
there to get it so as you can see the
furball has a really nice design it
doesn't look like any other home
security system and I wouldn't be
embarrassed but this in my apartment now
you probably do want to put it up a
little bit high so the dogs don't get to
it but it has a wide-angle lens so even
if it's up there you're getting a full
view of the room no matter where it is
we did run into a few issues with
setting up the fur bow it only works
with 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi which it was a
problem in our office but in an
apartment it was totally fine the app
itself is a little bit glitchy but
honestly you kind of don't care because
it's so addicting that you're willing to
exit and reload it just to make it work
the fur goes on IndieGoGo right now for
a $99 pre-order and honestly for a
hundred bucks
it's a pretty good deal looks good it
works for the most part and when I'm
bored I can literally just look at dogs
and play with them I don't know what
could be better you ready</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
