miller and this is the most expensive 90
seconds on the verge we've ever done a
surprise move windows 8 head Steven
Sinofsky is out the news comes just days
after the windows 8 and surface launch
source it inside the company say Steven
Sinofsky had a rather clash of
personality with many people both
employees and higher level executives
Julie larson-green is the new head of
Windows 8 if all that sounds familiar
it's because apple iOS executive Scott
Forstall suffered a very similar fate
recently with fairly similar reasons
speaking of Microsoft halo 4 had a very
unsurprising record-breaking weekend the
game earned 220 million dollars
worldwide in the first 24 hours
Microsoft is calling it quote the
biggest entertainment launch of the year
microsoft expects worldwide sales of our
three hundred million dollars for the
first weeks meanwhile the Halo franchise
itself is now cross a 3 point 38 billion
mark finally there in gonnigan the nexus
4 and nexus 10 google's new flagship
phone and tablet went on sale worldwide
today unsurprisingly the Nexus 4
smartphone has been selling out in the
UK Europe and even the United States as
of this morning in our review of the
device we found it to be quite capable
however without LTE it seemed to be a
little bit lacking for the US market
still it's the best Nexus device out
there Google is also selling a bumper to
go on the Nexus 4 because hey everyone's
doing it these days and that's it for
today's top stories special things to
oblong for letting us use their very
expensive set to namara will be burning
the whole mother for down and starting
