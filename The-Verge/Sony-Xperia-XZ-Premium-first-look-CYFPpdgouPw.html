we're taking a look at Sony's latest
smartphones this is the flagship its XE
premium so looking at the phone you get
a 5.5 inch HD r 4k display which might
be overkill but it looks pretty amazing
sony had kind of a downer year last year
with smartphones we weren't really blown
away by what we saw so they're hoping
this models can help them bounce back
we've got all the latest hardware specs
with snapdragon 835 processor runs
Android nougat it's got a 19 megapixel
camera with a feature that Sony calls
motion eye that captures two seconds
you're not going to miss any photo if
you get a quick fleeting moment you're
going to capture that moment with this
camera that's the headline feature
really it also records slow motion video
at 960 frames of second 720p which looks
pretty amazing glass on the front and
back there's metal on the top and bottom
there's a headphone jack on this phone
which is always nice and on the bottom
is USB see you've got your power button
here there's a dedicated camera shutter
button which is always nice to see on a
phone and over here is your SIM tray
microSD and around back is that 19 make
a pixel camera and both the front and
back cameras have five axis
stabilization so if you're shooting
video if you're blogging to be pretty
steady for you that's also the xes which
is a smaller version it's got a 1080p
screen but the same great camera and
that's really the selling point that's
always going to pushes this is the year
of their camera hardware their camera
technology so this phone's got a 4k
display which seems kind of outrageous I
mean I'm not sure if I can tell a
difference versus the 2k displays on
most other flagships right now but if
you want to go all-in there's a super
vivid mode which is probably great for
movies and photos and if you want to get
the most out of that display hopefully
it's not going to pack battery life that
much but something we're going to find
out once we actually have one so both of
these phones are GSM models so they
should work on a theme to your t-mobile
here in the US when they come out we
don't know when that's going to be
eventually and we don't know pricing but
that's that's going to follow in the
future so for more on Sony's latest
phones here at Mobile World Congress
check out the verge on YouTube
cool should we actually like get them
shots but covered in smudges though huh
just to be real with people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
