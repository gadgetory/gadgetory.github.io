was about ready to graduate from art
school when the web came along and you
looked at the wedding like this seems
like it might be an end run around the
gallery system and it was 20 years too
soon and painters still haven't figured
it out but I decided that I wanted to
understand the web I wanted to learn how
it worked
so the museum's been closed for the last
three years we've done a full historic
renovation of the mansion since is
Andrew Carnegie full house the
collection ranges you know all the way
from contemporary movie posters
mid-century modernist furniture to all
the forks to an enormous collection of
wallpapers to textiles contemporary a
moment and then we took advantage of the
opportunity of the museum being closed
and the building being taken down to
studs and posts to try and imagine what
it means for a museum to be part of the
Internet and vice versa so throughout
the museum there's a whole layer of
interactive experiences and if you think
about Smithsonian at large we have 130
million objects we have all the things
so how do you get all those to people
yeah how do you start to demonstrate to
people that and particularly for the
Smithsonian because like this is all
your stuff like it genuinely it's it's
for you and to try and use those
interactive tables as a way to to sort
of bridge the rest of the collection so
we have an enormous wallpaper collection
which you know one again people don't
have an opportunity to see because
there's finite space and - because many
of them are small snippets so the place
you see that sort of in spades is the
immersion room the immersion room allows
us to do is to project floor-to-ceiling
wallpapers but also it allows people to
create their own welcome
and then you know with all of these
things with the things that you create
and then the things that you collect on
the tables or throughout the galleries
you'll be able to dock your pen and save
your creation than the things you've
collected to your account on the
collections website just vibrate that's
it
and you know you've got the pen is the
pen is both capacitive stylus so it
works on the table so I just like all
silences do and in the back is an NFC
antenna and so and then there's a
circuit board with a small
microcontroller and storage and all of
the labels have a corresponding
crosshair on them and there's an NFC tag
behind it with the object ID and so you
walk up and touch it and it records the
object ID and that's it I mean in some
ways we've built the world's most
complicated physical bookmarking system
some lots of people have said to us
during during all this process of life
why don't you just write an app or use
people's phones and the answer is well
it's true people use their phones to do
this stuff but I think it's only because
that's what they've got up there at
their disposal
no because they actually like it it's
just the only thing I think what we
would like to be able to do if nothing
else is to say to people that yes it's
possible all right it's almost 2015 and
you know it's kind of amazing what we
can do and we're not going anywhere
we're the Smithsonian
