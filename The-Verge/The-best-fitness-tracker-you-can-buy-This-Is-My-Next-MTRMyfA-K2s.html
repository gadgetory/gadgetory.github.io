won't be a thing
they'll be built into watches or
clothing or your phone but right now
they're the best way we have to use
technology to get in shape there are a
million of them and they all do
essentially the same things they count
your steps and they tell you if today's
number is better than yesterday's but a
really good one will also tell you if
you're not sleeping well it'll remind
you subtly or not so subtly to eat
better or go to bed a little earlier or
get out and exercise more and it either
looks good or is basically invisible or
both they come in all shapes and sizes
but the best fitness tracker you can buy
right now is the jawbone up24 the reason
is simple it's just crazy powerful the
up does basic step tracking essentially
the same as any other device but it's
really the most powerful when it comes
to tracking your sleep it tracks that
incredibly well and pairs it with your
activity and your diet to give you these
awesome small tips about how to do
better tomorrow plus the vibrating alarm
which wakes you up at the perfect point
in your sleep cycle is just the best
the up24 also syncs wirelessly unlike
the regular up so everything is always
up-to-date automatically but what are
the up 24 gets really powerful is it's
integrations you can send your up data
to My Fitness Pal or a bunch of other
apps or even let it work with your nest
thermostats have the temperature
automatically change when you go to bed
it works with some food delivery
services so it'll know what you're
eating as soon as you order it using if
this than that there's even a huge list
of other things you can do as well it
turns the up24 from a simple fitness
tracker into an essentially limitless
data collection machine it comes in nice
colors it doesn't look geeky the battery
lasts a week and it's just the best
fitness tracker you can buy right now
the only other one worth even looking at
is the Garmin vivofit which is basically
the exact opposite of the up24 it has
kind of an ugly basic app it doesn't do
much other than just count your steps
and it's not great looking but I like
that it has a screen on it and that it
tells the time and I really like that
it's battery lasts a full year if you
want to buy a step counter and not a
whole health ecosystem the vivofit is a
really strong choice the rest of the
market really runs the game
the one hand there are super powerful
ones like the Samsung gear fit which is
also basically a SmartWatch or the basis
band which collects lots and lots of
extra data on the other there's the
misfit shine a beautiful round puck you
strapped to your wrist that just looks
like jewelry and off in some weird other
realm is the Huawei talk band b1 which
also doubles as a Bluetooth headset for
some reason the Fitbit flex is basically
just like the up24 with a slightly
thinner band and a lot fewer features
same goes for most other options the
winnings pulse o2 and many more
ultimately you should really pick the
one you like wearing the most because
whether or not you'll keep it on is the
main thing that matters in a fitness
tracker but if you're committed to
getting and staying healthy eating and
sleeping and exercising better the
jawbone up is by far the most qualified
device to help at least until a great
SmartWatch comes along</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
