The Verge, here at MWC 2019
and we're taking a look at a foldable
phone prototype from TCL.
So TCL is a brand you
probably know from its TVs.
It also sells phones under the Alcatel,
BlackBerry and Palm brands,
but displays are the company's
bread and butter so to speak.
So this is why we're looking
at this foldable display here.
I am not allowed to touch it.
I am not allowed to even get too near it.
And in its present state,
I would really describe
it as a folded device,
rather than a foldable device
because nobody is going to show us
it folding, opening and closing whatever.
One of the not obvious challenges
with a foldable display
is actually the hinge.
There's a whole bunch of engineering
that needs to go into the hinge.
And TCL has even branded its own design,
its called the Dragonhinge.
It has gears on the inside.
It does take a lot to make this thing
fold and open and close
properly without breaking.
Now having said that,
we do have five different
devices in front of us
and they're very different.
One is the 7.2 inch foldable.
One is a phone that seems to
fold inwards like a wallet.
Another is rather like
a small Galaxy Fold,
which has a display on the outside
as well as a foldable
display on the inside.
TCL says that is headed to a
2020 retail device, hopefully.
I'm not really sure
how that's gonna fit in
under the Alcatel or
BlackBerry or Palm names,
but the main point here is that we have
yet another contender.
Now we already have Samsung
with the Galaxy Fold
and TCL is getting into that as well.
Now with TCL because of
its brand positioning,
the company wants to make
things more affordable.
This is why its not
doing anything in 2019.
The only devices that you're
going to get affordable in 2019
are first of all going
to be very compromised
such as I myself saw
with the Royal FlexPai.
Or super expensive as you have
with Samsung's Galaxy Fold.
TCL doesn't want to get involved in that.
It wants to do something more
affordable, more mainstream
and this is why its heading towards 2020.
So aside from a 7.2 inch
functional prototype
that TCL has here, the
company is exploring
a whole bunch of other
applications as well.
You can have even smartphones
which are going to fold around your wrist,
essentially become a wearable smartphone.
Now these again are pure concepts,
we're not seeing any
working prototypes of them,
but that's the variety that
the company is exploring
with its designs.
One of my concerns with all
of these foldable devices
is what are they going to look like
when they're folded close.
How big is the gap in
the hinge going to be?
And how is that going to translate
into a device that you actually want
to carry in your pocket?
Hopefully we'll learn more
about that as MWC 2019 goes on.
But this for now, is our first look
at TCL's 7.2 inch working,
folded,
somewhat, prototype.
Hey guys, I'm Vlad with the (mumbles).
(laughs)
It's too early in the morning.
- [Man] First one, first one, and go.
- We're going to have plenty
more videos coming out here
from MWC 2019 in Barcelona.
So for more foldable, folded,
5G, no 6G sorry things,
