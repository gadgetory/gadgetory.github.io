Apple's new air pods they're the one
hundred and $59 wireless earbuds Apple's
going to sell late October to go with
the new iPhone 7 that does not have a
headphone jack you can use lighting
headphones but this is the this is what
Apple thinks it's a teacher so these are
the air pods here in the case all you
got to do is open the case all I gotta
do is open the case you can see air pod
saw connected to this iPhone you hit
connect you hold the button on the back
of the case here roll the button they're
going to connect so now all i gotta do
is take these out there they are you can
stick one or both in your ear
i've done that they sound pretty good
they sound just like apples old ear pods
but now they're ear pods you can see on
the bottom
they're totally wireless if you stick
them in here music starts playing you
take one out music stops playing and
then just stick them back in the case
the charge they run for up to five hours
on their own that's the lightning point
you charge it here this charger will
right up to 25 hours of battery life to
the air pods</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
