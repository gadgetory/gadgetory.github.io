in autonomous driving
but there's one outfit out of San
Francisco that's taking a different
approach Calma dot a I founded by George
Hotz
is building kits that allow drivers to
change their cars for less than $1000
into autonomous vehicles so we decided
to come to Las Vegas to see how close
hots was to reaching his goal driving is
a surprisingly intuitive process you
might not think this if you look and you
you know you go to the DMV and you read
the book about exactly how many feet you
need to stay behind a school bus nobody
drives like that people will cross lane
lines all the time people cross double
yellows all the time right
driving is this intuitive fluid thing
and to really be able to drive well you
need to predict what everybody around
you is doing we are common AI and our
slogan is ghost riding for the masses we
have a very data-driven approach we
believe in gathering large amounts of
data on the driving problem and learning
how to drive from that data instead of
sitting in a room with a bunch of
engineers talking about how driving
works and building what we think is a
good driver we actually look get data
from good drivers are even bad drivers
so we learn what not to do
put that into our machine learning
algorithms and what we get is a driving
agent
what's the Beast
it drives like a human our goal and our
approach is to drive really just by
watching people drive to learn every
part of the system we are in a 2016
Acura ILX we are self driving alright so
hands are off the wheel
Camas glowing um if I were to step on
either pedal you would hear that
disengagement chime there's no trickery
with my feet and it's difficult to like
bring them up here but I swear I'm doing
nothing there are two absolute minimum
requirements that we need one is
electronic power steering most new cars
today shipping have this so if we have
electronic power steering the steering
wheel is electronically actuated we also
need a way to electronically actuate the
gas on the brakes now in every
fuel-injected car there's some way to do
the gas brakes I don't think there's a
single car that's break by wire but
because of these systems like electronic
stability control and adaptive cruise
control there are electronic ways to hit
the brakes
if your car has electronic stability
control and electronic power steering
there's a chance we can make it work in
the center where Stanga cycles okay
there's a little bit of side to side
well there's a little bit of wind
honestly you can actually see the
steering wheel it kind of moves a little
bit please dad yeah
for the most part we're doing pretty
good here it will be after market and
user installable about on par with
setting up a piece of Ikea furniture I'm
not all cars will obviously be supported
only certain ones at launch we hope to
expand that selection spending the day
with george hotz in the comedy i car was
pretty cool it definitely still has its
kinks but for the most part delivers on
its promises and if george hotz can
deliver that product but end of the year
for less than a thousand dollars will be
well on our way to driverless cars</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
