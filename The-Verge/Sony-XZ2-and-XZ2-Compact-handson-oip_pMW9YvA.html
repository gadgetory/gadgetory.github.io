Mobile World Congress 2018 and Easter
Sony's newest phones the Xperia z2
the Xperia XE 2 compact now we've seen
years of Sony recycling the same design
year after year after year
big bezels fingerprint magnets things
like that this year they're putting
effort back into their phones again will
it make a difference I'm not sure but
it's a pretty promising start now let me
make this clear the xe2 still has larger
bezels around the screen than other
flagship phones do they're still picking
up for Sony to hit its name on the front
of the thing but they're less blocky and
distracting than before and the screen
itself feels more modern thanks to its
5.7 inch 18 by 9 display with a
resolution of 2160 by 1440 there are
front-facing stereo speakers at the top
and bottom and there's a nice metal
frame running around the whole phone the
USBC jack is on the bottom volume and
power buttons on the side and a SIM card
slot up top that also supports microSD
cards if the 64 gigs and built-in
storage aren't enough but if you're
looking for a headphone jack you won't
find one sony is following the herd and
getting rid of it altogether probably
hoping you're gonna buy their wireless
headphones instead overall though this
phone feels very premium and it's
water-resistant and supports fast
wireless charging from the back the XE -
kind of strikes me as very HTC with its
camera and fingerprint reader both
centered in the middle that main camera
is still 19 megapixels sony claims this
is the very first phone that can capture
a 4k video in HDR and you can even
record slow-mo footage at 960 frames per
second in Full HD 1080p that's pretty
cool
also Sony's 3d creator app can now scan
in a 3d model of your face using the
selfie camera up front and yes there's
now a dedicated to fingerprint reader
for its last several phones Sony
designed the power button to double as a
fingerprint reader
but for some terrible reason that the
company disabled that feature here in
the US we've been stuck using the
old-fashioned pin code all this time but
now everybody gets a fingerprint scanner
and it's in the right spot
now inside the xc2 is the qualcomm
snapdragon 845 the latest greatest
processor that's ready for 5g gigabit
data speeds it's 25% faster than last
year's Snapdragon 835 and as a GPU
that's up to 30% more powerful but a lot
of phones are going to have the same
chip in 2018 so sony put something else
inside the XE 2 to help it stand out
more it's called a dynamic vibration
system and the tagline is that it helps
you feel your entertainment so the phone
will vibrate and Rumble when you're
listening to music on Spotify watching
trailers on YouTube streaming netflix or
playing games you can adjust the
intensity or just turn it off if you
don't want your phone to vibrate all the
time
sony isn't yet telling us when the XC 2
comes out or how much it's going to cost
but you can get it in black green silver
or pink there's a smaller version coming
- that's the XC 2 compact it's got a
5-inch screen and the same powerful
Snapdragon age 45 inside but it's got a
plastic back loses that fancy vibration
system and doesn't support wireless
charging now I'm not sure if these
phones are enough to reverse Sony's
smartphone fortunes probably not sony
barely exists in the u.s. mobile market
carriers like Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T stop
selling their phones years ago but at
the very least it's nice to see a fresh
design small bezels and a fingerprint
sensor there are plenty of awesome
phones during MWC 2018 and draw the
latest news and all those check out
