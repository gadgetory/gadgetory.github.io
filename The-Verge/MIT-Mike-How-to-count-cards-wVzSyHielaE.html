I was one of the leaders of the mit
blackjack team and we used card County
to hack Las Vegas and beat the casinos
for millions our story became the basis
for the best-selling book bringing down
the house and the major motion-picture
21 now a lot of people think that you
have to be a math whiz or Rain Man to
count cards but actually it's quite the
opposite
so right now I'm going to give you hard
counting 101 now with card counters
they're concerned with three different
groups of cards first we have the
neutral cards seven eight nine and over
all the neutral cards don't favor the
dealer or the player so ultimately card
counters actually ignore these cards so
that leaves us with the high cards ten
through ace and the low cards 2 through
6 now the high cards are really good for
the player because these are the cards
that give you blackjack which plays
three to two they also make it more
likely that the deal will bust when
hitting on totals of twelve to sixteen
and they also make better draw cards
than doubling down and splitting on the
flipside the low cards two to six
favored a dealer because these are the
cards that turn the dealer's bad totals
of twelve to sixteen into winning totals
of nineteen twenty and twenty-one
also the more low cards remaining the
fewer black checks that will be dealt
which are good for players and bad for
the dealer's so as you can see there are
an equal number of high cards and low
cards so this is a balanced count system
called the high-low which is what the
MIT team used so at the start of a
brand-new shuffle the count is zero
because you haven't seen any cards and
then as the cards are being dealt the
count is constantly fluctuation every
time a hard card comes out ten through
eight the count goes down by one now the
reason the high cards have a count value
of minus one
even though they're good for the player
is that every time one of them is
depleted that's one less high card that
can benefit players in the future
conversely every time a low card is
dealt to through six the cap increases
by plus one because that's one less low
card that can hurt the players moving
forward now as the count increases on
the positive side that means there has
to be more of the favourable high cards
remaining and so what a card counter
does keep track of the count in order to
identify the rounds of situations when
they're more likely to get Blackjacks
the dealer's more likely to bust and so
you want to bet little or nothing when
you don't have the advantage as a card
counter and then proportionally more as
your advantage increases so as you can
see card counting isn't as complex as
people think but of course like anything
it takes practice to become really good
at it so let's steal one round of cards
and see if you can keep track of the
count
now scanning these cards over what we
can do is group up the high cards versus
low cards in pairs so that they cancel
out so for example this ace cancels out
the three this Queen cancels out the
four and then we can ignore two seven
eight nine because they don't affect
account at all and so that leaves us
with two low cards which each have
account value plus one said account of
these cards is plus two which means
there has to be two more favorable cards
remaining in the ship</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
