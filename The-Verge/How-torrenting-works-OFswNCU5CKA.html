without paying for it the last few years
you probably used a torrent there one of
the major ways to transfer file making
up as much as a half of all Internet
traffic by some estimates they're a big
deal and while it can seem like
torrenting is just downloading a file
directly from the web the reality is a
lot more interesting just to keep things
legal let's say you're looking for the
complete works of Shakespeare it starts
with the torrent file usually named
after whatever your download that's not
the full package though it just lets
your computer know what it's looking for
to read that file you need a client
something like utorrent or transmission
which manages the download and assembles
the fine assembling that file is really
complicated work when it becomes a
torrent your file gets broken down into
thousands of tiny snippets and the
torrent file lets you know where to find
each one one might be on a computer in
Singapore another in Brazil but the
client lets you download all of them
separately and reassemble the minor
computer and once each chunk of data is
safely on your computer you start
sending it out again sharing the parts
of the file you have well you look for
the ones you don't to figure out where
to get those snippets you need a
tracking system typically a server
that's specified the initial torrent
file it keeps track of who's got which
snippets giving you a real-time map
where all the different parts of the
file are there are a couple technical
benefits to this I like direct downloads
a single torrent can serve tens of
thousands of people without any
significant load on the track lesser if
a few nodes go down the network doesn't
really care it turns out to be a really
robust way to distribute big files
across a lot of far-flung computers but
if we're honest that's not the real
reason to get files this way the real
reason is you're stealing things and you
don't want to get caught if a single
person we're hosting the file that would
be the first personal lawyers would go
after
and back when people were using Napster
and so see that's exactly what I have
but now when they want to pull the same
move on a popular torrent they have to
go after 10,000 people at once it still
happens but it's a lot harder for
content owners and it doesn't happen
nearly as much they can also go after
the tracking surfers like they did with
the Pirate Bay
but systems like magnet links mean you
don't always necessarily need a tracking
server it's the result of a twenty-year
arms race between pirates and
entertainment industry and at least for
right now it's just a kind of a
free-form
