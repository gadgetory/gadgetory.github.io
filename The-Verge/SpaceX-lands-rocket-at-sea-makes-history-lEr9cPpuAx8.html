launching its Falcon 9 into space the
company successfully landed the majority
of the rocket on a floating drone ship
at sea it's the second time SpaceX has
landed its rocket post launch and the
first time the company has pulled off an
ocean landing this is another big
milestone for SpaceX in December the
company made history when it
successfully landed its Falcon 9 for the
first time a ground-based landing site
at Cape Canaveral Florida
sure Blue Origin has also launched and
landed its own rocket that vehicle can't
really be compared to the Falcon 9 and
now SpaceX has shown it is capable of
landing as Rockets both on solid ground
and at sea but why land on a floating
drone ship when you can land on land
it's definitely easier to touch down a
rocket on a large expanse of ground
rather than a ship floating on moving
water plus all the previous time SpaceX
has tried to land a Falcon 9 at fee the
results have been explosive the reason
has to do with fuel when the Falcon 9
reaches a certain altitude in space and
separates from the top of the vehicle it
uses leftover fuel to reignite its
engines and come back to earth
the engines are lit in a series of burns
that get the vehicle in the right
position for entering Earth's atmosphere
and landing different landings require
different amounts of fuel to pull off
because the Falcon 9 doesn't launch
straight upward but follows a curved
path up and away from the launch pad for
a ground landing the rocket needs extra
fuel to slow down on that arc completely
flip around and then retread all the
horizontal and vertical distance it is
covered to make it back to solid ground
but for ocean landings the drone ship
can position itself down range of the
rocket or in the ideal place to catch
the vehicle on a more natural path back
to earth that decreases the distance the
rocket needs to travel and the amount of
fuel needed to maneuver the Falcon 9 for
landing not all of SpaceX's missions are
even capable of performing ground
landings since some use up way more fuel
than others rockets that launch heavy
payloads or go to a high orbit need
extra speed for the initial launch an
extra speed requires extra fuel so for
Falcon 9 vehicles that accelerate much
more rapidly
assent there's not as much fuel left
over for the landing that's when the
drone ship is the best if not only
option for recovery spacex expects to
land about one-third of its rockets on
land and the rest in the ocean so it's
definitely going to need to perfect
those sea landings in order to recover
and reuse more rockets in the future the
company's president Gwynne Shotwell
expects reusing the falcon 9 will lead
to a 30% reduction in launch costs those
savings will only start to benefit
spacex with the more rockets they land
and the faster that they can land them

you shouldn't compare SpaceX to Blue
Origin or if you just need more space in
