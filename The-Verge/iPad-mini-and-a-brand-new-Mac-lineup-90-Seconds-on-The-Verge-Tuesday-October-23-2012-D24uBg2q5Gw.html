hamburger part of your well-balanced
diet this is 90 seconds on the verge
brought to you by virgin mobile Apple
said quote we have a little more to show
you and boy it wasn't kidding the
company today unveiled a 7.9 inch iPad
Mini it's super thin small enough to use
in one hand and has the same resolution
as the iPad 1 &amp;amp; 2 meanwhile Apple's 9.7
inch Retina display model was upgraded
with a faster a6x processor and the
company's new lightning port the iPad
Mini starts at three hundred twenty nine
dollars for the Wi-Fi model 459 if you
want LTE pre-orders begin this friday
iPad Mini start shipping on November
second but it didn't stop there apple
also unveiled a 13-inch macbook pro with
retina display the new model is
impressively light at just half a pound
more than the 13-inch macbook air in our
admittedly brief testing day we were
impressed with its performance despite
it only having integrated graphics the
new retina MacBook Pro ships today and
will cost you 1699 dollars for the base
model finally something that wasn't
rumoured a new iMac the new imac is
extremely thin and while it doesn't have
an official Retina Display it's pretty
darn close Apple dropped the imax
optical drive and firewire port to put
it in line with its newest computers the
company also introduced a new mac mini
with the same look as before but with
updated specs no word on the off
forgotten mac pro but Apple did promise
a refresh sometime in 2013 and that's it
for today's top stories but coming out
tomorrow the blue man group celebrates
its fifth year without a single Union
