touch this one on the right this is the
old nuke symbol touch they're actually
the exact same or hardware but this the
new one has new version of software and
it's ninety nine dollars luckily the
software updates going to come to the
original look simple touch the software
makes the screen just work better if you
can see the the blacks are a little
blacker and the font rendering is a
little bit better but what's really
great is it makes the page refresh which
is already pretty good on the original
even faster so we're going to jump into
Hunger Games of my favorite book and as
you can see the text is actually refloat
a little bit because the text rendering
engine is different and this one's a
little blacker it's a little sharper not
hugely better and there's still problems
i think kindle is still better at
software at font rendering but here we
go so that's a swipe there and that's a
swipe here and now we're going to do
them on the at the same time now it's
still using the the trick where it does
actually refresh the screen entirely
except for every at a certain point you
see that black it flashes black but as
you can see it's just updating just a
little bit it just resolves the text
just a little bit faster on the new one
and that's the big thing we'll just look
at this text the fonts real quick try to
get out of the same page so that's a new
nook simple touch it's ninety nine
dollars and it should be available now
