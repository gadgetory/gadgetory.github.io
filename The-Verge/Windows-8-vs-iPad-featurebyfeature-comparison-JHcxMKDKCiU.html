we're taking a look at Windows 8 the
consumer preview on a tablet versus the
current market leader the iPad 2 with
iOS 5 on a tablet so first off let's
just look at basics now Windows 8 uses a
lot of at least in the Metro interface
uses a lot of gestures and and interface
paradigms that are really different than
than what the iPad and what the iPad
does now the iPad is some pretty basic
operation right it's got you can swipe
through home screens you obviously hit
the home button you can go to search or
swipe over to get to search when you're
at your home screen if the if the iPad
is turned off you can hit the home
screen to wake it up and unlock it like
that pretty straightforward if you jump
into an app for instance let's say
YouTube looks something like that
pretty straightforward you can double
tap on the home button go over here to
the music controls brightness control
rotation lock control so on very
straightforward you've probably seen it
before and then there's also in in this
version of in iOS 5 you've got a couple
of gestures so you've got this four
finger pinch to get back to the home
screen if you're in an app you can use
four finger swipes to go to previous
apps or back to the the app previous to
the previous app pretty straightforward
and you know that's about it for
gestures on the iPad of course you've
got Notification Center that's about it
for gestures
besides in-app stuff like pinch-to-zoom
and the others on the other hand Windows
8 is very gesture heavy for lots of
different things so obviously this is
your your main home screen you see all
your tiles here and apps you can pinch
on this screen to get an overview of
your apps you can also swipe up and get
your app menu here so this is different
for this is contextual for each app so
for instance if we're in calendar you
get a different app menu there you can
swipe down from the top to close
a nap and there's the charm menu which
you get from swiping on the right side
there get these various controls
settings devices start share search etc
just want to show off a little bit of
multitasking you can swipe in apps that
you've been using from the left like
this and you can actually place them in
the sidebar as we've shown before like
so and it's pretty handy once you get
the hang of it go to the verge so while
we're loading this that should be
loading in the background and yep there
it is loaded up or at least partially
loaded up and it's pretty handy pretty
amazing actually it's also amazing that
nobody's thought of this yet but it's a
little the implementations a little
tricky but you get the hang of it I
haven't done think I've quite gotten the
hang of it but I'm getting there it's
kind of cool because you can actually
read your mail while you're working with
another app which is kind of amazing so
as you can see is it very gesture heavy
UI and you're constantly sort of moving
from these different sides of the of the
tablet to get around you know obviously
you've got the standard stuff where you
can just tap to get into something the
iPad obviously handles multitasking
differently you've got the multitasking
bar down here these gestures here and of
course pinch to get back not that
intuitive to be honest with you I mean
four fingers a lot of fingers to use and
frankly it's just it's cumbersome to do
it this is a weird gesture maybe you get
used to it after a while I never have I
prefer to multitask the old-fashioned
way but fairly straightforward compared
to Windows 8 so if you want to add an
account in mail you open it up and pull
up the app menu go to accounts and then
there's a Add Account here you can
obviously there's a couple of options
right off the bat hotmail Google and
exchange you put in your data and away
you go
it syncs automatically syncs messages so
you can go through messages here there's
no threaded messaging actually which is
interesting it's it's a pretty
bare-bones applet
Asian and you can look at your folders
it's uh it's it's really pretty
stripped-down as far as as far as these
as far as male apps go but it gets the
job done so you can select multiple
messages by swiping on them like so
which is fairly intuitive and then you
can delete like that now on the iPad Oh
starting an email account is fairly
similar just put a name here get option
to sync there now what's interesting is
that on the Windows tablet doesn't
really tell you if it's thinking if it's
thinking your contacts or not and I I
don't know if it is oh it is well this
might be for my other account hard to
say nope it's not these are just
strangers complete strangers don't know
these people frankly I'm a little
concerned now let's take a look at the
browser it's Internet Explorer of course
on the Windows 8 tablet and it's really
quite good quite fast and there are a
couple of drawbacks however for instance
it does not display our opacity
correctly on our some of our tiles on
the site so that's a little
disappointing to find out but you know
no one's perfect I mean up until
recently you couldn't see Typekit fonts
on android so we shouldn't feel too bad
but you know I think you can see here
both of these devices are just making
you know doing a pretty good they've got
a pretty good representation of the site
here scrolling is really fast and smooth
on the Windows 8 tablet you can double
tap and also a pinch to zoom which is
super fast definitely impressed with the
with the speed at the browser you also
get you know it's a little weird you get
your tab menu up here and your URL field
down here it's again it's very
stripped-down in comparison to
something well I mean even compared to
the iPad I it feels a little more
stripped-down they're clearly going for
minimalism here in fact there's some
weird stuff that that I found where it's
tough to save you want to save an image
it's not that easy to just grab the
image so a real option here to grab this
which I found a little troubling I was
trying to save a desktop image on of
course on the iPad it's a little bit
easier so there's some some basic
functionality that doesn't seem to be
here yet you know unless I'm just doing
something totally wrong there just does
not seem to be a way to select things so
made it very hard for me to decorate my
Windows 8 tablet but all in all not a
not a deal-breaker or anything let's
take a look at search so on the iPad you
can swipe here and start searching for
something that wants to search the web
and Wikipedia here you want to grab from
the charm bar you can start searching
let's do for hello and it doesn't really
make it clear you can I believe you can
search yep there you go so it's a little
bit a little bit less intuitive but you
get a lot more options you can also go
and search the Microsoft Store here and
there are no results for hello of course
very disappointed so less options really
it's kind of annoying in fact I've come
up against this that less options for
searching on the iPad I actually prefer
the implementation on Windows 8 so this
is the calendar it's pretty straight
forward actually pretty good usable
interface for for looking at your
schedule get a few different views you
can see here that Thomas Houston was
moving today except instead he was
actually working on a Windows 8 stuff
but actually really fast extremely
snappy you want to pinch the zoom but
you can't pinch the zoom and that is the
calendar by comparison you've got the
calendar here on the iPad which is
a little less intuitive and but a lot
has a lot more leather in it so I think
that's kind of got it you know something
going for it you can go to the day and
create an event here and you can move
them around on so on Windows 8 so a
little more complicated if you want to
train quickly change the time of
something you get a pull one of these
guys so not quite as intuitive so all in
all very different interfaces I actually
find a lot of stuff in Windows 8 to be
more intuitive than what they're doing
on the iPad but the iPad is of course
much more straightforward very
simplistic and isn't meant to do double
duty as a computer now you kind of
forget but you end up at this screen
every once in a while and this is stuff
I don't even know how this stuff
appeared this is just hanging out in the
background and in all honesty this is
this is the thing that I want to avoid
on a tablet so I just wish that that you
could stay in in this world instead of
having to go back to the to the desktop
environment I think tablets a tablet if
you just talk about Metro and the iPad
Microsoft is giving Apple some pretty
stiff competition and it'll be
interesting to see what kind of form
factors
what price points and what kind of
software developers ultimately make for
it
but my feeling is that Windows 8 is off
to a pretty promising start as a tablet
