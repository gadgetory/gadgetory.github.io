Barcelona and this is the HTC One m9 no
way does he MA this is a 109 you'll be
forgiven for mistaken HTC's new flagship
phone for its old one still has a 5-inch
screen with 1080p resolution it still
made almost entirely out of aluminum and
it still has giant boomsound speakers on
the front hell even the camera is the
same on it this time the four megapixel
ultrapixel shooter has moved to the
frontal device that makes room for new
20 megapixel camera on the back the
sapphire lens protrudes slightly from
the one end lines body the new camera is
the most prominent visual change and
that's intentional HD wants to build an
icon in some words with the one design
and it's only tinkered around the edges
literally the one online has more
pronounced the edge on the sides and now
is a grip you finish one of the few
downsides of the previous design was
that it felt too slick and easy to drop
but one m9 fixes that any moves the
power button to the side which also
helps the power button could have been
placed high about a final keep pressing
the volume up button when trying to
break the phone the camera is a big new
thing with one and nine but it's been a
letdown for me 24 hours to take photos
whatever their quality isn't good enough
for flex your phone in 2015 it's too
much noise to lure sharpness and
low-light photography is basically
disaster the one online keeps up a
history of unsatisfying cameras that
explain to one series so far not even
the addition of 4k video and raw image
capture going to save the day
on the software side HD is making a big
deal out of theming the news sent seven
home screen but a bunch of options to
adjust things like fonts icons color
scheme etc throws automatically up
suggestions for nearby places to eat and
a new home screen widget that
dynamically changes wraps depending on
your location these are all potentially
nice additions but nothing observing the
One m8 needed a few design tweaks and a
better camera to become most people's
perfect phone that's exactly what they
try to do with one and nine but it
didn't quite get there the design is
gorgeous the camera is not</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
