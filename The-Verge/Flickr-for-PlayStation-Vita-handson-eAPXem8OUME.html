we're going to take a look at the new
flickr app for a PlayStation Vita which
hit the Japanese PSN store today as you
can see it gets added to the home screen
just like any other application and
tapping the icon will bring up its live
area live areas are kind of like the
splash screen for PlayStation Vita wraps
every app has one like you can sweat
between them and this is the one for
uncharted for example the flicker one is
pretty barren there's only two options
there's this today's explored button
which takes you to something kind of
random from the day and flicker and this
is the start button so let's go with a
start button and get into the main
application there's a short load screen
that comes up before we get to the main
interface and here we are so the
interface kind of works from top to
bottom with all the different functions
of liquor and when you get to a bar you
can like scroll from left to right to
sort of load all the photos you can
actually change the order of these by
going to the layout setting at the
bottom so let's say if I wanted I don't
know that if I wanted my the Explorer
function to be at the top him I would
just drag it up here and there you go so
here we have it um there's not too many
surprises here it's all pretty much
standard features from Flickr itself you
put your uploads your friends lists your
history your contacts everything and
your own photo stream your sets let's
check out the search function so let's
type I don't know let's go in tokyo and
we should get a list of pictures from
tokyo coming up here you can see the
loading of these thumbnails isn't super
quick i'm on Wi-Fi so it should be a
little faster but isn't it sucked too
bad and thumbnails themselves are a
little bit compressed but if you
actually load the picture itself after a
while it should look pretty good so it
kind of comes up in a half screen with
all the information on the right and
tapping it brings up the full photo on
the screen and it does actually look
really good on the victor screen
so let's go back what else do we have so
of course one more thing about the
feature is that it is itself a camera
right there's this front facing camera
here and of course the back-facing
camera on the back so it's not a great
camera but it is a camera so it's nice
that flickr has its own upload feature
and integrated into the app so let's
give this a go if i tap the camera app
so it brings up the camera and if I slit
the front facing one here do it's a
flipped image of my business gut do I
want to use this image sure why not so
I'll tap this and here it kind of gets
loaded into the app and after today I
should be able to tap it so here it is
here and there's the upload icon here so
if i tap the upload uploading complete
and if i go to my recent uploads yep
there you go you'll see it right there
so now i've uploaded a picture on flickr
direct from my playstation vita and
there you have it this is the flickr app
for PS vita</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
