pleasure
you're a theoretical physicist you're a
best-selling author but you're also a
man which one of them which one of those
do you prefer which one do you like the
best you know it's hard to say it's the
union that I think really makes it a
package the package he'll come be
together so okay I'm extremely stupid
when it comes to all the things you're
extremely smart about explain your
string theory is sort of your thing
that's sort of your bag everybody when
they swing you hear about string theory
everybody immediately says screams your
name explain string theory and its most
basic to me sure it's our best attempt
to realize a dream that Einstein had
which was what he called a unified
theory which would be a single framework
maybe a single equation a single idea
that would describe everything that
happens in the universe the fundamental
laws the fundamental processes the
particles and how they interact so
that's the goal now what is the theory
itself well it answers we believe or at
least we think because this is not a
proven theory by any means a question
that the ancient Greeks asked what is
stuff made of what's the fundamental
ingredient in any piece of material the
finest uncuttable stuff and it's
important that that there is this
unifying that to you at least this is it
would be very upsetting to know that
there's somehow things in the universe
did not have some fundamental shake not
everybody agrees so there are some who
are the who are the bastards who don't
give names some of the people who are on
your hit list I'm not saying you're
gonna kill them you know it's a
perfectly valid perspective to imagine
that maybe there isn't a single
description of everything you need some
equations that work for the molecules
and atoms other equation that works for
the stars and galaxies and black holes
and some people believe that that's how
altom utley things will play out people
like me think that doesn't make any
sense because when you take say a black
hole well in the middle the center it's
a huge amount of material that's crushed
to a very small size you need a theory
of gravity a theory of
big things work now because it's so
small you also need a theory of how tiny
things in size work that's quantum
mechanics so it seems that you should be
able to put together the logs of the big
and the small into one package to even
be able to describe things that we
believe are out there in the real world
so if you don't want to ever say hey
black holes the Big Bang whatever we
don't understand we don't need to then
perhaps you don't need a unified theory
but if you want to answer those
questions yeah you've got to go further
and have a unified description okay so
so tell me about explain to me eleven
the eleven dimensions
yes by the way that's a that sounds like
a question somebody asks you when
they're on very high on drugs
yes tell me tell me about the eleven
dimensions can you III thought there
were far fewer dimensions that we had to
which is have access which is again by
everyday perception I'm glad you think
that way it means everything is working
you look around the world and you see
left-right you see back forth you see
up-down three dimensions of space yeah
the equation I also see time is that
normal time is fine to you still
perfectly healthy okay so if you're
willing to throw time in then you've got
four dimensions three of space of one of
time string theory when you look at its
equations the equations don't work if
those are the only dimensions if three
space in one time is it it needs more
dimensions and in the version that we
are most confident about it does require
eleven space-time dimensions what are
the other dimensions well they're not in
some sense much different from the ones
that you know about so these are the
ones that you experience the others are
like those but either very very tightly
wound up very small so you can't see
them with the naked eye even though
they're all around here or we may simply
not have the ability with our eyes or
with any of our senses to directly
access those other dimensions even
though there might be big all around it
right so you read a lot about parallel
universes and the idea of an infinite
number of parallel and if I'm misquoting
you stop me but an infinite number of
parallel universes can you explain how
parallel universe would work in I guess
tandem with the universe that I'm
experiencing or
sure that you're experiencing when you
talk about the beginning of our universe
we often speak of the Big Bang this
explosion if you will
early on that created everything that we
see around us our attempts to understand
that process really deeply have led to
theories that suggest that it may not
have been a unique event there may have
been many big bangs each giving rise to
its own expanding realm its own universe
and those big bangs could be happening
even today so you'd have a larger
reality in which our universes may be
just one expanding bubble a big cosmic
bubble bath of universes with everything
that we know about being just one of
those bubbles what's outside the bubbles
yes so what I would say one way of
thinking about it is think of a big
block of Swiss cheese and think of the
universes that I'm talking about as the
openings in that block of Swiss cheese
so this big expanding block of Swiss
cheese that's basically a space exists
regardless yes knitting outside of space
not that these theories require so you
can always imagine great things anything
else I don't think so the only thing
that drives me to take an idea seriously
is if there's a mathematical reason for
considering it and we don't need to
imagine a realm beyond anything that I'm
talking about now which is itself pretty
huge really expansive right and this
expansive reality would suggest that our
universe is a little tiny piece of this
grander hole and so those are those
other universes are currently
operational and their laws of physics
might look different from here the
particles that inside them could look
different but the weirder thing of all
is when you study the math you take it
very seriously which maybe one shouldn't
we don't know if our equations apply to
this vast expanse of reality but the
equations are pretty clear that there
would be duplicates of this realm so how
many how many are there is it infinite
there could be infinite okay in infinite
versions of this and in round variations
of this we've swapped in chairs and I
would be doing you in one of those
universes and on and on it would go so
you have a a theory that there's an
equation that can this this idea that
you can explain everything and and
obviously you're sort of that you're
studying this very closely lots people
are studying at this unifying Theory how
much closer are we now than we were say
10 years ago or 20 years ago how quickly
is this moving hour or have we have we
discovered things in the last say 25
years that have completely destroyed our
ideas of what we believed or is this a
much more incremental process it is very
incremental but there had been
breakthroughs that are thrilling right
so you may have heard about the Higgs
boson that was discovered at the Large
Hadron Collider at this last year so
that was a particle that had been in our
equations for 40 years that everybody
pretty much had come to accept it's got
to be there but you don't know it's
there until you find it right and it
could easily have turned out that you
smash these particles together in Geneva
and the particle that you anticipate
being produced this Higgs particle you
don't find it and that would have been
astounding and it would have been
exciting in its own right but it's
hugely gratifying that you follow the
equations the equations say you should
find this particle you build this ten
billion dollar machine you smash protons
together and holy smokes you find
exactly what the equations said that you
should find for somebody like me whose
work is completely mathematical that's
the kind of progression where we say
we're not nuts right this mathematics
can provide the window onto the next
layer of reality that we've yet to see
and you don't worry that we found ways
to describe things that line up with the
things that we believe and so don't
worry about that
okay so what what seems provable or
proof yes just our perception of I do
worry about that all the time
and how do you combat those fears um you
know I must see my therapist and we talk
it through and you know you just try to
come to to terms with these ideas look I
worry but not all the time because it
would be paralyzed by it is mathematics
something that we just make up inside
our brains
it's very good at organizing those
things that we can perceive or at least
beyond our perception of the things that
the math takes us to or is math really
fundamentally the language of the
universe and that's what we've tapped
into and we really are in route to
eternal deep truths do you feel like
we're in a dangerous place right now in
regards to science I mean are you
feeling more positive or more negative
about where we are as a society in terms
of our relationship with science so I
think what needs to happen there has to
be a fairly dramatic a fairly radical
cultural shift where science currently
is in the outskirts and it needs to be
brought right into center stage we need
people to see science as vital to a full
life as literature as film as theatre as
music because it is and I think part of
the way that you do that is you need to
stop only having the interaction that
people have with signs being the
traditional classroom experience where
you memorize stuff you take an exam and
when it's done you're all too happy and
you leave it behind
science needs to be communicated as an
ongoing story at Romantics and literally
throw children into a black hole so they
can experience the full excitement yes
you know I got being stretched in the
following sense so I wrote a story about
a kid that goes to a black holes called
icarus at the edge of time and the boy
goes to the black hole it's like the
original Icarus story except he doesn't
die in this version he spends an hour
around the black hole and to give away
the ending because of Einstein's general
relativity so he spends an hour around
the black hole and his dad said don't go
but he goes and he comes back to his dad
what do you think I'm the first kid ever
go to a black hole and it turns out his
dad has gone because an hour near a
black hole
Einstein taught us is 10,000 years or
more for everybody else that's how you
would like to teach children about
something while you're writing your
whole family and there will be dead
so so I wrote this book and when it came
hot off the press you know it was
dedicated to my son who's five at the
time I didn't want to read it to him
because it didn't want to be oh god dad
writes these things and I have to listen
to you know I didn't want it to have
that feel to him
so I just left copies of the book around
the house hoping he'd find it and he did
and they had my wife read it to him and
by the end he was crying because the boy
comes back and the dad is gone so yeah
exactly so so people have asked me when
I told them that weren't you upset that
you kind of wrote a story that made your
son crying the answer's no well yes at
some level but no because you're happy
about it because if the general theory
of relativity which is core to this
story can make a five-year-old cry it
makes the science meaningful it's not
just abstract ideas that he has to
memorize he sees that these ideas can
really matter and when you see that
science really matters then you care
about it and when you care about it it's
not just a subject Brian thank you so
much that was awesome I pleasure thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
