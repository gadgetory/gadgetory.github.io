and this version is called cierra the
headline feature is that you can talk to
Siri on your Mac now but there are a lot
of little things that make your Mac way
way better at talking to your iPhone
your iPad and even your Apple watch now
we've learned a lot from phones over the
past 10 years and now Apple is applying
a lot of that to the Mac let's start
with Siri you can launch it one of
several ways you can hit function space
hey Siri how's it going you can also you
don't want to do that you can click this
icon on the dock or if you don't wanna
do that you also got this icon up here
it's basically everywhere it's a little
confusing but stick with it and you can
ask Siri Siri things like show me the
weather in Utah here's the forecast for
Salt Lake City Utah between today and
June 29 2016 so you get this little
interactive widget here and you can like
save it as an image or if you want you
can even add it to your notification
area it's actually a lot more useful
than spotlight overall which makes it
even more frustrating that the two
things just aren't combined I type on my
computer and I really wish I could just
type at Siri - so while Siri makes your
computer feel a little bit more like
your phone there's a whole pile of other
features that make your computer better
friends with your phone and the first
and very best of them is called iCloud
desktop and documents basically it's
what iCloud Drive always should have
been
you've got some stuff on your desktop
and it just automatically mirrors itself
to an app on your phone
it's exactly like Dropbox but you don't
have to think about it because it's
built right into the Mac and right into
the iPhone well until you do Apple still
charges 10 bucks a month for terabyte of
storage or 3 bucks a month for 200 gigs
and it's really easy to fill that
storage up especially if you're backing
up everything out of your Documents
folder so another thing you can fill up
all that space is all the files that
have been backed up with a new feature
called optimized Macs
orange the way it works is it looks at
when your hard drive is getting too full
and takes all the photos and files that
you haven't touched in a while
deletes them from your local computer
and backs them up to iCloud you can
still get them whenever you want to but
it means that you've got more space on
your computer to do the work that you're
doing right now so there's a bunch of
other continuity features to talk about
too if you have iOS 10 on your iPhone
you can cut and paste from your phone to
the Mac and vice versa if you have watch
OS 3 on your Apple watch you can use it
to unlock your Mac so you don't have to
constantly type in your password
beyond that continuity stuff there are a
bunch of other app updates the biggest
one is two photos so if we open up
photos here you can see we've got albums
for people and places at Apple can
figure out those things on its own it
also has this memory section which shows
you a bunch of stuff that it's put
together based on you know it's
algorithms to make little albums sort of
like Google photos does and in terms of
editing photos there are some do editing
features if you add it a live photo here
you it will maintain itself as a live
photo and you can of course name people
here so this is me iTunes also got an
update it's still kind of a mess there's
like sidebar if you want it in a
drop-down and so on but Apple music has
these nice new big fonts and a playlist
weekly playlist which is great so it's a
little bit better here but overall going
into iTunes still feels kind of like a
children also there's tabs you know that
there's tabs in Safari but you can also
get tabs in pages there's new tabs you
can also get tabs in maps there's a
whole bunch of tabs basically any app
that wants to make a tab can make a tab
now because apparently tabs are how we
work with desktops from now on I should
remind you that this is just a Developer
Preview so a lot of things will change
there's a beta for the public coming in
July and then the whole thing is going
to be released
everybody in September and I'm hoping
that between now and then we're going to
see Siri get a lot more features because
I got to tell you she works great when
she works but there's a lot of questions
that she just doesn't understand you had
one email message from James temple
open it what up shall I open you just
didn't get their digits arey if you're
an iPhone user this is going to be a
great update for you and if you're not
Apple is making the case yet again that
if you have a Mac you really want to
have an iPhone because the two things
just work way better together
Siri is actually a lot more useful than
spotlight now all those little aptitude
it up all those little apt updates it up
and if you're not I got to tell you I
kind of tell you that the Donald Trump
thing that's in my head now why am I
talking like Donald Trump</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
