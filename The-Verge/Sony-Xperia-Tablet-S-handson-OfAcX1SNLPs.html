we're here looking at the Sony Xperia
Tablet S is brand new it was just
announced in Berlin but we got a chance
to check it out in New York City as well
so as you can see it looks a little bit
like some of the Sony tablets before
it's super light and really thin it
looks really nice it runs a Tegra 3
processor it has Android 4.0 and it has
some waterproof covering and a
nine-point 4 inch 1280 by 800 display so
there are a bunch of new accessories
that come with the tablet but one of the
coolest ones is this keyboard case it's
a $99 case and the tablet slides in and
then actually props up it reminds us a
bit of the Microsoft Surface and so it
has this capacitive keys here which
automatically are enacted or enabled
when you put it in and they're actually
surprisingly good for typing it's a
little laggy that we've seen but it's
pretty accurate and that's a big
keyboard and it's a cool thing to have
that doesn't add any weight to a case
and then whenever you're done you can
just close it and then it just carries
around like any other folio case you
might have but what's really interesting
is some of the software that Sony has
put in so let's take a look at some of
that one of the biggest changes they've
made is to the universal remote control
there was already a universal remote on
here but now you can actually add as
many devices as you want and you can add
macro so you can do things like turn on
your TV and your blu-ray player and tune
to a certain channel all at once and it
makes it a much more capable remote
control and it all works through an IR
blaster on the device and it's a pretty
neat thing to have on a device that's
likely to be in your home anyway there's
also a really visual TV guide that shows
you all the things that are on TV at any
given time and based on what you've
watched and it'll connect to your social
networks it'll actually make a TV show
bigger or smaller based on what you want
to watch so like apparently I really
want to watch First Take and I'm less
interested in day playing it's just a
cool way to watch TV and is a way better
way to navigate all your junk there's
also a new guest mode on the tablet
which is pretty cool it's an easy way to
switch between different users which
gives you different permissions for
certain apps and disable settings or
won't let you into the browser and it's
a great way if you have kids especially
to say here you can play games but we
don't want you looking at the internet
or accidentally buying things on the
Play Store it's a really clever easy
feature to get in and out of you and you
just need a passcode to get out
and then just like that you're right
back to where you were there's also a
lot of Sony's other software from its
expiry offends this is the first Xperia
Tablet so they've branded it with the
same look and feel and a lot of the same
apps you get the PlayMemories and
there's the Music Unlimited and the
video unlimited so it's definitely
designed to be used in conjunction with
an expiry alone so that's pretty much it
this is the Sony Xperia Tablet S it's
going to be available next week but it's
up for pre-order now it starts at $399
and depending on how much stores you
want can cost up to $5.99</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
