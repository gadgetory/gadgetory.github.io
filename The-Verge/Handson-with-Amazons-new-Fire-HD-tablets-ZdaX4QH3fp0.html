back its efforts and its consumer
hardware division but based on today's
product releases we're seeing it's clear
they're still putting some effort behind
low-cost tablets we're looking at four
new tablets first there's the new Fire
HD 8 inch a Fire HD 10 inch a very
inexpensive 7 inch tablet and another
tablet that's designed for kids let's
look at the new fire HDS first they have
a new industrial design some people may
like the colors that they come in but I
can say that this plastic bag feels a
little cheap right off the bat they're
super thin they're 7.7 millimeters thin
and Amazon is calling this its lightest
tablet ever one interesting note about
these tablets is they have a 16 by 10
aspect ratio we've seen more and more
tablet makers go to a four by three
aspect ratio because four by three is
better for more everyday stuff like
reading 16 by 10 is generally better for
a cinematic experience you can see that
Amazon is really pushing its prime video
here it has a 1.5 gigahertz quad-core
processor the 8 inch starts with 8
gigabytes of internal storage the 10
inch with 16 gigabytes of internal
storage both have a microSD slot to
expand both tablets are running on the
latest version of iOS it's fire OS 5 and
they're starting out with Android
lollipop the new 10 inch Fire HD tablet
costs 230 dollars the 8 inch costs a
hundred and fifty dollars that is indeed
a low cost tablet but Amazon is going
even lower than that it's also putting
out a new seven-inch tablet that's going
to cost just fifty dollars this one
doesn't have quite as nice of a display
it's a 1024 by 600 display it does have
IPs it starts with 8 gigabytes of
storage and has the same microSD slot
for expandable storage it has a 1.3
gigahertz processor 1 gigabyte of RAM
and once again is running on the latest
version of iOS which is fire OS 5 the
craziest thing is that Amazon thinks
that this is going to be your next great
party favor instead of showing up with a
six-pack of beer maybe you'll show up
with a 6-pack of tablets because they're
actually bundling them as a six-pack and
if you buy five you get the six one for
free so once again these are not your
top-of-the-line best tablets ever based
on the specs and base
to build a little bit - but amazon
thinks that it has struck a chord with
more of a low-cost approach to tablets
and that's clearly what we're seeing
here today</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
