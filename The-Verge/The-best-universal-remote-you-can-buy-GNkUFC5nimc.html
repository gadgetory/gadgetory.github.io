requires juggling a bunch of remotes for
a bunch of different devices you've got
one for your TV one for your cable box
one for your blu-ray player one for your
Apple TV maybe even one for your Roku TV
or fire TV or even a gaming system
juggling all these remotes when you just
want to watch a TV show kind of sucks so
a good universal remote can really make
your life a lot easier a good universal
remote controls all of the devices in
your entertainment cabinet even ones
that don't use standard IR control and
they make it easy to turn on the right
devices in the right order with just one
button press it also should be
accessible for anyone in your house to
pick up the remote and turn on the TV
smart phones may seem like a good choice
for universal remote but unlocking your
phone launching the app waiting for word
to connect it's really kind of
cumbersome when you just want to turn
the TV on or change the volume there
used to be a lot of companies offering
universal remotes when the past couple
of years Logitech Harmony line has
become the de-facto choice that means
that picking the best universal remote
really means picking the best Harmony
remote that Logitech offers and the best
of the field is the elite the Harmony
Lea has everything you could need in the
universal remote support for IR
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi a vast database of
codes and a straightforward app to
program it it also has a smart organ
Amma Clay out so all the controls you
can need are right in your thumbs reach
since the elite performs this task
through a hub that sits on your
attainment center you don't have to
worry about pointing it at the right
devices the entire time it runs its
commands Logitech has also made it easy
to program automated functions so single
button press can turn on your TV turn on
your cable box and set your TV to the
correct input or you can program a
setting that turns the TV on dims the
lights and automatically launches the
Netflix app the Harmony smartphone app
which is used to set up and program the
elite can also be used as a remote
itself which is convenient I want to
rely solely on my phone as a remote but
it can come in handy when the remote is
out of reach unsurprisingly a runner-up
pick is another harmony the 650 how many
650 is about a straightforward of a
universal remote as you can get control
up to 8 devices has an ergonomic backlit
keyboard and has an LCD screen for more
advanced functions and onboard help it's
also a lot cheaper than the elite the
650 can only be programmed by a Mac or
PC app which is a bit clunky and has no
aspirations of leading the living room
you can't use it to control smart home
appliances at all and since it only
works over IR it can't control Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth devices
Amazon fire TV or Playstation for the
rest of the choices available include
other harmony models that either rely
too much on smart phone control or don't
have the smart home features of the
elite and don't add enough to justify
the cost over the 650 there's also a
newcomer called the raised super remote
which blends a smartphone like design
with smart home control but the REA
doesn't have as expansive of a selection
of smart home controls as the elite and
it's mostly touchscreen design left me
wanting for physical buttons either way
whether you go all in with a Harmony
elite or keep it simple with a harmony
650 there's really no need to be
juggling a bunch of remotes anymore</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
