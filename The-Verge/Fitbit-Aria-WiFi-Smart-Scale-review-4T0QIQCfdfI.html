verge and this is the Aria Wi-Fi scale
from Fitbit the company behind the
wearable Fitbit ultra activity and sleep
tracking device are reviewed in October
Aria can automatically recognize up to
eight members of the same household and
as the name suggests uses your home 802
11 B or G Wi-Fi network to automatically
synchronize your weight data to the
Fitbit comm website and free iOS or
Android apps
it'll also measure your body mass index
in order to show a healthy weight for
your particular height the glass surface
even plays host to a series of
electrodes that shoot a small current of
one leg and down the other in order to
measure body impedance as gruesome as
that sounds the result is a reasonably
accurate assessment of your body's fat
percentage in lean mass composition
naturally this only works when standing
barefoot in order to make good contact
with the electrodes don't worry the
signal is safe even for pregnant women
although Fitbit does warn that it's not
suitable for anyone fitted with a
pacemaker as with the Fitbit ultra
tracking the minutiae of your body
composition becomes a game egged on by
fitbit's quirky badges goals and ability
to expose your data to friends and
strangers alike on a variety of social
media platforms while the Aria can be
used separately from the Fitbit ultra
combined they provide a comprehensive
view into your overall health that could
motivate some into leading a more active
and healthy lifestyle priced at $129.95
only the morbidly self obsessed or those
under direct doctor's order would
consider re a bargain that's more than
twice the price of standalone scales
offering a similar suite of body
composition measurements
