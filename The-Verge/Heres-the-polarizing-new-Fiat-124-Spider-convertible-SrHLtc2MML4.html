stand where behind me we have the Fiat
124 spider hate it love it everyone has
an opinion about this car it's actually
harkens back to 1966 when Fiat
introduced the first spider in Italy
last summer we saw the introduction of
the Mazda Miata today Fiat introduced
the new Spyder so what are the specs on
this car
some have yet to be revealed like we
don't know zero to sixty but we do know
it has a 1.4 liter turbo engine which
will definitely give it the extra power
it needs to move this small little car
across the great American freeways I'm
happy to see cars that actually make me
feel something it's been a long time
since we've seen a spider on the road
since 1985 but here we are 30 years
later and we have a new spider
convertible a lot has changed in the
world since then but some things don't
cheese and that's the love of beautiful
design or polarizing design or ugly
design you be the judge I'm just
relieved that we have cars that make us
feel something small cars that are
efficient that create a sense of
wanderlust similar to what the Mazda
Miata is done
some people are me out of fans some
people tend to go italiano you be the
judge my vote goes for Team Fiat I
happen to like the architecture and
there's a certain form language in the
body it's like the squarish roundish
effect that if you noticed if you look
at the front of the hood there's some
presence there but yet we see some soft
angles to that kind of create a nice
balance in the form language we don't
see this on every car today and I think
that's important personally I just can't
wait for summer to come to drop the top</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
