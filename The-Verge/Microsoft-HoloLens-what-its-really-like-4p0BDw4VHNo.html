company's augmented reality headset we
saw early versions of this last year but
now it's more than a prototype this week
it started shipping to developers and
commercial customers who have paid three
thousand dollars to experience the AR
headset and all of its glory but what's
it really like to wear it I'm Lauren
good reporting for The Verge and this
over here on my right is my colleague
Tom Warren if you have followed the
verge of stories about Microsoft you
probably know who Tom is this is the
main event the hololens itself so it's
definitely not unobtrusive but
considering its size it's actually
pretty lightweight you put it on by
fitting this interior band around your
head and then you use this twisty dial
in the back to just to fit it can either
rest on your nose or just above it air
tapping is how you select things when
you're gazing at all of the virtual
stuff in the world around you there's
also a hand gesture called the bloom
that tells the computer to go back to
the Start menu so yeah this thing is an
entire computer on your head it runs on
Windows 10 which means that in addition
to hololens specific apps you can do
just normal stuff to like browse the web
you can see how the air tapping becomes
more than just a select function in a
game like Robo raid which Tom played for
a while the other day while wearing
hololens so you tap to place it on the
wall and it's going to scan your
environment you walk around and it will
scan them so you can see it pulsating
off the walls over there
this makes the best use I think of the
spatial sound that you can hear in the
headset so you can hear stuff when it's
attacking you from behind so there you
go
basically you air tap and you shoot at
these little robots here you can also
air tap your way through holo studio
which is in all seriousness a
holographic app for making other
holographic apps
but if you're not into making apps you
can do stuff like make a Skype call to
the verge office back in New York
say hi Neil I Clara you say this is um
this is Tom Warren uh he's he's
currently talking to us on the hololens
oh wow
dancing what he seems yeah this is crazy
so what you're really experiencing with
hololens is mixed reality some stuff is
real some stuff is not unlike a big
all-encompassing VR headset like oculus
rift you can still see some of the
things around you while you're browsing
the web or playing games things like
walls or chairs or this table it also
feels slightly less dangerous than a VR
headset because you actually have
spatial recognition and a sense of depth
so you know maybe you won't hurt
yourself trying to lean on an imaginary
desk but the way it's built also means
that it's way less immersive than
Microsoft has promised it to be it's
like the difference between looking at a
projection of stars on your wall versus
sitting in the middle of a pitch-black
planetarium the graphics you've been
watching in this video are the video
outputs we got from Microsoft but when
you're actually wearing it the field of
view is limited and that probably won't
change once Microsoft ships this to
consumers so we had some fun with this
new version of hololens it's clear that
Microsoft envisions this initially as
something that will be used mostly for
enterprise applications and in education
and gaming too what it will mean for the
consumer market is still really a big
unknown and Microsoft is hoping that app
developers might help shape that it's
definitely improved from the hololens
prototypes we've worn before and the
experience of using it is way cooler
than what it physically looks like but
it is still a headset on your head and
as cool as it is it's a relief to take
it off and return to the real world
after a while
what should I read on the verge today we
have 34 new articles so far this morning
Neal I must be so happy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
