sitting here with the ford CEO alan
mulally and the CTO of the company Paul
Mascarenas they say that right perfect
okay got it I've been I've been
practicing that 45 minutes straight and
got it and I'm excited to have you guys
here first up because we usually don't
sit down with the with men of your
stature I mean CEO and CTO Ford that's
mean I could really affect the outcome
of a great American right depending on
what I say if I suggest something really
great to you or really terrible but
we're at CES 2012 and you guys are here
what are you here talking about why are
you here why have you come from Detroit
to be to be in in Las Vegas well first
of all josh is good to see you again and
it really is need to be here this is our
fifth year being invited to the Consumer
Electronics Show and remember that we
have been carved the cccs both were the
focus and also with the Taurus and now
today we just revealed to the public for
the very first time the new ford fusion
hybrid vehicle and what's really neat
about that is the electronics but also
the integration of sync and MyFord and
the applications go with that to allow
each of us to now have an integrated
life with our electric vehicles and the
response has been really really neat
yeah and and so you've got you know
you've got a number of announcements and
stuff that you're talking about right
now you know you're doing sink tell me
about sink and why it's important to you
what is the what is the thinking behind
it and and and and and how is it how is
it changing the way that you guys are
doing what you do with your car is what
you build them knowing about I might
introduce it and Paul has great
perspective too but we took a point of
view about six years ago that the the
automobile was going to be a mobile
application we could see where the
digital technology was going we could
see what the entertainment was going the
software associated with the safety
features with fuel economy it was going
to be a mobile app so we initially
started with Microsoft and built a
baseline automobile
platform and then we added my Ford and
on it and different applications then
especially we want to focus on on
keeping your eyes on the road and your
hands on the wheel so we went to voice
activation member was relatively new
yeah maybe 100 commands at the time but
we knew that if you could seamlessly
connect each of us and our smart devices
to the internet but also do it safely
that that would be not only a reason to
buy a ford vehicle but it would be a
want to buy a ford vehicle and so that's
the way we started we've been improving
that capability over time and now nearly
fifty percent of all people to buy a
ford vehicle by sync and MyFord and once
they've operated seventy-four percent
recommended to their friends and would
only get their next car if it has it so
you're saying fifty percent of people
who go into a dealer they say I'm buying
a car you can get sync do you wanted
they say all right I'll take absolutely
so that's not actually tillable as well
they said they say sync my foot touch
was a reason that I bought that we come
in so we look at it as a reason to buy
and just to give you a doctor point
we've sold over 4 million vehicles
already equipped with with sink so you
know we've talked about the
democratization of technology which is a
term we like the vehicle is the ultimate
mobile device right so being able to
bring this really affordable technology
to millions of customers around the
world is part of vision yeah and and and
you're doing I mean you've got speech
recognition technology in there that's a
tough one to crack I mean it's tough to
get a computer to really recognize what
you're saying what kind of innovation
are you doing in that in that space I
mean that seems like it would be a big
focus I mean are there partnerships or
technologies that you're looking at or
that you're using right now that you
think of articulate yeah great great
question and of course the vehicle
itself is a challenging environment the
voice recognition anyway because you've
got a lot of background noise so a
couple of things one is partnering with
the very very best in the industry so
our partner nuance developing the voice
engine and continuing to upgrade and as
they bring in improvements we can
introduce those into our vehicle with
software upgrades right as we're doing
right now with a my fault touch the
second thing is just some things that we
do inside the vehicle itself so
directionality of the microphones for
example correct positioning really
making sure that's very focused on
driver but it really comes down to just
partnering with the best in the industry
right and people like Microsoft people
like new on some of the app developers
that we want to quit so you know sink
has the the kind of growth of these
types of products and cars has
dovetailed with a pretty trying time for
the audio industry here in America do
you feel in any way that I mean we're
starting to see a ton of technology come
to vehicles I mean cars are obviously a
very advanced piece of technology but
also a very old piece of technology and
in the grand scheme of what weird what
you know this team deals with day to day
has do you feel like zinc has given you
an edge in terms of revitalizing or kind
of reshaping what for it is over for the
you know the last year absolutely you
know we we really five or six years ago
we really tried to come to a point of
view about what customers would really
value really value and pay for and want
and that came down to four major things
one is quality they want the most
fuel-efficient vehicle they want the
safest vehicle but they also want to be
connected seamlessly to the Internet and
the reason that we chose to not embed
the capability in the vehicle is because
we wanted to move with the consumer
electronic speed you to have one
integrated life the same the same my
communication devices you use outside
the car you use inside the car then we
add our value by managing the interface
with the voice recognition and the
interface with all the vehicle systems
and the response to that has been
tremendous it's a reason to buy ford has
been leading that and which is also the
reason that we were I think been so
successful at consumer electronics
because we're partnering with we kept an
open architecture we're partnering with
everybody and I bring these applications
in but the neatest thing to your point
as we move to more and more electrified
vehicles then all of a sudden you have a
wonderful convergence of the digital
technology both on the vehicle and the
electrical application but also with how
do you mean is your car I'm saying to
come party your last you know not just
about navigation it's about you at the
car we're going to charge it now
the charging station what's the right
time to charge it so you run all those
applications on your smartphone
transferring that information to the car
so you now have just one integrated life
reckon it becomes if I could just build
them that becomes an experience so the
technologies that we're putting in our
vehicles are an enabler to an ownership
experience with their vehicle whether
its connectivity whether it's the safety
technologies that we put in the car the
fuel efficient technologies and you know
as we create this experience for our
customer clearly very relevant value
affordable but at the same time is
differentiating our vehicles which i
think is what you're asking you
differentiating our vehicles from app
competitors and probably the most
important thing redefining our image and
reputation as a company that's right you
know me and and I think it has done
being a part of cs and see but in the
other and you've got people coming into
your product from a completely different
angle right you're starting from
technology to then lower the vehicle so
so you've got the fusion which is a
hybrid yep how important is is how
important our hybrids to forward moving
forward and beyond that electric
vehicles and you know when then what's
after that I mean obviously well just
I'll let you answer that one well I that
it starts fall first of all with a point
of view about where the world's going
and we expect a fuel efficiency we
really believe like I think most people
that we all are going to pay more for
energy going forward so what we have
found now is energy prices moved up is
that fuel efficiency is a reason to buy
it's one of the top reason to buy a
vehicle and it's interesting josh
because whether you're in a fiesta sized
vehicle or if you're in an f150 vehicle
the consumer wants the best fuel
efficiency in that vehicle in that big
old class so every everything we have
been doing is what can we bring to
technology to continuously improve a lot
of room to improve the internal
combustion engine a direct fuel
injection turbocharging lightweight
materials aerodynamics integrated
electronics all a significant
improvement in the internal combustion
engine then we see alternative fuels
like biofuels and ethanol so we make our
vehicles compatible with that and then
to your point the electrification and
ford strategy is so different because we
are making just separate electrical
demonstrators we actually electrified
the entire platform so like the focus or
the fusion you can get a petrol you can
get a diesel you can get a hybrid you
can get a plug-in hybrid with a bigger
battery where you can get an
all-electric vehicle with no internal
combustion engine and the neatest thing
about our strategy is that we build them
on the same production line most of the
parts are the same and with our scale
now we can offer these vehicles to the
consumer more affordably than anybody
else so you can imagine the coming
together of that technology with the
sync and MyFord and be able to operate
the vehicle as an ecosystem but do you
see that the internal combustion engine
can tell me you think that has
technology to keep investing in in terms
of absolute interms of refining the
basically the type of car we've known
for since cars absolutely and the
improvement is dramatic that our turbo
charging direct fuel injection today
increases the fuel efficiency by thirty
percent reduce the co2 by nearly twenty
percent but that it's all going to be
about the economics because we need to
continue to make breakthroughs on the
batteries we have lithium ion batteries
today but these batters can wave four or
five hundred pounds that can cost ten to
twelve thousand dollars right so the
widespread adoption of this technology
is going to be based on getting the
economics to be more compelling that's
why we want to use our scale to be able
to provide a more affordably so when
when do we get to the point where the
internal combustion engine is we're not
using anymore where do you see I mean
it's got to be a point where we say
fossil fuels or at least that particular
one particular type is where we're
cutting ourselves off from it how far
down there so this is a great question
in the way with officer a global company
with serving markets all around the
world the different for example Europe
is North America why more mature in
terms of technology infrastructure to
support electrification than some of the
emerging markets so when we look at it
you know there's years and years and
years of development ahead for the
internal combustion engine as we know it
today whether it's the fuel efficient
gasoline engines ecoboost direct
injection turbocharged the high
efficiency Diesel's that are the very
popular in Europe so our strategy is to
have a full range of efficient power
trains and we're calling that strategy
the power of choice and more the power
of choice means is let the customer
choose what is the most appropriate
power train for their lifestyle right
and their needs for a customer in a city
center very short commutes and so
electric vehicle could be the absolute
perfect choice yeah and you think that
do you think that'll that adoption will
happen let's say here in America enemy
not everywhere but it's got to start
happening somewhere but doesn't today is
a very small percent of our total sales
is increasing you know by the end of the
decade we could see ten fifteen percent
of our vehicles being electrified using
one of those technologies whether it's a
mild hybrid stop-start a conventional
hybrid when we're talking earlier Alan
mentioned the fusion yeah we have two
hybrids infusion we have a conventional
hybrid and we have a plug-in hybrid so
again depending on your usage and the
type of driving style you pick the
engine the best suits your needs a power
of choice again and and then with those
and I know you guys have to go so I'll
just wrap it up but with those vehicles
if they're utilizing electric in any way
sink is is plugging i means playing into
that that's oh absolutely that's part of
the sink universe now is the controls if
it's at a whole ecosystem where yeah we
had the mobile application you're you
can deal with your vehicle we came
outside the vehicle you can check and
see what you're charging is what your
routes going to be so it's almost like
an application to manage your life right
alright last question what kind of car
do you drive I Drive a different vehicle
every night really either a ford vehicle
josh or a competitor's vehicle because
we made a commitment to the consumer
five years ago that every vehicle that
we made was going to be best in class
and so we drive them to actually know
where are you guys your own vehicles and
the competitors now do you have to say
you also drive the competitors vehicle
do it is that it's part of the business
we've drawn vehicles which I have a
weekend a weekend preference I do well
that's my mistake that's that's very
very and my taurus i thank so much thank
you so much really read a venir
you thanks thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
