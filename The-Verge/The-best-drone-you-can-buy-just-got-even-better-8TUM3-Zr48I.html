car or staring downrange with a loaded
gun in your hands the best drones always
give you a little scare a thrill at the
power in your grasp I could see that
look in the eyes of everyone who flew
the new DJI phantom 3 it's a delicious
combination of fear and excitement as
they realize just how fast this thing
can move and then a few seconds later
that they weren't going to lose control
the DJI phantom has been our favorite
model of drones since we started testing
these aerial robots at the verge last
summer if you were going to glance
quickly at this latest model and even
give it a quick spin you would find it's
nearly indistinguishable from previous
incarnations but under the hood it's got
a slew of improvements that ensure the
best has gotten even better the first
thing you'll notice when you fire up the
Phantom 3 is how rock-solid it is while
hovering take your hand off the controls
and it will sit almost completely still
even in light wind the video produces
looks like it's being shot on a
stationary tripod even when you're a
thousand feet in the air the positioning
system now uses both gps and glonass a
Russian satellite network I've had
accidents in the past when mid-flight I
lost my GPS signal and thus the ability
to hold my position compared to my
experience with prior phantoms the p3
found more satellites and it found them
faster that translated to incredibly
stable and reliable flying
the camera on the new phantom is also a
big upgrade over its predecessors I got
a lot of terrific 4k footage while
shooting outdoors and varying kinds of
light you can easily change your ISO and
shutter settings on the fly with the app
I did find that the rotors and legs of
the drone occasionally intruded into the
frame and while you can tilt 90 degrees
up and down from shooting straight ahead
to directly below
I found that tilting the camera
sometimes produced a subtle digital
distortion in the video in my last drone
review I criticized parrots bebop for
producing strange stilted footage when
panning left and right but the Phantom 3
had the same issue I think this may be a
category wide problem all the effort
that goes into stabilizing the camera
during flight produces an unpleasant
artificial look when you're simply
panning horizontally fixing it would
require building and what people in the
film business call easing of course
shooting video works best when you can
see what you're capturing one of the
major technical differences in the new
phantom is that DJI built its light
bridge digital video downlink directly
into the drone this used to be a $1400
accessory but incredibly is now standard
on a $1,250 drone the range of my video
link varied sometimes I cut out at
around 1,200 feet once I was able to get
a high-res video stream from my phantom
at 4,500 feet about 3/4 of a mile before
the signal started to get choppy and cut
out the unit still responded to the
flight controller without any issues but
I never ventured far beyond that to test
its maximum range
I'm not comfortable flying without a
visual in videos posted online
phantom threes are shown operating an
even streaming video at roughly 3 miles
but I never got results that good
the battery on the new phantom routinely
lasted me 20 minutes or more for charge
which is great for drone of this size
and price the app also provides a very
helpful status bar showing exactly how
many minutes of flight time you have
left and when you're approaching the
point where you won't have enough
battery for the automatic return to home
feature to function the p3 has one
button takeoff and landing both of which
worked well you can have it return home
to the spot where it took off or have
the home point correspond to the
controller and thus hopefully the pilot
in my testing the Phantom 3 usually
landed about 45 feet from the home
beacon the autonomous landing is aided
by a new feature for the Phantom line a
downward facing camera that first
appeared on the more expensive DJI
inspire 1 this also provides a visual
positioning system that can keep the
drone stable and flying indoors where
satellite signals can't reach while the
drone can land itself
I found that most often I was just
catching it at about eye level and then
powering it off to avoid any chance of
dust or debris kicked up by the rotors
getting into the motors it's a sign of
how much I trusted stability that this
seemed like the best option I know
you're thinking I might end up like
Enrique but at least I'm the one
controlling the drone being manhandled
there were some small issues that came
up repeatedly during my testing I found
the internal storage and app a little
finicky the Phantom 3 comes with a 16
gigabyte microSD card you can view and
delete these video files from inside the
app but I found that the app was often
confused about whether or not a file
have been deleted and seemed
increasingly unable to free up storage
space until I reformatted the SD card
completely as with all drones whenever
you head to a new location it's a good
idea to calibrate the compass with the
Phantom 3 this was sometimes a simple
process but other times it required me
to repeat the ridiculous compass dance
several times this may or may not have
something to do with the magnet in my
finger but I had the same issues even
when using the other hand last but not
least the Phantom 3 has the ability to
livestream video straight to YouTube
this works well when you have a great
Wi-Fi connection less well over LTE
there's always a few second delay
between the action in the video but the
sync between the audio and the video is
strong so it feels live to the audience
as a journalist I can think of tons of
amazing applications for this new
feature although it's less clear how
useful it is for the average hob
maybe a bird's-eye view of your kids
soccer game broadcast live for family
across the world to see so yeah the new
phantom is awesome it took all the
things that were good about the original
and improved on them while layering on
new hardware and software features that
let you do things that simply aren't
possible in most consumer drums overall
it's combination of price power and ease
of use means the Phantom 3 is still far
and away the drone I would recommend to
anyone looking to get into the Hobby and
even to professionals who are on a tight
budget</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
