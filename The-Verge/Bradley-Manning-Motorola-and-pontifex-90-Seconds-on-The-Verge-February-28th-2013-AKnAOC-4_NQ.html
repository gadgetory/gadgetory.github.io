Patel and I'm in a glass cage please
send help this is 90 seconds on the
verge brought to you by motorola bradley
manning has pleaded guilty to leaking
classified documents to Wikileaks the US
Army private was a source behind the
release of various intelligent memos
detainee files and video and now faces
up to 20 years in prison for his actions
however Manning also pleaded not guilty
to 12 additional charges including
aiding the enemy reading from a
statement Manning said quote I felt I
accomplished something that would allow
me to have a clear conscience google
owns motorola mobility that doesn't mean
it's in love with the company's products
Google CFO Patrick Pichette said today
that the company inherited an 18-month
pipeline of products when it acquired
motorola and described the devices as
quote fine but not really to the
standards that what Google would say is
wow so when will we see some wow were
thee devices from Motorola who will
acquire the company in May of 2012
that's about nine months ago so soon it
should be soon I think it's in and
lastly pope benedict the sixteen has
left Twitter today the pontiff thanked
his supporters with one final tweet from
the @pontifex account before formally
stepping down from his post the Vatican
has since deleted all the Pope's tweets
and archive them off site leaving a
clean slate on the Pontifex account
should the presumably young hip new pope
also want to tweet instead of using say
snapchat that's it for today's top
stories stay tuned for an important
announcement from your local affiliate</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
