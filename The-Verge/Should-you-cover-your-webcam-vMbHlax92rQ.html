webcams but should you cover your webcam
former FBI director James Comey thinks
you should you still have a piece of
tape over your cameras at home heck yeah
Edward Snowden and even Mark Zuckerberg
appear to cover theirs it could protect
you from attacks like the one Miss Teen
USA experienced in 2013 which events
secretly spied on her and recorded her
and then blackmailed her but you're not
a head of state and you're also not a
celebrity so do you really need to worry
about someone spying on you through your
laptop's camera
well yeah in 2013 a hacker told the BBC
that access to a woman's webcam cost
about a dollar and that he had access to
500 computers that's crazy
so to find out how common these attacks
are and whether we should be worried I
talked to Todd Beardsley the research
director at cybersecurity and
penetration testing company of rapid7
there are only bugs in web-based
technologies that allow attackers to
open your webcam and record video on it
they're pretty far far and few in
between he explained to me that these
vulnerabilities often show up in flash
and Java and at this point there might
even be one in html5 what really sucks
is that you won't know if a website is
affected also hackers can turn off your
webcams of light so you won't actually
know whether you've been compromised
that's not great anything that wants you
to like click in a very specific space
in your browser like that would be very
suspect you see a lot more now with like
location services it's like click here
to allow application service we're like
that's typically the control well
there's not a lot you can do about it
other than state ok so at least tape
will stop someone from spying on you
visually that's a relief but how
effective is covering our webcams and
should we do it having a cover isn't
it's a super cheap super easy thing to
do that also doesn't get you a lot but
at least it makes you feel better right
and it is a signal to other people that
you think about security okay so Todd
says it can't hurt but hovering your
laptop camera
and actually address the much bigger
risk of your cell phone camera and
microphone microphone hacking is
probably just as creepy and
incriminating as a video conversations
you know that piece of tape stop we
actually tested this Hey
okay so can you try to talk to me with
your phone away from your face okay so I
can hear you pretty perfectly meaning if
a hacker had hacked into your microphone
even if you had tape over it he or she
would still be able to hear what you're
saying
hate to break it to you all but the
reality is that cameras and microphones
are everywhere now we have smart home
speakers cell phones laptops smart
refrigerators and even voice enabled TV
remotes listening to us at all times
unless you're going to tape over or
physically disabled every one of those
cameras or microphones you're still
going to be at risk but if nothing else
we can at least prevent webcam attacks
with tape there is some superstitious
comfort you get because you can see the
camera sticker all the time like you're
looking at it you can think like I'm
doing it right it's a little bit soft to
put the tape on the camera but but it
does ultimately like also means that
you're looking at security control all
the time so you might be thinking more
about like how long should my password
be should I tell these people to play
house which I click on this link and I
think that is probably so go ahead put
tape over your camera it might not stop
hackers from listening through your
microphone but it'll at least make us
feel a little bit better and prevent
them from watching us sleep at night
