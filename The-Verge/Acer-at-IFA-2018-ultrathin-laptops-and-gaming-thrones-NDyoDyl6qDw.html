here at Aoife 2018 at Acer where they've
just announced a whole bunch of new
products at the press conference there's
the new Swift five there's the Swift
seven the fitness laptop in the world
there's this ridiculous predator throw
nose gaming chair there's a convertible
predator triton 900 two-in-one gaming
laptop the predator X this giant gaming
Tower the problem is is that while a lot
of this stuff is super cool and super
interesting what if it just isn't
actually here so yeah Acer announced a
lot of cool products and yes some of
them are actually here and we'll get
into those but most of them aren't and
that's kind of a habbit phrase for these
days for example take the swift v in May
2018 earlier this year Acer announced
the Swift v taking the 14-inch Swift v
screen replacing with a 15.6 inch one
for would be the lightest 15-inch laptop
around and it was pretty cool at the
time but they didn't actually have a
working one there in May just a dummy
prototype unit so here at Aoife in
august 2018 they've got a working swiss
v and it looks good the screen looks
great
it's got Intel's latest whiskey like
processors plenty of RAM feels a little
cheap but I guess that's a sacrifice you
make when you're making a superlight
laptop but the problem is that it took
months to get to this point where it's
even here and real it's gonna be months
more before you'll actually be able to
buy one November for Europe and January
2019 in the US next up is the chair
that's behind me Acer's predator throw
knows this is a completely ridiculous
device it's a 485 pound gaming chair
it's got a mechanical arm that can
support up to 327 inch screens just
encompass your entire field of vision
it has motorized foot rest it has a
motorized foot pedal in case you don't
want to use the motorized foot rest the
keyboard swings out you sit down in this
and it just in cases you like a cage of
gaming joy I actually got to try it out
for a few minutes here and I love it
it's just completely ridiculous in the
best kind of way so just hit this button
oh my god oh my god it's it's eating me
goodbye everyone I live here now okay
that's really cool you can like feel
each individual bullet shot because the
chair has haptic feedback I really like
to see more companies embrace this level
of ridiculousness and all their products
going forward I love it
the problem though is that it's here
it's great but there's no price and
there's no release date so we have no
idea how much it'll actually cost or
when you'll actually be able to buy one
which is about to become a really
recurring theme here it's a similar
story by Acer predator triton 900 it's a
new two-in-one convertible gaming laptop
that they just announced and it's here
at Aoife sort of they have one prototype
locked under a glass box that we've been
able to look at but we can't try it out
we have no idea how it works and it
looks pretty cool the screen flips
around you can adjust it you can move it
around so that it's in different places
and different angles for gaming but
there's no price there's no release date
there's no word on specifications and we
have no idea when you'll be able to buy
one it's a similar story by the predator
X which is a stirrers new gaming tower
it's supposed to be this ultra powerful
gaming desktop it has two of Intel Xeon
processors which are usually put in
servers and it also is here it's an
unmarked black box we can't see anything
running on it and we have again no idea
of price really estate or any of that
information and last there's Acer Swift
7 now Acer showed this off at its
keynote on stage in a slide they
showcase the incredibly small bezel it
has a 92% screen to body ratio the
bezels are just over four millimeters
and it looks awesome
but that's all we can really say about
it because that's all ESR told us they
don't have even a prototype here that we
can see they haven't released any word
on specs there's no price release date
there's barely any information other
than a picture and that's where the
problem all this is really cool and it's
really cool to look at but right now
without any details it's hard for us to
even get an idea of what these products
are gonna be like when they come out in
months or even years
with all that said though it is still
really fun just to see that acer is
willing to take these risks and make
these innovative products even if all we
can really do is see them and not
actually try them out here at Aoife and
who knows
there's always CES ok time with Virg I'm
hearing Aoife 2018 at acer and there is
a loud banging noise there's no release
date we have no idea when you'll be able
to pick one up or how much it'll cost
when you did when you will when it does</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
