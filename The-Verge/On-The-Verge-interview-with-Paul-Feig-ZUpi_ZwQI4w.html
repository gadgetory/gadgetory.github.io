delightful or so I'm told Paul Feig here
good you and I can borrow I you know
it's actually I had a pen I'm sorry a
moments ago I know well now it's gone
forever like that I like that you go in
on the attack yeah throwing on see
exactly that's a technique yep Howard
and I lay back that's it now you have
control right this is right I'm now in
the catbird seat why I don't appreciate
that oh yes sir you're a man of many
talents mmm director yes sometimes I
producer actor occasionally a creator of
beloved television shows and other
exactly author yes true that I say yeah
I know my publisher would rival but but
to me the most interesting thing about
when I was reading about you and I did
several weeks of reading before I'm
sorry the most interesting thing is that
you were on you acted in the first
season of sabrina the teenage witch
certainly did and you played a character
can you tell me about your character I
was the biology teacher mr. Poole and
they asked me what would you like your
first name to be and because i'm a
comedy genius i said gene so I was dr.
gene pool they actually went so they
went for it see what year what your
resist this is a 1997 this is melissa
joan hart yes played a teenage witch yes
she did named Sabrina Sabrina and you
were her biology teacher you she was in
high school yeah yes right he was cousin
there's a talking cat on the show oh
that's right voiced by a nick bakay
afenifere comedy aficionados I don't
know Nick one of the funniest men
arounds also has voice a cat on Sabrina
well there you go so how could you not
be so tell me about that experience I
mean first off were you was this a dream
of yours had you been thinking yes I
want to get on the Sabrina the tester
breed of the teenage witch is not was
originally a film right it knows a comic
strip I was a comic comic book okay okay
a graphic novel the kids call it these I
don't think it was another Greta graphic
Robin almost like it would be a
compilation process or a storyline
I'm just a graphite no but you and
that's the kind of joke see the heat but
how did that happen and can you tell me
a little about your experience I mean in
a skirmish orangish ownership it was not
kind of a Jojo was it you know it's you
know I was an actor I'd been on I've
been a regular in like four other TV
series that all got cancelled in their
in their first season Dirty Dancing the
TV series no that didn't exist it did
you were in you were in it yes you play
this way Z character and this of course
I can i play baby ya know I was ever
you're not old enough to remember this
but then you go well I don't know
because you're autiful looking man thank
you that's not totally uncalled do you
are but no they need to be like when
they would make like the the Partridge
Family cartoon of the Brady Bunch
cartoon and they'd always add like a
dancing panda or like a singing bird and
that was me on the show cuz I was a
character that was not in the movie I
was you were enormous yes I was I should
have been a birth I was Norman the
comedian bellhop oh okay so you were
like I knew you were a new character I
was a highly licensable new super glue
what network was the dirty dancing show
that was on a CBS I believe ok how many
episodes oh how many do we go I think we
went 13 or 18 but I got this job that's
actually a lot of episodes well you know
I mean not for American television back
then but it was almost a full sees right
but it's the first time I they're gonna
be a regular on TV show and I got it and
then a writer's strike happened that
shut down the town for eight months so I
had a job you couldn't you couldn't
write they couldn't be like hey you know
how to relieve that are you you're on
the show it would have been processed
across it in a figure I would never do
that yes so so I SAT around and then it
finally came out dirty dancing yes not
Sabrina the teeny no no I'm feeling I'm
Craig is I'm not taking about I'm
actually far more interested in dirty
did you have to dance in it they tried
to get me to dance but I refused was he
refused to dance on the show no no there
was a scene like there's it like it was
Patrick Swayze and now that Patrick
Swayze was um Oh Patrick Cassidy failure
said Patrick Stewart knows Patrick
Cassidy plated the Melora Hardin who I
actually ended up moment years later I
directing on the office as cuz she was
Michaels a girlfriend okay
yeah but they were doing a sexy dance
and I they had a reaction shot of me in
the doorway and the directors like
pretend like you're into that you're
kind of dancing with them and getting
turned on I was like I'm not gonna do
yeah yeah I like to getting turned on
yeah no it's not to be like oh you're
not just dancing I just into the groove
you're actually sexually around one
either I'm dancing dirtily right okay
we're saying on theme you know was it
all dirty dancing the shoes I filthy
this network eight o'clock on this
Tuesday night they're like if is a clean
dance of this show we don't want to go
down we don't want a person so if
they're solo dancing it to be chummy
masturbatory ah so so that's a dirty Dan
see didn't work out right then there was
good sports with ryan o'neal and farrah
fawcett tell me about that yeah that was
a rhino Neal the the amazing and then
slightly wacky Ryan O'Neal a heavy is a
reality show with Ryan O'Neal's name oh
I think there is nine and Tatum oh let's
just say this that not that show was the
subject of a true Hollywood true a hot
behind the scenes whether that but the
scandal fill 10 some Verna no signs of
that company e true Hollywood story yeah
and they interviewed me about this show
about yes good sports oh it was a little
less volatile be supporting sports
themed yes what can you just give me a
basic outline it was Ryan O'Neal was a
former baseball star who was going to be
a commentator on this network I like the
setup and I was leash I was the guy in
charge of him but I was on goofy
character I see and then comedy
interested in baked it rose this is
again not has nothing to Sabrina really
no cursor button huh I'm what I'm
winding you through my I like resume no
no I like it the digression is
incredible exactly saying we're gonna
get back to like your birth oh no time
is good that was caught on film
you actually auditioned your audition oh
yes I almost I almost lost the part but
uh but uh yeah so you were the biology
he was a biology teacher yeah I let's
just move on gags ah cares about that so
do tell me you've done all this stuff
your preference is there one thing that
you love more than all the others oh
dude to do in terms of like acting
director I like you're producing you
like to wreck a bass I gotta push people
around can you see yourself just being a
director just in forever until you yeah
so you don't oh yeah I mean I was right
and I get them very well in the writing
and some things I actually write myself
and other things are you hired your have
these amazing writers I work with right
I like it it's is an actor I was very
limited let's just say i only get so
many skills in the director is really
the boss yeah you're in movie making
depo right you are the main story teller
and TV you're sort of the facilitator of
the writers write these great scripts
and you can make it better but you also
when they say like no I wanted this way
then you go okay that's fine is there
any person when you're a director that
you can't tell what to do uh sighs like
the pricing the producers web in the
studio when oh yeah I mean here you are
as a movie director York occasionally
fighting everybody I was looking on the
last two ones i did that everybody was
pretty cool but um no I've fought some
period victories in my time ya Yin just
didn't know you win and you're like well
nobody hates me yeah it was all worth it
to get him in a red shirt so so director
would be your preference yes you'd like
to die directing yes but not anytime
soon he's the scene ends and they look
back and there's a skeleton hanging on
yes sitting at the director's chair I'm
run over by a crane and they go he
wouldn't want to go that's how that's
yeah I never I say he would have wanted
to go that way i don't think i would
have wanted to go whatever way they
think i would have why we gonna go just
quietly in my bed yes not like in the
like dick Shawn remembered the comedian
dick Shawn no oh I'm so long dick shots
that's like a made-up person enough okay
it's a madman when the beginning of a
joke man you guys dick Shawn the track
but he died on stage performing and he
was a funny guy neither one man show and
so he did the money collapsed on stage
and people were laughing for Loretta red
fox this isn't with red fox no didn't
really I think he had a you know yet cuz
this thing was ongoing oh oh no you look
like another big one oh I Denny d
I think he actually this could be a
connection I might be propagating an
urban legend did you die eating pop
rocks no he can't pop rocks and soda and
then that he was doing his bit right and
they died in Vietnam that's right you
grew up in in that's very good you grew
up in the in the Midwest yes maybe it's
Michigan in the Midwest it's tech I need
we say Midwest well that doesn't that
doesn't feel Midway all of we hipsters
on the to coast it's basically like it's
you know la the Midwest and then New
York so it all falls into there but I
think mission is very Midwestern there's
a mythbuster and Sensibility I guess I'm
not cowboys and we're not you know no
Michigan Cowboys well ago there's
million milligan milk it hello where I'm
from there's Michigan militia oh yeah
that right fast those are people who are
preparing for the to fight the
government in the game the hammer comes
down yeah exact you do any of the names
than militias there no I don't cuz I'm
afraid know anything about them you
don't want to get 20 bone again oh you
want to research that money on the
internet I got a weird tweet from the
Westboro Baptist yeah something like to
me like watch my clip or something's
like why am I me and I went to see if it
like a mass emailing no it was just me
so wait a second somebody i order says
he'll pay for the Westboro Baptist
Church there was something i invested
some on twitter is something you they
considered liberal or pro-gay and
something and then i got this thing it
felt a little like well the Westboro
Baptist Church they're awful people yes
exactly i mean they're just the worst
yeah i mean it couldn't be worse yeah
and yet they tweeted they're tweeting
they retweeted you know they tweeted and
I would've ridgeway me see the heat it
stands for to everything is that the
Westboro Church represent their awful
people they love that turd joke so that
would serve that they're weirdly there
weirdly open to ask at humor yeah well
do anyway you know there's nothing I
Hitler was a nice painter Hitler was a
vegetarian he goes I don't one of us he
was it I don't think he was very good
pain no he was also nice to his dogs get
to see well that's what you hear yeah it
wasn't all back so someone should've put
s him that's where had it that will edit
that out that's gonna complement of here
that's about the ultimate publicist who
handles Hitler and get some good press I
know that's the ones right
you hear he was a vegetarian and yeah
and he was nice whose dogs there you go
that house of lies get that gun I don't
mean that going for him there so you
grew up in the middle I want to continue
IDK you grew up in Michigan yes uh tell
me about was it a middle-class kind of
like very American wearing a collar my
dad on an army surplus store so that's
awesome it was cold you have a ton of
amazing army gear when you were good I I
got to play with it all I mean that was
like the store was my my playground but
also it was it was hell on earth because
at the age of five my father made me
work at his store really so I was like I
was child labor that's illegal it is
illegal and he made me work I had an
entire career before I was 18 and this
was in an era when this is so long ago
but this was in a narrow way I know an
army-navy store would be or an army
surplus store you can actually get
really dangerous stuff there right Oh
like now they've been neutered somewhat
you can get like a camouflage jacket
well it's all kind of gone but this is
the day I mean they kind of coming out
of Vietnam yeah look at me been in the
eighties you could go in and get oh yeah
grenades and yeah imagine you should get
in the 70s it was all fresh from the arm
from there's like we're not using this
anymore yeah here's a here's a bazooka
my dad's old cop cover from what he was
in World War two hey is it a visible
it's a real weapon yeah it's it is I
said I my finger of its day okay if you
will okay listen you just didn't sound
real when I said it wasn't like you call
a weapon a bazooka and it does not sell
it sounds like something that people
came up with in the 40s when nobody knew
anything and then like what should we
call that no I don't bazooka breakfast
it makes a lotta Renly yeah if I was
gonna kill by something of a zucca
wouldn't be so what can we yell when we
shoot it how about bazooka so ah so it's
froak let's talk it so the reason I was
asking by your upbringing yes uh you
created the show Freaks and Geeks wildly
popular well now now you know let me
finish okay wildly popular now not
popular in its in its time mm-hmm how
many episodes did you did you get to do
18 of 18 episodes exactly the same as
dirty dancing uh I think there's a
connection here and I'm freaks and geeks
had a lot of dirty dancing on it good
they did behind the camera but buddy guy
who got cancelled yes but what it was on
NB NBC NBC we had the honor being the
most weeks the lowest rated show on NBC
right do you think but freak but it's
very beloved down yeah napa love that
 I was actually watching last night
I wanted to refresh it in my mind and
the thing that struck me most is that it
is in standard definition it does it is
dr. a bike for you and it is jarring
yeah you just keep thinking what's
happening no it's like watching
throughout you hold yes it is it's
incredible what we tolerated I know
during the freaks and geeks era I know I
hope they just stretch it so everybody
looks this is what horrible where we so
found it really aged badly uh you know
honest on that front I did a pilot not
that many years ago right before
letterbox took off and they were doing
things but we they wouldn't let us shoot
it they made a shoot on three by four
because they would occasionally get
letters from one or two guys who had
like a big screen TV and I got really
mad or no a small screen that they got
mad that it was you know they put the
bars untie so they felt they were being
ripped off from their entire to oh yeah
I know my father would rather watch yeah
he would rather watch them without the
oh yeah let the letterbox because he
feels he's getting more yeah even though
he's not right well you know he's old
he's older though hey can't really hold
that he gets it so so do you think but
do you think so TB has really changed
though since freaks and geeks yeah was
on the air and obviously people love it
obvious i mean i think a lot of people
consider to be one of the best shows
ever put on television it's nice let me
know it's a fact accepted do you think
it would if do you think that show would
have had a different story in this day
and age if it were on if NBC had that
show today I don't think it would have
because now the business model is kind
of if you get an entire season than you
know people will binge watch it right
when they might not necessarily watch
the first season so I think we were so
critically acclaimed at the bet we would
have at least got another half season
given the dvds kind of chance yeah yeah
but so does that does that make you feel
I mean obviously you're having
tremendous success in film yeah then
we'll talk about your film work in a
little bit nothing um several hours
later we're gonna get to you yeah I
still got the rest of my shows to go
yeah i know i was on a show called yeah
what do you have another show i was
before
whatever you say is going to be the
Jackie Thomas show was Tom Arnold's show
much Jackie Thomas the Jackie Thomas who
played a character named Jackie do yes
you did you did it was on after Roseanne
and we premiered it's the number two
highest rated show and we were cancelled
we were the 14th highest rated show so I
think what was the cancellation that
people didn't like Tom Arnold with it
really he was very much there something
going on with him and it just he had
married Roseanne Barr and she was the
most successful person and I love Tom
he's the greatest guy and he just was
unfairly accused we got cancelled and
then he had True Lies and suddenly
everybody left Tom are ya so that's
interesting it's called the feet once
again you guys luck here right there
before the time was right for tauriel
exactly but then and then I'm the launch
pad yeah you really are I'm the kindling
they gave lights you you did light your
rocket I'll be really you may for all we
know you may have kick-started all of
modern television its roots and geeks
yes well and you've read us very few of
the benefits none no no almost not know
but you have done a lot of TV you've
done a lot of directing yeah on TV
besides you're you're very deep acting
career which goes back several hundred
shows it certainly does haha failed and
weird shows um but you've directed a ton
of television yeah you've done you did
an episode of 30 rock more than one yeah
no just 1 30 rock what happened there
they didn't want you back oh you know
Alec go Alec Baldwin's at all yes and
yes exactly no it was fun a great on you
he leave nasty fine I believe the quote
was uh you got to knock it off with this
Truffaut man really yeah it's did
he say that said it but he was so you
have a real Lyta maneuver real be for
that we might even know I certainly do
this is real no I certainly do that i
love the man'll take action on a big to
trust me i know i don't know but sure
there is well those i've had action
taken on your beef oh oh god those jokes
the heat in theaters no heat isn't here
right now it is my trench i feel like i
don't know anything we're just glowing
okay it's good we'll edit that out yeah
oh so the more the office you did a ton
of episodes of the office yeah Arrested
Development yep another show really
killed in its prime
brought back to life yeah what's your
take on the new season you have not seen
it yet up its really up I've been out on
tour for four weeks I've got the scene
do you feel like were you left do you
feel you've been left out of the news is
of course that it's a dare they how do I
not use I've got a beef with oh yeah
gonna be with everybody know what I love
those guys I honestly I love those guys
so much yeah but you haven't bet you
haven't had time to watch this no no but
I will so you directed an episode of Mad
Men yes which is a very kind of a
departure for you yeah unless I'm
mistaken but you've done a lot of comedy
ya know Terry true i mean what in the
episodes from the first season yeah it
was the one where I call shoot where she
becomes a coke bottle and then she's
shooting at the birds the Navy she
agents she being Betty Draper Oh January
Jones yes okay yes I shouldn't I only
think there's Betty Draper and and did
they and what was the how did that come
about how to joined up and um he got
sent to me the pilot got sent to me and
I thought it was fantastic and Matt
Winer turned out he was a fan of freaks
and geeks and so he wanted me to do one
and they were very very nice and it was
fun I had a great time and that's where
I got to befriend ham and you know Jon
Hamm time John oh god I hate all my
family that's right I'm sure I never had
him before I was on this out of those
wonderful the sandwiches the canadian eh
eh but i do have great yes examine
everything that cast was so great yeah
it was fun there's lot fun do you but
how do you feel at me is drama something
that you're interested in as a no but i
but I face comedy as if it is drama you
always tried they have a dramatic
underpinning you should like be able to
be crying yes I do exactly with laughter
that's right but you know yeah you have
to have like a serious story and then
you make it funny and yeah but it but to
just tell like a turgeon's you know
story where he's crying it's like that's
not like life we all make jokes nah
maybe not your life well I don't just
wanna speak yeah seriously so so do you
do you have interest and creating new TV
shows I mean I mean you seems like there
would be some fertile ground there oh
yeah and now that that people agree that
that unions yeah freaks and geeks was
excellent I mean TV isn't the greatest
place that has ever been I think I think
we were honestly in a more of a golden
age that it was back when they called it
a golden age just think of all the shows
but it's also because of they are open
to the serialization of storytelling
right which i think is a better it's a
way to tell the story so nice
adik shows annoying yeah you know and
they're just not i know they're not as
exciting to work on because you're just
like reinventing the wheel every day you
have the same cast a chimeric Monster of
the Week yeah exactement yes well as the
x-files monster-of-the-week don't drive
my very annoying because I just want to
see the x-files story unfold oh well
have you ever seen the x-files no it's
about an FBI oh no I i have seen the XY
I thought you meant like there's I
thought it was a bigger the bigger so
bigger is like a movie that was here
total yes no I'd like this Gillian
Anderson yeah David you got be great
very funny guy actually he's great funny
in that show yeah I didn't work with him
I I'd like to maybe if it's funny a
funny sci-fi no yeah well I'm all would
you are you working on anything new for
television would you be interested if
we're developing a few things they are
oh you talk about them here of course
not can you just tell their age no I
will say there you will there is one
with a sci-fi been to it I like sci-fi
curly and I don't feel always been
enough sci-fi comedy I mean there there
was a recent attempt there was a show
that was about a fail at a family of
aliens that move to a neighborhood oh
that's right and people i took it was
called something like the family or I
want to be out now ders family sigh I
like these gears on family ties don't

space gender that would be actually
pretty good that would be awesome yeah
you're on Twitter yes I am now that's
gonna go a hard pivot rocks with man hey
I thought have been you're on Twitter
yes uh you have 1.3 million followers
it's like first up how did you get 1.3
million followers how does that happen I
got in early yeah I'll tell they give me
a pen I will tell you exactly I happen
but it can't happen again I'm afraid
because I came in early on it and rain
will I was working on the office Rainn
Wilson said hey way if you're gone
twitter I'll tell my followers so
immediately at seventh oh oh but what
happens they put me on this thing work
oh you are suggesting users list so
every day like every week I got thousand
more for a reviled person I know exact
winner I have suggester suggested users
list was a highly controversial I know
move on the party no time to benefit
which gave power to people like you hmm
who would probably abusing it oh no
totally so I man's up yeah
there's true though now you now have
incredible power you know pretty much
anything you oh yeah I can i huh so do
you see Twitter I mean there are people
who use Twitter as a comedy platform
guys like Rob Delaney for instance hoots
really made a career out of Twitter as a
platform for comedy do you see it that
way do you use it that way oh yeah
that's my favorite use for it i will
occasionally self-promote on it but i
don't like to do that i know guys you've
been doing a lot of heat promotion I
know a lot of you and I'm suffering for
it because you see the numbers dropping
but yeah but at the same time the
studio's like can you put it out there
but I it to me twitter is being a comedy
man yourself you always had the joke the
notebook that you carry around and you
write like funny thoughts I have a smart
iphone app on my smartphone well okay in
the old days yeah do carry notepad you
have a something not anymore no I used
you use your phone yeah okay yeah I know
yeah but but there is many years when i
had the pay give you write stuff in
there then you'd put it away you would
put anyway wow that's to go like i have
a funny thought to put it out of its why
do I actually right I have I do tend to
write down uh I'm gonna get I shouldn't
say this cuz it's a great idea but I'm
gonna tell you an idea i wrote down the
other day then right now and no I I
wrote down I did exactly what you're
talking about which is um I'll just say
what the idea is an unexplained at
Jewish terminator that's it and you can
just admit you just you just figure out
Jonas take it's not not violent okay and
I'd violet yeah I guess I should to
expand on that a little bit keeping out
the Terminator has a heads-up display
yes where he's evaluating what's going
on who interprets it in a marvel to
return the Terminator is Jewish yeah
that's it let's move on wow so so uh
were you when you were in I mean
obviously freaks and geeks at base off
we're going back to prefigure man oh
we're car be really 23 minutes into this
and feels like I'm so hot goodbye heat
stress and everything there's two of you
rises rap let's just wrap it oh I
my pants sorry
forgot to tell you here too yeah I know
I knew it we have that one thing what
happens but but but well this is sort of
related to the twitter stuff and sort of
the rise of nerd culture yes i mean i
think in some ways freaks and geeks is
now it now makes more sense because
people better understand nerd culture
and sort of geek culture which is really
risen to be the dominant force in
popular culture yeah when you look at
the movies that are the number one
movies right it's it's Superman and and
the Avengers and just real star trek
just incredibly nerdy stuff yeah that
even 10 years ago was was still sort of
breaking through no I mean I credit the
internet for all this stuff mean when I
back when I was a kid and you know we
got all our my geeky friends you always
felt like am I are we the only weirdos
out there that like this stuff and you
have no community the minute you have an
Internet you have this community that
empowers you like the weirdest stuff
you're into yeah there's a bunch of
people just suddenly like it seems not
only not that weird but kind of popular
oh don't know then you're cool doesn't
got this cool all of my weird sex stuff
oh yeah I thought I was the only what
yeah who knew you'd get you guys a
people huge gas man zang it like pick up
huh that's right oh you're your cop
brother how are you but I'd a look down
here by the couch give me a baggie and a
nice looking
there were lonely days hi that is good
stuff please stop being fun especially
just read more but but do you think that
freak sing but freaks and geeks
obviously was really it was really about
nerds I'm were you a nerd were you a
nerdy kid you know I mean I was geeky
but here's the thing we had like in our
school we had a few like nerely hard
corner DNT like the reality or know like
like carrying briefcases around there
looking scuttling does it doesn't
businessman well exactly Oh years ago
that they were they were wearing like
three piece suits and had a briefcase
I'm the date when I graduated I was
given a briefcase that was a graduation
that's an ox and a pen and pencil it's
an amazing graduation that we used to be
that was the worst that briefcase now
holding my iPad so yeah that makes a lot
of sense yeah but you weren't it you
weren't like I really know and we were
we were just kind of the group list
group you know we kind of were into
Warner Brothers cartoons a Monty Python
and we were too afraid of girls and so
we just kind of hold up their lunch
table I had the kind of Naruto oh no
yeah I'm not saying we weren't there
wasn't a nerdy you're a key nerd okay
not god I'm trusted I was hard no I
don't know I've just died it just seems
like that that that and there is
something about in your in your films as
well bridesmaids for instance you know
the the main character is sort of a
weird nerdy outcast in a lot of ways
yeah you know a doesn't who doesn't
really fit in yeah um I like you can't
even with even with her friends yeah I
did a lot of spiders in the awkward
that's something that we all are though
very few people even the cool people i
think don't feel like through that you
look very handsome people i think well
maybe not that very good-looking people
i think don't have I think there's a
fear of maybe when that starts to go off
the rails but it's not when not in their
prime right but then there's no they're
like they're like looking around and
going I'm not know cool no but then
imagine being very beautiful not that
you're not too very handsome man but
thank you Jeff but just shocking i think
all the time what if i were shockingly
beautiful how much easier with my life
babe I I would like to know and it's
like if I were a woman how many of my
life I didn't hear all these how much
harder so what all the supermodels are
always like I was such a nerd of
something I think it's a modern thing
yeah every talk show now somebody comes
on beautiful yes actress or model and
they go I was such a nerd in high
go I think that's become a blanket
statement I think the Nerds you're
talking about the guys the briefcases
and the D&amp;amp;D people the real nerds I
think if you put them side by side there
would be an astounding difference
between between the the real nerds a
fake nerves i really don't you even
suggest that to me that there's that's
not found thought I think that's good
I'm trying um so let's so listen and we
do need to wrap up but I want to talk a
little bit about I just mostly be get
the era and here i want to keep I could
keep going to sweat but I do want to
talk a little bit about because you do
have a film mmm that you're now
promoting aside me you haven't promoted
it except for the couple of times during
this interview yeah islands at once oh
but the heat yes tell me just give me
the give me the outline of the heat tell
me what the answer now the female a
buddy cop comedy there you go okay
somebody's losing Melissa McCarthy the
amazing Muslim McCarthy wonderful and
hilarious a Sandra Bullock yes and then
a cast of other hilarious people yeah so
on the clip their bill burr and Chinese
Janie hallinan Tony Hale is in there is
a hilarious thing up front that you will
not believe um yeah then you know Joey
McIntyre Joey McIntyre from New Kids on
the Block who is hilarious yeah that's
you didn't see that coming no yeah I
even who would who would could have
imagined bad enough he's talented and
handsome and now he's hilarious chance
and rich probably Oh talk attend go
ahead we're just k ot but all the rest
of us sure he's really has it all go yes
or he did have that Gulf of like 20
years there were wet in between new kids
on the block well and this you still
jump out you've got that's true he's
still gently um so this movie though
this has been a big people made a big
deal about your portrayal of women in
movies and that you're not this is not
it's not a how should I put this it's
not a traditional they're not
traditional portrayals in the sense that
the female characters are really fully
fleshed out real people yeah that you
know and frankly for Hollywood that's
unusual I know that's what's so crazy is
it right that's a weird again give are
like can you believe the carrot like
these characters in brides are smart and
funny and acting like all the women we
know in real life right how dare
right do that so what is it why is it
why did you crack this where is that I
mean what is it about you that that gave
you this sensitivity and insight into
the female condition I have a very item
of a very feminized man yes aiiah does
that mean I I grew up around a lot of
women my god I grow I was an only child
i grew up next to a family of eight kids
and six of them were girls and they were
all my best friends so I hung up with
them all the time and then I the bullies
in school so I drobo it was bullied of
course how could you look at me yeah but
I always would run to the girls and
going okay no part of the propane out
that's the boy and I know I understand
believe me oh yes I know him practice
running to the girls not yeah they were
fun and we laugh and I was in drama club
and all the guy so I I just always knew
women and I always kind of liked how how
funny they were and I was like kind of
making them laugh and they made me laugh
and it just this feeling and then I'm
watching all these movies their guy
dominated something like the funniest
women I know are in it they're playing
just like a mean girl friend got
funniest yeah why doesn't she get it be
fun isn't that I mean in some way this
might get you I don't know if this is a
sense of so did but Judd Apatow has this
he's actually been kind of gained a
little bit for his characterizations of
women that are a little bit that's three
dimensional right and not not the
technique but in you know the character
he's been baby 3d movies everybody's 3d
but the linen I realize something to
that feeling but but uh but and you and
Judd obviously have worked together know
each other does it did you see this did
you think you know was this hey there
needs to be an antidote to some of them
you will judge ahead you know Jed was
responsible for putting for putting uh
bridesmaids together right and Ken's
because he worked with Christian and
said she should do this so he was
already kind of in it I actually felt
cuz I I love him he's kind of like my
brother I felt like he was a little
falsely accused in that way again he's
just trying to do I mean they're really
me by comparison to comedies that have
come before Apatow stuff these
characters are wildly flashing out total
you know I did feel kind of like oh this
is cool guy can accomplish what I want
which is like working with a bunch of
funny women and they crack that open but
also kind of show that look judge what
if his names on something it doesn't
mean like it's all you know right
misogynistic which is not right but if
that reputation was there that was silly
but was it was it was it did you did you
think
this is something I have to crack or did
it just happen because this is the movie
that you wanted to make it was a little
bit something I wanted to crack because
I did over the Pinot Lindsay we're and
freaks and geeks is one of my favorite
characters ever you know created so I
had other projects that had like female
leads in Hollywood just going no you
can't because people won't go to see
that they always had like some reason
and you go okay and then finally started
going like wait that why is that a
reason it doesn't make sense that
they're half the population of the world
that is a great point there are a lot of
women in the world all right okay final
question yes we have gone way longer and
I've enjoyed every minute of it thank
you and more than my more than I
expected to be on and you're you wear
suits constantly is that you're a very
handsome address man thank you sir uh
what tip can you give someone one tip 12
if they want to be a great looking guy
mmm every day of the week yes what's
your what's your advice it's not about
how expensive the suit is is about how
good the tailor is so you can buy a
cheap suit go to some guys spend a
little bit of money to get tailored cuz
I guys although I don't yourself comes
to expensive not an excuse you can go to
the thrift store and you can buy a suit
and just get something to tailor it
nicely for you and then you will look
like a million bucks that is an
incredible piece of advice thank you so
much oh thanks so much really thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
