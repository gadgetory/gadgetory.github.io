its limitations but at the end of the
day I can make something that sounds
just as good as something that I would
do in this studio when you think of how
a hit song is made you might imagine it
all happening in a big professional
studio and you wouldn't be wrong
most music has been recorded this way
but in the past you usually had to be
signed to a major label in order to get
access to studios and these studios
required a lot of space people and
equipment now technology has advanced to
the point where many of the tools needed
to build a song can fit in the palm of
your hand literally oak Felder is a
songwriter and pop music producer who
has worked with artists like Nicki Minaj
Demi Lovato Alicia Keys uh sure and
Jennifer Lopez to name a few
oak may work with some of music's
biggest players but what he uses to make
their songs can mostly be done on a
phone and laptop which allows him to
work from anywhere in the world day to
day how much are you actually doing on
the go
versus and a traditional space like this
my main computer is a laptop so
technically I'm mobile
everywhere technically and in a lot of
ways the setup that I have here is just
a beefed-up version of what I would
normally have on the road so it's the
same thing just a little scaled up yeah
so how it has mobile production
personally empowered you or change the
way that you work it's helped me a lot
inspiration sort of strikes everywhere
not only when you're in the studio right
I get a lot of ideas when I'm asleep I
believe it about I'll get up and I'll
sit down it's like this little mobile
rig that I have where there are times
when I'm out and about and I'll think of
a crazy lyric or I'll think
really cool melody and I'll use my voice
notes on my phone or I'll use the music
notes app on my on my iPhone to just put
the idea down think about how many hit
songs do not exist because someone did
not have access to technology or a way
to put it down in the moment for sure I
can sit in a car and do a track oh my
god my computer to see how oak produces
outside the studio we headed to a home
recording session with singer and
songwriters abaya they've been working
on a project together and oak demos how
he can build a be using software called
battery as soon as we get in the car so
I just hit actually that I put together
and I do this a lot like when I know I'm
gonna work with an artist I'll just like
source different vibes or I'll just
create them alright let's pull up logic
I like to plugged in and drives plugged
in so let's start with a kick that's my
kick this is like super fascinating to
you because I've never really seen
anyone use the touch bar in this game
really oh it's it's soaking in dongles
so when we were in the car earlier
that's where it started and when I
walked in here and played it firm that's
what they heard as they were writing the
song I started adding more elements to
it those elements include sounds and
effects from plugins and samples in the
past these elements would need to be
created with hardware but now software
can be downloaded or installed on a
laptop these are used to create the
foundation of the track next the vocals
are added
Hey on it gets me Western in my way got
so busy counting numbers if I lose it
watch me do it
come with him on your way so she didn't
record that lead vocal but after she
recorded that we did all the background
arrangements and that's where a lot of
the track count comes from all of these
layers are then stacked into a project
in logic adjusted and then mixed for the
final product how many layers of audio
are there in here in this track
well altogether the track plus the
vocals there's a hundred and seventy
seven tracks total yeah so that's every
background every stack every crowd vocal
every hi-hat every Thom every kick every
snare every percussion every bassline
every chord everything but the truth is
is that all of these layers sort of
grouped together to make singular things
so when you listen to it with her
I mean it sounds like there's a party
happening like what's significant is not
just that a laptop is mobile but
software is powerful enough to
essentially be a studio recently I did a
record for Demi Lovato called sorry not
sorry
that has a gospel choir but that gospel
choir is your stream and it literally is
me and Shawn Douglas the other writer
the writer on the record and Demi
herself stacking our vocals like 40
times and I did it on my laptop and it
did it no problem because the processing
power did this processing power has
given rise to a new generation of
bedroom producers who don't need a
studio to make music I think the
technology has become the great
equalizer I think we're all on an even
playing field and now it's about skill
now it's about who's just good that's
actually true because we can have an
even playing field but that means that
everyone has to be better at what they
do it's exactly right if the next
bedroom producer comes up and does a
better record than I do they're gonna
overtake me so people's creativity will
be unlocked but it's right it still it's
the level of creativity that you have up
here that's exactly right
I think now we can be judged based on
our actual capability versus our access
now that the technology learning how to
get out of the way what do you mean by
that I think that should be the goal of
Technology get out of my way that should
be the goal and and and give everybody
the access to that yeah somebody who
doesn't know how to use Pro Tools very
well has a damn good idea in their head
and I think I think it's better for the
art
