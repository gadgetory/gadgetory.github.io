a lot of demos and we've seen a lot of
hardware but until now we haven't seen
how the software works on actual
shipping units this is how Google does a
SmartWatch edit score Android wear is
surprisingly simple from the home screen
you can swipe up to scroll through your
notifications on any single notification
you can swipe to the right to perform
actions on it like navigate reply to a
text message or see more detail about
the weather you can also swipe to the
left to dismiss the notifications and
they'll also dismiss on your Android
phone which is pretty convenient you can
also swipe down from the very top of the
home screen to mute notifications and
see your battery life the last thing and
maybe the best thing that you can do
from the home screen is say okay google
and it will bring up a google search
that will let you perform all sorts of
actions you can search the web you can
send a text message you can set it to
leave yourself a note it's basically the
entire power of google now right there
on your wrist the last core feature of
android where is the ability to change
watch faces to do that you just hold
your finger down on the home screen and
then you can swipe left and right
through a whole bunch of different
things different manufacturers will have
different watch faces and on the LG G
watch at least there's something like 15
or 20 of them some are pretty neat but
unfortunately you won't be able to
install watch faces from third-party
developers yet google says that's coming
in a future update setting up Android
wear with your Android phone is
relatively simple you need to download
the Android wear app from google play
and then pair it to the SmartWatch once
you've approved it to accessing
notifications everything that shows up
on your phone also shows up on your
watch within the app itself you can
actually go in and set different actions
for different voice commands right now
everything is just using googles apps
but in the future you could
theoretically have the timer map to the
clock you could have show me my steps
map to run keeper instead of Google fit
or you could even have call a car map to
burrow or lift or whatever you use to
get around the overall design is super
clean super simple and super readable
which is exactly what you want on a
watch every notification shows up as a
google now style card although I guess
from now on we're going to have to call
the material style cards with the
upcoming release of Android the
backgrounds are colorful pictures and
they're also contextual so if somebody
sends you a text you'll see that
person's profile photo in the background
probably the most frustrating thing
about Android wear is that you can't
reorder no
vacations basically this watch more than
anything else is a google now machine
you're going to have to learn to trust
google now and trust it will give you
the notifications that you actually want
we already know what a smart watch that
tries to do everything looks like it's
the galaxy gear android wear doesn't try
to do everything it just tries to do the
right thing just like Google now Android
wear sometimes wrong about that but what
it's right it's often almost exactly
magically right overall Android wear is
really close to what I imagine most
people would want on a SmartWatch it's
not too complicated it doesn't get in
the way and the voice commands and voice
search are legitimately great now it's
just up to the hardware manufacturers to
live up to it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
