zoom in here on cambridge by complying
cambridge it's down here a bit there it
is this is where we're based ms our bike
shop research in cambridge and what
we're doing here is we're using machine
learning to learn how to recognize
whether your hand is open or closed
until we use a bunch of we've recorded a
bunch of training data for lots of
different people using different using
the different open and closed gestures
and trained up this system using machine
learning so that it can recognize the
bus see where your hand is open and all
be doing here is ejecting this open flow
signal into into windows so we can move
things around and brick and release with
our hands so any app could be used let's
switch to a game now it's going to be a
jetpack joyride and i'm just going to
show it's not quite switched
so I'm going to show here that I can
just control a game this is but a simple
control game but I can now play this
game just by squeezing my fist I can
move the jet pack up and down and select
