here at CES 2016 I'm about to sit down
and have a chat with Brendon Schulman
who is the VP of policy and legal
affairs at DJI the world's most popular
drone company so tell us just a little
bit about yourself how you got into
drones and how you got to the job you
are at now so I'm a VP of policy legal
affairs my role is to really help
educate government officials try to help
advocate reasonable regulations for the
technology my background is actually as
a model aircraft enthusiast I've been
into radio control planes for over 20
years so over the last year we've seen
actually quite a lot of movement from
the regulator's here in the US what do
you make of the moves by the FAA and the
DoD in terms of creating a registry and
you know working towards sort of a broad
set of rules for commercial use I think
that's a that's a good mechanism for
getting people to take responsibility
and to be accountable if they get into
trouble and also it's an opportunity for
education people who register are given
the effe guidance on how to operate
safely and that's really in everyone's
interest so you come from the world of
model aircraft what do you think of the
fact that you know some of the larger
organizations from that world are
protesting you know telling their
members not to register and I believe
there are several legal challenges being
mounted to the registration registration
in and of itself is is a good policy
outcome I don't think anyone objects to
the idea that there should be some level
of registration for some category of
drones you could debate what weight
cutoff to use you could debate you know
what types of Thrones and I think the
challenge that we've seen is that
there's a community where they already
have was essentially a registration
process the AMA has a requirement to put
your AMA number or your your contact
information on the model aircraft and
essentially the FAA is duplicating that
so from a policy point of view their
system works as well as the FAA is rule
and the real concern is that in 2012
Congress said not to introduce new rules
for model aircraft that are used
recreationally and this is perhaps a non
objectionable rule but it's a rule and I
think the concern is if you can
introduce a rule that contradicts that
statute from 2012 what's going to happen
at
what new regulations would we see that
might overreach and be unacceptable to
the community so that the problem is
really one of process of how the rules
are made clearly the scale at which the
these crafts are now being used is
what's changed and that's why
fundamentally we have to come up with a
new new structure for policing them
right well I think those numbers tell
you that that the technology is very
safe I mean there really are a limited
number of incidents that raise safety or
security concerns that the problem is
that those are the kinds of incidents
that are very know worthy that make the
news and that really unfortunately also
drive the policy decisions particularly
at the state and local level that the
the number of reports that suggest that
people are using drones to invade
privacy at countless reports about that
in theory and I have yet to hear of one
actual instance of somebody using a
drone to spy on a neighbor we did have a
prosecution in New York State there was
a gentleman who was flying around a
medical facility and was alleged to have
been spying on people who were being
examined in the medical offices he was
prosecuted all the way through jury
verdict and acquitted under the existing
New York State unlawful surveillance law
so we didn't need a drone specific law
to prosecute him in New York State he
was acquitted because he wasn't actually
spying on anyone the building was
actually had mirrored finish on the
windows so he couldn't have been spying
and yet if he had been he would have
been prosecuted and convicted of that
crime so you know I think the issue is
to come to reasonable outcomes both in
terms of safety and responsibility and a
lot of the answer there is is education
providing information to the user about
how to operate in a safe manner now I
know DJI doesn't work on this but if we
were to think about a world in which
Amazon and Google achieve their mission
and there's thousands or tens of
thousands of drones flying over a major
city like Las Vegas or New York would
that require new regulations or would
that require only you know technology
and structure in order to make sure that
they stay in their lane they get where
they're going with minimal accidents I
think very much that that technology is
going to solve the kinds of issues like
that you know what do we do when we have
more traffic than now I don't think the
skies are gonna be blanketed in drones
if you think about the size of a drone
relative to airspace it really
drones are quite small they're not gonna
collide with each other just because
they're near each other and I mean they
would have to change the FAA you know
rules around line-of-sight around you
know having a man pilot at all you know
a pilot at all times and they would have
to change the you know the designations
in the airspace to carve out space for
you know low speed high speed you know
package man I mean they there would be
things that need to be done on the
regulatory side right that's true and if
you if you consider drones to the
aircraft and to already be fully
regulated you run into a lot of
contradictions or complications and and
that's actually one of them so
delivering packages is considered an air
carrier operation now it doesn't make
sense that the drone that's delivering a
package versus taking a photograph is
basically doing the same thing it's just
leaving something behind but in the
manned a traditional aviation world
that's an air carrier operation and
therefore outside of the the rules that
are currently being made and will be
released this year by the FAA
you've got the visual line of sight
issue of how do you fly far enough away
to actually make that delivery worth
doing while also ensuring that you
aren't posing a threat to other air
traffic and so that I think that's a
technology solution but also a
regulatory one you're correct because
the proposal that the FAA has now for
commercial operation is within line of
sight so basically as far as you can see
it or the surrounding airspace so I know
you're not gonna like this question but
yesterday right when we were I was on
the the panel right before you there was
a former member of the FAA who I believe
now is a drone lawyer or lobbyist okay
who was leading the panel to remember
his name Jim Owens yeah okay and he said
you know I think we understand when we
look back at the history of manned
aviation that in order to make progress
some people have to die and by that he
only meant that the industry is going to
grow to a robust size we're going to be
doing lots of things in an in an
environment which to some degree will
always be dangerous flying in the air
and as we make progress and build new
things and grow and scale somebody there
will be an accident somebody will die do
you think that that's a reasonable way
to think about what's going on the drone
industry
I think if you look back at the history
of manned aviation in the early pioneers
there were weekly deaths you go back to
those old newspapers where they talked
about the Pioneers flying around we
tolerated a much higher level of risk
back then than we do today particularly
in the aviation world so people are
extremely sensitive to safety for any
kind of aviation and I think even
disproportionately so so you have that
you know yes there are safety risks and
and they will lead to incidents that
that might raise concerns thankfully
we've had if you think back to the
history of DJI we've been around for 10
years we're celebrating our 10th year
anniversary now and I have yet to hear
of any fatality anywhere in the world
attributable to the kind of multi rotor
drones that we or other companies like
us sell so they and we've tried to
estimate the number of operational hours
that we have it's tough to do because we
don't really track all that information
but a rough estimate is probably like
three million operational hours per
month if you consider for example
general aviation which is currently
highly regulated and you look at
statistics there for every hundred
thousand hours of a private airplane
like a Cessna you've got one point five
fatal accidents so we already tolerate a
level of risk and the question is are we
going to tolerate any level of risk for
drones I think the fact that there's no
one on board is great because you're
already dealing with a safe technology
what I would be concerned about is that
you know in the course of doing anything
there are going to be risks and if
there's an overreaction to it to an air
safety incident that could hamper the
growth of the industry right yeah I mean
again DJI is primarily focused on
selling drones to consumers and
cinematographers people in Hollywood but
now you're expanding out drones that are
optimized for spraying crops recently
one with a thermal camera that would be
used by fire departments or
search-and-rescue and so I'm sure that
your drones will play a large role in
the industrial applications actually I
think like two-thirds of the commercial
exemptions in the US are for DJI
products right and so when you think
about it like that
are you comfortable with the idea that
these drones could be used for you know
something that begins to bleed back
towards you know law enforcement or
military use I mean I know that
are already police departments that are
thinking about how to use them you know
just for the kind of things that they
would have normally used a helicopter
for well we so we don't market to
government to military government or or
or law enforcement obviously everyone
who's interested in the beneficial uses
of the technology is going to find the
platforms that work the best of the most
reliable the most easy to use so so we
have users across the spectrum everyone
from the back yard flyer to the to the
top-of-the-line Hollywood cinematography
and you know I think for me that the
government agency applications are by
far the beneficial ones the search and
rescue opportunities whether it's using
the the new thermal camera or even just
photography to me you know you get if
you put a drone on the back of a
firetruck you were going to help save
lives and you know up the risk that we
just talked about the risk of a of a
fatality or collision is already
outweighed by the number of people whose
lives have been saved so you got to get
out there and have us journalists write
more of these positive stories right
every time you get a cat out of a tree
there needs to be a story I look I news
is news I and I think the bleeds it
leads I don't know I don't know what to
tell you that's how that's how the
business works you know that that's
that's for you to decide but I there
there are great stories out there to be
found and told if you want to find them
so I'll ask you one more question and
then we'll wrap things up Jim do you
think we'll get to a point where drones
are as ubiquitous as smartphones maybe
or personal computers car something that
every family has one of because there's
a lot of utility that you can get out of
it and it's not so difficult or
dangerous that people are worried about
having one it's hard to make that
prediction at this point if you think
about the the history of the computer
and how you needed like the basement
size mainframe to do anything and now
we've got something that's like a
million times more powerful in our
pocket it's hard to see the application
so we you know we just released version
3 of our SDK so I think in the future
we're gonna see like smartphones apps
written for drones to do all sorts of
beneficial things so you know what will
the drone be used to go fetch the
newspaper in the morning or walk your
dog if it sort of household uses that
might lead to everyone owning one
it's hard to say but I think it's very
exciting to imagine where we are now
compared to where the PC industry was or
even a mobile telephone industry was
this is like the the age of those giant
clunky car phones and and we've got
years and years ahead of us so from like
a legal perspective if the drone walks
your dogs that have to scoop the poop or
is that yes okay right well we'll end on
that note be sure to check out the verge
