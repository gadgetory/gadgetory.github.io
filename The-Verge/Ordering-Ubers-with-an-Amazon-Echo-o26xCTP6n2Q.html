I'm here with Amazon Zeca which keeps
getting smarter and smarter so it's CES
we saw it at a bunch of home automation
capabilities earlier in the week and
added Domino's yesterday it added
Spotify and today it's adding what I
think is my favorite feature you can now
ask it for an uber so Alexa asked uber
for a ride there is an uber X about
three minutes away would you like me to
order it no thanks
okay goodbye yeah so that was super
simple right all you got to do is open
up the Alexa app on your phone go into
the skills section add the uber skill
link it to your account and make sure
you set your address and then Alexa can
immediately get you a ride so now we can
ask your for Idol so yes this time and
then we can also ask where it is how
long has to intake to get here and
cancel again if we want to so Alexa
asked uber for a ride there is an uber X
about two minutes away would you like me
to order it yes please requesting your
ride this may take a few seconds oh
there we go Edwin is now arriving in a
Honda Accord so I can just open up the
uber app here there yeah so you can see
right here on my phone everyone's on the
way and then I can say things like Alexa
a scoober how far away my ride is your
ride request was accepted your driver
should be there in about one minute
your mover app has the details great and
then obviously I can do the thing that
no driver wants you to do but we're
going to do it anyway Alexa open uber
and cancel I've canceled your guys and
there we go so that is uber on the
Amazon echo it's pretty cool you can
also ask for things like a new Rex your
SUV basically any product uber sells you
can ask for directly from the echo just
using your voice you don't even have to
use a button anymore</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
