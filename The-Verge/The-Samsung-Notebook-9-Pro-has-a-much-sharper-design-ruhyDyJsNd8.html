I'm here at CES 2019, and we're here with
the new Samsung Notebook 9 Pro,
it's Samsung's latest flagship laptop,
and it's seeing a bit of a
different approach this year.
Not only is Samsung updating the specs,
it's still got the
latest Intel processors,
plenty of RAM, all that good stuff.
But what makes the Notebook 9 different
this time around is
that Samsung is putting
a really big emphasis on design here.
It's got a much sharper design,
much thinner corner radiuses,
much thinner bezels,
and it's a much more
modern look that let's it,
not only compete with, but stand out with,
competitors like Apple and Dell.
Samsung's kept a lot of stuff the same
on the Notebook 9 Pro this year.
It's still 2-in-1 design,
you can still flip it around,
it's got the 2-in-1 hinges,
you can use it as an easel,
you can put it up on a
stand, you can convert it
into a full tablet if you need to,
but it's just really
improved and honed it.
So, it's still made of an all-metal body,
but it feels like metal this time.
It's sharper, it's crisper,
and even in subtle things,
the bezels are thinner,
the corners are tighter,
more squared-off radius, which
helps it just feel less cheap,
it feels more premium, more professional,
and it's even in the small things.
There's this subtle ridging
that Samsung has along
the edge of the laptop and on screen,
which makes it a, easier
to open and easier to hold,
but also just looks really great.
And even stuff like the
trackpad and the keyboard,
the keys are larger,
the trackpad's bigger,
it's just a better, more
improved, clean version of it.
Ports-wise, there are three USB-C ports,
two on this side and one on this side.
There's also a power button, which has
a built-in fingerprint reader,
over on the right side also.
And a micro-SD card slot, which is nice.
Full SD would be better, but I'll
take what I can get at this point.
My only real big complaint is that,
while Samsung's done a really
great job at minimizing the
bezels on the side and top of the display,
they've even gotten the webcam on top,
which is great, 'cause no one
likes that weird chin-looking
thing that you get on
other laptops that have had
to put it in different places,
there's a really thick bezel
at the bottom of the screen.
It's wider than my thumb,
and I have pretty big hands.
It's not great, I mean it's fine.
Compared to the rest of the
redesign Samsung's done here,
it's workable, but room
to improve for the future.
The biggest question with
the Notebook 9 Pro is,
of course, how much is it gonna cost?
Now, Samsung hasn't said,
we do know that it'll
be out sometime in early 2019,
but that final price tag, as
with almost anything at CES,
is really gonna be the defining factor
in terms of whether or not this is
a product you're gonna wanna buy.
Thanks so much for watching,
for more great videos,
like this, from CES 2019, make sure to
like and subscribe to Verge on YouTube,
and we'll be here the
whole week with gadgets,
computers, laptops, you want that.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
