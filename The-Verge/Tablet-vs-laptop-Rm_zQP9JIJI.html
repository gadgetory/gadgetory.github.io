where a kid is using an iPad and at the
end of the ad she asks what's a computer
it sparked a lot of conversation in our
corner of the Internet
because it's a good question and
personally I think some people attach
the word computer to certain form
factors and I think that if you look at
computers philosophically there's
something that just lets you do the
thing you need to do and that certain
form factors frankly are a lot better
for that is that fabric on your laptop
this is an iPad pro and this is a
surface laptop you're probably thinking
that this is some type of Apple versus
Microsoft episode of vs. because of
these products but we're not really
talking about arguing over not really
talking about specific brands we're
talking about the differences between
using a tablet versus a left-right
a lot of people are probably wondering
if they can get away with just using a
tablet as their main computer especially
as the chipsets and tablets get to be
comparable to desktop computing power in
my opinion is likely not tablets not
going to do it and my take is that this
thing is so easy to use and as you
mentioned so powerful that for a lot of
people all they really need is a tablet
like this you really like Apple stuff
don't you one of the reasons I really
like using a tablet as my main computer
is just because of how thin and light it
is I mean I take this with me everywhere
I throw it in my bag I take it to work I
take it out to dinner I take it into bed
with me at night it's not like carrying
a clamshell around you realize that a 12
point 9 inch iPad is still really big
right there's a 10 inch one - okay one
of my favorite parts about an actual
laptop are the tactile keys in my
opinion a keyboard is an amazing
invention that is not broken and not in
need of fixing and I know people do it
but I personally don't understand how
anyone can do all of their work or
personal documents typing on a
touchscreen keyboard I don't use the
touchscreen keyboard all that often
that's why I have this
which is the smart Keyboard it
magnetically attaches and it doesn't
ever need to be charged it's pretty
great and it costs one hundred and sixty
nine dollars so add that to the thousand
dollar tablet you've got there and
you're in premium computer land I never
said this wasn't a premium product I
just said I like the convenience of a
tablet also how well does that thing
balance on your lap when you're using
the smart Keyboard that's what I thought
with a clamshell like this it's actually
comfortable and well balanced on your
lap hence laptop even though I don't use
the touchscreen keyboard all that often
I just love having a touchscreen in
general this has a touchscreen - yeah
but not all laptops - like okay I'm not
gonna say the brand name because we're
not making this about the brands but oh
my gosh were you about to say something
critical about also this works with the
stylus otherwise known as pencil
supports a stylus pen - again not all
laptops do in fact not many work with
the stylus right but just as your tablet
has evolved to be as powerful as a
regular computer
I mean laptops have evolved to offer the
best of all worlds if you buy a newer a
high-end Windows PC or even a less
expensive Chromebook you're likely to
get things like a touchscreen and yet
you still have this nice familiar form
factor also when I rotate my tablet or
just happen to pick it up the wrong way
the screen rotates with it does your
laptop do that why in the world would I
want to rotate my laptop and I think a
tablet like this gets better battery
life than most laptops
generally speaking you might have a
point there but honestly we've argued
enough about the form factor and
hardware differences between laptops and
tablets what it really comes down to in
my opinion is the software yeah it does
there's a reason why we don't get many
tech support calls from friends and
family being all like I don't know how
to set up an iPad right and and that's
why kids are able to pick up a tablet
and immediately get addicted to it is
that a good thing this is just known for
its intuitive UI and also it runs on a
mobile operating system which means that
a lot of the apps that you already know
from your smartphone you can run on here
too okay so maybe laptops sometimes
require a little more tech support
that's not really what I'm talking about
here I mean have you ever tried writing
a 3,000 word document on your tablet or
working in an Excel spreadsheet or
editing a really serious video project
or just manipulating folders and windows
there's a reason why people are so
attached to their laptops and that's due
in large part to the OS and software
I still think mobile software is better
why because for a smartphone first
generation this does end so what do some
thing about tablets and laptops are you
gonna say the words or factors seventeen
more times we're gonna say four factors
because we're nerds that's how we talk
those two just going at it again it's as
if there isn't something in between this
is an iPad pro
