asked after a fire hydrant failed during
a Hazleton firefight in the case of a
fire there's a chance the hydrant in
front of your home won't function is the
fire hydrant in your neighborhood
working hundreds upon hundreds remain
out of service in Kansas attic defective
hydrants risk lives while technology and
other firefighting equipment has been
revamped the hydrant has not been
redesigned in over a century which ones
work in which was done but two fire
hydrants the fire hydrant in front of
this hydrant a right in front of the
house was not working so a former New
York City firefighter has designed a
hydrant that is virtually indestructible
as a firefighter New York City
firefighter I recognized a need that
there had to be a change in the
reliability of a fire hydrant once in a
hundred years there has been no real
significant change even though we know
where the issues and problems are well
fire hydrants are the critical part of
the fire extinguisher n't tactic a
hydrant is as important as a firefighter
we have standards we get to the scene
within four minutes we want ahead we
have set up time which means connecting
to a hydrant stretching always line
another four minutes and we expect that
water to be on the fire in eight minutes
and when the hydrant is broken we don't
accomplish that through better
engineering and better materials we've
come up with the solution it's called
the single act spot and fire hydrant
here's your basic standard conventional
fire hydrant and you can see how the
corrosion on there exists because they
just put regular paint on there
it's totally vulnerable accessible these
things get damaged and bent
these can get cross threaded they throw
debris inside but the integrity of this
hydrant is easily compromised because
it's it's everything's accessible and
exposed to the elements what I've done
is I become stuck to the fire hydrant
and identified all the vulnerable parts
of a hydrant that are known to break
down and fail you know consistently now
you can see obviously just by appearance
how much different they look you can
notice that the operate with what is
going to come out is much higher which
is better for the firefighter to be able
to put this thing on there you have the
snow Pole okay and all the into integral
parts are encapsulated inside the
hydrant so you can't there's nothing
where the elements can get to it or you
can't put wrenches it's not know where
to put a wrench on you need a special
tool to do that okay so what all's I do
is come up with this tool crack that
open like that
spin that off take that off now
everything's out of your way the height
of the person's working order if I want
to get water comes out like that and
then take the caps up they come right
off inside up on top you see this grease
fitting so it's very simple you know
less complicated hydrant and we're
within 10 to 20 percent of the cost of a
traditional hydrant so we're not even
that much more but we do so much more so
it's it cradle to grave you can't afford
not to have our Hydra in the ground
so we're in about a dozen US states
right now we have 150 hydrants in the
ground in those 12 states and the reason
there aren't more is because typically a
municipality want to buy one or two and
put it through its paces over a four
season cycle and determine for
themselves let the fire department work
on them extensively and determine that
you know it doesn't leak it doesn't
freeze in the wintertime it won't rust
or corrode or break down and then once
that happens they start to order more
hydrants people don't realize the need
for hide until it's their house it's on
fire and also that hydrants not working
and people yelling screaming out of the
building and firefighters are putting
their lives at risk you know and it's
unnecessary it's something that time has
come people believe they're just an
ordinary fixture in the street they are
life-saving Fire Department appliances
they shouldn't be used you know for
washing cars or for cleaning streets
people do not understand the importance
of these types when you're at a fire and
a hydrant doesn't work and the
firefighters are standing around and no
one can get water out of the hose then
you understand how important a fire
hydrant is
