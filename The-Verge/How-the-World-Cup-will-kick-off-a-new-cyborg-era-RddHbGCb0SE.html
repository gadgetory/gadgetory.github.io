will walk onto the field of the world
cup and with the help of a robotic
exoskeleton open the games with a
ceremonial kick there is no joystick or
steering wheel involved here the person
inside is controlling the suit with just
their mind it's one of the most advanced
versions of a brain machine interface or
BMI and while it sounds like science
fiction it's actually just the latest
proof we've entered the cyborg era
this sue was created by the walk again
project a consortium of over 100 neuro
scientists and engineers from around the
world it's spearheaded by dr. Miguel
Nicolelis and his colleagues at the Duke
Center for neural engineering building
on more than 40 years of research on how
to record and translate the electrical
activity in our brains the natural
language of thought into commands that a
computer can understand BMI research
began in the lab with rats and monkeys
scientists were able to gather data on
mental activity by implanting
microelectrodes into the animals brains
beginning in 2000 they were able to take
that information and translate it in
real time so that a monkey for example
could use its mind to control a robotic
arm in one of dr. Nikolai Lee's most
famous experiments a monkey in the lab
Duke was able to make a robot in Japan
walk simply by thinking about moving its
legs in recent years scientists have
been working to bring the advances from
the lab to humans in the real world but
there's one major challenge most people
aren't willing to get the kind of
invasive surgery and implants necessary
to gather enough data the waukegan
project solves that big challenge it
works using an EEG headset that is able
to gather enough brain activity to
control a robotic suit without any
invasive surgery as BMI continues to
improve it holds great promise for
people who've lost mobility or limbs
DARPA's dekha arm a BMI controlled
prosthetic for example has already been
approved by the FDA for testing outside
the lab the big transformation however
will come when this technology is
deployed not just to help those with
medical need but to augment improve the
abilities of everyday people from
soldiers to construction workers to
extreme athletes VMI may push human
bodies well beyond their natural limits
as we learn how to translate the
language of the brain in real time BMI
may also open up new avenues for
communication at the University of
Washington earlier this year researchers
demonstrated a brain-to-brain interface
in which one subject could use his
thoughts to control the movement of the
person he was connected to BMI advocates
like dr. Nicole Ellie's hope that in the
future this kind of technology may allow
us not just to control robots but to
share a thought
memories and emotions with our fellow
humans in a neural network that connects
us all
