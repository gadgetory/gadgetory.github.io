the future we are living it here on a
retired airstrip outside San Francisco
California with two geese taking in the
scenery right outside watching a silver
bullet drive by we're at formal Naval
Air Station Alameda and the reason we're
here today is because I'm going to be
taking a look at the Mercedes f015
luxury in motion now this is the vehicle
that debuted at CES a few weeks ago to a
huge reaction for a couple of reasons
one its self-driving - it really does
look like it's from the future it looks
like nothing that we've ever seen before
we're actually gonna have a chance to
drive it today and hopefully we don't
die it's not a street-legal car that's
why we're out here in this place so
let's hope everything goes according to
plan almost everything about the EPS r15
is designed with autonomous driving in
mind from the outside you can barely
tell there are windows for passengers to
see out of it all they're there but a
metallic coating makes it look like
uninterrupted flowing metal from top to
bottom
a prominent hump on the roof contains
high-precision GPS equipment which isn't
something you see on an everyday car oh
and there are lasers in the front and it
talks to pedestrians nearby you know
totally normal stuff we're about to get
in if I die but my family I died doing
what I love
I guess so I'm sitting in the driver's
seat of the f015 here and you'll notice
that I'm facing backwards I'm not facing
toward the windshield which is one of
the cooler features of a self-driving
car you don't have to be looking forward
and we're surrounded by LCDs these are
actually touch screens you can do a
variety of different things you can you
can change the speed that you're going
you can control music you can call
people and you can change the background
here to whatever you want you can
be a 360-degree photo you can rotate
that photo around there's a retractable
table in here that can serve all four
passengers and they can play games so
that as you're driving you're just sort
of like having fun and the cars rolling
right now by the way we didn't have
anything to do with that the car just
started moving on its own
the steering wheel is literally behind
me behind my seat nobody is touching it
we're just we're just rolling and and
you'll you'll see the images on the
displays and the doors are kind of
moving along but they have nothing to do
with the scenery outside it's just
whatever you want it to be you can
experience some other environment it's
very very sci-fi and every sense of the
word
the legislation doesn't exist to
actually allow any of this right now but
Mercedes is looking at this as a vision
of 2030 they're calling it a research
vehicle not a concept vehicle a lot of
the stuff that's happening in here
they're testing in the hopes that
eventually the legislation will catch up
and by the time 2030 rolls around maybe
we'll see cars that actually look like
this on the road I don't know whether
I'd personally own something like this
but I think it's too soon to say maybe
it's a generational leap maybe our kids
will be driving vehicles that look and
work like this maybe they're not for us
but the fact that they're actually
working they're not just concepts
they're working they're driving on
deserted air strips is pretty amazing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
