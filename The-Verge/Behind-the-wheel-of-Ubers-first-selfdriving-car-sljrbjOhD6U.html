of Transportation is self-driving cars
we're standing next to one right here in
Pittsburgh Pennsylvania it's owned by
uber and we're going to get behind the
wheel and drive it ourselves well I
guess it's cars gonna actually drive
itself and I'm just going to be sitting
there let's go check it out
oh and I mention I don't know how to
drive all right I'm ready to engage I'm
good I'm going to engage the car into
self-driving and I do that by pushing
the silver button to my right the white
light turned in and turned on from blue
the car is now driving itself passing by
some some factories here are some
beautiful oil this is the Heinz Factory
here to the left they definitely have
the impulse to put my foot on the gas
even though it's doing it all itself so
I'll turn back here and say hey what's
up but I'm not going to do that and it's
accelerating a little bit as we going up
a hill but now it's slowing down and
it's stopping and I did it all by itself
I'm very proud of your car the turn
signal came on automatically and now
it's turning itself on to this bridge
and it just did that all by that's
incredible
okay so this this guy jag doubt into our
lane so I decided to take control of the
car so that we don't die what what
they're telling me is that it knows how
fast to go it knows what the speed limit
is because uber has mapped the city and
so it has programmed into its software
how fast we can go
depending on where we are in the city if
we were to go somewhere that was
unmapped the car would refuse to go into
autonomy mode I think it's a little
close to those parked cars but okay kind
of moved to the left there a little bit
I kicked us out again that's all right
there's a there's a lot of obstacles on
this road so maybe this is a road that
you would want to be in control yourself
I'm now driving the self-driving car and
I just want to say screw you robots all
right now it is driving itself or
approaching ubers Technology Center here
and we're here success we survived cool
so over says that the ultimate goal is
to have a system in place where there's
no drivers in these cars that you
basically pull out your phone
pat the app and a car comes to your home
with nobody in it and I'll take you to
your destination Travis kalanick the CEO
of uber has talked about an idea of
Perpetual trips that the cars are just
constantly picking people up dropping
them off sort of akin to mass transit in
a way but obviously automated totally
automated and running itself we got a
chance to see some of that up close it's
obviously in its very early stages here
but it was really cool to see especially
be behind the wheel as the car was
driving itself
I felt very fluid very natural I was
always scared maybe half a second when
it got a little bit close to some parked
cars but other than that it's clear that
this is a technology that's well on its
way and it'll be really interesting to
see how Eber rolls in sat in the future
