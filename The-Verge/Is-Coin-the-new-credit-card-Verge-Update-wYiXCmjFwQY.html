officially on it started a few years ago
with Google Wallet and more recently
Apple pay but there's been other
independent players like plastic and
coin taking a tangible approach with a
single programmable card after months of
delays I finally got my coin beta in the
mail it looks and feels just like a
regular credit card but it has an e-ink
display and a button setting up coin
involves a smartphone the coin app and
they're included card reader the process
was a bit confusing at first in order to
buy something with coin you have to
first pair your coin with your phone
then add various credit cards and debit
cards and then sync coin with your
device to get your cards over there are
a few other hoops you have to jump
through like entering your CVV and
verifying your card but once you
understand how to sync one credit card
the process makes sense and once you've
got the card synced you just press the
button to cycle through them we set out
to do three real-world tests with coin
first buying something at a drugstore as
expected
coin worked without a hitch at a normal
point-of-sale machine next I went to get
lunch so we're here inside Cris where I
frequently eat lunch and crisp has a
membership card which I've got
programmed into my coin and what's neat
is you can actually nickname your
membership cards so I've got the crisp
part here and I've got my credit card
here so let's get some lunch the cashier
a crisp
thought coin was really cool but I could
see how it would be confusing to some
people who are used to seeing a specific
membership card boom went through
awesome and for our last test I'm at an
ATM machine right now and ATM machines
sound like they eat your cards and I
have no idea what's about to happen if I
try and take out money with the coin but
let's see what happens all right should
I know when you're
it's literally not reading it doesn't
want to eat this at all try a different
machine
Wells Fargo does not like the coin so
coin works as well as you'd expect it to
anywhere that takes credit cards takes
coin well my shopping street was cut
short because it didn't work at the ATM
machine let's go eat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
