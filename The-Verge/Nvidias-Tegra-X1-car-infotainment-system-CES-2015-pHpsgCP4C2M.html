2015 and the thing we're taking a look
at right now is in videos brand new
Tegra x1 powered infotainment system so
over here on the left is a digital
instrument cluster which isn't all that
exciting but the interesting thing is
this big touchscreen module here she's
like a massive touchscreen tablet that
you can have integrated into your car
and what Nvidia is showing isn't really
software that anybody is going to use
necessarily but it's a demo of what can
be done so you have these five key areas
at the top they can occupy the entire
screen or they can occupy just a portion
of it so this part is for in-car
controls you can also have the camera
cameras mounted around the car that's
another big part of Nvidia's big push
into auto technology is to get itself
above the cameras and car awareness
there's also music controls or was a big
part or was important and you also have
navigation the navigation is actually
one of the coolest things because it's
readily rendered in 3d and as you can
see it can be rotated you can move
around it animates really smoothly
actually and it's really quite
good-looking it makes it emphasizes in
videos reputation for having high
resolution high quality graphics and
really puts it forward in a nice way so
the split screen functionality is
actually one of the cool things here and
the fact is the touchscreen and has all
this power is disposal so this is we
just having these five basic sections
it's just invidious demo and videos
taste what we can expect to see from car
manufacturers in the future for this and
