CES is always a show about new TVs from
4k HDR TVs that roll up when you're not
watching anymore
all the way to transparent prototypes
the week that we spend here is a
showcase for the present and the far-off
future but 8k the hottest trend at CES
2019 is still little more than a fantasy
don't get me wrong
8k TVs are very real you can walk into a
store today with $5,000 and buy one for
yourself and here at CES we're seeing a
whole new wave from Samsung Sony LG and
more companies but listen the idea that
anyone should buy an 8k TV today is
sheer stupidity
there's just no content your favorite
Hollywood films and your favorite
Netflix shows they don't exist in 8k and
there's no sign that's gonna change this
year or next let me start off by
acknowledging that 8k TVs are an
incredible technical achievement
they have 33 million pixels which means
you can get your face right up in there
real close and you can't make out
individual pixels it's more true to life
than ever before and genuinely feels
like you're staring through a window not
some giant TV screen let's see that
right there is your first problem you're
gonna need a really big TV to tell any
difference between 4k and 8k 55 inch TVs
won't do the job 65 inch won't work
we're talking 75 inches and above and
here at CES companies are going bigger
and bigger and bigger Sony just
announced a 98 inch LCD TV and LG has an
88 inch OLED I don't even want to think
about how much those will costs that's
just one example Samsung's 82-inch
Hewlett 8k TV runs ten thousand dollars
but the most pressing problems facing 8k
is content because there's just none of
it honestly right now your best hope is
maybe some mkbhd videos Nate Kay or
random YouTube scissor wheels there's
just not a lot happening from Netflix to
Amazon to Hulu no one's announced any
firm plans to stream anything in 8k and
most films even when they're shot in 4k
get mastered down in 2k and as for cable
TV or satellite well how much do you
watch in 4k on those things right now
exactly there's virtually nothing now
Samsung and Sony and all these companies
are gonna tell you that a I can help
upscale 4k content so it looks just like
8k I'm not convinced quality's not quite
the same but if spending ten thousand
dollars to watch drone footage or nature
YouTube content is your kind of thing by
all means buy an 8k TV maybe by the time
a Betar 2 comes out someday this will
all be better but right now it's not I
don't trust it and neither should you
there having said all that there's
definitely some TV tech here at CES that
is worth getting very excited over I
mean did you see LG's Robo TV I think
it's unreal and Apple's AirPlay 2 is
coming to all the latest TVs from brands
like Samsung vizio LG and Sony that's a
big deal and the payoff is coming this
year as opposed to sometime down the
line and finally we're seeing many TVs
make the long-waited upgrade to HDMI 2.1
and that lets much more data pass
through the HDMI cable so you can watch
4k at 120 frames per second or 8k at 60
frames per second now yes that means
we're all going to buy new HDMI cables
at some point in the future but right
now you're fine all this leads to the
future there are new technologies on the
way and the most exciting one to me far
and away is called micro LED micro LED
has the potential to be even better than
Ola which is the best picture quality on
the market right now it has millions of
tiny self emissive LEDs that put out a
superior picture with none of odds
drawbacks like burn in or natural
degradation over time micro LED displays
are modular so you can make them into
any size in the aspect ratio or any
resolution that you want last year we
saw Samsung's giant the wall and for
2019 they're showing off a 4k micro LED
TV that it can actually fit inside your
living room now it's gonna be a while
before you or I can buy a micro LED TV
these displays require a painstaking
precise manufacturing process and few
companies can do that at scale right now
but it's still damn exciting because we
I have been waiting for a true OLED
killer for years now and it's almost
here
it is fun to get excited about the
future that's what CES is all about but
if you plan to buy a new TV either this
year or next you should go 4k without
even considering anything else
I am a self-professed home theater nerd
all the way I want 8k to do very well
but now is not the time to buy or even
consider an 8k TV the card has gotten so
far ahead of the horse that it's silly
there's just no content to watch on
these amazing looking TVs all of these
companies keep making more and more 8k
TVs because they can they look great but
they're coming out before anybody else
is ready for it
hey thank you so much for watching all
of our CES coverage this week we're
starting to wind things down but for all
of our great tech videos as always
