look like a techno cyborg jerk that's
exactly what Intel is making these smart
glasses are called vaunt and they're
completely different from what you're
expecting what's amazing about these
glasses is they look normal and they
feel really light in my head they've
only weigh about 50 grams they're
designed to do just one thing show you
simple basic information in one of your
eyes it has this little red monochrome
projector that shines an image on a
holographic mirror thing which then
bounces it directly into my eyeball so I
don't have to focus on it it's just sort
of down there but the best part is that
if you're not looking just slightly down
to the display it completely disappears
so it's not distracting you the other
thing is you're not going to be tapping
and swiping and doing whatever you might
do like you did with Google glass
there's no camera here it's meant to be
not intrusive not annoying in social
situations but you can do little subtle
things like if a notification comes
anyone read it you can just kind of look
over and it'll slide in or you can
dismiss it like that
Vaughn glasses are a prototype project
from Intel's new devices group and later
this year developers are going to be
able to start using them now they do
need to be fitted to your eyes
interpupillary distance so that the
display can actually line up to your
eyeball so we went into Intel's lab in
San Francisco to try them out take a
look some what you see I whoa I I see it
red I see incoming call from CEO Brian
krzanich it fits interfaces it's
basically it's it's a heads-up display
it's just displaying some red text here
that I'm just seeing right below my
standard line of vision how on earth is
this thing showing me a heads-up display
because I don't see it on the glasses in
fact I don't even oh right there
I can finally see this thing is
projecting into my eyes that's right
what how is it visible is it a laser
what's the story
it is a pixel a victim yeah what is it
what is a vixen vertical cavity surface
emitting laser is this safe thing to
have absolutely it's so low powered it's
at the very bottom end of a class-one
laser
we had to integrate very very power
efficient light sources MEMS devices for
actually painting an image we use a
holographic grating embedded in the lens
to reflect the correct wavelengths back
to your eye the image is called retinal
projection so the image is actually
painted into the back of your retina if
you were prescription glasses the
prescription is used for looking at the
world but not for the image we send you
you can have terrible vision and still
see bright sharp clear image that looks
like it comes from infinity I know what
you're thinking a thing that shows
notifications in Maya all the time is
awful and Intel is very aware that you
think that's awful so they're trying to
be really smart about the stuff that it
shows you it's trying to only show you
really contextually important
information when these things are
available to buy what is it gonna do
like what sort of things is it going to
enable they're just gonna be you know
all my Twitter mentions rolling and my
eye all the time because that sounds
awful it's not okay as you're walking
around understanding where you are that
restaurant or at that restaurant which
one has a better yelp review as I'm
leaving my car getting instructions to
where it was actually going not where I
parked simple things that are you're in
the kitchen and you're cooking and go
Alexa I need that recipe for cookies and
it just appears on your glasses we are
providing a level of behavioral AI to
our system that allows us to figure out
what to show you when why would I feel
like I need a pair of smart classes
especially but I could also get like a
SmartWatch that can also show me
notifications all the time
what I saw the first smartphone mmm-hmm
I didn't go and say wow right Chewie
that's gonna happen but the fact is
right Turing would have never happened
without smartphones we're excited about
this because it enables new use cases
for developers to come up with to try to
figure out what all those use cases
could be later this year Intel will open
an early access program so developers
can get units and start making stuff
that works with the vaunt by the way it
should work with both Android and
iPhones and throughout this whole
process Intel will continue to develop
its own companion app and a I and it
will release more prototypes with
different eyeglass styles
but then what happens why is Intel
making smart eyeglasses these are
incredibly difficult to make okay the
electronics in here are incredibly
compact
the Asics that we have included or of
our own design the apse processor is our
own as well just the whole thing is
custom right in order to fit in this
package okay so your Intel you can do
that crazy stuff but just because you
can doesn't mean you should so why yes I
think BK's been quoted to say data is
the new oil I think other people say
somewhat similar things the point is you
have to consume that data somehow so not
only do we want to manage the data and
help you compute in the data center with
Intel servers and all that other stuff
we also we want to want to be part of
presenting that data to you in a way
that you can consume so that's what we
do right so I just want to be clear when
you say that Intel thinks of data like
oil this this thing isn't about like
collecting all that your biometrics form
no right it's about taking all the data
it's a lot to be part of the story of
there's a million pieces of data that
might be useful to me and Intel wants to
be in that flow ok the data in a way
that it hasn't been before so here's the
bet with vaunt you want smart glasses
maybe you don't who knows but you
definitely don't want glasses that are
big and ugly and techie and so you have
to get over that hump of are you willing
to put technology on your face and the
magic here is they've made that hump
that you need to get over do you want
tech on your face totally easy like this
is fine this is not a thing that I'm
worried about wearing and once you get
past that issue of is this a thing that
I would be willing to wear then it's
possible that there could be a whole
bunch of emergent ideas I could come
these will help you because of what they
provide you because how they can win
over those constraints that other have
your screens can't or they ask you for
too much arriving at the grocery store
both hands on the car eyes scanning the
aisles for the products we need and we
have the shopping list somewhere right
but now we have it here so those are
very big dreams but will the tech
actually work these prototype glasses
definitely do but it's going to be up to
software
to make them actually useful and maybe
more importantly do you remember how
smartphones changed how we all talk to
each other what do you think smart
glasses are going to do will we accept
that the people we're talking to might
be reading face book on their glasses
when we're just trying to have a dinner
conversation you can't really tell when
somebody is paying attention to
something on a vaunt only the person
wearing the glasses can see it we're a
little ways from needing to worry about
those social questions but whether Intel
releases smart glasses first or somebody
else beats them to the punch this
technology is definitely coming so I'm
talking to you right now and you feel
like you mean so much I'm actually
playing a trivia game right now great
that's the future I want yeah yeah yeah
you can ignore people more efficiently
that way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
