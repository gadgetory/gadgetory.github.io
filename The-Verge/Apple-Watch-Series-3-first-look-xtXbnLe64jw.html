am looking at the Apple watch Series 3
as expected
this one has LTE connectivity which we
use it works without the iPhone so let's
check it out you can see here there's a
little calling icon at the top there
those dots in the middle are an
indication of your LTE signal strength
you can swipe up here you can also see
it there and then one aesthetic
difference between this watch and
previous generations is that you'll
notice the digital crown is red which is
supposed to indicate that this is an LTE
equipped series three Apple watch so it
looks exactly the same as the other
Apple watches that you've seen before
but there is one slight aesthetic
difference it is a little bit thicker on
the bottom here so if you look at this
heart rate sensor module here and you
were to compare that to an older watch
in fact I'm wearing one right now you
can see that it's just the slightest bit
thicker
hey Apple says it's two sheets of paper
thicker which is just I know a brilliant
but typical marketing statement to make
about it but when I was wearing it on my
wrist earlier so I put this on really
didn't feel all that different and
honestly it doesn't look thicker just
looks the same as previous
apple watches aside from the addition of
an LTE modem one of the things that's
different on this watches watch OS 4
it's running new software and there's a
software that's going to run at all
Apple watches not just this one you can
see here that when you're scrolling
through your app dock now it is a scroll
vertically rather than across like you
used to there's some direct integration
with gym equipment so if you go to a gym
that happens to support Apple watch
software you can carry your watch
directly the gym equipment there is more
Siri integration you can basically talk
to Siri on the watch and it will talk
back to you which it didn't use to do
and even though these heart rate sensors
in the back look pretty much the same
except for a little bit of thickness
apple's doing some interesting stuff
around a heart rate tracking now it's
going to show you your resting heart
rate it's going to show you when your
heart rate is spiking even when you're
not working out so basically it's taking
the same sensor set but it's processing
the data and it's different ways to make
this smarter and I think that makes a
lot of sense because one of the big
drivers for people to buy smart watches
not just Apple watch but smart watches
in general are the health and fitness
tracking features right you get
notifications you can track your health
and fitness and in some cases to use it
for authentication like like Apple pay
but those are really the three main
value propositions I mean there's all
the other stuff too you can go
to a cluster of apps just like you used
to that hasn't really changed
so in a lot of ways the Apple watch
Series 3 isn't a dramatic difference
from previous versions but with the
addition of LTE and with the new
software it's largely going to be a
combination of things that make it a
little bit more capable than previous
watches it's not a replacement for
iPhone it's still in a relationship with
iPhone but it's a little more
independent without it now this new
Apple watch series 3 is going to be
available on September 22nd this one
with LTE costs 399 dollars there is
going to be a series 3 without LTE and
that's going to cross $329 and then the
serious one which is the original Apple
watch which doesn't have GPS doesn't
have waterproofing it doesn't have LTE
that one is 249 dollars series 2 has
essentially gone away because the series
3 without LTE is that for more coverage
