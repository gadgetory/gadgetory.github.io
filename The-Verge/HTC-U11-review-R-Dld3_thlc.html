year or so has had its own thing or
giving some have elongated screens some
of dual cameras some of modular
accessories you can snap on the back of
the phone not all of these things are
bad so we're actually quite good but
they're always for smartphone makers to
take they're otherwise very similar
devices make them a little bit different
HTC's new you 11 isn't unique here it
definitely has its own gimmick but
before I get into that let's talk about
the parts of the phone you actually care
about because for the most part you 11
is a really good premium smartphone the
you 11 is 600 of $49 unlocked from HTC
or just under 700 bucks if you get a
from Sprint which is the only carrier
selling the phone here in the US that's
premium pricing right up against the
best phones you can get from Apple or
Samsung now fortunately the U 11 can
hang in this premium space it's got a
great 5.5 inch display that's vibrant
and colorful premium build and a really
eye-catching design it's got a solid in
the liable camera and really fast
performance the Elevens glass back at
something it's just really vibrant and
reflective especially in my blue review
unit it's super nice to look at it as
typical for HTC really well-made too and
it's finally water resistant the U 11 is
ip67 rated just like the iPhone 7
but with glass or compromises and this
one is both a fingerprint magnet and
it's pretty slippery to hold now HTC
throws in a basic plastic case in the
box of the 11 but that gets scratched up
really quickly and covers up that nice
beautiful color so I think it's a poor
compromise I've been most impressed with
the U 11 fast performance it's got a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and 4
gigabytes of RAM and it's perhaps the
fastest Android phone I've used outside
of Google's own pixel apps open really
quickly the interface is really fluid
and scrolling is just as smooth as you
want it to be the you 11 12 megapixel
camera is also really impressive it can
take good photos in most any lighting
conditions in a capture steady 4k video
with something called 3d audio now it
may not win every head-to-head
competition with a pixel f8 or iPhone
but the Elevens camera didn't leave me
wanting whenever I used it either
speaking of audio the u 11 speakers are
really loud and really clear so if
you've been a fan of HTC's boomsound
speakers in the past
you won't be disappointed here but you
might be disappointed by the lack of a
headphone jack which is as annoying here
as it is on any other phone that doesn't
have one HTC does include an adapter and
a set of surprisingly good USB see
headphones in the box but those
headphones only work of EU 11 champions
with your laptop or tablet or whatever
other device you might carry around you
probably already know whether this would
be a problem C or not but it didn't take
me long to miss the headphone jack when
I got into my car and couldn't plug into
the aux port now battery life could be
better that's not to say it's bad but
it's just not as impressive as a snappy
performance and the rest of the phone
most things I'm able to get through to
evening before charging up but this
really isn't a small phone and to be
great if we could handle even more than
a day of heavy use out of the box the U
11 is running the latest software from
Google Android 7.1.1 and it has some
light customization from HTC and I think
the software is great it's fast easy to
use and it's not too far away from what
Google Offers on the pixel you 11 even
supports app icon shortcuts and in
standard launcher now there's not one
but two intelligent assistants on the U
11 and soon there's going to be a third
you already know how Google assistant
works and you can use okay Google to
launch it even when the screen is off
agency has also included its own
assistant that tries to give you helpful
tips on when to charge your phone where
to go for lunch and what the weather
will be like tomorrow but most of these
are pretty obvious things or already
handled better by Google's own assistant
I'm more excited about the forthcoming
Alexa integration which will allow me to
yell LexA and my phone to do a bunch of
things I normally ask an echo to do
that's not gonna be available till later
to summer so I haven't been able to test
it yet okay so at the beginning of this
I told you there was going to be a
gimmick so here it is HTC expects you to
squeeze the sides of this phone to do
things you can launch an app turn on a
flashlight launch Google assistant or do
other tasks with either a short or long
squeeze now the feature works as
advertised and I had no problem
activating it but I'm just not sure why
I'd ever want to do this they're already
quicker and more comfortable ways to do
many of these tasks and squeezing the
sides of a phone never feels normal or
intuitive it seems like this feature is
a little half-baked and maybe it'll get
more interesting in the future right now
it's a totally forgettable gimmick so no
the u11 doesn't have an edge to edge
screen it doesn't have a dual camera
setup and it doesn't have modular
accessories they can snap on to the back
of it it's very much a traditional
smartphone just like we've expected
smartphones to be for the past 10 years
but at the same time it's a really good
smart phone so if that's all you're
looking for the U 11 is it
I believe you okay Google to wake the
phone up like that owned
I got owned myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
