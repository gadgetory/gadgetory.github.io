last year by dropping contracts and data
limits and cementing itself as the bad
boy of wireless carriers CEO John Legend
also helped with that last night the
company continued that tradition these
high and mighty do opolis that are
raping you for every penny you have if
they could do something nice for you
they would the hate you these
days t-mobile is trying every possible
way to get customers to try out its
service the latest attempt is called
test drive and it's exactly what it
sounds like anyone can now go into a
t-mobile store and walk out with an
iphone 5s that runs on t-mobile's
network and comes with the company's
unlimited plan free of charge at the end
of the week people bring the phone back
and either sign up for the plan or
return it with what t-mobile says are no
strings attached and who is providing
all these iphones to test-drive apple
according to legend apple is giving the
iphones to t-mobile for free in support
of the program but Ledger's on carrier
announcements didn't stop there thanks
to a new partnership between the phone
carrier and streaming music service
Rhapsody t-mobile customers will now
have free access to internet radio
starting june twenty second i'll be at
only customers that pay eighty dollars
or more a month get it for free the rest
of its customers will still be able to
get access to it for four dollars per
month and even non t-mobile customers
can sign up for 499 a month it's a clear
attempt to take on services like Pandora
which claims to have 77 million active
users as of last month unraid EO differs
though by offering unlimited song skips
offline options and no ads it may not
compare to companies like spotify and
rdio which offer the ability to listen
to full albums consecutively or organize
a library of music but unraid EO is
really just a value add giving
prospective customers another reason to
sign up with t-mobile the company also
announced a new initiative called music
freedom which rids customers of data
caps when using a select group of music
streaming services these include the
aforementioned Rhapsody Pandora Spotify
iHeartRadio iTunes radio slacker
Samsung's milk and the forthcoming
streaming service from Electronic Music
destination beatport it'll also be
taking votes from customers through its
website and on Twitter for other
services to add to the list of
exemptions well this may all sound
wonderful and right in line with
t-mobile's uncarrier image
it's not a good look for net neutrality
because t-mobile is essentially deciding
which companies observe free data and
which ones don't yeah you know I fear
behind the verge so the mobile the music
freedom thing is pretty interesting but
from a net neutrality perspective I
think it's problematic to treat a
certain kind of data differently than
other data just because it's music and
I'm wondering if you guys thought
through those issues and if as a as a
you know data first kind of company if
you think that's problem so you actually
think that somebody would have a net
neutrality problem with you giving it to
them for free thank you kind of got it I
guess yeah I I I don't agree especially
since you know if you have a different
service that you want and it's being
used we will put it's a technical
inclusion in the process it takes a
short period of time to get the
appropriate site get the URL figure out
how to whitelist it and get it on the
network so it's more so than that our
idea is to give free streaming of music
to everybody and i I don't I don't
foresee the uncarrier issues and what
we're doing with the industry being
other than something that the proponents
of net neutrality would really be
supportive of whether that's true or not
what's to stop t-mobile from withholding
music freedom from services that aren't
and John Ledger's good graces</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
