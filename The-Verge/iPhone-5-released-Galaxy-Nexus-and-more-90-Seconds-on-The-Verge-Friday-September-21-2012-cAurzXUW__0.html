David Pierce and this is the 90 seconds
on the verge freestyle dubstep remix the
iPhone 5 is now available Apple's taller
slimmer smartphone went on sale at eight
a.m. local time this morning we had a
chance to review the phone this week and
it really is the best iphone yet it's
thinner a little bit taller because it's
got a bigger screen and and it is using
some new materials there's glass on it
but you've also got this new aluminum
back the LTE is fast the battery life is
solid and the four-inch screen is
gorgeous unfortunately we haven't found
a whole lot to like about iOS 6 it's the
best iphone yet but is it really
covering new ground debatable and jelly
bean has finally come to verizon's
galaxy nexus android 4.1 has been
available on the unlocked nexus for a
few months but only now is the verizon
version getting the upgrade from ice
cream sandwich the new update vastly
improves performance adds expandable
notifications and introduces eerily
intelligent personal assistant Google
now now all we need is a new flagship
google phone given that the nexus is
about a year old at this point and
finally boeing is making all of your
inflate dreams come true the aerospace
company is planning to outfits some of
its aircraft with equipment that will
allow inflate cell phone and Wi-Fi use
all Boeing 747 777 and 787 plans should
be cellphone friendly by 2013 the
equipment would still need to be
approved by the FAA though yep there's
always a catch that's it for today's top
stories tune in tomorrow for open mic
