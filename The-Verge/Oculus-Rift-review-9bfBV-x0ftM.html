oculus rift since I tried a prototype
for the very first time three years ago
but the rift also represents something
we've been waiting on for decades real
high-quality virtual reality Mars take a
trek through a prehistoric jungle tore a
house that has not yet been built it's
called virtual reality and as Jay Shafer
found out all it takes is a special
helmet the glove and you're off your
guess the first really powerful VR
headset you can buy a piece of
technology that feels like something out
of science fiction but the rift isn't at
the cutting edge of virtual reality
right now the most revolutionary VR
brings your whole body into a game that
oculus motion controllers aren't coming
out until later this year when that
happens the rift could feel a little
like the holodeck right now it's more
like those nutrient pods from the matrix
but you know what those nutrient pods
are a lot of fun before we actually plug
into virtual reality we should talk
about how the rift looks because oculus
has some excellent design work here
before you even open it all the parts
come in a black carrying case with a
magnetic top I'm not sure how durable it
is but it has a great texture and the
actual hardware looks even better the
rift doesn't look like a gaming device
or an old sci-fi movie prop it looks
classy for a big face mask anyway the
most important part here is the headset
but there's also a tracking camera plus
an Xbox one controller that you'll use
for most of the games the last thing is
a little remote that you can use for
very simple games or for controlling
video oculus has its own app with a game
catalog which you can use either inside
or outside VR the oculus rift is
launching with 30 games which cost
anywhere from $5 to $60 the cheapest
ones are mostly ported over from the
gear VR and playing them on the rift has
mixed results
this kind of dead secret and it's a
point-and-click adventure game that I
actually really liked on gear VR also
it's kind of a case where the gear VR is
actually better than the oculus rift for
it because the whole point of this game
is that you're supposed to be able to
turn 360 degrees and look at whatever
you need to they here that would get me
tangled up in this cord really horribly
so instead you can press a button and
you'll sort of blink around it's done
the the sort of blinking motion is there
to cut down on motion sickness and it'll
actually work pretty well
it just doesn't feel quite as good this
is also a game I really like to play
with the remote because the whole idea
is that it's very very simple you're
supposed to use or if the equivalent of
a mouse in VR so a food game controller
just sort of seems weird so this is
exactly why they put it there loud one
of the most fun obvious things to do in
the rift is pretend your chair is some
kind of cockpit whether that's a jetpack
a spaceship or a car on some weird 360
degree racing mobius strip so the really
interesting thing about radial-g is that
it's a 360-degree track and you're
trying to outrace everyone else while
not falling off it occasionally and
trying to find the fastest path it is a
super intense game with super intense
techno music and that's what makes it
fun in VR and no matter how crazy this
looks I actually don't really get motion
sickness in it because it's kind of like
driving a car those games are all
first-person but there are actually a
lot of titles that make you an invisible
observer The rifts tracking system means
you can lean around like you're looking
over a tabletop model it's a smart
system and it's probably the least
likely to make you motion sick the
camera isn't moving until you move your
physical body I've wondered for a while
how long I'd be able to stay in the
oculus rift at a time and it's actually
pretty long if I adjust the headset too
tight I'll get a headache and until
somebody installs a hands-free Soylent
tube here I might end up missing a lot
of meals while I'm playing a few
experiences do make me sick
mostly ones that weren't originally
imagined as VR games but otherwise I can
spend hours without taking it off and
more importantly I really want to spend
hours so if you've ever played Dark
Souls Chronos is pretty much exactly
like Dark Souls in that you know the
third person character you have shield
you've got heavy attacks you get to
dodge and you have to fight a bunch of
monsters and it's sort of unclear what
they are but you're
this dark fairytale Kingdom that has
much more going on plot wise than I am
willing to reveal here but it's actually
incredibly interesting the sort of big
difference between this and how we
probably work if it weren't in VR is
that you'll see there's not a camera
following you there's just one in
various directions as I move around this
can actually get sort of complicated
because it means that if a monster comes
up in a taxi and I'm trying to dodge
right here okay then backs me up and
then suddenly they've got this entire
different camera angle to go through it
is maybe not the best decision but
that's alright because this game is fun
enough the elephant in the room here is
that you could play a lot of these games
just as easily on a normal PC or console
screen even if it wouldn't feel the same
there's nothing stopping you from
getting up and moving around in the
headset I can take a few steps to either
side and still have it track me but
oculus is launched lineup is a lot of
games that you'll want to sit in a chair
and play they don't take advantage of
the thing I like most about VR the fact
that it can put your body into an
experience especially when I don't have
an avatar I start feeling like a
disembodied brain hooked up to an Xbox
controller of course virtual reality
isn't just about video games oculus has
photo and video apps so you can see 360
degree movies and pictures you can also
watch 2d video like twitch streams or
anything stored on your hard drive in a
virtual movie theater it's got a few
interactive animated shorts like lost in
Henry but for now that's about all
oculus has put a lot of non gaming apps
on the gear VR and it makes sense that
we could see things like Netflix come
out to the riff after launch and
everything will change later this year
when the oculus touch controllers are
released touch let you do things like
sculpt with your hands realistically
grab and throw things and play action
games that involve real physical action
at its best the oculus rift lets you
have new experiences that would be
totally impossible outside virtual
reality right now it's mostly adding an
extra dimension to more familiar ones
but that extra dimension is still worth
seeing especially with the game's oculus
has lined up the rift isn't nearly as
cool as it might be in six months but
that doesn't mean it well
blow your mind just a little</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
