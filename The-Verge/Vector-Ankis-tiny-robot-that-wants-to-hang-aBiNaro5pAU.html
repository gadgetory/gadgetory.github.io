apparently this little guy right here
named vector he's a home robot from Anki
and here's a question what can you do
with know if you're familiar with Anki
you know that they make another robot
called cosmo that looks a lot like this
little dude but the differences are that
this thing is way more powerful it's
designed to be always on it's connected
to Wi-Fi and it knows what's going on
around it all the time it's just sort of
looking around hanging out and it has a
lot more powerful technology and it - so
there's a laser sensor on the front
little capacitive sensor here so I can
feel if you're petting it it has four
microphones so it can hear you say its
name and respond to you and answer
questions like what's the weather like
to understand what all of that means we
came to Aki's offices here in San
Francisco to talk to the people that
made vector and find out what they think
you can do with it on key calls vector a
home robot which makes you think about
Rosie from the Jetsons but vector can't
really do that much it can do some very
basic assistant stuff like Alexa but Aki
is spending way more time working on the
robots personality than its utility you
can think of them as an older brother
for Cosmo but definitely not Cosmo hey
Victor I have a question what's the
distance from San Francisco to Los
Angeles
hey vector set a timer for 10 seconds
every one of our products will be a
character it'll have a name it'll be
different personalities because if you
have a robot that helps you with you
know with something more functional or
Hazen meant to do something in
healthcare or security or something like
that it's a very different type of
personality but still has to be an
interface that's actually very intuitive
and very warm a robotic personality
could very quickly become really
gimmicky so vector doesn't actually talk
too much it just sort of chirps and
beeps like a little Joyce unless you
specifically ask it a question but more
importantly its actions are designed to
react to the environment which makes it
feel a little bit more alive we really
place close to tension to have behaviors
be based on either sensors or what the
user is is doing so that was a big piece
for us not just having a robot who was
entertaining briefly but something that
felt very alive over the course of the
day the thing that's really different is
that he has interactions that are
physical and based on you hanging out
with him so if you turn on music he'll
pick up the exact P and he'll start
dancing to the beat right like that's
new or you know if I pet him he'll get
really blissed-out by it and then
there's things that we didn't design
that just happened so if you turn on the
TV he will watch that TV because he's
listening to the sound yeah and then the
screen triggers his motion detector so
he gets really interested by different
things personality may go a long way but
is that really enough reason to buy a
quote-unquote home robot when you think
about kind of that stereotype of the
humanoid robot you end up going into a
bad place for two reasons one is you hit
a price point that is totally
impractical for the level of capability
as possible today right and you end up
pigeonholing yourself because you end up
trying to match the strengths and
weaknesses of a human which don't map
perfectly to the strengths and
weaknesses of robotics today and if you
miss anything you hit on Kenny
the uncanny valley which is uh basically
creepy and unnatural by making a
character that is very humanistic in its
qualities but far but not trying to
sound or look or feel like a human you
actually can better match your strengths
and your weakness and avoid the
weaknesses right
you can set expectations right way B and
so the fact that he's still a cute
little character I don't expect him to
give me a beer which is the test exactly
right so vector can't bring you a cold
one but that doesn't mean it's not
technologically advanced it basically
has the guts of a smartphone inside it
including a faster processor and Wi-Fi
which means that it can always stay
connected to the Internet and doesn't
really need you to take care of it it
can hang out on its own find its own
charger and not fall off the table it
does a lot of that with surprisingly
advanced computer vision for such a tiny
package so what you're seeing here is a
visualization of the robot and as I turn
him he can feel it by virtue of that
gyro I talked about yeah he knows he's
turning in space and you can also see
he's building slowly building maps so
I'm gonna manually drive him around so
you can see you can see his cube in 3d
and they go like I was saying before
that's using the the marker and if I
move that around you can see it moves in
3d and now I'm gonna show you show them
the cube and so he sees it just and he's
able to position it he knows exactly
where that is really down to the
millimeter Wow
cuz that's what it takes for him to pick
it up so is it able to place our faces
and space as well in this map yeah see
in your eyes nose and mouth there and if
we if we introduce ourselves to him
he'll eventually associate a name with
each of these places you're the green
where I've shaded on the blue am Jade
moving in space and you can see if I
move closer it will also move move
closer this thing can recognize faces
how are you doing facial recognition on
a little tiny robot what's interesting
is most people's eyes are about the same
distance apart so that's a that's a
known distances which is all we really
need so by realizing how far apart my
iOS eyes are in the image I can tell how
far away the face is roughly but it lets
him remember where I am in space which
means that if he decides is going to
pick up that cube he turns around and
drives over here uh-huh
he remembers I'm here and that allows
him to do something we call referencing
which is something kids also do right
before they they want to do something go
often sort of look up at you make sure
you're watching them he can do that as
well it can turn back and check
me out and then go and pick up this cube
and what's powerful about that is it it
takes it from being an experience where
you're watching a robot pick up a cube
right to one where you're sort of drawn
into the experience and in doing it
doing in with him or break life so he
can tell if you're making eye contact he
can tell if we're looking at each other
instead of him right so we can also use
that information to try this behaviour
hey vector fist-bump you can turn around
drive around he's sitting in his home
right now imagine gonna put him on our
counter like sound the floor a coffee
table a party yeah so living room coffee
table kitchen table there's a we'd have
a accessory that's kind of like his
habitat and the keys that he's always on
you forget you should forget that you
there is an on/off switch he'll charge
himself go back this charger he'll be
sleeping for part of the day he'll wake
up when something interesting happens
and a lot of this is gonna be the magic
that builds out all of the subtleties
around him being alive okies launching
the vector robot on Kickstarter today
and when it ships in October it's gonna
retail for about 250 bucks but if you
get this thing don't expect it to have
the same utility is even a $50 Amazon
echo after all this thing is only part
digital assistant it's also part toy and
part I don't know little cute robot bed
thing but what it actually is is a
chance to experience what it's like to
have an autonomous robot in your house
it turns out the main utility of the
vector robot is something we don't talk
about very much in tech it's fun thanks
so much for watching I want to know what
would you do if you had a little tiny
robot in your house let me know in the
comments and oh hey one more thing we're
gonna be taking a little break I've got
jury duty people who have vacations and
will be back sometime in September and
so I'm just gonna roll this on for a
little bit longer because that's what I
do goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
