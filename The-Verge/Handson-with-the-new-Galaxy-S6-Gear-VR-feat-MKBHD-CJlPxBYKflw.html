we're at MWC we just got to look at
Facebook and oculus is new version of
the gear VR works with the galaxy s6 we
also have the older version here that
has the note 4 in it the new version
here is using the s6 and it's got a
higher pixel density screen you got the
same effective resolution in this as you
do in this one but the effect is going
to be greater and it's inside the new
version the gear VR overall the the
whole package is a little bit slimmer
the straps are a little bit lighter it
doesn't weigh so heavily on your head as
the previous version did and then when
you actually have it on the movies look
a lot better you can actually sit
through a couple minutes of a cinema
experience that they have inside here
whereas in the previous version it was a
little bit harder to see you had the
sort of screen door if that where you
could see the pixels another thing I
noticed after having tried both is that
yes is lighter a lot of it is because
the phone itself is lighter and also
these are physically different size
phones so this Note 4 version won't work
with the s6 version and this s6 version
won't working with the s4 or the note 4
so you have to get the one that
corresponds to the phone you have but
like you said the s6 lots of people are
gonna buy it most people have the
opportunity to try it out yeah everybody
involved here Facebook
oculus and Samsung are gonna reach a lot
more people now that a flagship phone
can work with something like this as
opposed to something that was a little
bit more niche with the note 4 I got
thrown into the middle of a dog play
don't worry I took a bunch of them out
for you not enough everything else it's
basically there's gonna be some more new
content that's gonna take advantage of
the higher pixel density screen
everything's basically already on the
oculus Home Store in the Samsung store
so if you have a gear VR you can check
that out now but you're gonna want to
get your hands on the s6 editions to
actually check out the higher pixel
density it's pretty cool
all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
