Google both fight to connect the world
one high-altitude UAV at a time I'm
Russell Brandon and this is 90 seconds
on the verge Google is acquired Titan
aerospace a company developing
solar-powered drones that can reportedly
stay in flight for years at a time
Titans team will stay in New Mexico but
work closely with Project loon Google's
original initiative to use weather
balloons to bring internet access to the
world at large that team will also
reportedly work with turbine company
Makani power which Google picked up in
May of last year it sounds crazy using
drones to bring the world online but
surprisingly enough Google isn't the
only company with this strategy last
month Facebook announced plans to
engineer its own fleet of Internet
equipped solar-powered drones just like
Google it would aim to bring
connectivity to the estimated two-thirds
of the world that's currently offline
according to a Wall Street Journal
Facebook also considered buying Titan
earlier this year but ultimately decided
on the uk-based Ascenta to make its
airborne routers so all these American
companies look to deploy drones across
the world we're still not sure how to
regulate drones at home the Federal
Aviation Administration has until 2015
to outline safety regulations for
commercial UAVs at that point Titan says
its drones will be ready to deliver
connections up to 1 gigabit per second
across a thousand miles of remote
countryside with each drone lasting up
to five years at a time if you're
already connected then Amazon would like
to offer you deliveries by drone
assuming it doesn't get stuck in a UAV
traffic jam for more on the future of
drones check out the verge coming up we
take a look at Operation Magic School
Bus a fleet of nano drones designed to
enter through your nostril to learn
about the central nervous system</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
