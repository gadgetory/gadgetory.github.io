invaded and Angelina Jolie was like a
general and she just starts getting
bigger and eventually she's like 800
pounds and it got to the point where my
only out was to jump in the toaster
suddenly one of these prehistoric giant
birds just comes up and just eats my
graphicly just visually rips her apart
we had to deal with the repercussions of
this like mangled body of my mother and
like walls start disappearing and like
people are watching me but at some point
I was flying
you're just airborne and you came down
and like I landed on a ramp and like Bob
Balaban is standing there I'll just say
hey Bob and then they kind of like get
like a cross-section so you see the dead
baby in the center but there's like
layers and layers of paint around it and
then there's this weird crazy flip where
like I bring Ben Franklin with time
machine into the present day and I'm
just like showing him around and he's
like I was saying you know his mind is
alone like everything I showed him his
Wikipedia article he was like yeah I had
syphilis what happens when we go to
sleep at night I've always been an
advocate for a good night's rest when
most of my colleagues are still dashing
off emails or enjoying a nightcap I'm
usually in bed by 10:00
two o'clock a solid nine hours but
beyond appreciating the benefits of rest
I have to admit that I'm also drawn to
the fanciful imaginings that often come
with it dreams but not just any dreams
dreams I can control
Oh
you
dr. Andrew Varga is a neurologist at the
NYU Sleep Disorders Center sleep is a
really evolutionarily preserved
phenomenon from from creatures that you
wouldn't even think would have sleep
things like C elegans which is a little
worm - fruit flies you get bombarded
with all this experience during during
wakefulness and sleep is thought to
maybe help you sort of figure out like
what's worth filtering out and what's
worth kind of retaining do we know what
is going on in the brain when someone
has a lucid dream lucid dreaming differs
from regular dreaming during REM in that
certain frontal areas bilaterally seems
to get much more activated during lucid
dreaming
you know the idea I think in to some
extent behind lucid dreaming is that you
create a little bit of a hybrid state
that doesn't otherwise exist right part
of your brain is essentially rip remains
asleep and remains dreaming but part of
the brain actually enters a state of
wakefulness lucid dreaming it's the holy
grail of sleep imagine having complete
control over the world around you it's
like the most immersive virtual reality
experience and it doesn't cost you a
dime just a warm blanket and lots of
practice I've always had weird dreams
like most people and been curious about
what they meant was my psyche trying to
process some earlier life trauma or
teach me important life lessons or was
my gray matter simply performing various
restorative functions with dreaming
simply an arbitrary side effect in
trying to figure that out I read a book
about lucid dreaming written by Thomas
pizzelle a very active lucid dreamer and
it made me think lucid dreaming could
help me figure out what it all means and
even if it can't well it sounds pretty
damn fun do you ever get confused about
whether or not you are awake or asleep
yes
do you think you're awake right now I am
awake are you am i dreaming I'm also
dreaming III think I mean what are some
of the most intense or crazy or profound
lucid dreams that you've had I mean do
you do remember them like in like a
vivid way or do they tend to sort of
fade I was once told by an oak tree I
asked how were you so strong how can I
be like you and it said build something
that will outlast your body I've gotten
a great advice from an eight-foot-tall
Abraham Lincoln a whale made of light
told me all matter has its origin and
spirit and it showed me that if you make
changes here in the dream world you can
actually affect the physical world that
these are two parts of the same whole
also if I said the word Cosi spasm does
that mean anything to you you know when
you get into bed and it is so cozy that
you just have to like kick your feet and
like do a little freakout like it's so
warm in the bed that's the kind of
spiritual practice I'm talking about so
I want to be a lucid dreamer what do I
need to do well you already are a
dreamer so you got that down I am
knowing you are a dreamer that every
single night you have access to this
rich inner world the next thing is about
remembering your dreams so go to bed
with a paper and pad next to you next to
your bed wake up and you know that
you'll have a dream so keep that keep
that journal next to perform techniques
like the wake back to bed so if you set
your intention in the beginning of the
night I'm going to become lucid you're
gonna you're not going to be come into a
dream in for another 90 minutes so the
goal with the wake back to bed is to
sleep for six hours straight wake up in
the middle of the night or six hours
later and now you're going to stay up
about 15 minutes setting your intention
that the next place I'll be will be a
dream and I will become lucid and then
you're going to go back to sleep and
essentially you're going to go right
directly into this REM cycle and with a
strong intention
can carry right over into a loose
adjourn and I would say more than all of
that it really is about waking up and
being present more in your waking life
that presence will carry over into your
dreams because that's essentially what
you're looking for is to wake up to the
present moment of a dream so when you're
when you're doing these practices yeah
get into your pajamas and get into that
cozy bed you know you're not just show
them right the spasm cozy spasm exactly
okay it's time to dream for the sake of
this experiment I've also set up a
camera in my room to document my dreams
the second I wake up shadow wants to
make the dream journal a mobile
experience while the app does allow me
to easily type out my dreams the
dictation function fixes that middle of
the night confusion that makes writing
in a dream journal difficult shadow also
pulls out key words from my dream and
creates a more visual experience one
that will help me train my brain to
recognize patterns in my dreams
good morning everyone and so I just woke
up after falling back to sleep for
another hour
huh I had a really intense dream and I
feel like it was the closest I've come
to having a moment of lucidity and a
dream it was just like a normal dream
I'm already starting to lose it but I
was in a car at a sports car next to
someone that a dude that like I knew but
I don't know who it was but like in the
dream I felt like I knew him and he was
speeding through like an empty city and
then I had this moment of like where I
just felt like really like in the car
like could like the wind temperature
from outside coming in and like feeling
the car like around my body and then I
was like slow down and like turn around
and like take me to this house so he
like turned around and and parked in
front of a 2-story house and I got out
of the car and then I woke up so now I'm
already forgetting the dream but it felt
like very very real it was really weird
so a good step it feels like I'm making
progress but I think it might be time
for an upgrade this is the REM II sleep
mask created by Duncan Fraser and
Stephen McGuigan of bit Bangor labs the
project was funded in 2012 through a
successful Kickstarter campaign Remmy is
a device that gives you this kind of
predictable signal your dreams it
flashes lights through your eyes while
you're in a dream and you can kind of
latch on to the two light patterns and
it helps you recognize the fact that
you're dreaming so you can say oh
there's the lights in the middle of a
dream like now I can start to control
the world around me originally and when
we'd start looking to it the main method
was sort of to brute force train your
brain to always check whether you're in
a dream throughout your day you have
some kind of action you would repeat
look at a clock look at text count your
fingers typically if you did that enough
during the day you might do it in your
dream however in the dream you look at a
clock and you look away and you look
back the time has changed or text is
very hard to read so what you're doing
is you're creating almost like a ticker
in your waking life that would then
carry over into your your dreams and
would cue you and and Remy kind of
automates that reality check process you
know you don't have to train yourself
necessarily all day to check your watch
or you know read words Remi continues
giving you predictable signals though
they are of your own design so when you
first turn on Remi you'll get a little
signal just the back-and-forth pattern
to let you know don't on and all the
lights are working at this point it's in
a regular mode which in default settings
means it's going to just not do anything
for five hours after five hours it's
going to start showing you signals every
15 minutes with what like a two minute
wiggle some of them are more jarring
you'll get just all fulbright one eye
flashing back and forth and some of them
are just more like fading back and forth
like a Nightrider type pattern most
people say I saw it manifested as some
sort of other light source and a dream
they'll say you know I was standing
there and suddenly my kitchen lights
started going like this or ambulance
went by and was for me I generally see
them as lights as lights overlaid in a
dream you know like nothing incorporated
into the dream itself
they're still an inner play it's like
you suddenly nothing's there unless you
will it to be there it's more like
you're in a movie but all of a sudden
you don't to say your lines and and you
know take cues you can just do it
everyone Steve and I had talked about
was dreaming he talked about flying in
space
I just never done that and so the next
time I I was in this dream I flew into
space but I hit like a a painted space
ceiling like a diorama and it was really
fascinating to see how like I was able
to do what I wanted to do to a point and
then there was this sort of like
third-party interpretation of that Wiley
coyote thing yeah I think it doesn't
really interesting when you can kind of
bounce against your subconscious
good morning
night - with the Remy mask no lucid
dreams but I just woke up from a dream
that I was getting ready to get married
and I dreamt that I was like in a house
it was like my house or like a house I
was familiar with with Carl and we were
getting ready for our wedding because we
were like getting married that day and
we were like making food I don't know
why because it was a some other wedding
that is not the one we're planning we
were getting ready for our wedding and
then my oldest sister arrived and I was
like all excited to see her and then we
were lying on the grass and then my mom
got there which is unusual because she's
dead and she was wearing like the same
clothes she always wore which was like
total like mom pants like with the waist
up really high and I'm like I tucked in
like button-up shirt and she was there
she got there and we were like really
excited to see her and she was like
lying on the grass with us and then she
like turned over and gave me like a
really big hug and then that was when my
alarm went off and I woke up and I was
crying so
not the kind of dream I have every day I
don't have dreams about her a lot and it
was actually rather unpleasant booze Oh
as if it was a very very big dream I
feel like the last two nights with the
mask I don't know what it is but the
dreams have been like pretty intense I
don't know if that's a good thing or bad
thing
using Remy and shadow help me to have
more vivid intense dreams but I was
still unable to have a lucid dream that
will come with weeks months or maybe
even years of practice whether I'm using
my smartphone and LED mask or pen and
paper my brain is my only tool in the
end and while scientists continue to
wrap their heads around what dreaming is
and why we do it
developers and lucid dream enthusiasts
will continue to do their part creating
whatever gadgets and apps are needed to
better understand this bizarre tranquil
even frightening experience that happens
when we're trying to catch some C's in
the meantime I'll keep dreaming</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
