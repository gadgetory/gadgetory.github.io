this is the HTC One basically this phone
is HTC's hail-mary the company's been in
rough shape for a long time and it's
hard to say how many more chances it's
going to get to make a real dent in the
smartphone market the one is HTC pulling
out all the stops trying to prove it can
really be relevant again it has some
remarkable specs some impressive
features but how can it compete so let's
start with the hardware the one is
gorgeous
full-stop the 1x last year was one of
the best designed and best made phones
we'd seen and the one bests it in every
way it's light and thin but it's matte
aluminum body still feels really sturdy
and strong the back curves ever so
slightly and the chamfered edges sloped
down toward the front of the phone so
the whole handset kind of just Nestle's
into your hand the phone's back and
edges are pretty minimalist they're
silver with white accents plus beats and
HTC logos and there's only one port a
micro USB that doubles as micro HDMI on
the bottom the power button is on top
which is a little awkward to reach on a
phone this big but at least there's a
good reason there's an IR blaster
built-in to the power button which lets
you use your phone to control your TV
the software for doing that isn't great
but it does work and it's a handy
feature to have there's a little more
going on on the front of the phone there
are speaker grilles on the top and
bottom which both look cool and sound
awesome they create a really nice stereo
effect as you hold the phone sideways
and they're a lot louder than most phone
speakers I think the rules don't apply
to you as you disagree with some free
watch there's some beats software at
work here and it does make a noticeable
difference though it's basically just
adding a low-end to whatever you're
listening to but the star of the show
here is the 4.7 inch 1080p display in
between those speaker grilles with tiny
black bezels on either side 1080p
displays aren't exactly novel anymore
we've seen similar displays on the droid
DNA the sony xperia z and the like but
this one is every bit as good and even a
little sharper since its 4.7 inches
instead of five like the other devices
colors are great text looks fantastic
viewing angles are really good the
screen is not super bright and it can be
tough to use outdoors but this is
otherwise one of the best smartphone
displays out there there are two buttons
below the screen flanking an HTC logo
you get home and back and for some
reason there's no multitasking button
that's fine you just double tap the home
button to get to the multitasking menu
and long press to get to Google now but
the buttons are really awkward to press
unless you hold the phone in two hands
just because they're located off to the
sides the one is running Android 4.1.2
which is already outdated software and
is missing some of the nice Android 4.2
features and as always it's skinned by
HTC's Sense software HCC's tone sends
down a lot over the years but it's still
pretty unmistakable and HTC has even
done some new things in this version the
most obvious new thing here is blinkfeed
which is basically Flipboard for your
home screen HCC's theory is that you
want quick at-a-glance news on your
phone so it puts a scrolling
customizable news ticker right on your
home screen you pick a bunch of news
sources or connect Facebook and Twitter
and just watch the news roll in it works
and it's a fairly handy thing to have I
guess but it really just feels cluttered
and makes using the one kind of
exhausting plus without that much work
you could just use Twitter and Flipboard
widgets to create an even better system
in settings you can change it so you
have a more normal homescreen and then
the blink feed set up one screen to the
left and I actually found that was a
pretty perfect setup there are a couple
of other quick changes worth making on
the phone too by default the app drawer
only shows nine apps at a time which is
just a huge waste of space on such a
high res screen you can make it slightly
denser and you should you should also
sort apps alphabetically which just
makes things easier to find with some
effort those things work well but a few
things about cents continue to be kind
of a mess take the people app for
instance you can get around by swiping
through tabs in the holo interface or
you can tap on the header to switch or
you can tap on the other header to pick
your sources there are just too many
ways to do everything too many steps in
you have to remember and it just gets
confusing there are also a few ugly
icons and font choices which make the
one feel like a toy when it's really
much more than that otherwise in a lot
of cases HDC seems to be changing things
for the sake of changing things but one
place that's definitely not the case is
the camera instead of going for more
megapixels the one has what HTC calls an
ultra pixel camera which is a custom
sensor that's essentially a four
megapixel camera but with much larger
pixels that means in theory that the
camera can take in a lot more light at
once and even though you're getting
slightly smaller photos HTC doesn't
think you'll care that much
this approach is good and bad on the
plus side low light performance is
excellent I got shots in low light but
the iPhone 5 just couldn't and this is
definitely as versatile in that sense as
a camera like the Lumia 920 there's also
optical image stabilization which helps
in bad light so the shutter can stay
open longer but the downside is that you
get noisier softer photos there's a lot
of processing happening with each photo
which leads to a lot of softness and
sort of mushy photos and even in great
light photos don't feel particularly
sharp the photos look great at Facebook
or Instagram sizes and in fairness HTC's
betting that's all you want to do and
that's probably accurate there are a lot
of internal filters and settings for the
camera but the coolest one by far is
called Zowie basically it takes one
second video before you press the camera
shutter and three seconds after and then
lets you scrub frame by frame through
the video to pull out exactly the shot
you want it it works great and really
helps undo their shutter lag problem
every smartphone has the cameras are
trade off its photos aren't as sharp as
some of its competitors particularly at
larger sizes but there are a bunch of
cool features and you really can just
get shots you couldn't otherwise the one
runs Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor
with 2 gigs of RAM and it's just off the
charts even intensive games almost never
lagged or dropped frames and except for
a few pervasive Android issues like
scrolling which is for some reason still
jumpy on every Android device it's as
good as I've seen it's kind of overkill
honestly since a quad-core processor is
really beyond what you need and what any
software is tuned for and the
performance isn't noticeably better than
any other high-end phone but that's
obviously not a bad thing and it does
work really well call quality and
reception are about what you'd expect
noise cancellation was actually really
good on the one picking up less
background noise than the iPhone or
other Android phones I tested but it's
not a huge difference I didn't get to
test the LTE version but this unlocked
European model was fast and
on a team when you look at the ones spec
sheet from the superfast processor to
the big and high res screen it seems
impossible that the one would get good
battery life and it is impossible the
one will last a full day but only with
really light use and some serious
optimization in more practical use
you're going to want to keep a second
charger with you at all times after I
spent about 10 minutes demoting
blinkfeed fixing the app drawer and
installing a third-party keyboard I kind
of fell in love with the HTC One
actually I fell in love with it the
moment I took it out of the box but with
a little work it became not only a
beautiful phone but one I could actually
use to get work done there are a handful
of things I still hate about Sense and
the battery life is really unfortunate
but I can pretty easily say this is my
favorite Android phone yet
of course Samsung may have something to
say about that with the upcoming Galaxy
s4 but as of this moment the HTC One is
the gold standard for Android devices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
