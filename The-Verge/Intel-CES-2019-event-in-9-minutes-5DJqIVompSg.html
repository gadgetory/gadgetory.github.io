- Hey, good afternoon
everyone, and welcome to CES.
Thank you so much for
joining us here today.
So today, I'm pleased
to be here to announce
that we are launching six, new,
ninth generation core desktop processors,
from core i3 all the way up to core i9.
We'll also be bringing 9th
generation core processors
to our mobile family, our H-series line,
just next quarter in Q2.
Bringing that same high
level of performance,
for gamers, content
creators, productivity,
to our mobile H-series line.
So, stay tuned for that,
we are very, very excited.
So, for the first time
anywhere in public today,
I'm gonna demonstrate,
and we're gonna show
our Ice Lake, first volume,
10 nanometer client SOC.
This is it, right here, this
is the Ice Lake in my hand.
This is way more than just a CPU,
and it's packed with a bunch of firsts.
So, to show that off, a little bit,
I wanted Chuck to come out and show us
Ice lake in action.
- We've written a little script here,
I'm gonna go ahead and
enter on both of these,
now, this script is gonna go through,
is gonna look at all
those hundreds of photos,
that I have on each system.
And you're gonna see,
it's gonna look through all those systems
I've put in a category of water.
So, it's gonna find all those pictures
that I have, that have water.
And you're gonna see, with
each of these systems,
even though I have a
core i7 8th gen CPU here,
when I bring in the
advantages of Ice Lake,
it's gonna happen and go
through those pictures,
much, much faster.
- Right.
- You're gonna see, actually,
in this case, a 1.5x
improvement when I go through
and look for pictures with water.
- That's right, that's right.
- Before in the past, when
you had a system this thin,
this light, you had to
sacrifice something.
Usually it was, that CPU
performance and GPU performance.
But now, with Ice Lake, you
are now sacrificing nothing.
So, we've also got,
Thunderbolt on this one system.
So, you see one cable,
I've got a cable here
so you can hear the game,
but I've got one cable
going to a monitor, keyboard, mouse,
an external storage in, and I still have
that tremendous (mumbles)
graphics performance,
(mumbles) this type of gaming solution,
all in one simple solution.
- So, now you've gotta take a breath,
'cause we did that really fast.
You've shown Ice lake in the form factor,
great CPU, graphics, AI
work-load acceleration,
gaming and Thunderbolt 3 integration,
all on that package.
- Exactly.
- Awesome.
I'm gonna get a little
bit geeky for a minute,
so, bear with me.
But at the same time, I
think you'll appreciate
how some of these new
technical innovations
are helping us bring new
value to our partners
and users at the same time.
So, what I'm gonna talk about now,
for the first time anywhere,
is one of the first
products that take advantage
of that architecture and innovation,
and that is codenamed Lakefield.
I'm gonna show you a little animation,
on how Lakefield was put together.
We took a new approach, that's allowing us
to integrate different
CPU core architectures
into a single product, and
we call that a Hybrid CPU.
So, what you are looking
at in this animation,
is a processor that has five cores,
it has a 10 nanometer
high-performance Sunny Cove Core,
and it's combined with
four atom based cores,
so you get low power
efficiency, immersive graphics,
I/O memory, all in this tiny SOC,
which is approximately 12mm square.
We're pairing this
Hybrid CPU architecture,
with an innovative 3D packaging approach,
that we call Foveros.
Where we are able to actually
stack different pieces
of IP together in three
dimensions, instead of just two.
So, that SOC is now packed
with all the technology
in 3D, that people come to expect.
Drives longer battery life,
performance, connectivity.
We can do smaller chips, smaller boards,
more efficient, better designs.
It's gonna unleash some great performance,
some great platform
innovations in the industry.
And even more innovative devices.
So, we're not talking about
just a minor decrease in size,
I wanted to show you, the Lakefield board,
that we've built inside of intel.
Here it is, this is Lakefield.
On a reference board, that
we have done in house.
This is our smallest full PC motherboard.
- I'm super excited to
show you exactly how far
we've come with this Lakefield boards.
Here you can see, I've
got a smaller system,
I've got a video up and running,
I've also got the display monitor running,
so you can see (mumbles) computing
display working up there.
And I've also got a little
larger form factor here,
I've got a movie playing, full desktop,
OS experience, looking fantastic.
- You know, we wanted to go even beyond,
and show you Lakefield
working in systems today,
that it's possible scaling
down a very, very low
standby power and small
designs as he's got there.
But also scaling up in performance
to a full PC experience.
- I'm happy to announce that,
we at the tail end of 2018,
began shipping our next generation Xeon,
codenamed Cascade Lakes.
Cascade Lakes, is designed to handle
processing the world's data.
Today I'm excited to
talk about a way in which
we are expanding our
collaboration with Alibaba.
We caught up with Alibaba's
Chief Marketing Officer,
Chris Tung, just a couple of days ago
at their headquarters in Hangzhou,
and I'll let him tell you
a little bit about it.
- [Chris] Alibaba and intel are both
worldwide partners of the Olympics.
And I'm happy to announce
our next collaboration,
that will take us there.
Alibaba Cloud and intel
will deliver the first ever
AI powered 3D Athlete Tracking,
during the 2020 Olympic games in Tokyo.
This groundbreaking
technology will provide fast,
with more compelling insights into how
world-class athletes perform
and compare to one another.
We are very proud to work with intel
to reimagine the future of the Olympics.
- We've developed a
novel technology concept,
called 3D Athlete Tracking.
Unlike the way this is done today,
there's no special suits,
there's no special sensors here,
what we're doing is, taking
the data from regular cameras,
we are applying a AI algorithm,
a bunch of compute power,
and what you end up is a
super accurate digital model
of the athlete's performance,
and you can imagine that you can analyze
that information in many different ways.
- We've been working with
some great intel engineers,
to see just what Xeon processors
could do for range AI.
Here are two systems running range AI,
so, both systems are now
tracking the human movement
in the video.
On the exact same video.
With our current solution
on a GPU, we're inferencing
around 90 frames a second,
but on the Cascade Lake platform optimized
with the intel DL boost,
we are inferencing
at 450 frames, which blows my mind.
- And so, today, we're
announcing that we are expanding
our decade-long investments
in network infrastructure,
with a new network SOC,
codenamed Snow Ridge,
that is being developed
specifically for 5G wireless access.
What you see on the animation
on the screen is a simulation
of the traffic being
generated by this machine.
It's flowing through Snow
Ridge on this machine.
What Snow Ridge is able to do is,
it's able to differentiate between
these different applications,
and prioritize the application
that is most latency sensitive.
In this case, the remote
surgery application,
literally could mean the
difference between life and death,
in terms of the responsiveness
for that application.
You can see that is running
at 100 gigabits of traffic,
and it's able to prioritize
that remote surgery
application over the others.
This example, for example,
imagine a world where a surgeon
and a patient could be
in a different location,
and the surgeon could use a remote robot,
that mimics his hands gesture,
to instantaneously operate on a patient
in a different location.
I'm gonna show you another
product now on 10 nanometer.
Our Ice Lake server silicon
that follows Cascade Lake.
This is the first time we've
demonstrated this publicly,
and what you can see here is that,
we are running a machine
learning simulation,
with Ziva dynamic software,
and we're using it to
create this character,
Zeke the lion, on the
left, what you can see
is a machine learning simulation,
that's running on that Ice Lake server,
and this is the model that's being used
to create this character Zeke.
And on the right, what you can see is,
the Ziva software that's creating Zeke,
layer by layer from the
bones to the muscles,
to the skin and then
finally adding the fur.
And you can see how the end
result is incredibly lifelike.
So, we are very excited
about Ice Lake coming
to the market in 2020, the
follow one, the Cascade Lake.
In some, what you've seen over the course
of this presentation today,
is we've demonstrated
for you four products
running on our latest
10 nanometer process technology.
Ice Lake client, Lakefield client,
Snow Ridge for the data center,
and Ice Lake for the data center.
All having in common the 10
nanometer process technology
from the ultra low power in Lakefield,
to the highest performance in Icelake.
Thank you very much for joining us,
have a great CES, thank you.
