either a guitar hero or a rock band game
and yet somehow by coincidence this
October there's going to be both a new
rock band 4 and a new guitar hero live
what's interesting though is both
companies are taking the same formula
and doing a little bit of a different
twist on it some admittedly more than
others let's talk about rock band 4
first because it probably looks closer
to its predecessor than guitar hero live
rock band 4 has kind of the same
instruments maybe a little sturdier but
it is the same guitar same drums same
microphone what is different though that
rock band is playing up is that there
are new guitar solo mode is actually
kind of promoting improvisation at
certain sections when there's like a
guitar solo you would expect instead of
giving you the notes it's going to
basically guide you along with certain
patterns and by playing those patterns
you're kind of adding your own elements
unique twist but it does feel like a fun
little challenge it is tough it's tough
to make something sound good as long as
you're fucking the right rhythm and not
doing too much crazy stuff simply
holding down the right notes will give
you pretty cool scale patterns and those
who like really love metal you can
double tap to that is a big difference
drums have a little bit more of a fill
system that's less improvisational the
game's pass that is better it makes for
a tighter better sounding experience
robin for however is doing the big thing
of making almost every single song from
rock band 3 before backwards compatible
if you've bought it on your xbox one
account or you bought it on your
playstation account it's going to be
there so that's rock band 4 words really
taking what everyone loves about the
last game quite literally bring it over
to the new one guitar you're alive is
not doing any of that guitar you live is
a fresh start for the franchise there is
no compatibility because the guitar
itself isn't the same instead of the
normal five large buttons the neck
it's actually now three by two grid you
can think of it as three frets in two
strings if you're trying to compare to a
real guitar that's actually not that bad
it takes a little bit getting used to
but otherwise you are kind of playing
the same game maybe it feels a little
more like guitar chords and I did feel
that but otherwise you're going to get
the same experience after like a
learning curve but the big new feature
and the one Activision seems most proud
of is Guitar Hero TV and you can really
think about is a series of like 24 hour
music video channel it's kind of like
MTV too if you grew up in the 90s only
difference is you can now hop in and
play guitar hero along with the song
whenever you want there's a serious
different channels based on musical
taste some of them will be premium if
you want a lot of challenges or actually
pay real cash for it and what's really
cool that is the exact same stream for
everyone at the same time so if you're
playing I don't know monsters of men
into your same person la is playing the
exact same song and you can actually
compare scores and you kind of get
ranked globally which is a really cool
experiment so that's Guitar Hero live in
rock band 4 to actually different takes
with other game genre come into
next-generation consoles for the first
time this October but the question I
have is where is my ddr revival where is
dance dance revolution because i really
really miss 59 in sandstorm please make
that happen that's the rhythm game I
want</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
