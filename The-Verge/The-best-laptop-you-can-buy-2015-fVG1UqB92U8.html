also have tablets but when it comes time
to get a lot of work done
nothing beats a trusty old laptop a
laptop is great whenever you need to do
a lot of typing multitask between a
bunch of different programs or really
plow through your inbox the options for
laptops are seemingly endless and can be
daunting and if you choose the wrong one
you'll be living with that mistake for
years a good laptop is easily portable
fast enough for multitasking has a great
keyboard and trackpad has a display
that's bright and easy on your eyes and
lasts all day without needing to be
plugged in there are a lot of laptops
that offer some of those qualities but
the best laptop for the most people hits
all of the marks if you want the best
all-around laptop that you can get the
13-inch MacBook Air is the one you
should buy that shouldn't really be a
surprise the MacBook Air has been the
gold standard for years because it hits
all of the marks you need for a great
laptop computer it's super thin really
light really well-built and has a
best-in-class keyboard and trackpad
outside of gaming or video editing the
base MacBook Air is fast enough for the
vast majority of things you need to do
with a laptop the AERS display isn't as
good as the displays on the larger and
heavier MacBook Pros but it's bright and
good enough for web browsing and
watching video it also has awesome
battery life easily topping 12 hours
away from an outlet something that the
new even thinner macbook can't come
close to the macbook air isn't cheap but
if you use your computer for many hours
a day it's worth the investment if you
want a Windows computer the options for
you are even more daunting but Dells XPS
13 is an excellent laptop it's thin and
light just like the MacBook has an even
nicer display and it's powerful enough
in any configuration for most any tasks
the XPS 13 s keyboard is excellent and
while its battery life and trackpad
can't quite match the MacBook Air
neither are deal-breakers other Windows
laptops like Microsoft Surface pro 3 try
to be both a tablet and a laptop at the
same time but they're not really great
at either
it's a classic jack of all trades master
of none problem if you want to tablet
get a tablet but if you need a laptop
you should really focus on getting a
great laptop
there are ton of cheap Windows laptops
but if your budget is really tight and
strongly recommend considering a
Chromebook Toshiba's Chromebook 2 is a
great option it's got a great screen and
fast performance and only costs a few
hundred dollars
picking the right laptop is a big
decision this is a machine you're likely
to use day in and day out for at least a
few years do yourself a favor and make
the right decision and right now the
right decision for the most people is
the 13-inch MacBook Air</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
