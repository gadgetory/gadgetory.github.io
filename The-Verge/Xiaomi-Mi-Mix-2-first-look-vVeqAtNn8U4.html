we're checking out the new Jean Mimi mix
- which is the update to last year's new
mix full screen smartphone from Xiaomi
now the me mix 2 is actually a successor
to the original me mix that was launched
last year which was Johnny's first full
screen smartphone now mix 2 has a couple
of notable improvements over the me mix
last year first of all it comes in both
a standard and a special edition and
I'll get to the differences in a second
the biggest difference that you're gonna
notice between last year's phone and
this year's phone though is that it is
smaller this is now a 5.9 nine inch
screen which is still huge
but because the screen is pushed all the
way to the edge it makes a phone feel
smaller than it did before with a six
and a half inch screen of course the
screen is the star of the show here it
is an edge to edge panel it goes all the
way to the top edge of the phone and the
sides there's just a little bit of bezel
here and below it it's an LCD screen
with a wide color gamut
it's got 1080 pixels of resolution so
it's not quite as high-res and a Samsung
screen or something from LG but it does
look really nice outdoors and its really
vibrant and colorful the other things
that are really notable here is me mixes
ceramic back so this is a ceramic back
on a standard model and it kind of melds
into a metal frame here on the side now
if you opt for this special edition it's
an actual full ceramic unibody which
Joey says is the first phone on the
market to have this kind of feature the
back just kind of like morphs into the
frame of the phone it feels really great
in premium it's really really nice it's
also really really slippery and super
fingerprint T as well so it does it does
come with a case in the box but you know
then you cover up how pretty it is
so that's that's the difference between
the special edition and the standard
model so one thing about ceramic all
this happened is it's more resistant to
scratching than glass so that's one of
the positives of using it over say
Gorilla Glass however it is more brittle
which means that it shatters easier
which means that if you drop it on a
corner it's probably gonna break like I
just did it filled up out on two feet to
the ground and I heard it break I don't
know if you heard a break but there you
go that's
the problem with ceramic phones now
inside the phones got a snapdragon 835
processor which you can get with 64 128
or 256 gigabytes of storage it comes
with 6 could good bytes of RAM in the
standard model if you offer the special
edition you bump that up to 8 gigabytes
of RAM that's a lot of power and a lot
of performance pretty much just like any
other Snapdragon 835 phone I've used
this year it's really fast so it's got a
34 hundred million power battery that's
going to be pretty long-lasting for
anybody even if you're a power user for
me it's easily lasted all day and
multiple days that I've been using it
one thing it doesn't have is wireless
charging even though it has a ceramic
back there's no wireless charging so
that's a little bit of a bummer other
interesting things it's got dual SIM
card support support so you can actually
run two SIM cards at the same time and
it supports over 43 different network
bans which means it actually works here
in the US I've been using it on t-mobile
and I pretty much had signal everywhere
I expected to wherever I've gone which
is kind of unique for jelly phones if
you're familiar with them at all it's
got all these specs it's loaded with
premium design obviously the big screen
is the big star of the show here so
what's missing well it only has a single
camera it's a 12 megapixel camera with
optical stabilization eff 2.0 lens it's
got large pixels it takes decent photos
there's really nothing to complain about
with the camera it's not going to give
in galaxy s a or a googol pixel any
competition but it's a fine camera the
other thing that it's missing there's no
water resistance here so if you get it
wet you're kind of screwed and there's
no headphone jack it's just USB C port
on the bottom it does come with an
adapter in the box that will let you put
standard headphones on it but you can't
just plug headphones directly into it
and it doesn't come with a set of
headphones either so those are kind of
the things that you are missing out here
now for software this is running me uy9
which is based on android 7.1.1 this is
Jamie's custom version of Android it
really looks quite different than the
Android you might get from Google on a
pixel or on other phones it mostly looks
like iOS which you know personal
preference take it or leave it but it is
very customizable you can seem it and
make it look different ways pretty
easily as well
now the me mix 2 is going to be out real
soon in China it's going to start around
$500 goes up to over $700
you go for the full special edition and
then it's going to come to Jimmy's other
markets across the world but sadly it's
not coming to the US which is kind of
the story with every Joey phone no
matter how cool they are so you can't
buy that here but if you are able to buy
it and import it into the u.s. the cool
thing is it'll work here which is kind
of neat so there you go that's a real
quick look at the gemiini mix - for more
on this stuff be sure to check out the
verge comm be sure to subscribe to
youtube.com the verge and one thing that
doesn't have is
no it broke Wow
so there you go ceramic phones</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
