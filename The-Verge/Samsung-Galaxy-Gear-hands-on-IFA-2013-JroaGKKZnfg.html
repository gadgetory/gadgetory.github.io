Berlin and we take a look at samsung's
new galaxy gear smartwatch this is a
smartphone accessory the company is just
introduced can we takin our first look
at it unlike other smartwatches this one
actually comes with a embedded camera
it's 1.9 megapixel camera it also has a
speaker so it has this metal buckle and
a speaker and it has a metal case it has
multiple watch faces as you might expect
from smartwatches has notifications it
has your contact you can take voice
memos s voice activation you can do
quite a few things that relate to your
galaxy device Samsung describes this is
perfect companion for the new galaxy
note 3 which it's introduced today
fortunately the speaker seems to be
rather quiet so if you actually want to
carry out a call you want to do it in a
quiet location because you'll do the
kind of futuristic thing of holding this
up to your head and having a phone call
that way if you swipe down from the top
you should be able to access the camera
and you can record up to 10 second
videos at 720p resolution and you can
take quick snapshots Samsung has a
number of applications dedicated to this
has the pedometer right here and it is
working on other apps from other
developers it actually has more than 70
applications as of September 2013 and it
says it's working really hard with
developers to try and get some more the
display on here is a 1.6 63 inch display
320 x 320 resolution Super AMOLED the
processor on board is an 800 megahertz
Exynos single core processor from
Samsung and the price should be
somewhere around three hundred dollars
Samson says 299 when it launches in
early October in the United States it
would actually have a global launch
little earlier than that by the end of
September so this is a very first look
at the samsung galaxy gear geez here at
Aoife Berlin 2013</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
