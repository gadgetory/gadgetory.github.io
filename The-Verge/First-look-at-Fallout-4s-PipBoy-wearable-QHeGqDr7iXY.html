we are as close as we're gonna get to
the fallout for Pitt boys this is the
little collector's item that comes with
the more expensive limited pip-boy
additional fallout 4 the idea is that
you can download an app to your phone
and you can simulate the kind of green
chromatic hit boy look at Pitt boy is
like the personal information device
that all the vault dwellers get so they
know their hit points and when they're
gonna die and what they're gonna die of
it looks a little plasticy I mean the
web edition itself isn't actually that
expensive of all collector's editions Ko
considered it does look somewhat
intricate I mean again you're not
getting the in Dolby opit boy you're not
you're think you're gonna pay $1000 so
you can accurately recreate but it is a
fun little idea and you know it in terms
of wearables it is a fully featured
phone case so ideas you open it up put
your wrist in it kind of strap it down
it looks like kind of like Hasbro or
Mattel kind of plastic it's until I made
the toy and then right up front by the
display that's where your player phone
in there's gonna be a pip-boy app to
kind of recreate the screen which you
can use without this but it's a lot more
fun when you put like a Ghostbuster like
device around your wrist so this is
about as close as we're gonna get to the
pip-boy right now if you actually want
to own one yourself it's gonna come with
the follow for special collector's
limited pip-boy edition on November 10th
the cost for the game in this is going
to be about $120</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
