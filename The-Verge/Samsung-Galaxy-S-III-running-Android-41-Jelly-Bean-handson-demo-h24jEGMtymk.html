we're here in Eva in Berlin I vodafone's
booth looking at the galaxy s3 on
Vodafone that's running jelly bean
Android 4.1 point one we found this
galaxy s3 running Android 4.1 jelly bean
if we go in here of course it's still
running Samsung's TouchWiz well if we go
into here to settings and look at the
status of the device we have android 4.1
point one which of course is jelly bean
which is released back at Google i/o our
announced back at Google i/o otherwise
you probably not going to notice too
many changes because this is TouchWiz
and Samsung has has its way with the
operating system but of course there is
google now if you open up the search bar
we're in here and it's in German but oh
it's on German but of course we are in
Germany and we also have voice search
which is you know two primary features
in jelly bean otherwise a jelly bean had
a live performance improvements like
project butter and we can't you know
we've spent a little bit of time with
the device here and it doesn't seem too
much faster than it was on ICS when we
tested it in our reviews no word of
course from Samsung when we can expect
this official officially to roll out
we've just had loose estimates but we
know exists of course and here it is
with rotifer in Germany
