CES 2015 and we're checking out one of
the first devices announced to the show
is the new LG G flex 2 this is a 5.5
inch smartphone it has a curve to it and
is the successor of the original G flex
which was a six inch device and it's
kind of a mix with LG's current flagship
phone the LG g3 which is again 5.5
inches so really what you have is the
more compact size and dimensions of the
newest Mart phone but you still have
that flexible back
you actually can flex and bend this
phone is designed to do it it also has
this specific self-healing cover on the
back which heals within 10 seconds so
you can scratch it you can try and
tarnish it whatever whatever way you
want and it will still here and come
back it's plastic it's not metal a lot
of other companies going for metal
designs but LG has really good looking
really shiny and reflective but in an
attractive way look to these new phones
it comes in two colors there's a
flamenco red and a platinum silver and
it's one of the first devices announced
when you Snapdragon 810 processor this
is an octa-core 64-bit processor runs in
two gigahertz it's basically the most
powerful chip you can have these days
but a big upgrade over the original G
flex is in the resolution of the display
it's do an OLED display but now has
1080p resolution Full HD which gives you
403 PPI pixel density which is great and
it's just over what the iPhone 6 plus
has which Oh to make sure this everyone
about the camera is pretty much the same
as the one in the LG g3 always been
improved is had a few software tweaks a
few hard optimizations and you can still
use it to take selfies by using a
gesture
take the selfie and when you go down to
preview it it automatically switches to
the preview and then when you go back up
to look it switches back to the camera
this is designed for selfie stick use
which apparently is going to be one of
the big trends of 2015 so in terms of
performance we just had a quick look
around the LG G flex view and it looks
to be moving around really fast and very
fluidly it runs Android lollipop as I
say it has one of the fastest chips
around it basically has all the latest
specs that you would expect from a brand
new smartphone however LG is marketing
this is more of a niche high-end device
it's going to price it higher than the
LG g3 and it does expect to sell that
many of them and that's part of the
reason why it has this glossy and shiny
ostentatious look to it I'm actually a
fan of it I think it works I think it
has that premium feel that I was going
for and I love the fact that is smaller
than the G flex which is six inches we
just breathe too large for it to be a
smart phone I think comparing this to
the LG g3 it has a more natural feel the
curve is more subtle than the original G
flex which again is too good and
obviously being able to crush and then
and really put this thing for his paces
speaks very well for its durability so
this is our first look at the LG G flex
2 is one of the very first devices at
CES and we expect it to be a whole bunch
more and see more more of them subscribe
to our YouTube channel we'll have all
the latest as soon as it happens</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
