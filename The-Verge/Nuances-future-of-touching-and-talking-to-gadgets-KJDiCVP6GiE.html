there's a good chance the phone you have
or your next phone already has this
technology it lets do all sorts of
things without ever touching your screen
nuance is one of the most well-known
companies making this a seamless and
invisible experience you might know them
from the work on Apple Siri they're here
the consumer electronics show showing
off new technologies for wristwatches
computers and televisions it can do
anything from changing the channel to
turning off the lights in your home and
it's getting better faster and smarter
and knowing who you are nuance has also
expanded from voice technologies to
touch if I keyboard company swiped three
years ago and since then it's managed to
squeeze down that experience used to use
with your thumbs down to a finger right
on your wrist watch like science fiction
these ideas might seem nebulous and
far-off where they're here right now and
they're spreading out to other devices
so the first thing we saw was a
television that you can talk to and
change the channels watch Judge Judy
nuance has been doing this for years but
what's new is that it can actually
recognize who's talking it's like it
knows me one example we saw is it you
can pick up the remote control and
actually say I want to see my lineup and
see things that you've already looked at
things you've saved and so if someone
else comes and watches your television
it's not going to confuse it with you
another thing we saw as a wristwatch
that you can just write on with your
finger this really didn't work well the
idea is so crazy to take something that
used to be a couple inches wide and put
it down into something you can use with
just the tip of your finger the third
thing we saw is a computer app that's a
lot like Apple's Siri you just talk into
it and it's always listening so you can
just say hey dragon what's the best Thai
restaurant in Las Vegas get restaurant
reviews music recommendations and it'll
just fire up apps it's pretty amazing
it's also rolling out a new pcs with
technology that's always listening
because nuance basically works with
other companies they've created
technology that works with other
products from other places one example
is Philips hue this is a lighting system
you can use with your smartphone what
they've done is combine this with their
voice technology so you can say turn the
lights blue turn it into party mode
turning into study mode and the lights
will change around you it takes that
same thing that used to be on the side
of your wall and puts it
your wrist we had about an hour to play
with all three of these things and when
they worked it was amazing and when it
failed they failed spectacularly but the
important thing is that this is the same
software that's been out for a couple
years but they keep adding features that
makes it more impressive functional and
simple to use and the amazing thing is
they've taken it from these very simple
devices where it seems obvious and put
it in places where you wouldn't even
think like a wristwatch What's in
wristwatches now it could be somewhere
completely different in just a few years</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
