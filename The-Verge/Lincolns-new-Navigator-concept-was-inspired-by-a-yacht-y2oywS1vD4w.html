concept the new Navigator is supposed to
remind us of a luxurious yacht Lincoln
says it's meant to have an elegant
beauty a tricky task with such a large
beast there was no attempt by the
designers to minimize the size of the
Navigator it's so big that isn't
possible instead they decided to embrace
the volume and make it as elegant as
they could now don't be fooled by the
Tesla Model X styled gull wing doors
Lincoln was very clear that those won't
make it to the final version when it
debuts sometime next year instead it's
just to give us a great view of the
interior the interior is meant to evoke
a sense of serenity and harmony both
words that were used by Lincoln
executives to describe the concept and
they were quick to draw contrast to the
more aggressive style of Cadillac their
chief rival which has a much more
domineering design language though the
Navigator isn't the highest volume car
Lincoln sells it is the best-known of
all the company's current name plates
and it serves as a halo car for the
brand
Lincoln expects to show the final
version of the Navigator in about a
year's time Lincoln says sitting in the
Navigator is meant to give you a sense
of decompression and sanctuary and
release
they say that settling into the seat
after a long day at work should make you
go we're just getting started with the
