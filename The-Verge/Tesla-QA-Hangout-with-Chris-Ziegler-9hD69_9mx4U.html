it with this piece and hopefully you all
agree and hopefully you brought
questions for me here today we all you
need to do is tweet at us we have a
hashtag it's Tesla QA and we'll pick
that up uh Sam I have I have the lovely
and wonderful Sam chakra with us here
who is going to be feeding me questions
Sam do we have anything yet yeah right
off the bat we have pastor s88 from
twitter asks how is the interior space
is it roomie yes it is very very roomy
and tehsil actually talked about this
specifically with me the fact that by
eliminating all the controls inside the
car they were kind of able to open it up
a bit and it is really cavernous like
it's probably one of the more roomy
sedans I've ever been in sitting in the
driver's seat I didn't actually sit in
the in the in the rear seats mmm which
was a bit of an oversight and in
retrospect but but from the front it's
it's a really really roomy ride cool all
right let's see what else we have a
couple more here off the bat this
question was asked by two different
people does the large LCD screen become
distracting at night is it usable in the
day when the Sun shines on it oh that's
it oh yeah that's a great question in
the daytime I didn't have any problem
with daylight viewability and and this
is something that is an issue for more
and more cars now because we're seeing a
lot of vehicles move to LCD instrument
clusters and larger and larger LCDs in
the center stack and and last year I I
took a look at the cadillac XTS which
has what cadillac calls q and it's a
little bit like what Tesla is trying to
do where they they replace all the
instruments with with a single CD and
they have a big LCD in the center and I
didn't really have any problems with
daylight viewability there and I
certainly didn't in the tehsil and I
don't know if that's just that they're
using good LCDs or if it's that the
hoods that they have on the instrument
clusters kind of block that light of its
combination of both but there was never
an issue in the
a light and also i think that the back
lights are very strong which also helps
at night however at first it was way too
bright for me what it does is it has an
auto adjustment we're at a certain time
at night I think it might be like tied
to sunset i'm not sure but at some point
it goes from a date they mode to a night
mode where all the colors change so like
the base map in google maps is is it
turns into like night mode essentially
yeah yeah it's like dark gray instead of
white so that helps but the the the
default backlight strength was too high
at night so there's like this this huge
like light hitting my face while I was
trying to drive and but I was able to
turn that down it wasn't an issue after
that there's there's like a a dial on on
the screen that you can easily just turn
down the brightness yeah it's just a
slider you go into settings or slider
you turn it down you're all set okay so
there was another parts of this question
with such a large screen on the dash be
fine distracting at night or too much
glare during the day did you find
yourself searching for things on there
or is the system pretty well thought out
um it depends on the screen and the
function basic things like the like the
radio and the climate controls which are
permanently docked at the bottom of the
screen okay excuse me are easy to find
and after a few hours i was able to
pretty much hit them without even
looking but uh when you get into like
the settings of the car like like it it
there's a thing called creep mode which
is kind of a weird name the other thing
about it it creep mode where when it's
enabled when you take your foot off the
brake it creeps like a regular automatic
car and when you turn off it it just
sits there like a manual what if you
want to go in and change functions like
that kind of you have to dig and look
around but hopefully you're not
accessing those while you're driving
anyway right so it really isn't that big
of a deal and the web browser is just a
web browser the the keyboard the soft
keyboard that comes up at the bottom of
the screen has a very simple layout it's
that the keys are huge they're easy to
practice I don't have any problem with
missed visit estate prices working a
keyboard it is a standard QWERTY
keyboard
and there's a separate toggle for
getting into symbols okay but but yeah
what the the bottom line is it after two
days of driving the car there was never
really a point while I was uh well i was
actually like in motion that I was like
concern that I wasn't gonna be able to
find something I needed in the screen
but one thing that kept vexing me and
and my video crew can attest to this one
of the things that that was a continual
problem was the fact that uh yet like i
would get in and the doors would lock or
like i would lock the doors or something
would happen and then they would want to
get in the passenger seat and the car
was locked and you know that the door
handles completely retracted right right
right right and then the only way to let
them into the car is to like go like a
couple menus deep and then you find the
like this um there's like an overhead
view of the car with like all the
different lock toggles available to you
and then you can unlock the doors so it
would take like a good like 10 seconds
to get them into the car there's much on
the door like no uh no I don't think so
it's just it's just window controls I
think I'm trying to picture the interior
the car I don't think there's a physical
switch for the locks so so yeah I kept
doing that and it it I think it got them
a little frustrated and you couldn't
what about just opening the door from
the inside like leaning over and yeah
you could do that or you could pull the
the fob out of your pocket and and
double click one of the buttons to
unlock the doors that's another option
but I just ended up using the screen not
the fastest function in the world but
then again it's not something you need
to do while you're driving right all
right let's move on ah paul from twitter
says when with when will the
supercharger network be available in
europe hopefully this isn't paul miller
otherwise he's jr. um in Europe I don't
know to be very honest with you I know
that they're concentrating on the u.s.
right now and they have a lot of work to
do there because they want to get 200
stations by 2015 and they only have what
I want to say eight or ten right now and
they're they're just on the coast they
have a few on the west coast and I think
two or three on the east those are
charging stations or
a supercharger say those are super
chargers so the idea the way Tesla
described it to me is I want to get you
an H formation so that they'll have you
know they'll have superchargers all down
the west coast superchargers all down
the East Coast and then a bar across the
country that allows you to get across
without having to like plan a stop at a
level 2 charger and then and then get a
hotel and let it charge overnight but
they're they're a long way from that
they have no superchargers in the middle
of the country right now so the only way
to do a cross-country trip is to like I
said plan a route along level two
chargers which take a lot longer but but
as for europe i don't know there might
be some information on tesla site about
that but i'm afraid i don't know offhand
okay um so this is sort of a question
relating gas stations are everywhere so
if traditional cars run out of gas run
out of fuel gas station is nearby have
you felt any anxiety about running out
of electricity and not being your place
to charge it yeah yeah there's actually
if you watch our video there's a
prominent section in it uh where I'm
sorry is the is the Hangout okay I just
got a note that it might not be active
right now or is it active think it
should be ok sorry yeah there's a
prominent section in our video where we
very nearly run out of juice trying to
get two morrow Bay California which was
our night one stop we had a two day trip
and our night one trip was through a
place called morro bay which is about
halfway up the the pacific coast of
California and and we yeah we got there
with one mile left of range and I want
the sweating bullets I was I was not
comfortable for a few minutes there I we
we had um we had driven past san luis
obispo about 15 or 20 miles before we
got tomorrow bay and i'm sure that we
could have found a level 2 charger there
and we were kind of deciding you know we
were right on the bubble with the range
and we're like well should we stop
should we keep going and we decided just
you know forge ahead why and and yeah it
was it was very very close um this is a
sort of a question coming for me does it
have a
you know the reserve tank now some cars
technically have that whatever it is is
there something like that the Tesla
where it's gotten you know it reserves
something in case you know you come into
that sort of emergency well what Tesla
told us is that when you get to when you
get to zero range uh you're not
necessarily just going to like die on
the side of the road it can run there
have been you know tales of Model S
owners and drivers who've pushed it
beyond zero we didn't get to that point
we didn't want to get to that point
right but but uh but one thing that does
happen is when you get close to zero I
think it starts happening around 20
miles of range you get this this dashed
orange line in the in the in the in the
instrument cluster that that indicates
it's not our p.m. but like it indicates
an amount of power that you can't push
the motor beyond and that's because the
battery just incapable of it anymore at
least not safely right and that orange
line keeps going down and down and down
into get closer to zero range and then
you get to the point right around zero
miles to go we're like you can just
barely accelerate and and that's that's
the point that we got to by the time we
hit the level 2 charger in morro bay so
so it sort of like caps the car and
really condenses what what fuel you or
energy you have left right yeah you're
not going to you're not going to be
racing porsche panamera 'he's when you
get close to zero range unfortunately
but to answer your original question I
mean yes you can probably push app as
zero but I certainly would not want to
be the guy that has to do that right
okay this is from YouTube Jay Fodor asks
uh what is the platform that the
touchscreens running on is it based on
Android or what's what is it the it as
far as I know via the cars you I is is
some custom solution on top of real-time
OS or Linux it's it excuse me it's not
it's not Andrew
right but I can tell you that the the
center cluster is running on a Tegra 3
and I believe that instrument cluster is
running on to take her to UM and I was
let's put it this way i think that the
car would benefit from a Tegra 4 because
especially especially in the web browser
which was little laggy and you know i
don't again like i said in the in the in
the piece i we I I don't believe that a
driver should ever have access to a web
browser while rolling right and i'm
doing a tesla you do right yeah
especially a bad one but this one was
but but i do think that in terms of
performance maybe it's just the size of
the displaying the resolution i don't
really know but whatever reason it
performed very poorly especially on like
a really design intensive site like the
verge so so yeah they would probably
benefit from a hardware it is that
attributed to the network connection or
you think it's strictly the hardware
it's it's the hardware yeah because you
could let the you could let the site
load completely and then it'll so yeah
like a swipe around and it's it's really
laggy okay and also it doesn't support
it doesn't appear to support any kind of
video if you ml 5 or flash so Wow so if
you want to watch the Tesla audio in the
Tesla I'm your Tesla to do something
really meta you just eat you can't
unless you bring a laptop or tablet
along with you Wow alright um this
questions from sams e bein from youtube
how fast did you guys push the car
that's enough a style how fast um this
is going to be kind of a cop-out answer
but I don't the short answer is I don't
know because you know there were there
were definitely a few straightaways
along the PCH that were completely
emptied devoid of cars where we you know
we we opened it up but I wasn't you know
I was so focused on paying attention to
the road ahead of me and my surroundings
that I wasn't actually looking at this
pedometer so the short answer is I don't
know but the car it feels like when you
put the accelerator to the floor it
feels like the car will do
like propel itself forever and
eventually you'll hit the speed of light
and then you know some weird relative it
relativity stuff will happen and time
will bend and it's it's insane like the
car feels unlike anything I've ever
experienced in my life it's a in terms
of performance right and thrusts into
work and yeah not because it's it's I
mean I've been in some very fast cars
but but the the way the car accelerates
is very foreign because it's so smooth
and smoke and so linear throughout the
entire uh you know range of acceleration
and speed like you okay there is no
there's no like traditional tort curve
like in a like in an internal combustion
engine so it's it feels very weird even
if you're accustomed to a car that can
do zero to 60 in under five seconds you
know huh um all right we've got plenty
more questions to go through here this
is from Sam Hector on YouTube what's
next for Tesla iterative updates to the
sedan or diversifying it to SUVs and
other types of vehicles the first thing
you're going to see well you know it's
it's it's anybody's guess really because
they were like I said in the piece they
were actually really secretive about
what was going on in the design studio
in LA but it's pretty widely understood
that that their next thing is the model
x they've been showing it off for a
while now they have the concept version
of it in the design studio what is the
model x the model x is their SUV okay
and the really notable thing about this
this SUV is that it has these so-called
falcon wings where instead of having
four doors that open to the side like a
normal SUV the the the doors open
straight up um kind of like AG all wing
uh like yo mclaren doors they're not
they're not know they're not a like a
McLaren is a swing wing right or did a
going on well me neither what about like
is it is like a DeLorean where they open
this way or their Lamborghini you know
sort of it's like it
kind of unlike anything the closest
approximation I can think of would be
like a Mercedes SLR but the difference
is that instead of the door being a
single piece that opens straight out
like this hmm the the door is the door
like goes across the the top of the roof
and is hinged along the edge where it
turns down along the side of the vehicle
so that when the doors raised they kind
of like that they they crease and come
together so that they're not opening up
so the long and short of it is that you
can you can drive the car into a really
tight parking space and you don't have
to worry about having to open the doors
because they go straight up and there's
also just one on each side so when you
open the door it like opens up the
entire side of SUV so there's an insane
amount of like uh you know it's like
super easy to like get big boxes in and
out super easy to walk in and out of it
so technically the size of four door and
the the two doors on the side are just
this just one piece um yeah well yes
yeah the each door is like the size of
like to traditional doors so it covers
the front and back of the vehicle and if
that's TV i would actually um the model
x is a very sleek looking SUV the
closest approximation i would give you
would be like a BMW x6 um uh well I'm
trying to think i'm going to google some
some pictures here oh i see so it's yeah
BMW x6 would be the closest i think so
but but it's a little more utilitarian
than that i think there's a little more
cargo space the x6 has been widely pad
for for having no cargo space that is
not the case with this vehicle so uh so
yeah that that's their next project and
then after that I'm sure that you're
gonna see some updates the Model S and
they also kind of hinted that they're
looking for ways to get into a more
affordable yeah that were some things
next question two is there a timetable
to bring the prices down to
crius level yeah for the Model S III
don't think that's necessarily their
goal it's definitely a premium vehicle
and it feels really premium inside now
but you look at things like the Nissan
Leaf and even like that you know the
Chevy Volt and and the the mitsubishi
miev i think it's called mom there
there's obviously a demand and an
interest in lower costs may be smaller
v's and and that's something that that
when i talked to franz von Holtz house
and he definitely indicated that that's
something that they're interested in
pursuing longer term and they're kind of
exploring ways to do that but the next
project is the Model X in terms of
updates to the Model S one thing that
that that he know for that Franz noted
to me is that the car because of the
touchscreen it's very it's very future
proof and and you know I mentioned
before that I think it could up it could
benefit from up from an upgraded take
before and it's 3g instead of LTE runs
an ATT 3g network button but that aside
all your firmware updates to like the
motor software and the the touchscreen
software and the instrument cluster
software all that comes over the air
just like a smartphone which is it
totally unique in the car world like you
know that nowhere else does this ever
happen right like you'll just you'll
wake up in the morning you'll go out to
your car will be like hey we downloaded
a new firmware overnight do you want to
apply it and you just you know you apply
it and and there are release notes and
everything it's really cool so that the
card in in that regard the cars very
future proof and they're still adding
features to the car perfect examples
that creep mode I talked about earlier
yeah that was not there when the car
launch you ha drivers requested it so
they just added it in a firmware update
wow wow uni um so relating to that
question sort of directly Ashwin rajani
sorry if I butchered your name from
Twitter's asking how does the technology
and the Model S compared to other techy
cars audi with google earth BMW i drive
Ford SYNC Mercedes etc very good
question the in terms of the overall
capability of the car there excuse me of
like that the the ice that
the center console the electronics of
the car I would put it about a half step
beyond the most advanced systems from
mainstream manufacturers on the market
right now those paying you know audi and
I Drive primarily but they're all kind
of like in that same mix that you know
that they have the cars have their own
data connection cellular data
connections Audi and BMW just upgraded
to LTE or in the process of doing so
Tesla is not yet but obviously it's hard
to ignore the fact that there's no other
car in the market that has this giant
touchscreen so right that certainly sets
Tesla apart and I I don't think I mean
the I I had a long round table with Audi
executives at at CES earlier this year
and I mean it definitely wasn't grained
in my mind how badly these traditional
car manufacturers have been have feel
like wronged and burned over the years
by government regulators both in the US
and abroad like it's such a heavily
regulated industry the car business and
in for obvious reason safety that uh
that it's it's very difficult for them
to do really anything and I think
they're little gun-shy about doing like
really radically different things with
other regulations right right with human
computer interaction and you know just
in general that the way the driver
interacts with the car Tesla what I
think felt unburdened by that gun
shyness because they're new to this
business and like i said in the piece i
don't think that regulators have really
caught up with how far ahead Tesla
skated from the puck so they're doing
these insane things with this giant
touch screen like the browser that I
just don't think the Department of
Transportation ever like considered then
they never thought that this would be
something I had to contend with so so I
think that over the course of the next
ten years to get back to your original
question I think you're going to see the
the old guard car companies the BMW's
the Fords the Mercedes of the world
you're going to see them incrementally
catch up to what Tesla is doing in terms
of interface and you're gonna see Tesla
kind of like I don't want to say
stagnate but you're gonna see them kind
of like level out as the regulations
catch up with them and so I don't think
they're going to have that radical
interface advantage forever but right
now they're certainly half step they're
ahead right okay I'm the same person
from Twitter not a schwinn says is there
any way to integrate smartphone apps
into the center stack google nav Spotify
Rdio mom Pandora hmm yeah another good
question so they they in the most recent
firmware update they just added a screen
of like apps it's like an app drawer
basically like you would find on Android
or anything else are they installed in
the console themselves are from your
phone there well this so Tesla's not
talked about how that's going to work
exactly but it's pretty apparent that
they are going to end up having a way to
install extra apps in the in the car
because you know right now they have
slacker but it's you know it's obvious
that they want you know they want our do
they want Spotify they want all these
things and and the the car has
smartphone integration but not to the
same extent that like Ford SYNC does or
GM's was it called my link i think is
what GM uses so it's it's not to that
level of smartphone integration the
tehsil you can you know you can connect
the phone bluetooth and all that all
that jazz but it's it's not like you
have all these look like apps on the
phone that like are tightly integrated
with the center console right now so i
think but the impression i get is that
they're going to end up having apps that
are installed in the dash and then you
know maybe they'll talk to the phone in
some way i don't know but i think that
the the the center console for tesla is
going to be like the primary point of
interaction ok cool uh let's move on um
someone asks let me find this question
here be honest Chris would you own a
Model S or an m5 um I both is that
available yeah thats you know the m5 is
is a really a really stellar vehicle in
many ways i mean the the short answer to
your question is i would own an m6 gran
coupe after after seeing it at a couple
auto shows recently but um but the the
m5 is a really amazing car with a really
amazing engine and a lot of great things
going for it i think that the Model S is
uh is also an amazing car but but it's
you know the infrastructure isn't quite
there yet to make it practical for every
way that you would traditionally use a
car you know it's it's obviously great
for urban and suburban trips but but it
you know still at the point right now
we're planning a cross-country trip
would be a really or even like a state
to state trip would be like a really
stressful thing and you don't always
want to have to worry about that and I'm
really really hopeful that through
combination of government subsidy and
private investment they're going to get
to the point in the next three five or
ten years where that infrastructure will
be there and things like Tesla
superchargers are going to be a major
part of that but but today if I if
someone put a gun to my head I it would
have to be at m5 I think but believe me
the model s is right in the mix and and
if I could have both I certainly would
cool um okay uh does the electric this
this is coming from George on Twitter
does the electric motor make the
whirling sound and does it feel a bit
disoriented to hear that sound instead
of an engine it's a really quiet car in
terms of in terms of like mechanical
noise I think that at very low speed
with the windows down you get some of
that that Jetsons sound yeah but when
you're at speed on the highway with
especially with the windows up even with
the windows down like it just like a
regular car unless you're driving like a
diesel 18-wheeler like the the the
prevailing sound that you're hearing is
not the engine with the road noise and
the women noise and and the Model S is
the same way
um there was another question relating
to that um how cool this is from inner
slice on Twitter how quiet is the car
what's the cabin noise like at highway
speeds um yes it's it's a it's a quiet
car I don't know how much insulation a
sound insulation they put in it and I
don't know you know if there's any
interplay to be honest I don't know if
they do active noise cancellation which
is kind of a hot feature in cars these
days you're seeing a lot of cars do this
thing we're like you know they that
there's a microphone that's detecting
like the engine you know that the
ambient noise and then it's emitting
sound from the speakers to cancel that
that noise out I don't know if the Model
S does that to be honest but um it's
it's not it's certainly not a loud car I
used to own a Lotus Elise which is the
car that theam that the the tesla
roadster was based on right and that was
a very I mean first of all was a gas and
I can't it's not apples apples because
it had a gas engine in it but like that
the engine in that car was like six
inches behind your head and so if you
were driving for more than a few miles
actually were earplugs when I would
drive it from state to state because you
just go deaf otherwise but but that is
not a problem the Model S needless to
say okay out of the this is coming from
mobile dawn on twitter out of the 265
quoted mileage what do you reckon most
people will actually get i think that
most people will get so so first of all
i should i should point out that Tesla
has a total of three different battery
capacities for the Model S we tested the
largest battery which is an 85 kilowatt
hour but they also have a 40 and i
believe it's 65 and that that affects
the the price of the car obviously
tremendously because that I think that
the base 40 kilowatt hours like 57 k and
the car we tested was I I added it up
and it's somewhere around 100k so big
difference in price but um if you get
the 85 kilowatt hour then you'll get the
265 yep but and in the
world I think you will probably get
realistically 240 to 250 would be my
guess but one of the reasons and I
pointed this out in our piece one of the
reasons that we that we really took a
big range hit I think is because we were
you know first of all we were really
being liberal with the accelerator to we
were we were driving up and down the
mountains non-stop and and Grenn you get
some region on the way down which is
putting power back into the battery but
you're not it's it's not a perpetual
motion machine so you're not getting the
same amount of energy on the way down
that you're that you're taking out the
battery on the way up okay so that was a
hit and and we had a ton of of cargo in
the car you know we had like you know a
billion cameras yeah and other humans
right so it a you know we got I think
somewhere around probably 220 when all
is said and done but but i think that
the average person is going to get it
more than that okay this is coming from
curtis cook on google+ pretty good
question how does the state inspection
process go can you just take it to a
local mechanic and have them tested that
is a very good question and that varies
from state to state uh I don't yeah I
honestly don't know at all how that
works I know that California is a lot
more strict for that sort of thing than
most states but but I I'm sorry I don't
know and to be honest not it's possible
that not all states have figured that
out and maybe some states don't even
care because it's a zero-emission
vehicle so you know some like in in in
Michigan where I was raised the the
inspections always centered around you
know the amount of crap that the exhaust
was putting out and right that's not an
issue with the model s so if I yeah yeah
I mean check with your state mm-hmm okay
um so Anthony Keller from Google+ chris
sigler what if anything did you miss
about the Tesla after returning it and
going back to internal combustion oh the
linear acceleration just that
the the the ability to be on the highway
like there's a certain amount of I think
that as a driver there's a certain
amount of confidence that comes with
knowing that you can like kind of
accelerate your way out of any situation
and and that's something that I always
kind of like lingers in the back of my
mind when i'm driving a car that doesn't
really accelerate like the car that i
personally own right now which I don't
like and that that isn't a problem with
the Model S at all so so not having
access to that that seemingly limitless
and linear acceleration i think is the
thing that i missed the most about the
car the thing that i missed the least is
is not having like I you know I mean
that the charging situation that in a
nutshell like you it's going to be a
long time until I mean if there were
superchargers every 25 miles around the
contrary it would be a complete
non-issue right because everywhere you
you went you feel safe I get in and
you'll be fine but but until that
happens there's always going to be at
least a little bit of doubt as to
whether you know you're always going to
have to think about it which is a price
you know that's as the owner of a of a
gas car that's not something that you
ever think about it might be something
that you occasionally think about if
you're driving a diesel cuz I don't gas
stations I have diesel but but as I as a
gas car owners just a complete non-issue
because there are gas stations
everywhere and right that's so until
that's solved that that is going to be
the thing that is going to be the thing
that that i missed the least about dry
TV for sure on that just made me think
of a question we have to pay for gas do
you have to pay to you know charged
vehicle at superchargers no but the the
level 2 charging situation varies from
city to city and from state to state in
Morro Bay the the there was one level 2
charger there and and by the way if if
we had pulled up and the charger was in
use we would have been completely hosed
which I am just not thinking about
Jordan one of our video guys actually
just brought it up with me
but but that was a free charger not all
level two chargers are free like it here
in Chicago um Walgreens and I think they
do this elsewhere to walgreens the the
the drugstore company has installed
level two pre level two chargers at a
lot of their stores so if you drive an
EV you can just park up and plug in
while you go in but if you go into like
a lot of parking garages in the city
there are level two chargers that are
like little kiosks with with credit card
readers and you need to pay to charge
but the super chargers are free which is
one of the the really awesome things
about of course if you're driving any EV
other than a than a Tesla doesn't do any
good whereas level two chargers are
pretty universal so um but yeah it just
varies from location location ok this is
coming from inter slice again on twitter
0 to 60 and 4.4 seconds how about 0 to
100 just how severely is range going to
be depleted screeching way from stop
lights in the city a lot uh yeah I was
warned on several occasions that being
liberal with the accelerator would have
a significant impact on our range and I
think it did just because we fell so far
short of 265 going from LA tomorrow bae
0 to 100 time I I don't I don't know I
Tesla probably has an official remember
on their site but but I can tell let's
put it this way even if we did do a 0 to
100 run on a public road I wouldn't tell
you it's just not legal um ok this is
coming from a shag on Twitter since the
engine is totally different there's a
good question is maintenance different
you have to change the coolant oil
filters etc that is a great question yet
we brought this up with with the the PR
people at Tesla and it's it's close to a
zero maintenance car one thing that I
didn't bring up in the piece is that if
you open up the hood it's just another
trunk there's like there's nothing user
serviceable in there it's just an empty
space where you can put in luggage and
we did use it for luggage the only thing
you can access
there's the windshield washer fluid just
like any other car and and we were told
there's some fluid or lubricant or
something that that needs to be changed
once every 12 years I think but but
apart from that I think they recommend a
yearly checkup where you just take the
car in and they like you know look it
over and do whatever to it but it in
terms of user service it's basically
zero as windshield washer fluid and
power that's about it um that's that's
pretty interesting okay what else let me
check here as much as this is coming
from no amar on YouTube as much as I
like the Tesla s I feel that this car
will get an initial press bump and then
slowly fade away do you think the Tesla
s is the car that will make electric
cars viable for normal America I and not
yet but I think what's very important
about Tesla even if the Model S is not
ultimately the car that pushes the world
over the hump on v's what's important
about the company is the fact that
they're being really aggressive about
pushing the EV agenda and making sure
that it's in the public eye and talking
about it constantly and talking to
people like us who are bringing you
stories about it and so that you know
people are aware of the EV initiatives
and they're aware of infrastructure
issues because it you know a test will
be the first to admit there's a ton of
money and time and energy that needs to
go into building out this infrastructure
make it five truly viable and so I think
just having Elon Musk and Tesla being so
aggressive about pushing the EV agenda
is what matters more than the Model S
itself and you know you're seeing I was
talking earlier about the old guard car
companies being a lot more conservative
in general and that's certainly true
with TVs to you know companies like Ford
and GM do have EVs in their lineups but
they they don't try to market them as
mainstream cars yeah and it Elise in
GM's case they're um they're they're
pushing extended-range v's um also known
as hybrids like the volt and and now the
cadillac ELR which are you know they're
a great concept but
uh they still rely on gas and the range
is a small fraction of what you get on a
model s so um so in terms of you know
pushing a true EV infrastructure and
agenda Tesla's really leading the way
and I think that that message is much
more important in the car itself okay
all right we'll take a couple more this
is again from raw she's got some great
questions is there a built-in voice it's
a built-in voice command if so how well
does it work Alice can see rior google
voice be used like can you integrate
Syria with it or doesn't have its own
proprietary system yeah there's there's
a built-in voice recognition system that
they just if i'm not mistaken they just
recently added it in a firmware update
it i don't think that it shipped with
the car it's new and uh they admitted to
me on the spot they were like look we
know that that voice recognition isn't
perfect we're playing with it you know
we just added this uh we didn't test it
much but it did fail to recognize you
like you know the problem with most of
these voice recognition systems and cars
is that like you don't know off the bat
what it can recognize and then you need
to go to like a process like have it
lists out possible commands to you and
it's just and and then it becomes more
trouble than it's worth I wasn't able to
get it to like do anything interesting
you know I got a lot of like
unrecognized command okay like I press
the buttons an unrecognized command at
the bottom of the instrument cluster but
it's new and and you know unlike a lot
of other systems where like you know
that they probably aren't going to
update the way the voice recognition
works and even if they did you have to
take it in the dealer to get the
firmware updated with this cards just an
over-the-air update so they could
theoretically make it better than it is
right now okay so that's one of Tesla's
big things like they could just push
updates over the air unlike any other
manufacturer can write okay let's see um
what else do we have here did you feel
as intimate and connected this is coming
from Linda Don Twitter did you feel as
intimate and connected with the Model S
as you would with your favorite manual
shifting vehicle
no no I no no I mean if you if you
compare this to will like that the lotus
elise that I was talking about before
lucky it's very like you definitely feel
like you're part of the machine whereas
with the model ests and frankly with any
car where you're not shifting yourself
you feel a little more like you're being
taken for a ride and I think that you
know we were testing the performance
model which has you know it has a bunch
of things that make it a sporty-er
experience and it definitely felt like a
sporty car but did it feel like a sports
car I would say no it just it felt like
a very sporty sedan and yeah i mean III
don't think it's it's possible for an EV
to ever achieve that level of connection
with the driver and you know I am I my
guess is that there will be in
California at some point in the future
unless they're banned there will always
be at least a niche market for gasoline
vehicles even after v's an
extended-range v's take over for that
very reason the fact that you know that
there's an enthusiast slash hobbyist
aspect to it that you can't get from EV
but I think that being said I think that
Tesla did about the best job it possibly
could connecting the driver to the car
sort of having a manual even though even
though it's you know probably one of the
most technologically advanced cars
you've ever been in and driven it
doesn't you don't feel intimate with it
as you do it you know a regular stick
shift car no yeah I don't think the
technology really has anything to do
with it you know you can drive you know
and again going back to the the lotus
elise it's a very raw car there's no
technology in it dates you know it's got
like a crappy aftermarket radio and and
you know a button to turn the lights on
and off and a manual transmission and
that's about it and and you know you
that's in fact I think that many ways
technology is is opposed to feeling
connected with
car um because it you know that systems
kick in for you like you know stability
control is a great example that traction
control and there are things happening
that you don't that you're not actively
controlling yourself right that's not an
issue with like a really old school
manual car okay makes sense this
questions coming from Michael Voss on
Twitter what kind of tires does it come
with it comes with tires uh they're low
profile I I think that they're uh
they're not like right flats or anything
no I don't believe so I'm getting it
mixed up in my mind because I just had a
discussion with the chief engineer of
the Cadillac ELR and he was talking
about tires and I don't want to get it
mixed up okay but the I can tell you
that they're extremely low profile i
think that the that the the high-end
wheel on the model s if you if you
option it is a 20-inch so as you can
imagine it's gonna be a very low profile
tire but i don't know the manufacturer i
I don't I don't know the stats on it I'm
sorry mm-hmm but that that should be on
Tesla's site that should be in the back
section yeah um would you want this is
coming from interest less on Twitter
would you want a manual in the Tesla
Model S or is the automatic beneficial
to the overall system yeah I don't think
I mean they could I'm sure they could
find a way to like you know MacGyver
Emanuel what it's it's counter to what
they're trying to do and you're sacker
I'm sure that you'd be sacrificing a
great deal of efficiency right for that
like the bottom line is that if you want
like if a manual is that important to
you this is probably not the car for you
right and and you know BMW went through
this the same heartburn where uh you
know that they they got their electronic
manuals they're so good that and still
efficient that they were faster shifting
than a manual and more efficient and
better in every way even for their
performance vehicles but you still have
these old-school people who just say
just give me a manual right they
actually had to go back and lie
you know engineer a manual for the new
m5 and m6 and you can actually like you
can spec them in by default you get the
electronic manual but if you want to
spec in the manual you can but but of
course is our internal combustion cars
so I think it's it makes a lot less
sense in something like the Model S and
I don't think you're ever going to see
that okay to preserve long-term battery
life does it need to be fully charged
depleted or can it be topped up randomly
I don't mean the battery on this thing
right yeah there are there are a couple
different charging modes on the car that
you can choose between one's called
standard ones called max range and i
think that the standard mode is better
for the long the longevity of the
battery than the max range but you can
like if you absolutely need like top top
out the battery you can put into max
range mode and get a little extra juice
out of it but apart from that you know I
didn't look through the instruction
manual for the car but mark the engineer
that we talked to in in gilroy
California where the superchargers are
located he had just picked up his Model
S from the factory and he had said that
there were no battery conditioning
recommendations huh for the car that he
had been told so and you know to be fair
lithium ion batteries are pretty low
maintenance compared to like my cats and
nickel metal hydride so right that that
that doesn't necessarily surprise me
it's possible that you know my guess my
instinct is that if you treat the the
battery the same way you treat a laptop
battery to get maximum life out of that
you're probably going to get some some
extra life out of the out of the car's
battery pack as well but but we weren't
told any guidelines for that okay um
alright let's wrap this up I got one
more question here has anyone asked
about the public perception about Tesla
did anyone recognize the car when you
were driving it oh yeah we got we got
recognized non-stop which really
surprised me because you know I I don't
think of most human beings as being car
fanatics and like you know they can't
tell you know a Ferrari from a
Lamborghini but also you did drive it
through
california rights you'd expect yeah yeah
and I'm sure that they're much more
familiar with Lake low mission vehicles
in general and Tesla specifically since
is a California company uh but it it
still shocked me just how many people
everywhere knew what we are dry either
knew what it was or wanted to know what
it was interesting at what I pulled into
a gas station ironically of course yeah
and and this guy another pump came over
and he was like holy crap what is this
this is a beautiful car and you know
people I mentioned in the piece a guy in
a pickup truck like pulled up next to me
on the expressway not start honking his
horn and giving the thumbs up and it was
and it we were we were going to pull out
in in Big Sur getting some you know
doing a photo shoot and and a family
came up with their kids and they're like
hey you know can I put my my son in the
car can you go around with it so
everyone was just really really excited
about it which surprised me because it
isn't a very like it is a very
attractive car but it isn't like it
isn't like a bright green tesla roadster
you know it doesn't have that level of
like you know grab eNOS it doesn't grab
your eyeballs like that does so um so
yeah i was a little surprised but but
you know it unless you're um let's put
it this way it's a first world problem
if you're a Tesla driver and you're
getting a lot of people asking you what
your car is that that is the first real
problem true alright cool um Chris
thanks for hanging out literally and you
know right here with us yeah and thanks
everyone for your questions we got some
good ones for sure I just want to make
