Kickstarter electric skateboard from a
company called inboard on in santa cruz
california after over a year of
follow-up work to get it out to backers
we can finally put a production version
of this high-end board through its paces
at 13 99 comparisons to the popular 1499
boost board are inevitable and yes the
specs are close in board claims that the
m1 can go 24 miles per hour
boosted board can go 22 miles an hour
the in board has a range of around 7
miles and the standard boosted board
also has a range of about 7 miles but
really these boards couldn't be more
different
the biggest difference between the two
boards are the motors the m1 uses
something called hub motors where the
motors actually sit inside of the wheel
itself
this gives the m1 a much cleaner look
with only a single well hidden wire
snaking up into the motor from beneath
the truck the boosted board on the other
hand uses a belt driven motor I'll admit
I wasn't expecting there to be too much
of a difference between these motor
types but there definitely is the hub
motors feel a lot more like gliding
where bell motors feel like you're
directly in control of the power at
lower speed hub motors feel sluggish and
kind of bad where belt motors give you
an immediate kick at takeoff but at top
speed riding on the M ones hub motors
feels a lot like a smooth luxury car
ride where the belt motors feel kind of
like writing an angry wild animal on a
phone call with Ryan Evans one of the
inboard founders I was told that one of
the biggest reasons why the company
decided to go with hub motors is because
they can be programmed the hub motor
allows us to upgraded performance and
change the performance of the wheel over
time in like pretty significant ways
because everything is electromechanical
versus having like a belt system where
if we're going to really change the way
that the motor works we would have to
introduce a new hard worker fogging up
basically
entirely new product like loosen me to
one of them boards engineers claim to
have complete control over the motor
performance from torque to the
acceleration curve the second biggest
difference is the deck itself the m1
uses a high-tech composite board that's
extremely stiff and this has a huge
impact on how it feels to ride the
stiffness gives the m1 a stable feel
that's good for true beginners and
experts who need control a top speed
this is a major departure from the boost
board which has an extremely flexible
bamboo deck in my opinion the flexible
deck of the boost board is a lot more
fun at middling speeds but if you're
going somewhere in a hurry you can't
beat the luxury feel of the m1 at top
speed one area where the m1 really
shines however is its battery
it's truly swappable meaning that you
can drain the battery in the board
completely and swap in a fully charged
battery in less than a minute that means
that the m1 s range isn't really limited
to seven miles it's limited to how many
of the company's two hundred and $49
batteries you can afford and carry there
are other nice touches on the m1 as well
like a touch sensitive underbelly for
pairing with the app as well as the
front and rear LEDs one thing that isn't
so great is the remote there's a lot of
play in the throttle which sometimes
makes you wonder if you're really in
control of the board in my version there
are also several different signaling
mechanisms the remote beeps vibrates and
flashes LEDs when you're on the board
it's sometimes impossible to figure out
why it seems to be unhappy as it rumbles
at you I've been told that this is an
over-voltage warning but at times I've
been confused of what the board is
trying to tell me so is the m1 fit to
sit at the high end of the electric
skateboard market the company is still
very young but the m1 seems to have
hidden depths just when you think you're
at max speed there's a little more and
just when you think you couldn't break
in time you can the m1 is a luxury board
that's very good today it may even be
great tomorrow and board down in red
pants me
