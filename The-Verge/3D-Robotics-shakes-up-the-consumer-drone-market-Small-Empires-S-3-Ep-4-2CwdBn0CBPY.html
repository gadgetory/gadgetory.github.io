California is one of the most
interesting companies in the
fast-growing drone industry it started
from a community of drone enthusiasts
and now it makes a wide range of models
for everyone from average hobbyists to
industrial railroads three are sets
itself apart by serving as the
centerpiece of a large open-source
software community developing some of
the most advanced autonomous flight
programs on the market so now the
question is is this commitment to open
innovation enough to compete with bigger
more established brands
you would not think and when the
editor-in-chief the wire decides to
create the biggest one company America
that he picks a 19 year old kid from
Tijuana he just met on the Internet
but in that in fact was exactly the
right the right person well since I have
a memory you know I've been in love with
electronics Legos computers but I also
was in love with our planes and I always
wanted to be a pilot
basically I'm living in LA when I was 21
at that time I have the opportunity to
to get the remote control the copter and
it was very difficult to fly and that's
what I got me into the rabbit hole so
now I wanted to you know make it work so
that's when I started my research and
that's when I discover that I needed
something more more complex electronics
and more complex software to be able to
touch it and this was not expected to be
a company this was really not even
spected to the community this is just me
trying to get my questions answered on
the Internet
so I create a website called DIY drones
which is basically to answer questions
what the heck and it was just the right
place in the right time the community
took off the people server said hardware
has suddenly gotten interesting I must
explore you could be an expert in
software but not of hardware expert
electronics but not on avionics and a
community started building certain
projects started actually collaborating
on electronics and code and actually
making real drones the last time is when
Arduino was released which is the one
the platform to change everything for
the makers a main hackers you know out
there so I was able to get my hands on
one of them
and it was I'm exciting you know to
learn like from from a scratch like a
new computer system this guy Geordi
Munoz who was showing how to fly a
helicopter the Wii controller using
Arduino it's really impressive and we
were learning a lot from this guy he was
clearly the smartest of the bunch and it
was a lot as the smarter bunch they was
clearly he figured something out it was
the Arduino is the common filter it was
the fact that he actually did it it was
just just clearly a guy who you know
everyone was smart everyone knew stuff
but this guy somehow it put it all
together so I thought I need help I need
someone else to do that like that date
job I'm the editor of Wired right I need
I need someone to actually do this and I
thought she was the smartest guy out
there was join me and I said yeah you
wanna wanna build boards and they said
sure I got some time and I said what do
you need
he says components here's a jacket so
she just brought me a check $500 to
finally the best investment in his life
so that's basically how I everything
Deanne 3dr started out with a focus on
building an open-source platform that
can be tailored to fit the needs of
different clients across a broad range
of industries but in the last few years
it's become clear that the drones
leading the consumer space were also the
ones being most widely adopted by
commercial operations so to catch up 3dr
had to create a compelling model for the
average beginner and it just released
the finished version of its mainstream
consumer drone the solo so the drone
marketplace has become really crowded
over the past couple of years and 3d
robotics is seen as something of an
underdog DJI this Chinese company has
the majority of the sales and the
majority of the profits in that space
and is continuing to innovate at a
pretty fast clip well the first
challenge for us was getting robust
apply the second hard part was to make
it easy people don't care about software
you don't you don't buy the software and
a phone you buy a phone and you know
you're like it's like I want to buy a
slab here that just works and I wanted
to have one button and I just wanted to
always work and to to turn software into
a consumer electronics product to it
integrate it to embed it etc to to
basically turn something that's
beautiful and reliable and affordable
that is a whole different
skill set that's ultimately necessary to
to sell to consumers I'm in charge of
sales marketing revenue you know
customer service making sure we sell our
products do a lot of product development
they're kind of the all the early so low
definition stuff what it should be I
think it should be so low as my chance
to come and you know if I had a wish
list of all the things that a drone
could that could fit in a backpack could
do these are all the things I wanted to
do you know I think you know challenges
from just like an overall brand
perspective or just second mover
challenges you know well well there's
this company DJI that's been around for
three years and my buddies got a phantom
and you know my uncle has a phantom why
should I buy this other drone you know
they've been around they've been doing
this for longer than you have what makes
yours better you know and just trying to
educate the consumer you know what what
is different and special about solo over
the incumbent in the market you know and
so it's just that you know it's the
second mover challenges this year they
introduced solo this is the first drone
that's been introduced that has a 30-day
money-back guarantee so you buy this
drone for $1000 you play with it for 29
days if you don't like it you just send
it back to them to give you your money
back
while 3dr is far from the leading
manufacturer in the drone industry it's
made a name for itself by building
innovative in quality products 3dr came
out of a community of drone enthusiasts
and developers it has the deep respect
of many industry veterans due to their
continued commitment to building
community and open sourcing that
technical progress as a company we make
hardware as a community we make the open
part of the software we're modeled a
little bit after Android in that respect
which is to say that there's a platform
there's an open-source off you know this
is a software platform that can be used
by lots of people but there's also a you
know a company behind that platform and
that company makes its money from
selling some hardware but also going
forward building software and services
around it
drones are expensive and they crash
right it's a product that flies and
occasionally falls out of the sky and
usually when that happens the message
that you get back is I'm so sorry and
best luck with your next drone 3dr built
a system so that they essentially have
like a blackbox recorder and if they
determined that they were at fault they
will just replace
crowd and that's also a first I think if
you look at the company as a whole and
really the 360-degree view on you know
channel engagement strategy and the
customer support story and logging
everything about the flight in the
controller so we know we can always take
care of our customers on the back end
there's a lot of decisions we made
around solo that that were more not just
in the moment of flying based decisions
take really great care of our customers
it's simple I'm a user you know our
whole marketing and sales team or video
production team they're all users of the
product you know we really have a
passion for these things and we want to
make the flying copters that we want and
love if this doesn't feel great to us
then let's not do it for our customers
it almost feels like we're trying to
develop the best copter we can for
ourselves and we're sharing it with the
world and I feel like that's a distinct
advantage we have over DJI the potential
uses for drones are expanding rapidly 3d
our technology is currently used across
multiple industries including
agriculture infrastructure construction
photography search-and-rescue and even
ecological study 3d arm might not have
some more established brands like DJI or
parrot but that's not what they're
betting on they're betting on open
innovation from the growing community to
help create the future trends very soon
you will see the livery medicine rescue
traffic whatever you can imagine or
whatever you need to put something there
or move faster between the point A to
point B now you're gonna be able to do
it safely and that's something that
really looking forward soon I think I
think some drones are going to be like
sprinklers you know irrigation systems
on farms where they just sit there and
every morning at 6 a.m. they go up and
they do their thing and they come back
into their pads etc and that people
control fleets of hundreds of thousands
of them you know or I could be
completely wrong and the point is it
doesn't matter if we use the open
innovation approach I think we get the
collective innovation of everybody out
there on our platform rather than just
what just you know my capacity to
imagine
you
