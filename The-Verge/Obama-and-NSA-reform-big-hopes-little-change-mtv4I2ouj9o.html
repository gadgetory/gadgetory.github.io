introduced his plan to reform the
American surveillance system building on
the recommendations made by a White
House review panel despite some welcome
proposals the speech offered little real
change and what the President did
propose will have to go through Congress
and intelligence agencies first the
strongest proposed reform is an end to
the government database that stores
virtually all american phone records
obama promised to quote and the program
as it currently exists we don't know
where those records will be going moving
them back to phone companies or into a
private database could present privacy
problems the NSA complains it might not
be able to look up individual records
quickly enough we'll hear more about the
ideas in March when intelligence
agencies present their proposals for
moving the database Obama promised to
create more oversight for surveillance
outlining a plan for more transparency
and new posts that would advocate for
civil liberties he also reassured
non-americans that their privacy was
being respected and that they wouldn't
be targeted because of race or religion
it's going to be up to intelligence
agencies to carry that out in an
extraordinarily difficult job one in
which actions our second guest success
is unreported and failure can be
catastrophic the men and women of the
intelligence community including the NSA
consistently follow protocols designed
to protect the privacy of ordinary
people they're not abusing authorities
in order to listen to your private phone
calls or read your emails when mistakes
are made which is inevitable in any
large and complicated human enterprise
they correct those mistakes the US has
been hot water for spying on world
leaders and Obama promised that if your
is close friend he'll just pick up the
phone and call you that didn't stop him
from pointing the finger at other
countries though no one expects China to
have a open debate about their
surveillance programs or Russia to take
privacy concerns of citizens and other
places into account
but let's remember we are held to a
different standard precisely because we
have been at the forefront of defending
personal privacy and human dignity at
the same time the NSA isn't going to
stop spying anytime soon the president
described surveillance playing a crucial
role throughout America's history from
Paul Revere spying on the British to
more recent counterterrorism efforts
launched after 911 in fact 911 came up a
lot the tragedy of 911 911 another 911
911 in aftermath of 911 911 911 a horror
of September 11th 911 many of the review
panel's proposed reforms are dropped
entirely the president didn't mention
the NSA's programs for collecting email
in bulk or breaking into the private
networks of companies like Google and
Yahoo it seems likely those programs
will continue with only minimal changes
in oversight the new reforms offer some
hope but little change the next test
will come when the CIA NSA FBI in
Congress decide what to do with
President Obama's proposals</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
