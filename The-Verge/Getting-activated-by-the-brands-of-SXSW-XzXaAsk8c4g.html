entertainment editor at the verge and I
am at South by Southwest most people
think of South by Southwest as a
three-tiered festival you've got film
we've got music you got interactive but
the glue the special sauce that pulls it
all together nobody quite gives enough
credit is brand so while as
entertainment editor I'm mostly out here
to check out the best film and music the
universe has to offer I also can't help
but be curious about these brand
activations I want to see how detailed
they are I want to see how they're
engaging with us socially I wanna see
what kind of stuff they're giving out
and you know I just want to see what a
brand activation is and how I myself can
get activated into the den of brands
when I walked into South by Southwest
row so it was pretty much in what you
might call an event space or an art
space just sort of an empty hall that
maybe one might have a bottom it's fun
for the most part it looked a little bit
slapped together I wasn't too impressed
by the optics at this activation but
considering that there was a vending
machine that basically forced me to
tweet hashtag Game of Thrones so that I
could get a prize I mean they did a
pretty good job of making sure that some
kind of social action came out of this
activation the prize ended up being a
pretty crappy iPhone 6 case which I just
pawned off on Brian Bishop and he
promptly lost
so to wrap up Game of Thrones South by
Southwest rows not my favorite
activation here didn't get to activated
except when I was actually forced to
tweet something in order to get not the
best prize in the world it was sort of
hard to explain a little abstract with
the interactive sword game I'm gonna
give this my pass I'm gonna get out of
here
get out of here
can you tell me what a brand activation
is if brand activation
we should get it started get it going
let me go now turn out introducing a new
friend into the market by giving it to
consumers I don't know so I walked into
this booth and it wasn't really clear
exactly what I was supposed to be doing
I got a few prompts with some vague
questions about what I would like to see
in the future of music festivals and
then suddenly my picture came up on it
and I was supposed to record a message a
message about what I'm not really sure
wait what am I supposed to do yo music
festivals if you're supposed to confess
let's be real I'm not even gonna bother
to Tkaczyk this one it was a disaster I
did not know what I was supposed to be
doing there this is a massive fail I
have no idea what just happened that's
it can you tell me what a brand
activation
what do you think it is something
so can you tell me about brand
activation so that to say I've been a
little bit disappointed by the brand
activations at South by so far this year
has been felt very activated to be
honest but I got an invitation tonight
to stay at the Bates Motel which of
course is famous from the A&amp;amp;E television
show Bates Motel and this is my hotel
for the night what the this is the most
activated I have felt the entire time of
Anna South by Southwest this is the gold
standard of brand activation here at
South by Southwest okay it's a frigging
motel room okay there's like an actual
bed a crappy fan in the corner aren't
work everything that you would find in a
real motel is here look at all this
stuff they gave me I got an ileus presto
I got a brownie of some sort I got hot
sauce I've got so much
so we've seen a lot of brands here at
South by Southwest try and fail to get
activated seeing a lot of different
methodologies different philosophies of
activation and I think if there's one
thing that we can learn from the Bates
Motel activation provided by Annie is
that it's really not that hard all you
have to do is give people a place to
sleep let people sleep in your brand
people wants to sleep speaking of it's
been a long day I need to get some
shut-eye catch up on some work
so other brands take note I'm about to
get activated
