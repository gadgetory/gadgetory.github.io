in the news first off Yahoo is in the
news Yahoo cause that's the whole bit
just let's just take that in just you
know so let that soak in for a second
I'm excited so they hired the CEOs thing
with Scott Thompson Scott Thompson so
right there's make that up Eddy how he's
there for five buns and then he got
fired because he lied on his resume
about having a computer science degree
he's actually as an accountant he has an
accounting degree but he does not have a
computer science degree there's a big
kerfuffle that's a word and you think
you would check that they fired him so
so we were talking about it and we and I
said look everybody lies on their resume
right you've all lied on your resume
yeah he said this to an audience of his
employees yeah I mean I've la I lied
there's no way I should be running the
verge I lied about my I mean no eyes not
I'm not qualified I tell people I'm a
doctor there you go hi super I'm dr.
Patel I thought you were doctors don't
take those that's ecstasy he's like this
will make you feel a lot better
there's nothing to joke on every Oliver
all right anyhow but we were like let's
find people and ask them if they've lied
let's see if people will tell us if
they've if they've lied on their resume
and Frank and specifically what they've
lied about Paul thought that people
would not go for it no Paul was dead
wrong very wrong Neal I took to the
streets of New York the hot sweaty gross
sexy streets of New York we might have
different ways and Andy talked to people
never as people everyone is like like
you know I don't usually lie but I'll
lie on my resume here's exactly what I
did take a look at this it's a
fascinating look into the minds and
hearts of average New Yorkers if you
relied on your resume to get a job mmhmm
yeah absolutely
absolutely yeah I wouldn't say I have
lied maybe like exaggerated
responsibilities so on your resume right
now it says they're fluid in Portuguese
it might say
do you know one word in Portuguese see
is that does it mean yes yeah do you
know how to say no now okay you know
it's a baby it's almost just like if you
don't do it you're an idiot because you
won't get the job I lied about having
let's agree
oh my god you know I think the weirdest
resume have you ever received at the
verge is literally just the word please
I know that means I didn't sleep that
night
so you're on your resume it said you
were manager yes yeah
what were you actually a chance no it
was an Excel I'm a bank it changes but
I'm actually a checking account
we need some like suits we need to see
what the 1% thinks of lies problem is
none of them will talk to us
excuse me sir we're doing some
interviews no none of that
excuse me we're doing an interview about
lying and resume yeah just wanting to be
involved with your thing all right
thanks I appreciate it
excuse me sir your boyfriend yeah hi
we'll talk to you next
oh my god your guy in a suit I've been
waiting for a guy in his food oh my god
come on big guy Masood
yeah if you were hiring people and you
came across the resume with the yahoo
email address on it you I would be a
little offended because everyone uses
Gmail who who has Yahoo or like hotmail
I had a hotmail account before my Gmail
and everyone was like that's only for
like child predators what's your main
personally I have a hotmail account when
they don't have a gmail email address
actually I judge them so that's people
they don't have Gmail yeah I never use
Yahoo I told somebody my email just as I
air Wallace
and the person at my job just kind of
look at me like do you still have a oh
well like come on you gotta get up on
the Gmail now
I'm a Gmail guy there are three things
you would immediately do if you're the
CEO yeah
oh god I'm try pray pray pray cry pray
and then I would call a big meeting to
restrict you the my first move would be
to quit
second move would be to sell my shares
because then you wouldn't be obstructed
by that we're going to move to get out
ultimately we're all liars we all
stretch the boundaries of reality to
construct a box that makes us feel more
comfortable but as I looked inward today
a universal truth revealed itself to me
no one gives a shit about Yahoo
that was that was enlightening
alright seems like you got it lightened
there it was very very strange yeah I uh
I liked your last line no one gives a
shit about Yahoo that's really touching
well no the whole problem is that Yahoo
doesn't give a shit about Yahoo and that
is it that's how this happened it does
seem like if they were just took a
little more care with the brand they
might not have hired the guy who likes
resume they like Scott what what it's
fine
just hi does he have a computer science
degree so you have a goal here right
does he have a computer all right I mean
ultimately aren't we all computer
scientists though on our resume</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
