seen Google assistant everywhere from
your phone your TV your car even your
watch now we're seeing it on these brand
new smart display and the Novo is one of
the first partners to create these
actual devices essentially it's
basically extending the Google assistant
to a screen basically display so kind of
similar to how we seem to the echo look
something that's sort of similar to the
rest of that so let's see exactly well
what it does for that so I can say stuff
like hey Google good morning and it's
going to go through a routine which you
get you all right to work information
maybe the news or that sort of stuffs
the sort of thing you'd expect when you
wake up and ask it for a routine so
other things you can do beside the
routine stuff is obviously queries like
you it on Google assistant hey Google
show me bakeries nearby so normally on
the phone you listen to get the Google
assistant and you get a bunch of stuff
back and you have to wait and go through
every single thing and here you can also
scroll through this like a card UI you
can tap whichever one you want so you
can also dig deeper into the experience
here hey Google show me how to get then
you're gonna get directions for your
Google Maps what's really interesting is
it's also gonna send these directions to
your phone as well so you can pick up
and go out and drive to wherever you
need to go so you might be wondering
what's this running is it Chrome is it
Android it's actually Android things
which boots into the Google assistant
experience that we're seeing right here
so we're seeing a Google geo we've seen
Google Play Music we've seen Maps
YouTube a lot of Google services at the
moment there's any third party to
support in the future and that doesn't
mean via Android apps or anything like
that so it's a new platform essentially
that Google's created and the Nova is
one of the first hardware makers to sort
of launch this at CES this year
there's actually two different models
and there's an eighth inch and a ten
inch the 8 inch has got just a regular
HD display the 10 inch has got a full HD
display but then over have done some
kind of interesting things on the
hardware and so around the back of the 8
inch model you've got a matte finish and
in only 10 inch model there's actually a
bamboo those aren't really being strange
about just how they designed them then
built kind of stand into the place that
you can change whichever way you wanted
to stand
that's pretty neat as well they've also
done a really interesting privacy
feature which is the webcam has a
shutter a physical shutter study you can
shut off and you'll be able to see that
from from from the distance we were a
red dot essentially you that will show
you that it's actually turned off that's
a pretty good thing to see in these sort
of devices we've seen device like the
echo spot that's got a camera that's
pointing at your bedroom and there's no
control over the the actual webcam there
even though there's a lot of software
restrictions is still quite nice just to
have that as a privacy control anyway so
these are kind of like military little
TVs they're kind of a retro sort of look
to them and I could see that they'd sort
of fit in the kitchen and you've also
you'd get YouTube for your recipes
you've got Google Maps for you driving
directions they kind of make sense at
that part of the home and they're kind
of small enough just to sort of sit on
the side and sort of just be there for
when you need to call them I think it
was really more interesting though is
the actual platform and where this will
go these are also limited to this 8 inch
and 10 inch form factor on these devices
and it's gonna be other ones obviously
and but I think what's really
interesting is where it goes like could
it be part of your toaster could it be
on it like your fridge I think that's
kind of where I see this essentially
going in the future in terms of when
they're gonna be available when you can
get your hands on one of these and
Google and an over both saying missus
can be sort of summertime the 8 inch
model here is priced at $199 and the 10
inch one is priced at $249 so you can be
able to get these in the summertime and
that's when we're gonna see exactly what
happens with it and we obviously seen
the Amazon echo show and it's pretty
early days for that particular device
we're not really seen its full
capabilities yet and this is obviously a
major competitor to it and its kind of
what we're expecting to see whether
whether either device is successful or
not we'll have to say but I think it's
it's gonna be an interesting battle
through the rest of the year ok thanks
for watching and we're gonna be at CES
all week so subscribe to our YouTube
channel and you can really see a lot
more devices just like this</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
