ce4 lives welcome that was amazing
welcome to the verge of oval show where
we talk about mobile technology mobile
industry and the colors of smartphones
this is episode 25 for the week of
number 12 and I am dieter bohn I'm going
to add some oh my god but in sync with
Dempsey foot yeah we're a little bit of
a train wreck yeah I've disrupted
everything I'm very good I'm gone you're
yeah you were having some awesome
pixilation on your video but that's ok
oh I'm just looking at it now it's kind
of going up and down it's like I'm the
anonymous member for the podcast yeah I
can't read your lower third right now
but we know who you are where you are
yeah I'm getting on my's for his own
safety yeah I'm the representative
internet troll in today's podcast taking
the place of chrissy cloud usually
nominated trope yeah there's an absentee
today in protest so the the most
important mobile news of the week is
that in Skyfall James Bond thankfully
only used his Sony Xperia T L phone for
like four seconds great yeah spoiler
alert I mean come on heaven I haven't
seen it what oh we all know man there's
so much I want to talk about with this
movie i purposely did not read your your
forum post on it because yeah there is a
very long rant that i posted in the
forums about about the movie and i
recommend you go read it yeah i think it
stinks period TX 20 30 TX is that what
it is i got that wrong the guys have the
t.o in the united states it sanity oh sh
t and t model right so there's three
different names which are almost
identical for phone that is pretty much
identical yeah differences eva is
terrible i don't want to talk about it
it's identically identically
the disappointing so yeah but that does
a big way to put it um but actually on
the topic of the biggest news i was
looking at topics list and i was taking
you were trolling me hard on me with
this like I just thought you know I put
it together in an order that made a
little bit of sense but it's that I'm
not like making a huge judgment call
here we can start wherever you want let
you want to start talking about BBM we
can start talking about BBM oh yeah dude
revolution if well it actually is kind
of a thing I mean I feel like I should
not be the one ranting about this
because I feel like a dieter you should
rant about this but but what the heck
man blackberry messenger this it's for
blackberry 7 yeah they have 20 so if you
don't know what we're talking about is
room is announced that there is a new
version of blackberry messenger that
will offer free voice calls over Wi-Fi
doesn't look like there needs to be any
carry involved with this over Wi-Fi and
you know it's it's an interesting and
useful feature and they're making it
available on blackberry 7 devices
earlier devices not so much and they
haven't said anything I don't think
about blackberry 10 I mean if it's not
on there that's ridiculous and yeah I
mean that's kind of cool um yeah so
maybe I shouldn't share this but I'm
going to we were like okay well we
should test this thing out as a
blackberry that we can we need at least
two people with blackberrys on the verge
staff you know active BBM accounts and
like you know active data to to test
this and it was like crickets I've heard
apparently the the minimum of two people
was to more than we actually have to get
better the other thing is rim announced
that they're going to launch blackberry
they're gonna have a launch event for
blackberry 10 on january thirtieth and
presumably they'll be actually be
releasing it in different areas the
world shortly thereafter although they
won't say what I just hope it's not
another one of these we're launching and
it doesn't mean anything kind of events
like we've seen with Windows Phone so
often well I pretty much is guaranteed
to be
I will see I I don't know I'm just one
it's the one thing I don't expect to see
is january thirtieth comes to sing hines
take the stage and he's like he is a
blackberry 10 device or touch he is a
blackberry 10 device physical keyboard
he will show both of them that's fine
yeah he's not going to say pre-order
today shipping next week he's not going
to do the apple way of launching a
product which is the thing you should be
doing yeah but anyway seriously now that
I've counted over well myself you want
to think I pro my salary by Corus gdm
around a because the thing that I
was saying isn't the biggest news story
which a lot of people might consider it
to be too busy stories apple and HTC
said something that painted disputes but
I am sick and tired of all this legal
stuff will come to it I mean it's
significant it's important but it's not
the most fascinating news it's not the
thing that everybody's been talking
about thing everybody has been talking
about is a nexus core going on sale yes
and what unless that is oh my what a
mess that was I mean I I wasn't all that
fascinated by it I wasn't one of those
guys who's chomping at the bit to buy
one but it was such a fascinating
experience for me to witness the guys
who were specifically one of them is on
today's podcast ah mr. Siefert and yeah
so let me let me tell you about my my
position with the nexus 4 so i was
really eager to see it go on sale and i
was thinking maybe i'll buy one maybe i
won't but I hadn't really committed to
it uh and then you know when at noon
yesterday when it went on sale in the US
and the whole play store went down I was
actually tied up an event so I had like
no way that I could really realistically
try to purchase this thing uh and of
course the store goes down and people
aren't able to purchase and supposedly
it sells out so quickly so you know I'm
back in our office a couple hours later
and people in our office are saying well
we're just able to refresh the store
page like 40 times in a row and suddenly
I'm able to buy it so I see two of our
other staffers buy them successfully and
then I pretty much made it a rule that
if I'm able to make it
show up in the Play Store I pretty much
have to buy it so so I refresh a Play
Store like 50 60 times in a row until i
got the add to cart button and i quickly
added to cart and submitted my verges
and now I'm you know four hundred
dollars poorer so basically better
strategy we you know I was I was all set
to go on a rant about how ridiculous is
it that Google can't just get a simple
play store up and running that says out
of stock you know order and we'll let
you know when stock comes in like you
that's like you know that's insane that
you they just don't let you buy it if ya
you just you just said there a refresh
it but maybe they're secretly geniuses
and they're just they you wouldn't have
bought it if it was just there but since
you know it's like gambling you just got
to keep trying it's like exactly why
he's not totally worked for me because
if it was just like I signed on it's
like oh there it is it's for sale should
i buy it uh maybe i wouldn't buy it but
because it was like you know you got to
get this oh yeah i won congratulations
you just lost four hundred dollars yeah
yeah but this this was the fascinating
aspect to me because it was kind of a
psychological behavioral experiment it's
like we've got this thing we've got it
priced at a level where people are
really gonna be eager to buy it anyway
and i will just introduce scarcity into
the equation like no severe and random
scarcity does the other thing exactly as
dan says it's a jackpot it's like yes I
got into this and now i pressured I mean
I don't know it's like a really
well-executed strategy that you might
get from an estate agent like dude we
got people coming in next so either you
pony up all your money right now or it's
God you have to deal with it no she's
interesting but also I mean thing to say
is then we'll say Play Store was
crashing and coming down lunchtime in
the US fresa was up and down all over
the world since the middle of the night
since australia and the jokes on Twitter
were like it's called a nexus 4 because
they made four units per continent stuff
like that obviously there was there were
limited quantities
fewer than well i guess google and LG
just underestimated how much the man
there will be for this phone i don't
know what whatever he actually like
server issues preventing people just
getting the waters brew or was it there
was a bunch of weirdness I think people
especially in the UK I heard that like
people would have it in their cart and
then they go to like check out and it
would disappear from their cart so there
was definitely some some odd things
happening there you know aside from the
whole you know hammering the Refresh
thing that we had going on over here and
I'm just going to recite one more joke
that I picked up on to it i'm a complete
plagiarist today but somebody will say
you know this would be totally
embarrassing if google actually ran
cloud services so i think i saw that
yeah it's a shame it's not a giant
company that runs massive cloud internet
services right because then we'll be
totally embarrassing what's happening
right now is a bit of a shambles but you
know the nexus 4 is out now the nexus 10
is out now well you know actually I know
what it is they they're running their
Google Play servers to sell the device
off of an HSPA network this penalty that
must be it yes yeah and it's 4g man so
uh to follow up yesterday's insanity
with the online orders today i hear the
u.s. t-mobile stores in select locations
and small quantities started selling the
device its store and how do we know that
dad well we know this well a because
t-mobile said it would happen but we
know that is a for a fact that they were
there because a certain mr. chris
ziegler who decided not to be on the
show today went over to a store and laid
down some serious cash for a nexus 4
despite the fact that he's hated on it
pretty much ever since it's been
announced I mean he's going to break my
kneecaps if if I brought this up during
the show so i'll prepare to prepare to
be in a cast next week I mean hold
strong say the psychology of what Dan
did makes perfect sense to me the
psychology about Christy
no idea I I kind of listen to explain
that was the nexus 4 in cyan is that
what the the story was you know III knew
this was gonna happen with Chris because
the exact same thing happened with the
iphone 5 right yeah he literally was
like not gonna buy one and then at 4 45
in the afternoon the day it was leaves
like guys I'm gonna walk over to the ATT
store and he walked over to the ATT
store and ballwin and came back so and
then he bought a shot at least bit and
then he bought a Lumia 920's yeah I'm
he's using a Wimpy about 20 now that he
just bought okay can I just digress on
the iphone 5 for a minute like a quick
minute sure thank you i don't think
we're really gonna stop you so yeah I
mean thank you for me should I
appreciate it I just want to say a bit
i've been using the iphone 5 for about a
week not because i actually prefer it or
want to i'm being forced to four
completely professional reasons you
understand but i'm on border i like this
phone and the other thing is I haven't
you used iOS user on the air power for a
while but I haven't used it on the phone
for a while and is so kind of cozy and
comforting to know that every single
thing in my life as a nap and I'm
talking mysupermarket isn't that yeah a
supermarkets loyalty scheme has a nap
easyjet has a nap that's kind of okay
British Airways as a nap it kind of
sucks but it's like every single thing
that I can think of dictionary.com has
an app and they're not all great dinner
or perfect but the is a broccoli happen
again yeah what about the ID i got i
gotta tell you the deficit of like raw
vegetable search engines I I gotta know
Vlad is there like a social network app
that will you share your raw carrots
with other fans of raw carrots now do
you see my relationship with carrots I
think it's being way over that's called
Grindr carrot Graham seriously cameras
have quite a bit of sugar in them so
some I'm controlling my intake of care
okay I I just want another record that
add is control he's a dick of carrots
because have to now or because of the
taste because there's a little too much
sugar in carrots yeah yeah I mean I have
to like like for example yesterday I
pomegranate that's really sugary but
it's amazing so it's like my sugar
intake and this digression really is not
comfortable so you just move right along
what I'm saying is with the iphone like
the distinction to me is a qualitative
one where Android has really fully
fleshed-out ecosystem and it feels
robust right you get a pretty much
everything you need but with Apple
there's this extra step with iOS where
you just know it's going to happen and
the other thing is skype just this week
got updated to support the iphone 5 and
what kind of like whoa it's about time
you know and i have a five just came out
and yeah and it's like this is the pace
at which change gets or rather
developers work to adapt to change in
the apple ecosystem you just so wrap it
so it's like iphone five comes out it's
a new size new resolution but you know
that within a month or two everybody
just knows how important that app is to
them and they update they do they do
that and they're just really comforting
and reassuring thing for consumers and
and this is part of the reason why we
keep harping on about this ecosystem
action with Windows Phone you know I I'm
starting to hate the word ecosystem now
because it's started to lose its meaning
but this is this is what it means to be
and I wanted to share that with you guys
and now we can talk about the droid DNA
droid DNA oh yeah let's I mean we could
talk about Windows now let's how about
the droid DNA so lucian uh join DNA
dan you held it in oh my god gagan an
actual picture on there like an image
instead of a sense for because since I
think say to me said I would you're
pretty mellow stories never what I want
that uh I don't know why I don't even oh
forget the thing in the camera why are
you looking down I'm trying I'm trying
to let me do one of these uh it's like
I've never used one before yeah it's
like all I have are screenshots on here
so it's actually pretty lame um but
let's do what you're listening to the
audio version of the podcast so nothing
yeah here's yes here's the droid DNA um
it's really thin for for what its eyes
but obviously the the star the show is
the 5-inch 1080p display and it's it's
like 440 PPI um I don't know if this
will actually focus that close but you
really buy you can't see the pixels
there's just there's no pixels and the
viewing angles are insane it's super
awesome a tree it looks like the image
is literally like floating on the
surface there baby daddies nice I mean
uh we've been we've been raving all year
about the 1x display and it's super lcd2
with 720p and how it's the best mobile
display that we've ever seen and even
though newer stuff has come out like the
iphone 5 and the galaxy s3 the 1x is
still the best but this is better so so
there's you know there's that the other
thing is you know it's 5 inches it's
pretty big as you can see but it's not
as big as you might expect from a 5-inch
phone I compared it side-by-side with a
1x yesterday and it's a little bit
taller than the 1x but it's it's about
the same with really yeah it's about the
same because it's it's I don't know it's
just so tall and narrow that seems were
married in the battery is 2020 million
power so it's actually kind of small
well it's it's a it's insane to say that
a 2000 milliamp hour battery small these
days but uh it that's the fact it's yeah
put a screen size in the high resolution
yeah i've got i got to do some more
tests on it um but I'm battery is my
concern it's super thin though you can
see it's got like these tapered edges to
make it is also mentioned and this this
is i think is a big credit for it for
HTC is that they built the wireless
charging right into the phone while it's
that thin yeah yes yeah it's on you
because you can't access the battery of
course the battery door does not come
also you can't access that so it is nice
but i will i'm gonna hate on this right
now if you see this the bottom is where
the micro USB port is and look what i
have to do to access it because it's a
door I can't recall all the last phone I
tested the head abdur on the battery
that's like really terrible and so it's
actually really hard to get out and it's
really hard to put back in as far as
inconvenience so both that's why you
have one is charging what is sinking
right yeah I guess that's that's what
they're trying to push the other thing
that I'm super annoyed about is the play
student of the power button which is at
the top in the middle which is like the
worst place to put on a five inch device
well we discussed this last week you
just need to bang it out you know on
your forehead oh you can the other thing
that's really cool I'm like totally
giving away all of the stuff that's
going to be my review in a couple days
but if you see this flashing it's got a
notification light on the back of the
phone all that is awesome so if there is
one on the front you can see flash there
yes and then on the back right there
like like that's that's one of the
coolest things I've seen so that's
amazing yeah I mean I schedule how would
you characterize the the build quality
mean I've got a no to back here and I
still feel like it's typical Samsung
like it's good and fine but it has that
vague feeling of being plasticky well
this this doesn't feel too plasticky
it's all soft touch on the back the back
is really slate and flat but it's all
soft touch materials it's got this kind
of funky I don't know if you can see it
there grille on the side yeah um that's
on both sides and you know it's it's
pretty typical HTC build quality it's
not a unibody though like the 1x so it's
it's not a doesn't feel like a unibody
but okay I mean it's all it's actually
really light to its 138 grams which for
a thought of this size is lighter than I
would expect like I've got night and
then yeah dude you beat me to it it's
like so so for those of you who don't
know the 920 is really heavy but I'm
sure if you're listening to this you do
you know that but around the verge we've
begun to call that the tank so we just
refer to like you know I'm checking out
the tank where I'm holding the tank or
using the tank today's is to repair the
Lumia 820 isn't that much lighter i
think it's 160 grams a problem there are
really nice hefty phones and this is why
i'm saying credit to HTC because they're
building wireless charging right into
this device which is right then
the windows phone 8x which again is very
thin and even small it's a 4.3 inch boat
so you know nokia is excused that we've
packed the most advanced yada yada into
this phone therefore we made it the size
and weight of a tank is a bit flaky when
you compare it to what HTC is a cheap I
can't but there's an infographic that's
floating around about the weight of the
920 and I can't find it but the you know
they quote me they quote you know it's a
tank and they quote like where'd
somebody else and then they have like
are you just being a baby here's why
it's okay and then I think the first
like comparison is an iphone 5 and like
two slices of Bologna and like that
equals the way yeah its fucka yeah
there's two slices of turkey the iphone
5 look at me very thick slices of turkey
if you ask me yeah odd guy that's what I
said but um so let's see is running a
tegra processor right no no this is a
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 pro so same
problem so I owe any more of the okay
we're just talking about specs we know
the specs yeah I mean that I'll just say
what this best pic is very nice and sexy
and attractive to me because we all know
the Snapdragon s4 is eminently more
efficient than the Tegra option it does
all we don't have you we think Thea no
we know with Felicity s4 pro it's a quad
core yeah I know but at the same time it
doesn't come with a gimmicky companion
call it actually can crank itself down
it doesn't have a little buddy coming
along for the ride well Jay on their
Optimus G put like an eco mode thing and
I got an email asking me that you know
talk about how you can motor flex
battery life and I don't know on that
much like they've got a whole bunch of
widgets for messing around with the
processor which made me worried that
maybe it wouldn't be that battery
friendly but I don't have the that's
what she's on me anymore but in my time
with him you know I found the process
would be super fast and didn't seem like
it was problematic on battery life no
that's this thing has got a huge screen
so who know it's a screen and it's the
high resolution it's pushing around a
lot bigger as more pixels we know that
like with when the ipad 3 wasn't
revealed and i had a really high
retscreen an apple
added like almost double the battery
over the ipad 2 to get the same battery
life so you know that could make a
difference i obviously am NOT gonna
don't know just yet because i still got
to run a few tests on it but uh right
that'd make it i can bring it back to
the optimus G that's great point of data
raises i also have zero idea what that
eco mode does on that phone but i
enabled it and it actually had endurance
which was like it was significant enough
for me to notice that that is longer
than most folks in that size class
anyone with that battery and I was like
why is this happening what's so special
about it and now that you mentioned the
Eco mode and the quad core is for that
makes perfect sense fee which all you
know actually makes droid DNA re you
know compelling option for a whole heap
of people apart from the whole sense
situation and let me quickly mention the
price in the u.s. of 1929 and should be
launching this time by promoters are
aware that we should be launching this
time next week ago in 21st it's kind of
amazing it's really impressive all of us
thought it would be like higher than
that daily I would have expected it yeah
for the first 1080p phone in the u.s. to
be priced at 199 is pretty significant
if we go back a year HTC was the first
company in the u.s. to bring a 720p
phone with there is a news out yeah and
that was priced at 299 so um yeah I mean
it's it's offering a lot of a lot of
specs for the price that's definitely
for sure and we're just all accepted
that phones can be this big and that's
okay like we're not complaining about
phablets we're not complaining about all
god this great is so big I hate this is
why why are they forcing these huge
phones on us we just sort of yeah that's
how big phones are now that's how it
goes oh then we then people are just
going to be like am i watching a rerun
of
hello episode 24 Oh episode 27 we're
echoing ourselves like you register your
complaint once we already know when you
register you to break nobody listens and
then you carry on hey dude where we know
I have HTC in our audience right so I'm
sure I'm sure there's slaving away on
that on that 4.1 inch super phone plus 1
Jesus with a 720p screen or whatever it
is 300dpi for whatever resolution that
is yeah seriously pixel densities in
that important anymore like I still want
to see an experienced at 1080p phone
naturally obviously but you know once
you get past like 340 DPI you know the
720p resolution of 4.3 inch screen then
it just get silly like yeah I mean you
didn't need to say that you can't see
the pixels on this fig that I know it's
basically like bits of paper yeah and I
mean because it's a super LCD like you
could see the viewing angles are really
great too so yeah well looking forward
to revisa yeah and then you said no my
way cuz we're where it won't work
doesn't matter no you away I used to be
a phone what what is this outdated idea
of using a phone as an actual like
if I needed that I'll get BBM with those
awesome voice calls and then I would
like plug it into the nexus 7 with 3g
data ah oh yes actually we review the
nexus of it with 3g data no just this
week we don't normally talk about
tablets here but i ordered the ipad mini
with LTE should be arriving on friday
are you seriously doing what you're
doing right now data this is really
compelling audio woody of your oh yeah
oh yeah it's really here come jumping up
and down but I'm not excited about going
back from right now
but I mean whatever I'm excited to have
a tablet with LTE in it because the
night my nexus 7 doesn't like I
definitely agree with you there neither
like I i like my nexus 7 at home but it
rarely leaves the house with me just
because it's a pain to get connected so
sweet i but jelly bean it's it's rolled
out to their words like the downloads
you could get and i'm pretty sure
they're rolling out OTA slowly to some
devices Galaxy Nexus Nexus 7 I got my
oga today actually I did you get your
okay for my next scheduled asians Nexus
S and moto zoom not getting it so this
is kind of insane uh if you ask me
because both of those devices are on 4.1
actually four point one to point two now
yeah and and I I don't know the reason
why they wouldn't be updated to 4.2 yeah
I don't either it's actually kind of
aggravating um maybe you know I don't
know like maybe those lock screen
widgets just take up so much resources
well if it's like if it's a space issue
maybe but then you know lighten your osf
google sure I'm some fat I don't know if
it's I don't know if it's a space issue
I mean the thing that that's funny is
because when you go from four-point-oh
to 4.1 I there's a much more of a jump i
think than 4.1 2 4.2 there's there's
much more of a performance increase
there's a lot of under the hood stuff
that happened so i could almost see some
them saying this isn't getting
four-point going from 4.0 4.1 but
frankly 12 4.2 is a little bit more of a
disappointment yeah yeah and you know I
actually really like the new clock on
the lock screen yeah it's just really
clean and clear and readable not that
the stock google lock screens have ever
been particularly terrible but like the
new one is really nice it's like in 4.8
and it will be available in no point
five percent of android devices i'm sure
we'll look at those android stats at the
beginning of next month
then you'll be like that this is this is
a frustrating thing you know thing yeah
and the recurring thing but if you have
another phone and you want to get to a
newer version of Android cyanogenmod 10
they've gone to a stable release so it's
not technically 4.2 but you know they're
working to integrate 4.2 stuff into
cyanogenmod 10 this is what I'm running
on my HTC One X on ET and I endorse
cyanogenmod I think it's a really good
and really awesome i'm really happy with
it further there's some drama today like
that it's the person when Santa broadcom
is like not giving it back to them and
was like being a jerk and so now they've
moved over to saiyajin Matt cyanogenmod
gorg instead yet again probably there's
a little dodo main fight there someone
got a little bit tiffy better I'm just
I'm I'm pretty happy with the cm10 on
the what exit this is the reason I'm not
buying a nexus 4 is I can get you know I
can keep my LTE and have something
relatively close to the stock experience
I like what cyanogenmod does on top of
Android 4.1 instead of just offering a
straight stock AOSP rom and you know
there's still some bugs so you know
whatever they're still working on it but
you know it's really awesome and I am
NOT going to buy a nexus 4 not kind of
did it one bit perdon Vlad why do you no
interest in the nexus 4 if I might ask
because because the LTE thing I think is
much less of an issue for you in the UK
than it is for us here the u.s. I just
want to say with respect to what teacher
is talking right now it's like I'm not
gonna think about the big pink elephants
I'm not gonna think about the giant pink
elephant and then the only thing in his
mind is like man does a pink elephant in
my imagination yeah it's yeah so yeah DJ
I'm sure you're not gonna buy nexus 4 i
totally buy that i'll buy the nexus 4
bumper how about that how ridiculous is
that they're selling a bumper dude I
seriously I I don't think I've got
enough credit
I don't think enough people have written
about my full sight when I was bitching
about the glass back like as soon as the
next four was announced I was first to
jump on that bandwagon and save this
girl's back strike trouble ok.let
browser stemmons review that yeah and I
mean that's just want to I mean the
future is laden with cracked glass specs
on Nexus fours and people cursing their
luck and thinking this could have been
some sort of you know high-end plastic
and I would have been happy and probably
just kind of cringe that LG's random
patterns and stylings whatever but I
mean okay let this also dance quite sure
why I'm not so psyched about nexus 4 I
think I also kind of addressed it when I
was a enthusing about the windows phone
8x and I mean it's also kind of speaks
to the fact that as mobile reviews we're
not regular people that we're different
worse a lot of ways i don't i don't know
if i were you i think chris is the
prototypical mobile phone buyer and
chris is the perfect example then again
not just something that I am because
like the fact of the matter is you
brought you run for all these android
phones you get to use them for week two
weeks a month whatever and you get kind
of bored with them and then you move on
etc whereas most people have to make
these choices for months and months at
an end i mean ii again if you chris
ziegler he thought because he
keep breaking by spring so thankful
seems like he's like you feel it was a
willing this beard and then you suck on
your cone it's like that i don't even
know what to say about it but ok this is
this point is me android what what I'm
really trying to say is I just grown
bored of Android to some extent I've
what a really grown bored of is non
stock Android and basically sense is my
nemesis at this point and it's the thing
that drives me nuts because the droid
DNA will be so much more
a fascinating captivating device me if
it was running 4.2 stock which again the
nexus 4 runs but I've also had time with
the optimus G which is essentially the
nexus 4 and it is like am I going to be
thrilled and excited about the optimus G
with stock Android to some extent I mean
obviously I prefer it but is is it's
just some experience that I've had
already and this is why I'm psyched to
see Windows Phone develop and grow and
do some more interesting things because
that is a chance to look at something
that's truly knew this is why I had a
digression about the iphone 5 because of
being away for iOS for a while which
again marked me out as being
particularly different since everybody's
freaking user there and it's probably
what I'm going to be you know fascinated
by the new BlackBerry devices when they
release in temporary 2014 you go person
we're rooting for you um yeah no I see I
see your argument Vlad and it's it's I
you know I've been even teasing crest
today but I kind of wish she was here to
talk about his is using the Lumia 920
because he's called yesterday I quote he
called himself a windows phone 8 convert
because he's like you know perfectly
happy with a with the Lumia 920 right
now um but yeah I mean it's a different
experience I guess and uh you know it's
not the same old Android and iOS front
of the middle type of thing that we've
seen for a couple years now yeah but ok
let's actually get to the topic that was
on top of our topic list which is apple
and HTC cuz that was not the week but
the weekends absolutely biggest names
yeah yeah I was all reading and like I
was I meant to Sinofsky schnapps key is
the biggest news ready yeah well in our
in our mobile world apple and HTC are
the biggest news yo so in art for the
mobile show uh Appalachian so saturday
today I'm at a wedding
the reception for this wedding and my
phone just starts blowing up because
Apple HTC decide to announce that
they've become reached a 10-year
licensing agreement and settled all of
their patent litigation around alone
yeah around the world and like uh you
know and they had to of course announce
it at you know whatever it was our post
went up at ten after nine so they must
have announced it just around 9pm so
it's uh um thanks thanks guys but it's a
it's a pretty monumental thing it's one
of the the first agreements that we've
seen between Apple and an Android
manufacturer and the fact that it's it's
for so long it also means that HTC will
be able to use some of apple's patented
things in its its its devices those
things that Samsung's not allowed to use
like slide to unlock and bounce
scrolling I'm not sure about scoring was
covered by no slide to unlock was
definitely a license to HTC so that
makes for a very interesting competitive
future between HTC and the other Android
manufacturers yeah I think I think I
spotted a report today from Samsung one
of the Samsung higher up saying
something doesn't intend to follow in
HTC footsteps and agree a licensing deal
without yes obviously that was based on
a relatively aggressive translation yeah
and so it's yeah that's that's what I
had we had determined i think but but
even if whether or not is like the most
unsurprising thing ever yeah i mean they
they wanted court because they wouldn't
license yeah it was like oh it's like
samsung we're just waiting for HTC to
set the market and I was like yeah okay
we'll go go ahead and go do you got that
billion-dollar lawsuit whatever yeah
that was just biding our time I'm just
waiting for you guys to do it and that
now we'll do a deal I mean obviously
they won't but I think I think I think
this is really significant because it
does actually said so for the others
again Samsung is growing into androids
exception and if because of his size and
because these were
configuration of those things Samsung is
kind of a unique company but you know LG
is an in Samsung's position for example
Sony certainly is any sense of
transition and those companies are the
ones that stand to be next in Apple's
firing line I don't think that Apple is
soon then yet but you know I'm sure even
Apple has a limited number of lawyers so
now that the freed up from HTC who's to
say there won't be you know nudging and
pokey those companies and that's what
Microsoft it for a long time Microsoft
was suing guys like HTC Motorola and
demanding you know royalty payments for
certain Microsoft patents and now
Microsoft has a full freaking portfolio
pretty much every Android manufacturers
paying to royalty fees and you know the
thing that people will be saying is you
know android is free from as far as
Google is concerned you get the source
code from google but then you actually
end up having to pay a whole bunch of
licensing fees to microsoft and now to
Apple yeah yeah I mean crazy I just this
is how it should work right there'll be
a little bit of fighting in the courts
and then you just say you know what how
about we spend our time not arguing
about this and I mean HTC in particular
like they actually had some of their
devices held up like they couldn't sell
what was it it was uh the evo ltd LT
yeah yeah and so you know it's it's in
there just get this behind them and I'm
really happy now what will be really
interesting glad you mentioned LG I
think that if we see license deals that
cover Nexus devices like the Galaxy
Nexus or the nexus 4 that would be very
interesting because that would sort of
be you know stock Android is not cool
with with apples patents yeah it
implicates Android itself yes yeah
rather than the skins yeah um I mean if
you just because for example okay if LG
decides okay we'll pay a licensing fee
and that will cover the nexus 4 for
example done that
means LG thinks it's in danger of losing
a court case let's say now we're
releasing put those things but it
doesn't necessarily prove that Android
itself infringes does now does apple
have a suit against LG right now I don't
think it does I don't think it does III
think motorola is the only one that's
left that Apple has an active suit
against and that's all very interesting
well yeah I think the question might be
does that go even know if it has i think
if you okay assuming apple's press
relations people actually spoke to
anybody and responded to email and you
reached out to them do you think they
would actually know of the top of their
head coup de su in a good or not sewing
or if you said hey guys you have a go
suit against Sony they'd be like yeah
let me just give a get to legal and find
out and I have a post it on our imax of
who is currently illegal litigation with
them right now yeah it's like dude we
need to take care of acer asus first of
all we're gonna have a bit cooler here
before we get to OG in over its kind of
so i really do you think this is kind of
like the dark and unpleasant side of our
business because the whole baked and
stuff is just so tiresome and i say this
is somebody who studied low for a long
time I know there are actually
fascinating areas of law you might not
believe it but it's true and pay some
boys and one of them like they're
probably should be when I first went in
to go and won't started studying it I
was like I'll dude I feel almost be the
greatest you know it's you you get to
talk about technology telecoms media all
of these glamorous and interesting
things you're in cutting-edge yadda
yadda yadda and then look look at the
things we're stuck talking about it's
like Apple got a paintings on the
underground in rectangle it happened it
literally happened and i'm reading our
headline and I'm like you know growing
my eyes and not believing it and I'm
like wait Neil I wrote this so it's not
a joke
that's it I mean I've got nothing else
to contribute to that so as far as you
know that the the lawsuits that are left
there is definitely the lawsuit with
Motorola which is immensely interesting
because of motorola's very close ties to
Google itself now but we still don't
really know what's going to happen with
that and i'm not sure what I want cedar
but I'm just goodbye i'm shaoling josh
Topolsky here I've got some problem with
my hair and so I'm just checking to make
sure that it doesn't look completely
ridiculous only partially I would check
this whoa but my video feed looks
completely gelatin ated at the moment
yeah Vlad I could tell that you have
hair yeah so so change well yes yeah
you've been growing that up it looks
very nice I've a complete recovery from
a haircut so we don't really know what's
going to happen yet with motorola an
apple but i think that'll be you know as
you know if I just said how
uninteresting all of this is I think if
anything it'll be interesting to see
with the watch to see what happens with
those two you know does it that's true I
could be the drama and the soap opera
that we also like to create around these
things who's going to sustain story
anyway but speaking of soap operas let
us actually talk about Steven sadowski
and his departure because that is
through a major major thing that
happened over the weekend yeah so he's
out he left on the twelfth pretty much
effective immediately although he's you
know gonna hang around and help if
needed um he is pulling a forced
home yeah he's fully well that's
actually exactly right people inside the
company tell us that one of the big
reasons that he's leaving is he just
doesn't play well with others and you
know he likes you know his silo control
of things and doesn't like to
collaborate and uh you know that's what
Microsoft needs to do now they need
Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8 and
SkyDrive and Windows Live or whatever
they're calling it these days and Xbox
and I don't even know what else you know
they all need those things to talk to
each other and interoperate and you know
share stuff more so than they do now and
you know if he's not the person to help
make that happen then you know I guess
he's gotta go Julie larson-green is
taking over for windows and what's
really interesting for us mobile side is
Andy Lee's who had sort of
unceremoniously been taken off of the
Windows Phone team to work on like a
generic you know cross windows phone 8
windows project that was never very well
defined is now back and he his new job
is what now I think windows corporate
development and strategy so he's sort of
back in the mix as a player at Microsoft
which is I think I just want to say
corporate development strategy is
perfectly defined and everybody from my
grandmother to I nice my five-year-old
niece perfectly understands and gross
the width and breadth of that decision
that's ah Jesus uh oh so what I tools
like what you totally eaten your
Wheaties this morning you're just angry
angry man not do you if I Wheaties I
would be joking all day I'm afraid of
cops Akron for like cereal like you know
or can fiber chunks or Wheaties or
whatever like do you ever crave carbs is
there like a non no no but does the
point like like cogs and arian trading
mobs vegetarians eating soy and
pretending it's burger do you do
anything like that you pretend that
something is wheat no I never pretend I
keep it real he keeps it really keeps it
raw then why are we talking about glads
diet again this isn't good what tweeted
this afternoon a picture of cauliflower
and broccoli and said this piece is
yummy its glazed donuts to me is it is
if your if your palate adjusts to not be
completely destroyed by eating you know
sugar and dogs or whatever then yeah you
you taste flavors other people thought
tasting regal I want I want to go back
sugar wait wait no I was going to talk
about any leads yeah then we I just all
I wanted to say was I was really happy
that the Vlad is you know passionate and
angry but it's and then we started
talking about College yeah okay look
yeah that's a good point and job titles
like senior vice president and then
another noun after that like senior vice
president something-something operations
like that is so grammatically Boston
like it makes me feel dirty if I were to
write it in full but set all that aside
um first the first thing to say is that
Cena Sinofsky was the guy in charge of
Windows 8 yeah right and you got it uh
yeah I mean Windows 8 is a product of
Steven Sinofsky work so let's give the
guy credit he might be a complete and
epic asshole to people worked with but
the final product of what he produced I
had a cohesive vision again we don't we
already know I mean how could you really
assess something as you know holistic is
a desktop OS over you know a few days or
a couple of weeks even you need to sit
down and spend time so we'll see how
Windows a develop some of the long run
but to me I totally agree on the point
about Microsoft needing to unite the
various strands of ass ecosystem as in
uffish strong personality as strongly to
control things getting in the way of
that because I say he was the man in
charge of windows 8 and windows 8 was
like his baby and it was like a ball
right and he's clutching it tightly
whereas what Microsoft is trying to do
is like take these balls is that let's
get back to the food metaphors they're
like free balls of mints and you're
trying to splice them and make one giant
epic ball of Awesomeness right and if
he's touching it too tightly and he
can't work with the other guys you know
guys like Joe Belfiore in charge of
Windows Phone and whoever's in charge of
Xbox Live and no services that's where
the friction comes
and the first things that steve ballmer
actually remarked about a successor to
me the most destructive yeah this is
information because he said looking at
the technical and the professional
requirements for the job I think she has
exactly the qualities that we need and
the first quality identified was good
communication skills and the second was
collaborate effectively so just the
things that he's highlighting is
positives in her like somebody who's
just broken up with one girlfriend and
moving on to a new one and saying that
the new one has these really great
qualities that usually tends to be the
things that your girlfriend which in
this case is Steven Sadowski was lacking
that's enough analogies free yeah I mean
the thing is like the what I would
expect to be next for for Windows Phone
like what you know how would this affect
Windows Phone like they did it right
they got it on the windows 8 core and
the there's not you can't directly take
a Windows 8 app and just throw it onto
Windows Phone 8 so maybe they'll fix
that and move in that direction but it's
actually relatively close based on what
they were talking about a bill and what
I've seen even if you can't just
directly just like release it on both
platforms at the same time whoa look at
that light in the background there even
if you can't release an app on the same
good both platforms just the same thing
the skills that you need to make one app
now directly translate to the skills to
make the other app and you can share
assets and it's actually very easy to do
one or the other so I'm not sure what
this executive shake-up means like
directly for the future Windows Phone
that they haven't already accomplished
under you know under synopses leadership
I just want to say that Andy Lee's was
the guy who's the head of kin yeah ah
come on don't hold that against him
as somebody who has a massive in this
please didn't buys come late to kin
though didn't he kind of inherit kin I
can't remember the timeline I went out
you know what did Oliver backlinks that
is an enormous printer in the background
on his video feed enormous and
apparently use it every day which makes
him a completely evil person I wouldn't
say every day but it gets used every
week right and so what I'm saying then
is you can't hold bad decisions against
people like I don't hold that against
you too much so you can't hold that
against tantalise like okay ken failed
so you move on it doesn't mean that the
guy in self is a complete not a failure
well and like you're saying with his us
extremely nebulous title we don't really
even know how close he'll be to Windows
Phone 8 anyways so yeah but yeah we'll
be very interesting to see uh you know
how Windows Phone 8 like you were saying
Peter how to develop parallel with
Windows Phone or Windows 8 and if it
will become even closer than they are
now the one thing that would sinofsky is
I guess a lot of people really thought
him to be Steve Ballmer successor as CEO
oh yeah but that's not the case so
that's a that's pretty interesting it'll
be interesting to see who would
Microsoft you know kind of bubbles to
the top as maybe possibly the the
successor to Ballmer now or maybe bra
water will just continue to be for
eternity uh we should have funny we
haven't pointed out like Windows Phone 8
has launched like we should bring that
up like the 920 the 8x are on AT&amp;amp;T
what's verizon got the 10 i forget out
what's on every care so they had 22 a 22
and then DX those are going to be in
stores on the fifteenth verizon
clarified that today and then also on
tmobile the eight to 10 a 10 and uh
there's gonna have phones and i gots to
go over today actually from t Verizon is
going to have a free windows phone 8
device by the end of the
here which is fine yeah I mean I guess I
guess you know the verizon has that one
hundred dollar price point and the two
hundred dollar price point so the free
price point is kind of like that lowend
cover so so verizon's definitely got a
full windows phone 8 spread uh yo
covering all of the price points that it
would expect to cover to match against
its android offerings and of course
against the iphone models that it offers
so how excited are we about this chris
was very excited he went out to an ATT
store and bought a Lumia 920 a cyan one
uh oh yeah of course I will answer that
question glad as we get closer to the
holiday season and we start to see how
the marketing push goes and how sales go
as a result of that marketing push oh so
you you're going to be like a sports
commentator I no no no no but no listen
it you know we dudes this today just
saying no when you don't even know what
I mean uh what are you okay go ahead
Colette let me get my knives yeah like I
was what i was watching the NFL over the
weekend and thing that was consistently
noticing is that the Vikings are awesome
and totally enhanced the Lions that's
what I know the story yeah dude Adrian
Peterson an amazing um but the thing I'm
so I was also noticing is that sports
commentators love to wait until a
decision a decisions consequence is a
fully apparent and then they give the
expert opinion on it so they wait until
like this is what I'm not you're gonna
say and let me tell you why you're wrong
go ahead because our consistent
complaint about Windows Phone 8 isn't
the app ecosystem isn't there either in
terms of breath but especially in terms
of depth and like apps feeling on par
with what's available on the other
platforms and microphone is doing with
everything they can to solve that
problem with the thing that will
actually solve that problem our sales
numbers are devices in people's hands
and people demanding from these app
developers to make better and more apps
for Windows Phone 8
and the only way those sales numbers are
going to go up as if we see you know
Realogy remarketing brush so we've got a
chicken and egg problem here but the you
know it's a classic ecosystem conundrum
but one of the ways that we have seen
that ecosystem conundrum get solved is
verizon our you know ATT or carriers and
the manufacturers or in this case
Microsoft working together on a unified
awesome powerful and huge holiday
marketing push to actually sell devices
and if that happens then you know by the
end of the holiday season we will see
more devices more market share and that
will drive more apps so you know I'm you
know am I excited I'll be excited if you
know it's able to you know lead to a
more robust ecosystem and I think it
could I think they're doing everything
they can we'll just have to wait and see
what the marketing looks like and I had
another point and I lost it but the
that's been ever you say you first quit
was so damn good that man come back so
to follow up with the eaters point
yesterday I at the droid DNA launch
event I had a little bit of time to chat
with verizon's CFO and I asked her you
know Verizon's marketing push in the
holidays is always very large and it can
be the type of thing that either makes
it if I succeed or makes a device fail
and I asked you know what's it going to
be like for windows phone 8 and the
verizon has really started its marketing
campaign yet um but she did say that
starting when they're available in
stores so I guess tomorrow there'll be
gonna be available at stores so we
should be seeing some some windows phone
8 ads from verizon and we'll have to see
if it's as big of a campaign as
obviously the Droid has been and
obviously what verizon's done with Apple
ads I mean Microsoft is promising a big
campaign to you know but like Rolling
Thunder you know was not much um well
that was nokia right yeah i know but
what I'm saying is like big promises
don't necessarily yield big results and
you know I mean here's the thing like
this is a new platform again and I know
that apps from windows phone 7 75
carry over and I know it's been around
for a couple of years but in terms of
what apps are actually able to do with
native code now and like games able to
get ported to it or even launching on it
originally a much more quickly it's it's
a whole new platform that has new
possibilities that haven't been
exploited on windows phone at all
because they just weren't there and I
want to see you know I want to see apps
i want an IRC f that can persist in the
background I want you know killer games
that appear on Windows Phone the same
day they appear in iOS or Windows even I
just want to start what's up so I can
buy coffee without having to trust the
third party sketchy up so I mean it
they've built everything they need to do
now they just need to sell the phones
and get the virtual cycle Nico system
going I can't believe just the sheer
dependency the ban is built up my
smartphone like this really measure of a
stove except I I can't get coffee
anymore I don't understand Vlad I don't
know how to exist anymore can somebody
help me if I don't if I don't use my
Starbucks app I don't earn my rewards
points and then I don't get my free
drink so it's it's all it's a cycle
they've got me sucked in do you know
it's not totally collecting what's that
you know it's not a free drink well like
if you like let me have my dream okay if
you actually came to negotiate with
people like starbucks or people like
your supermarket and they ask you how
much do you want for your data how much
do you want for your shopping habits and
you were going to sell them you could
get so much more than freaking you know
a few cents on every purchase so then
eventually it adds up to a free drink a
quotation marks you being ripped off
with all these loyalty cards mean think
about it it's a loyalty card you had the
lawyer one that's like it's a
convenience factor and it's you know the
stupid rewards are whatever but now the
truth is that dan will only get coffee
from Starbucks he hates local businesses
he
entrepreneurs he hates you know the
local coffee shop you know some mom and
pop place he wants corporations to win
uh you know glad you and I are you know
socialist but he is a hardcore
capitalist he's much that's you know in
the one person yes a Starbucks app on
their phone I mean they just deserve it
right I mean it's sitting on his on his
iphone right next to his foie gras app
you know just right there yeah I mean
look I don't even need to read a
passbook opens it for me think about
that I walk into the starbucks and pass
book opens my my my app for me and it's
like go spend this money on sugary
loaded over roasted coffee that doesn't
really taste like it and like how are
you not horrified but if stuff you just
saying right now it's like oh hey it's
the apocalypse it's going that's about
it maybe does a realistic part I mean
the other thing we found out this week
is that apparently Arabica coffee is
going to go extinct because of global
warming within the next eight years this
is a crisis this is a real crisis like
me Erica isn't the only type of coffee
but is the higher quality it's the one
that matters nobody wants to take the
robusta come on ah dude I can't believe
how much reaction we wrote about this in
first of all I'm like wait we've write
about coffee now this is within our
remit and I look at it and I wouldn't
like very mad if we did not convinced
and nms although people have picked it
up on facebook and on twitter and it's
like hundreds and hundreds of comments
and everybody's alarmed about it and all
of these things whereas if we do an
article about you know landfill in
Southeast Asia you'll get like six
comments and you know follow the people
who like well though sucks where's the
droid DNA coming out again copy we need
to prison yeah before we wrap up I do
want oh do we want to talk about
FaceTime on AT&amp;amp;T um I just point out
that sweeper in the chat
was that who was yeah sweet Britt in the
chat just wanted to say that the dance
or republican he install this Romney on
his phone boom amazes me to be happy
hello although I love a bad pun man um
so AT&amp;amp;T has like backtrack just the
teeniest tiniest amount and I wish we
had Chris here to to rant about this
because he wrote a really good article
about how 1880s flip-flop on facetime
over cellular should scare you like
they're allowing / phone's not on mobile
share to do facetime over cellular but
it's still twitchy right like it's not
every single plan they just stepped it
back just a little bit and it's you know
in response to not direct regulatory
pressure but like the threat of a
possibility of it but it's still like it
shows that like us complaining about
FaceTime on the mobile podcast doesn't
actually fix anything it's it's insane
how arbitrary these restrictions are
because and before it was you had to be
on a mobile share plan didn't matter
which device you own if it was FaceTime
compatible and was on a mobile share
plan you could use it over cellular and
now it's like well only if you have an
LTE device but you don't have to be on
LTE to use it you can still be on an
hspa+ network or connection and use it
but it's got to be an LTE device so it's
like sorry 4s users who are not on
mobile share and sorry for iphone users
who are on grandfathered unlimited plans
because if you're on a limited plan
you're you're just well I'm assuming
that it's that arbitrary restriction is
because they're still afraid that the
network is going to fall down because
there's just flat-out more iphone 4s
users out there than there are iphone 5
users so it's not about LTE it's about
it's about just limiting the numbers
yeah yeah although I must admit as well
as then explained everything I am
completely a loss of what the hell is
coming on
I have no idea honey well I would just
like to note that you know and how many
carriers are Kari offered the iphone
across the world and there's one carrier
that has a problem with it and its ATT
and like no other carrier is having a
problem with facetime see how America
yeah okay not nobody enjoys okay but
actually i just wanted to squeeze in a
couple of observations from the UK
before dita wraps up in his expert style
first of all it's have a good pass book
which then brought up with the sub box
application and now that's cool that it
happens for you automatically that i'm
really happy for you and I'm gonna let
you finish by a neck okay but actually
passbook in the UK is one of the saddest
things you ever see there is like four
compatible things and I well I want to
say that it's pretty it's pretty damn
sad in the u.s. too because i use it for
starbucks and I've when we reviewed iOS
6 at the time the only thing that was
available for passbook was a walgreens
app and so I have that installed as well
uh but yeah it's pretty pathetic yeah I
mean it's barren at the moment it is a
typical of Apple but then so is maps so
whatever and a Nokia Maps coming to Iowa
that's about that yeah we did I add that
to our list did we so know if they
rebranded here they bought here com
they're doing crowd sourcing for their
Maps data which seems like amazing but
Google's been doing that forever and
ways is doing that and there's you know
open street maps this is that that's you
know everybody's doing that well ya know
then it's coming to iOS is potentially
really great because Nokia's mappings is
you know really good I just hope they
get it released in relatively short
order so actually we're doing this
series this mind-blowing series of
living wid things which which is right
now focused around the home theater
stuff so like xbox 360 ps3 amazon
devices etc and i'm thinking we need to
do one with living with Nokia Maps
because I actually
I've tried it I've always tried it
occasionally and given it a shot during
reviews or whatever but I've never sat
down actually like use it extensively
the weather I've used google maps and
had to rely on it on a daily basis I'm
sure the same will be fascinating to do
with respect to iOS 6 now that this is
like a pitch meeting for future features
I did I'd if I do you feel like
sometimes we're kind of you know you
kind of need to spend some extensive
time to really appreciate you because
all I ever hear about Nokia Maps is yes
is good and it's being reliable enough
when I'm use it on occasion but I'm
still kind of wary like I wouldn't buy a
phone I think this is good as Google
Maps yeah would you guys say that's the
case I think we're so loosely mice in my
testing yeah the my testing in terms of
accuracy and you know directions and
everything else Nokia Maps has been as
good as Google Maps I've had I had no
problems there I've had some
unfamiliarity with the UI and I kind of
don't love it and there's a problem
specifically on the Lumia 920 we're like
the old Bing Maps was still there in a
weird way anyway so it I think if you
were to live with Nokia Maps for a month
I think you would probably find that you
would get used to the UI you feel pretty
good about it and you may get really
into stuff like you know the local local
Scouts and Windows funny thing but i
forget what Nokia's local like they've
got their augmented reality anything
local citizens yeah which people I'm now
just a few new age 8 yeah I doubt you
would find it as like as good as I doce
y el pin in certain areas um no yep is
garbage well the car you'll find counter
else is garbage everywhere SAT for a
samsung easing in san fran so y'all go
get 5 carats so I'm never gonna try
looking for what a man forget you out
man oh it's a water pump we don and what
about must have way too much sugar man
no no it doesn't doesn't doesn't thing
it's really really sweet but it's
actually very low
in calories and sugar it's it's amazing
watermelon is utterly amazing what do
you do with the situation's eat them
yeah I chew are you afraid of a
watermelon grown man up man need the
seeds so I just want to say it's going
to be a very amusing day when I download
and install a Nokia Maps app on my
iPhone I just find that very just to
clarify is it is it now just called here
or is it nokia here I don't recall um i
think it's i think it's just here I mean
you know it's from Nokia so it's no gate
here Chris put it uh yesterday I was
saying that and he's like well just
think of it as the NAD tech app so good
yeah but I mean I've used a whole bunch
of different third-party map solutions
on iOS and they're all pretty terrible
yeah so far right and so if they can you
know make this feel I think it's just
called here maps Oh Dunn's Evans code
here maps like why I have to hear it so
if you just see how critical it maps I
mean are you really that worried about
what is uh yes damage Adam with the
brand to buy roofing today so I'm
worried okay but yeah the other thing I
was just going to throw away quickly is
something i could have comments on a
couple of weeks back and i was missing
from last week's podcast which was LTE
in London here in the UK yeah because I
managed to get an OT you know do a
little round round the city jury and
test it out see how what what LT handset
did you get dude you broke up there for
a second from e.e it was a galaxy s
freak but you know they spoiled the
iphone 5 the Lumia 920 etc um and I have
the HTC One X 0 honestly the 1x one XL
1x plus spirity Xperia T L not get a 20
lumia 822 these guys are like
yeah I've no words left to describe but
anyway is it a LT in London is good
bordering on glorious depending on where
you are yeah and completely irrelevant
again depending on where you are yeah so
if you are where I live in a perfectly
civilized lovely leafy area of North
London there's just nothing well I mean
the best I can get is free g plus
whatever the heck that is to actually do
a bit of community move around but ok so
i'm masahiro but as soon as I start
approaching Highgate I get reception and
then it jumps from like three and four
megabit which is actually kind of low
compared to the free network I jump from
that for free for megabit to like 19
down and 17 up and like speed test
starts flying I mean just literally
flying and I like that so that's when it
starts becoming fun to just run the
speed tests yeah I'm not kidding you
it's like usually I run a speedtest and
I go and do and think about something
else it's like making tea that's how it
is whereas with this thing is like the
tap on speed test and you yokai said and
you look down it's already done right
and as you move into you know
particularly areas of good coverage in
city the highest pizza got were like 36
38 minutes down and something like 20 up
which is just crazy on a phone and I'm
really starting to appreciate why you
guys are so nuts about LTE and i can
tell you i can tell you i can do that uh
you know two weeks ago I was saying
people here in the UK we're going to be
okay with the fact that doesn't have LT
and vast majority of people here I go to
be perfectly fine with it because eee
price plans are not great its coverage
is not great its bandwidth or rather the
frequency which it operates isn't great
for penetration buildings so you won't
be covered everywhere you go outside and
some buildings you go inside the office
and you lose your soup cause did so
there's a whole heap of thing standing
the way but when you do get that little
boost of lte man it's like it's like
primordial man tasting his first refined
sugar it's not just a brush which which
Vlad will not eat that's right but you
know it's in it it's it's good they're
just a whole bunch of caveats at the
moment well I hope it'll be interesting
to see how the the network in the UK
will handle load as more people get on
it because those speeds that you're
saying we see them from time to time in
the US but most of the time if you're on
verizon's LTE network which is which is
you know pretty broad and fairly well
loaded at this point you don't usually
see 20 up and 20 down but you see more
like 13 down and seven or eight or nine
up which is still by the way good come
on yeah I mean compare that with the
experience and have no or HSPA it's like
oh yeah when it when it hands off down
to 3G I just pretty much want to just
put my phone away and give up because
verizon cdma service is so slow and
they're just one of the addendum I
wanted to throw in and i'll say i was
listening to this on the BBC which is
actually that apparently development in
africa with mobile telephones first of
all sales of phones in Africa I like
going off the chain I mean I'm sure
they're like 2g really basic simple
phones but everybody needs a phone
nowadays because of mobile payments or
things like that they facilitate things
which mount possible and connectivity
and all of these things and which isn't
that fascinating but the thing that I
picked up from this BBC report was
actually that quite a few carries in
Africa might completely skip 3g and just
stop rolling out 4g and this is
something i found cute about Bulgaria's
broadband rollout because we never
bother with dial-up and DSL or these
things they just jump straight to like
fiber optic connections and big fat
pipes and all of these things which is
why i had 50 megabit helm in the most
rural part of bulgaria
and and this is a nudge I just really
enjoyed the idea of people in Africa go
from like to G where everything's like
tech space like i'll send you a payment
text i'll send you a facebook message
text and all of a sudden like 4g droid
dna's dropping out the is hi I'm
service worried its breed three times if
you count the young gay whole' SS
wearing yeah that's an atomic an antigen
on that of that beautiful note i am
gonna wrap up the Virgin Mobile show for
this week if you want to follow us on
Twitter where we do occasionally swear
you can i'm at backlog lads at flats a
bob Dan's at DCC Fredette Seifert is
spelled with an e I Chris who is not
here is at z power and if you want to
tell him that you missed him on the show
you can but I recommend you do so with a
photo of a cyan colored phone we'll be
back next week which day who knows we'll
see how we feel we're not beholding
anybody I mean we were bold to you our
viewers but whatever okay goodbye thanks
