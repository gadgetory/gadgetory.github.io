believe in the Internet
I've been on the internet for the
majority of hours of my waking life I go
to sleep with you and I wake up see
internet and it just it's kind of
invaded in my life it's supposed to be
like a utility right like like the sewer
and you don't you don't go down into the
sewer it's just it's just like I'm it
just helps you it's a helper hey you
should go down into sewer the Internet I
mean after a while you're gonna start
you just have to feel dirty
CSS crappy stupid superhighway HTTP had
that fakes please colon slash slash HTML
how this my life will be different so I
I'm gonna have my phone I'm gonna have
an iPad I'm gonna have a computer but
they're not gonna be connected to the
Internet we're not even get a text
message cuz I want to be want to be in
the zone and I don't know how long it's
gonna be could be forever could be for
like three hours
I might just freak out but I'm gonna do
it and before I go there's some things I
need to do
well here I am at the library I've been
trying to think of a good way to replace
Wikipedia to one of my favorite websites
so I've been reading a lot of Yelp
reviews about libraries and I picked
this one four out of five stars pretty
good the only complaint was that there's
a lot of children here I feel like
that's complaining there's sick people
at a hospital this is a place for
learning it's a place for joy so what if
a kid gets excited about Curious
George's a lot you know there's some
stuff on here that I'm gonna really miss
and I think the biggest thing is gifts I
just I just love gifts so much what I'm
lonely or I just I miss being connected
to you know the information superhighway
corgis you know I I just I'm gonna save
it
here you go mr. Miller
thank you very much these are my thumb
drives this is what I will use to form a
sneaker net to transfer information to
my peers and colleagues
what are you seeing it for a lot now is
looking up health things enough I have a
rash or maybe it's cancer you know it's
usually cancer from here at Canal Street
the world capital of big watches big
t-shirts you can get fake electronics
but I'm on the hunt for a genuine
old-school Nokia do you have any old
Nokia's yeah no what's the oldest phone
you got like a real home like a milky or
something look Brad Mikey cop off
psychic let's use those super you I want
like please snake on it the cools game
let's see phone okay I see the Nokia
over the c10 two two games games games
games games no games you might think
that Spotify invented free unlimited
music but actually there's been music at
the library all along a little bit
Dashboard Confessional yeah got a little
bit Dave Matthews oh you are shuffle are
you music what up no old folks alright
thank you so struck out
apparently they only have new fake
phones on Canal Street and will
disappoint a little disillusioned but I
think you know what I have to do now
all right this is the last time I I'm
just gay use eBay because you know it's
it's it's easier and there you go ID
like I bought a phone just now and I
spent I spent three hours trying to do
that a Canal Street so what are my
favorite things to do on the Internet
let's play Starcraft 2 and Starcraft 2
doesn't really work without the Internet
so I'm gonna see see if I can find a
replacement what would be so good like
things that get me started and if I just
wanted like a for playing you mean yeah
if I was just gonna have a really
bare-bones
rules already this is kind of like
playing conflict playing Starcraft
against Warcraft I think it's gonna be a
good move for me ultimately I have have
no idea what life is gonna be like
without the internet I mean you can
prepare for these sort of things these
sort of natural personal disasters you
never really know how you're gonna react
until it happens
and the grim darkness of the far future
mankind teeters on the brink of
extinction there's no time for peace no
respite no forgiveness
there's only war I guess in my case it's
more like there is no internet it's not
as it's not like personally like a war
thing for it's just like don't I can't
get on the Internet at all but uh you
know basically
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
