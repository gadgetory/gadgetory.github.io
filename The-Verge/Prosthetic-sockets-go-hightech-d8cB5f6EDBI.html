experienced the full spectrum of
prosthetics simple hydraulics - simple
kind of mechanical knees -
microprocessor computer knees but what
has not happened in my entire experience
is any evolution of the socket
technology people are comfortable
wearing their prosthetics hard to do
things with a positive attitude when and
while you're in pain a growing number of
startups and researchers are finally
taking a fresh look at prosthetic
sockets using pumps flexible liners ski
boot like ratchet systems or even
surgical implants to improve on this
long-neglected component of an
artificial limb one company earning
praise for its advances is limb
innovations which has developed the
infinite socket a modular and adjustable
version that can be quickly produced and
continually adjusted the san francisco
company was founded by orthopedic
surgeon andrew petty and prostitutes
garrett Hurley UCSF colleagues and
surfing buddies who found they shared
similar frustrations over the state of
modern sockets patients generally say
the infinite socket is more comfortable
than the conventional version allowing
them to wear for longer periods and
engage in more rigorous activities that
includes Robert Spotswood he lost his
right leg in nearly his life in a car
accident outside of Birmingham Alabama
when he was 16 he was eventually able to
return to sports he loved before his
accident like rock climbing and soccer
and take on new ones but with
conventional sockets he could only climb
or play for short periods before the
pain forced him to stop the sockets
actually enabled me to not only play 18
holes of golf where previously I could
only play nine I could play back to back
18 I could play 36 in a day I could play
in a tournament for a weekend I could
turn around afterwards and go out that
night go to a nice dinner walk around
the city I didn't know it at the time
but I wasn't doing the things that I
would really want to do because I was
pay and I was uncomfortable the upfront
cost of limb socket is currently about
the same as a conventional one but
because it's adjustable the infinite
socket could potentially save money over
the long run
since patients won't need entirely new
ones when they gain or lose muscle or
weight but it doesn't seem to meet the
needs of every amputee Dan Brzezinski
lost both of its legs in 2009 when he
stepped on an AED during a tour in
Afghanistan for me I found that I'm
fortunate in that I actually don't seem
to lose or gain volume all that much so
adjustability isn't my number one
priority efficiency really is for me he
spent weeks getting fitted with the limb
socket but found it was considerably
bulkier without being significantly more
comfortable ultimately after giving it a
go for five or six sessions a couple of
hours each
I thought the technology was cool but
personally the desire for me to chase
that perfect fit through a limb socket
just isn't there and I feel like this is
still the best use of my time and allows
me to have the lifestyle that I need
other organizations working to improve
prosthetic sockets include CLIC medical
which also relies on a ratchet system
and the best project at MIT which has
developed a flexible silicon liner
meanwhile Brzezinski himself is most
interested in an emergency surgical
option known as osseointegration in
which devices are implanted directly
into the residual bone allowing
prosthetic limbs to snap on it avoids
the need for a socket all together it
means patients can support their weight
on solid bone instead of soft flesh it
is a risky procedure however prone to
infection and Brzezinski is holding off
for now by having the implant go
directly into the bone you can actually
get sensory feedback from the ground you
get the vibration of that foot striking
the ground much more so than you do
through a socket so there's some really
neat benefits there
of course any novel device or
experimental procedure in the medical
industry faces considerable challenges
from getting prostitutes to recommend
them to convincing insurers to pay for
them but patients themselves are happy
to finally see some progress in this
crucial component of prosthetic limbs
addressing a very literal pain point in
their lives when you feel more
comfortable just on a day to day basis
walking to work getting in and out of
your car it just gives you the
confidence to live more freely and as a
result you end up pushing yourself I've
never been in better health I've never
been more excited to wear my leg on a
day-to-day basis it's more excited about
new me and phiy technology as an amputee
I always appreciate it when when any
company or entity is trying to push the
boundaries and come up with something
new limb isn't the only one working on
that technology and I think the industry
will get there eventually I think it has
potential</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
