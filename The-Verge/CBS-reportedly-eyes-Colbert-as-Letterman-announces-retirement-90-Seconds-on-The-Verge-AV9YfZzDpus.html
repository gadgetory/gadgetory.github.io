still a ways off but that hasn't stopped
pretty much everyone from speculating
about his replacement deadlines founder
nikki Finke says that Stephen Colbert is
quote the only one on the air currently
that CBS is considering and Mashable

take the gig according to The Hollywood

John Oliver was approached about taking
the 12 30 slot Oliver ultimately went to
HBO as for Craig Ferguson who currently
hosts CBS's Late Late Show at
twelve-thirty multiple sources tell The
Hollywood Reporter he's not a serious
contender CBS could just scrap both the
Late Show and Ferguson's Late Late Show
all together and start with a clean
younger slate both shows her owned not
by CBS but rather worldwide pants David
Letterman's production company and
