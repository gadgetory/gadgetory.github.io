looking at Microsoft's new surface free
tablet that's a surface free not the
surface pro free this is a ten point
eight inch tablet and so it's gone up a
little bit in in size from the previous
version and it's free by two aspect
ratio so - is kind of turning this more
into a tablet than the surface - was big
changes you've got a new hinge design on
the back which pops free way so one two
and then three it's kind of not exactly
the same as the surface pro free but
gives you a little bit flexibility under
the hood is the the biggest change and
this isn't Windows RT anymore so there's
no ARM processor in here you've got an
add-on processor which does mean that
you can run your traditional desktop app
so you know iTunes on here you can have
all the full office applications
Steinway v1 true Windows rather than the
Windows RT which didn't didn't have all
that support so it's running on an
accent processor its quad core processor
and you've got a 10.8 English display
which is nineteen twenty by twelve
eighty so while there's a Batson
processor in here the performance seems
okay but I'll have to review it fully
and to see how that goes it's pretty
much very similar to the surface - I
mean it's it's pretty much the same sort
of thickness they have changed a few
things on the side here and you've got a
micro USB port now and that's the power
port so now you more playing out of the
magnetic connector or anything like that
you can use your phone charger and/or
the supplied territory cetera and you
still got the full size USB and display
port so you can still connect up a
monitor still connect up flash drives or
accessories and on the other side of the
device is pretty clean and there's
nothing there apart from the kickstand
much less moved up the volume buttons at
the top here but overall still kind of
looking the same as the surface 2 and
the rear it's got a new logos as the
Microsoft logo rolling in surface and
compared to the surface pro 3 is
obviously a lot smaller dimensions and
it's a little bit a little bit thinner I
guess we'll put perhaps kind of the same
but obviously they look very similar
because they're both sitting still in
black
nation here but you can see that the
screens obviously very different you
look at 12 versus the tenth this is a
new surface type cover and pretty
similar to the old one clicks in but you
got the new magnets that stick it
together like that so it gives it a
little bit more stability when you
combine it with the kickstand so it's
not sort of just something around on
your lap or anything new color options
this is the orange one and there's gonna
be red blue and also I think a cyan
version as well and at the same time
they also added a pen for the surface
free and now this isn't this doesn't
come with the surface free this is
separate accessory you can draw on just
as you read on the surface pro free and
you can get much much in colors
depending on what type cover you go for
its overall you're getting a surface
free which is obviously cheaper than the
surface pro free so this one's coming in
at $4.99 without the cover and without
the pen and sort of impressions it's a
lot lighter than the surface pro free
and the surface 2 before it and so
you're getting a cheaper like a machine
that's are going to run all your apps
instead of the windows RT so that comes
in at full 99 with the keyboard and the
pen sold separately</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
