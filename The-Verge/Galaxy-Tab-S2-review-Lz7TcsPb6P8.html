thin it's so thin in fact that when I
went to go dig it out of my bag the
other day I couldn't even see it at
first is this worth $400 or more the
brand new Samsung Galaxy Tab s2 is the
successor to last year's Galaxy Tab s as
I mentioned it's thinner than last
year's model but it's also lighter has a
similarly beautiful display and has an
updated processor but despite its svelte
figure it's still in some ways the same
tablet inside I can't help but feel like
it's lacking that wow factor that would
catapult it into true top-of-the-line
tablet territory
does it have longer lasting battery life
nope an amazing camera nope that's
pretty much the same wireless charging
wishful thinking let's talk about the
tab s2 s build first one area where it
really stands out it comes in two
different sizes a nine point seven inch
model and an 8 inch model Samsung claims
the s2 tabs are the thinnest on the
market it's even thinner than the iPad
air 2 if you want to compare it with
iPad and it's pretty nice looking the
back of the Galaxy Tab s2 is an
unembellished matte plastic with metal
edges that give it a more premium feel
one area where Samsung's mobile devices
have really stood out from the pack is
in displays and the tab s2 s rich
looking Super AMOLED display is no
exception
specs wise the resolution is actually
lower than the display on last year's
Tab s which some consumers might ding it
for but the difference in pixel density
is probably not visible to the average
eye now there are a few features that
will look or feel familiar to you if
you've been using other newer Samsung
mobile devices for example the tab s2
has the fingerprint scanner built into
the home button it's running on Android
though it is an outdated version of
Android at this point and it has
Samsung's familiar TouchWiz skin there
are things like side sync which allow
you to do things like text message and
make phone calls from the tab and as
with other Samsung tablets you can
multitask using the multi window feature
but one key difference between this tab
and the previous is its four by three
aspect ratio on the previous Galaxy Tab
s Samsung went with a 16 by 10 cinematic
aspect ratio the tab s2
like many other tablets on the market is
4x3 and more optimal for everyday use
case stuff like reading it has an
updated Samsung Exynos processor due in
part to the fact that some people
complain that last year's Tab s felt
sluggish for the most part the new tab
felt fluid and fast and I was able to
play graphics heavy games and stream
video mostly without issue
although the smaller tab s2 froze up on
me and a couple occasions also it's
worth noting that the tab s2 has the
same processor as the Samsung Galaxy
Note 4 not the superfast chip found in
Samsung's latest and greatest
smartphones the cameras they're just
okay I still think using tablets for
photos is just weird but I know that
plenty of people use their tabs for this
and they probably won't be blown away by
the tab s2 s 8 megapixel rear and 1.2
megapixel front facing cameras which are
pretty much the same as last year's Tab
s and the rear cameras positioning means
it's still too easy to inadvertently
cover the lens with your hands or finger
also battery life suffers a little bit
due to the tablet's thinness it wasn't
terrible during an official verge
battery test I managed to get well over
6 hours with both tablets but that's
less than the average for tablets these
days it also doesn't support wireless
charging or super fast charging as I
mentioned earlier the Tab s 2 starts at
$400 that's for the 8 inch Wi-Fi only 32
gigabyte model but it jumps up to 650
dollars for a nine point seven inch 32
gigabyte model with LTE putting it
firmly in the upper echelon of tablet
pricing when you consider this it's
tough to justify an upgrade from the
previous model unless thinnest lightness
and a little more speed or top priority
for you tablets in general have fallen
off from the initial excitement around
them a few years ago and in order to
make a case for someone to spend several
hundred dollars in a tablet these days
it has to be something really special
Samsung has definitely improved upon the
Tab s where it needed it the most
but it kind of feels like Samsung made
this because it could not because it
should I can't help but think or maybe
hope that there's another tablet in the
works whether it's a new high-powered
Note tablet or another tab that is going
to truly bring out the wow factor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
