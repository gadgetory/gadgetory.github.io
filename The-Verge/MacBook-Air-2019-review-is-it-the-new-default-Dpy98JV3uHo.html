- So we have the new
2019 MacBook Air here,
in this really nice, rose gold color.
Like, actually,
wow, I kinda forgot how much
I really like this color.
Anyway, I'm reviewing it
for The Verge, even though
it is a pretty minor update.
Now, the MacBook Air, and
I mean the classic one
that everybody had, not last year's model.
It was the default laptop.
So here's a question.
Can the new version of this new design
live up to this laptop?
(upbeat electronic music)
Let's get the review part of this video
out of the way, right at the top.
It's good.
Still good, technically, since
what's different this year
compared to last year, when Apple released
the first version of this new design
is actually not that much.
In fact, I can explain it
in just three bullet points.
Number one, the keyboard has been tweaked,
again, for reliability,
with those new materials
that Apple's been talking about.
Number two, the True Tone
display is new, so that's nice.
It matches the color
temperature of the room.
And number three, it costs
a hundred bucks less.
That's it.
MacBook Air still has the
same Y-series processor
that's fast enough to do
most day-to-day tasks.
But it can slow down on heavy stuff
like video and photo editing.
Or even just having too
many apps and tabs open.
It still gets about seven
or eight hours of active use
in my testing, it still
uses USB-C to charge.
And it still has
a super convenient Touch
ID fingerprint sensor.
Plus, a really nice, big
Force Touch trackpad.
The screen looks great,
and I really prefer screens
that have True Tone.
Plus, thanks to a software
update for the Air line
that came earlier this year, it can get
just a little bit
brighter, up to 400 nits.
But that's not as bright as
what the MacBook Pros can do.
Also, just FYI, the webcam is pretty bad.
But let's admit the obvious.
You're wondering about the keyboard.
Well, what can I really
tell you? (chuckles)
My first impression is that
it's the same as last year.
It's a little bit softer and quieter
than earlier MacBook Pro models.
(keyboard tapping)
Now some people don't like
typing on this style of keyboard
because it's so shallow, but the truth is,
like, I kinda like it.
Cool right, fine.
Whatever, what about reliability?
Well,
I just can't say.
I don't know.
These are the new materials
style of the Butterfly switches,
so that should help with reliability.
And it's covered under Apple's
extended keyboard warranty,
so that should make you feel better too.
But at this point, these keyboards
have been so hit or miss,
it's safe to say that you're
taking at least a small chance
until we know how these new
materials are gonna work.
Or until Apple just
switches to another design.
(percussive instrumental music)
That's pretty much what there is to say
about this new revision
of the MacBook Air.
But a thing that you should know
is there are plenty of Windows laptops
at around the same price
point as this machine
that beat it on any number of metrics.
So you can log in with your face,
you can get an edge-to-edge screen,
or you can get a faster processor.
But none of those Windows laptops
have the overall build
quality or fit and finish
of this MacBook Air.
Setting aside the keyboard, of course.
But more importantly, for a lot of people,
those Windows laptops, they're not Macs.
So the fact that I think that
this is a pretty good laptop
is a big deal.
It really needs to be pretty good,
because it's the main
option for a lot of people
who want to use a Mac laptop.
Which brings me all the way back around
to the question we asked at the top.
Is this the one?
Is it the default?
The answer to that totally
depends on your needs.
The advice that I always
give about technology
still applies.
If you need a new computer,
buy the best one that you can afford.
If you don't, you should wait.
You'll save money, and there's always
a better computer coming around next year.
But that advice only works in technology
if the product cycles are
predictable.
And the Mac has been super unpredictable.
First, Apple took forever to
update anything on any Mac.
Then, it started updating the Macs,
but it wasn't providing
yearly spec-bump updates,
which makes the whole
line feel more consistent.
Then, they started doing that,
but they keep changing the
iteration of the keyboard
with every new release, to try and fix
that reliability problem.
It's infuriating.
(percussive electronic music)
Look,
you know what's going to
happen with the iPhone.
There will be a new one in September.
And that means, don't buy one after,
I don't know, May or so.
But do you know what's gonna
happen next for the Mac?
Probably not.
Maybe they'll fix the keyboard.
Or, maybe Intel will get its act together
and finally deliver a
much better processor.
Or hell, I don't know,
maybe Apple will finally
switch to ARM processors.
The point is, you can't predict,
which makes it harder to decide
what to buy right now,
if you need a computer.
Plus, on top of that, you also
know in the back of your mind
that you could spend $200 more
and get the new MacBook Pro
that got announced next to this thing,
which has a better screen
and a better processor,
and a Touch Bar, and it's
a little bit thicker.
But whatever.
Do you see what's happening here?
Instead of me just saying,
yep, this is the default.
There are a bunch of ifs, and maybes,
and caveats to worry about.
Now, I know that that is
always the way with tech.
But it was never the way
with the classic MacBook Air.
This wasn't just the
default for Mac users.
It was pretty much the default
laptop for almost everybody.
And I don't think that this MacBook Air
has earned that title yet.
It's very good, but it's not the default.
Hey, thank you so much for watching.
We've got full reviews
of both this MacBook Air
and the new MacBook Pro
over at TheVerge.com,
so you should check that out.
Also, Verge Science is doing a video
about the 50th anniversary
of the Apollo mission.
It's great, you should watch that.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
