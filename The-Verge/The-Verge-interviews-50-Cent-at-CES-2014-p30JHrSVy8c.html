Vincent - how's your 2014 going so far
it's going great man as amazing
experience being out here I get a chance
to walk around it's like looking at
tomorrow yeah yeah and you've been at
CES for how many years now three years
three years this year third year or this
is your fourth year it's my fourth but
it's the third year that I've actually
had product out in his doors and okay so
how I'm curious how have things changed
has it gotten bigger yeah well for me is
mines did my space in NCS is growing cuz
it's getting bigger so you're getting
bigger yeah either that or they just
made the area smaller do you do a lot of
people do you spend a lot of time in the
booth I do it well inside my actual but
when I come in I do interviews so I mean
if the last three years I pretty much
saw everybody I had to see before I left
was a lot of press and publicity before
I left yeah and I was curious when you
come to CES do you just kind of do press
or do you also do like deal making and
meeting distributors yeah that's well
that's a part of it they're calling me
in and out of those meetings okay
in the beginning I do it initially just
to help people understand it I'm
actually the owner at a company and not
just the face of it what an endorsement
yeah right and that's hard because a lot
of celebrities are walking around CES
some of them fly in and fly out
immediately and so you're actually one
of the few who sticks around this is the
difference when you invested and you
have ownership versus you actually uh if
you got a license are you getting paid
royalties based on product connected to
your like this right so you help
guarantee 45 minutes come in sign
autographs run out
so what made you want to actually make
your own headphones as opposed to just
put your face on somebody else's
headphones like when you first launched
you did a partnership with sleek audio
in 2011 and then that deal what happened
it was my first attempt at creating SMS
you know and it didn't work out because
the actual the staffing it was involved
in it like people make the mistake that
they think they're not careful when you
have a really high profile and you get
involved with people who are
knowledgeable in the tech area but not
the business portion of it because
that's what actually happened it started
to expand the staff and stuff like that
without sales expanding right so you
felt like and then later I acquired
corner audio to create SMS audio it's
already a functional company and
profitable so the staff had already
gelled together and it was the right
team executed so here at CES where
gadgets get very high-end and you kind
of have headphones made for this head my
headphones me for that I'm wondering as
a musician what do you think is the
perfect set of headphones what are the
qualities you look for well I mean it
depends on what I'm doing to be honest
cuz because those two different
functionalities is the only way that
they're actually different there's some
headsets that exactly the same size and
the book is just not the same quality
what everything else that's been put
into it because I focused on durability
look I broke so many of them in the past
really yeah I could be pretty stuff
no just in the bag and running around
and shuffle you look an airport the
plane may move with the Edison and it
done and cuz I focused on durability we
created like a polyurethane with a nylon
texture inside it that makes it a lot
harder to break then I see other SS and
it's got a 40-millimeter drive and I
mean the sports edition of street buy 50
has waterproofing you know a lot of
people don't realize why the why the
actual gadgets are breaking even when
your phone goes out of whack and touch
burns because of moisture all the time
well you don't have to worry about that
in Las Vegas
let's try so I was wondering if I could
ask you about some of the stuff at CES
this year I know you've been really busy
and you haven't seen all of it but there
are a couple trends that have come out
of the show I wonder if you think
they're gonna stick around and whether
you would invest so the first one is
self-driving cars have you seen out a or
BMW self-driving car yeah I think it
could be cool I think it may cut those
driving companies out I got a drive on
myself out of it eventually when you
could just tell the car or would it go
yeah you would go for that you don't
feel like you would miss driving yeah
I'll let the car drive me I would what
would you do all the car was driving all
kind of things it would allow you the
ability to do things that you couldn't
do in the past right all right I would
actually have to change what that
wouldn't happen
the law would never be a law the
detection or the other habits that our
gadgets are giving us you know what
wouldn't actually be an issue anymore
right like texting while you're driving
you're looking at your phone
okay so thumbs up for self-driving cars
well what about curved televisions have
you seen like the Samsung yeah TV it's
gonna take a while before it I'm into
that not into it
well like last year a lot of stuff is 3d
and I wasn't into that right I didn't
write they were nowhere but but I just
really got on I liked them getting
thinner because now it feels like you're
hanging a painting instead of the
television yeah and with the car totally
I just have to have a specific space did
it correct Mac that it works right okay
and then it felt like the perfect place
to put it cuz yeah all the walls are
flat for the flat screen yeah okay
and the last thing I'm wondering about
is e cigarettes you see you seen those
are electric cigarettes yeah I guess
it'll help that helps someone break the
habit if they still used to if they have
something to do that with yeah without
nicotine in it you know that would
probably be the most helpful gadget you
know would you ever use one yourself a
an e-cigarette well I don't actually
smoke so I would be using it for no
reason
well the e cig companies want you to
start even a few alright even if you
don't do it so cool so cool it's a great
it doesn't have yeah now that won't
happen okay what about a cigar no no
okay
alright well there you have 50 Cent's
reviews of the technology trends of CES
2014
what would you go would you go to a
smoking lounge to smoke a cigar vaping I
mean like a regular one they're like
vapor e cig lounges there's wouldn't
Soho assuming all people yeah it's
really cool it's a how do you think New
York you should check it out where do
you get back I'm gonna check it I see
there's a lot of things I missed for a
second the minecrafting like I didn't
know what was going on with that look
like didn't finish making it I did yeah
play minecraft no I just really got put
onto it okay are you gonna start playing
I'm check it out I've never played it
but a lot of people in the birds are
very into it yeah
cool so I wonder if I could ask you
about social media cuz there's a story
about you a couple days ago where you
put on Instagram some photos of some
cute photos of your baby son and then
you took them down
I wonder of what you think of Instagram
and social media does it tempt people to
share too much well I think technology
is gonna take away privacy completely
really yeah like your Google glass is
the guy that just wants a photo for
social networking uh-huh takes a picture
you are to your right as it does the
glasses to take the picture like that
does yeah then you have no idea no but
you see you later
yeah later so it's like it'll be
everything will be out and when I did
it's important to try and stay as close
to you know as many people as possible I
went far as your fan base is concerned
that um that you I used my social
networking to entertain them mm-hmm it's
not like me showing you what I had to
eat right and because people use it
completely differently they show you
their lifestyle
right you know like if you look at my
zoom my my Instagram I may even look
like it's a fake one because it's things
that I put up not things photos of me I
see so you share jokes right do nice
stuff but I'm sure there are lots of
people who care what you're eating
cuz they're 50 cent yeah but I mean
that's a lot of stuff is boring I get I
think if that guy I won't really care
like if you're comfortable so many other
things for us to talk about then what
you a flushed it
mm-hmm you know like when's the last
time is your friend had a conversation
with you're gonna say hey how you doing
so what did you have for lunch today
right
not I can't remember yeah but now I'm
curious what did you have for lunch
today I didn't have much no why not I
skipped this so there would be no
photograph there's a plain spot and well
you should eat lunch after this well
thank you so much for coming thanks for
having this is 50 cent live on the bird</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
