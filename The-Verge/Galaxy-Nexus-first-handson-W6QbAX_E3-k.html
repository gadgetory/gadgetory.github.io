hearing a Hong Kong so you can look at a
Galaxy Nexus S this is the first ice
cream sandwich device that's made by
samsung it's a pretty clean phone it has
a teardrop shape starting with very thin
to the bottom coming out to a bumpin
starting over top clinical bump it
bottomed reminds you of the galaxy s2
has relatively similar dimensions but
the screen is a 4.6 5-inch screen 1280
by 720 resolution really high res screen
there's pretty decent viewing angles
cipriana lat as well so you parameter
there you go and we just have a quick
look around here we need to set it up to
help mr. Peeples the people application
actually they don't have an address book
for contacts anymore here's the app
drawer and your widgets all the widgets
are resizable inscrutable I mean the
clock isn't going to resize a little bit
things like your bookmarks which is
right here control the moon is very much
like honeycomb in that respect so just
trying to go funny there's a calendar
it's practically a long press to
relocate it then you have these bounding
boxes you can just resize and white so
so we'll just take a quick look around
advice as well there's a front-facing
camera up here at the top we've been
told it does facial recognition to
unlock the phone it's not going to do it
now but it's there is available if these
cover on the side there's a samsung
trademark not trademark with a whole
mark he have a dub connector and it's
free and a half millimeter headphone
jack and yeah I'd say to put about my
face before microphone I believe it's a
five megapixel camera on the back LED
flash yeah when I can show real quick
the camera can you pull it up and shoot
a quick shutter
they're turning the lights off on this
year it's just who to give us some
atmosphere this yeah all right so here
we go romantic it's using flash right
now but it is very quick just a camping
just very quickly let's try and take
photos so not all of them are you focus
because it's taken so quickly but it is
a very quick camera so anyway um last
thing let's show that the app launcher
and how you can swipe out the program's
oh yeah these are the most recent apps
right here and this is a scrollable list
think only have three ABS openers what
let's open up the browser of love all
right recent apps it's Curtis list and
you can dismiss apps by swiping off to
the right it was actually turn them off
that's what Google Earth sodus it
doesn't turn the apps off but it does
remove them from this list so it
essentially turns it into your app
launcher or your multitasking overview
with your most recent applications so
that's most recent apps home button and
back button these are software keys
they're not capacitive keys they
basically integrated into display itself
so here we go that's a first quick look
as the Samsung builds Galaxy Nexus
running ice cream sandwich I will be
back with more soon yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
