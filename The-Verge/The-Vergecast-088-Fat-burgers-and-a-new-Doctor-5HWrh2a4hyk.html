week of August 5th 2013 I know I'm Josh
Topolsky but I'm UI fatale yeah I'm
leaving and joining us all the way from
beautiful downtown Chicago Illinois
Chris Diggler Chris pleasure to be here
that's how you do it I just want
everyone to know that my headset like
josh is screaming into the area of
design thank you I got like a double
Superman curly hair twice as super does
all right I don't have this The Verge
cats of the week of August 5th 2013 5
and and obviously you've tuned in yeah
or you're watching a replay of this and
that's great
oh we got some breaking news here
breaking news CBS Greg sand of all talks
with Time Warner have gone badly off
course CBS says can I see that headline
again at CBS s talks with Time Warner
Cable have gone badly off course you're
never watching see it's great well I'll
be honest with you I was just saying
this before we went on I I did not
notice CBS was missing from my I mean
you wouldn't notice it to look at under
the dome on CBS yeah I was like I was
like my TV programming seems better now
yeah and then no under the dome is on is
on CBS and and you but you can watch a
free if you're an Amazon Prime customer
they have all the episodes they have a
deal with prime both Animas disease
right but that's not they're not
blocking and on on Time Warner Kurt how
could they block blocking it on their
website if you go to CBS no no this is
like an Amazon Prime like you go to
Amazon knows what they can do man if
they're able to block it here's an
extreme on a separate service I don't
I don't know if you guys didn't know CBS
and Time Warner Cable are in a fight
over fees right there's the time to
renegotiate let's get let's be clear
that's what's happening and CBS has said
as a negotiation tactic they've pulled
their content from Time Warner Cable so
you can't watch yeah CBS our show they
pull their content from Time Warner
they've pulled their content from Time
Warner and then who's doing the block
and they've they've pulled their they've
pulled so if you have a Time Warner
Cable connection yes and you go to
cbs.com to watch a show the time where
I've you basically yeah you get a garish
message yeah that's like sorry loser
yeah there's your call Time Warner Cable
and complain yeah there so yeah it's
insane actually so here's what I want to
know by the way so you you you have paid
you can get Time Warner Internet yes
with no Time Warner Cable right so just
let us think about this for a moment
that means CBS is just wanting Lee just
blocking this blocking people for no
reason but also it's insane plus net
neutrality well it's like a reverse and
net neutrality because it's that
neutrality because they shouldn't be
able to they can limit what they show to
like in general but if it's open to the
person next to me if the person next to
me is on is on is on what's another FiOS
or whatever why would they be have
access to something on the internet I
don't it's the internet it's not a
television channel
well it's backwards it's like net
neutrality laws are designed to prevent
the people who own the pipes from doing
any blocking right because the idea is
that if you're on the internet you want
everybody to have everything sure so the
government has been like the incentive
is there you'll share CBS is a CBS is
evil yeah that's true
I mean I would say I mean there's lots
of things you can't get on the internet
because you have any connection right
like yeah like ESPN is a great great
example like ESPN has streaming deals
with like a handful of providers and not
a handful of owners I wouldn't know
about that Netflix super HD is only on
like a handful of providers and they
call and say call your provider it's all
super HD it's 1080p at a higher bitrate
how would you know if you can get it
just like the Apple TV that says super 8
I gave them
and I can't get in on time what can you
get in time the last generation I know
there's all kinds of stuff but like
actually two out grades it before it
actually blocking CBS comm for free
over-the-air television yeah because
it's it's stupid I think we can agree
that this whole situation seems
meaningless in the grand scheme of
things
oh it's too evil companies yeah it's
like it's like oh I can't get my CBS
programming I mean right piracy of CBS
shows up spiked which is holy I will say
I will say uh I love that I love pirate
I think that's great you know if you're
Time Warner customer and you can't get
it you should just pirating under the
dome you should probably reevaluate
you're like well you should also just
get Amazon Prime subscription for
several reasons but mostly you see watch
out to the dub but uh but I hope damn I
was I just gonna say it was very
important it was about CBS it was about
Time Warner Oh the thing I did notice is
that my Showtime Showtime is this yes
owned entity and so that's all gone it's
just a block of things that say TWC data
not available
yeah and that's great so I'm sure the
people who are making Dexter are really
psyched they're like cool where it's our
final season and the people who watch us
are on the coasts where they have time
warner and now nobody can watch us so
thanks for nothing well I mean the
question is like is CBS so irrelevant
that people won't care like do you know
you don't seem to care I care about
Showtime or yes ultra relevant I think
CBS regularly wins I mean we're not
normal people I think that if you listen
I think if you look at Nielsen CBS
regularly wins important time slots
during the week yes no what are you
talking about they're like 18 of the top
20 shows our CBS shows right CBS is the
heart the heartbeat of America that's
the soup no Chevrolet is the RB of
America chevrolet used to be the
heartbeat of America CBS now it's to CBS
CBS hacked its pacemaker and exploded it
and now CBS is the heartbeat of America
last Moonves personally packed it and
exploded it anyhow I mean yeah let's is
by the way is super crazy he's like he's
like a Lex Luthor style TV executive
yeah a bit like keep in mind like he's a
he's leading all this in Greg is
actually writing keep putting this thing
together I'll have it soon but uh it's
like les Moonves is doing all this a
Time Warner Cable he was the one who was
like leading the charge I'm like ebooks
pricing yeah with this other area going
after going after area going like hopper
going after dish like yeah screwed up
seeing it like just like alright see
that stuff right yeah he's a good guy I
like him I mean I definitely my life I'm
truly glad I do not work for him at any
moment I have to say there's a there's a
great part of the message that shows on
Time Warner customers TVs when they tune
to CBS it says something like don't
attempt to switch to another provider
because sometimes this happens to you
might don't go outside you could get hit
by working AMC we're in a fight forever
yeah you know what I'm so sick of these
stupid TV people content is your I'm
done I'm selling my TV content is the
problem if there was no content we
wouldn't get into these bands got too
much content
look man Netflix is the future you to
YouTube you can get anywhere YouTube and
you pirate everything and put it on
YouTube that's the way to make money
that's right that's how a national day
of pirating and put it on YouTube yes
what Jeff Bezos BeeZee behind the PC so
sorry I want to extend an offer to last
Moonves if he'd like to join us on the
verge caster in any capacity for an
interview about his his evilness
yeah the stage is set the door is open
we welcome you and would love to talk to
you about your various nefarious goings
goings on go on ongoing yeah
dealings okay uh sorry Bezos yeah bought
the Washington Post Jeff Bezos bought
the Washington Post for some insane
reason for 250 million yeah for those
that's a quarter billion yes which in
cat quarter billion sounds more
impressive in cash in Kashi and any
actually like the the Friday fall are
proceeding as he took out he cashed in
185 million dollars worth of Amazon
stock yeah which is like his in his
ownership 0.5% yeah or something I know
it's a tiny amount like what are the
logistics of that did he walk into like
his local chase or whatever stack with
the stack of Amazon stock yeah you walk
in your local branch out in the trade
yeah oh god that'd be amazing if use D
trade believe in what's wrong with the
baby
you tricky we're not to eat ray guns are
there oh there's the time I trade
there's a ton of on cyber trade a cyber
trade is definitely I would use it don't
go to cyber trade that Chinese babes
Ameritrade right Ameritrade a TD
Ameritrade yeah but that's like a real
Bank well you can go to branches of that
you can't go to an in trade that's true
there's an e trade branch in downtown
Chicago Wells Fargo that's what yes
it's at the no wonder you won't leave
that bear City go to the east great
advice oh you know what there is I just
saw there's a physical StubHub yeah go
stop cuts across the stream yeah
that's where you pick up your tickets
that's right yeah why did you basis
buying the post so first off major huge
masses are not Amazon not Amazon Jeff
Bezos purse man bought a massive
historically significant yeah currently
failing media empire The Washington Post
newspaper interestingly not the
Washington Post the company not watching
us competition was explained late and
Kaplan burners let's not the building
the paper I don't think the word you're
looking for is failing necessarily it's
unprofitable but I mean they were
largely responsible for was a man and
the man's job was to walk forward in a
straight line and they were just like
walking in a circle spitting the Creta
is it now my drugs failing it's actually
more like let's say
that you were a man with a family yeah
and you had to support your family by
working in a job and each year you made
less at your job than the year before
your family could eat less and buy fewer
clothes and live in it they had to live
in a smaller place yeah is that person
succeeding Neela and I just talked about
this I will only accept analogy as
involving ex-girlfriends so it's really
hard for me to like I don't understand
what that means
so Bezos so so Laura and I were talking
about this and she had a theory which I
now have agree with and I think this is
the the moat people are like why why
would Jeff Bezos want what's he gonna do
with it is he gonna turn it into it you
know he's he's just gonna clean out the
ability to turn episode fulfillment
center my favorite theory was he's going
to use all the Washington Post
distribution trucks to deliver groceries
from Amistad to me an amazing ideas I
don't think he does he owned those
trucks I think that's a different know
the post so so her by the way can you
imagine like very loud can we turn the
lights can anyone make Josh stop
screaming directly dad stop screaming I
can tell you when you talk my eyes are
vibrate I can tell you one thing my
ability to stop screaming doesn't he's
got it yes can you just imagine any
moment in your life like Jeff Bezos like
woke up yesterday and like realize that
he now owns a gigantic can you imagine
wakes up he's wearing silk pajamas yeah
he bounds out of bed yeah and he starts
doing like a it's like a musical and
he's doing a song about how he you know
I bought the post yeah the song is
called and then someone's like and by
the way you own a fleet of trucks they
lead it is dirty during his his song and
dance routine you know he's brush to see
the I bought the post or whatever but
someone leans in and like they're like
mr. Bezos a paper mr. Bezos and like
don't forget you own the trucks I'd like
to see that I did you see that but I
just
Morris theory yeah which I agree with is
is look basis is a rich super rich super
powerful
yeah there's 1% of his net worth tight
he's a Titan
of Industry yeah he's respected he's
feared he's loved he's hated he does
look like a supervillain but what
doesn't he have he doesn't have a piece
of the real East Coast old money
Empire right stuff right this is what
rich people used to buy when rich people
were really like rich people not these
not these fake become billionaires when
they were real rich people when they
were like the Rockefellers and the
Carnegie's they were buying stuff like
newspapers like hey I'm gonna control
the press right that's what he's doing
he's like I'm gonna get a newspaper
because I want to be like a hearse so
it's super funny is that he in his like
personal life and professional life
super cagey with the press like has been
giving the same quotes about Amazon for
like 15 years yeah I think I think that
the key here is he's never really found
he's never really people that he felt
truly comfortable with so he bought one
who could interview him exclusively what
was really weird huh sorry I'm gonna let
you go but what was really weird if you
guys saw they did the post ran a story
about he had a huge story on themselves
which is odd but it was like Washington
Post sold like front-page logic rush
Washington Post sold like what's
happening but but but they did an
interview and it was like a reporter
from the post interviewing John Graham
the owner now former owner of the post
about selling the post on the Washington
Post website yeah like in the washington
post offices it's just really really odd
right guys it's most meta thing that's
ever is really better no I think the
real litmus test over the next you know
told 18 months is gonna be to see how
many senior leaders of the post leave
because that's going to let us kind of
know just how much Eaton tends to
control what this what this his line is
basically like there are obviously be
changes because we ought to make it
better we have to expect but I'm leaving
like he's basically leaving it alone
he's his line is I have a day job I feel
like we hear this all the time they're
like I'm gonna leave it alone
I guess maybe he'll leave it alone like
like Google left Motorola that was a
great segue that line about
we need to experiment we need to invent
or something so he obviously has some
plans or intends to make plans for the
paper how directly involved he is we
want you to post singles you can you can
buy on a newsstand one article I mean
that's a sort of so that's a software it
lean on me it would have made sense for
like Amazon to buy it like it's more
like it's not like Jeff does it's like
Jeff like he doesn't have pull at Amazon
well that's just when I get it I get why
am it like if he owns Amazon like Amazon
has to like stay its course to its
mission not be distracted whatever
who's alert is that is that your phone
that's 500 people think you could
doesn't have a mute switch I don't got a
lot of phones right now oh that's the
one no I think that was another if your
iPhone is on the beat yeah if you kept
pulling phones out by the way I you're
over it I need some trouble shoes my one
I can't travel shoe to the right now
what's the problem it won't do a pup
dates after the 4-3 update
what do you mean like it's all its
erroring out when it tries to like auto
update and a half in the background what
are the what is the error is it packet
it is serious bar thing does it say does
it say file package not valid no it's
something I connecting the server and
there's like it's a good F 43 I don't
know what it I have no idea I've never
seen I googled it and like I found I
didn't have a map update errors I what
do some like deep like droid like I was
like definitely worried that they were
stealing my identity like when you get
like deep in my cyber droid hacks comm
with two exes instead of a CK oh yeah
when you're when you get involved in
like Android anything it's remotely out
of the realm of like you just have a
regular you're on Google Play account
user and that if you get into the realm
of look how do I want to do some a key
thing the rabbit hole don't you do not
go down that route I've lost countless
hours days even but if you run cyber
droid hacks I just think you're doing a
great RIA the two x's we should buy that
right now trade hacks with two axes dot
or dot are we done are we done talking
about Amazon I'd know so well I mean are
we it's up to you guys I mean I just
think
like I think you're right I think he's a
rich guy I think he won yeah that's cool
look if you were SuperDuper rich and you
could have anything you want he loved
the media because like the thing is he
clearly lo he loves he loves me yeah
yeah we know he loves media exists to
distribute information oh that's what
I'm saying but but I guess does he own a
sports team no no he's an intellectual
yeah he but instead of a this is his
sports do you read his profile werevery
he makes every executive he starts every
executive meeting by making everybody
write a six page memo and then all the
executives sit down and quietly read all
the memos before they begin to come up
with more weird stuff no you're like you
do not yeah did you hate everybody
compose your haiku we're not starting
anything else you got your haiku yeah
about your particular task
yeah and then we evaluate each other's
haikus I'm going to do this you're
already known as the verges eccentric
leader so I don't think yeah I think
that what everybody in my Google account
whoa yeah I understand I don't want to
reset though you're talking to these
people in the end nobody knows who
you're talking to everybody I know the
answer is I sure you said Oh what my
eccentricities are I think I'm a normal
guy I mean you've been checking your
hair on camera for five years well look
at it look at that why don't you check
it check it check it out all right do
you want to talk about Doctor Who I'd
love to talk to new doctor and you are
you are like my age I imagine doctor who
I'd be enraged luckily I don't we have a
lot by the way can we find the Doctor
Who that I look like he's the guy he's
the one with the he's the one from the I
think he's the 8th doctor can you find
the a thing his name was Tom this is
gonna be tweeted at us really fit
quickly where's the doctor that I look
at look like sorry
anyhow there's a new doctor the 13th
doctor right 13th he is an old white
British actor he's a middle-aged white
British man and I'm sure to England I'm
sure he's a very sure he's great
I'd no doubt I just I just don't care I
guess like I would have been more
interesting no it's apparently why can't
the doctor be Ross has just walked in
he's all fired
the jogger me
why can't a doctor be a woman somebody
who's not a white guy I'm throwing it
out there both both of those things
Indian doctor every cool just but now
there's already a lawyer lawyer former
lawyer now journalists look why can't
there you that's what my dad looks like
exactly I'm not even remotely kid it and
I think you'll find you put a beard on

a scarf a scarf yeah you do scarf scarf
they're only there only two things just
put a photo shop a beard on him already
what are you waiting for
someone in that control room by the way
I'm sorry to the viewers and listeners
of The Verge cast you didn't pay for
this luckily because if you had you feel
you'd been ripped off yeah someone in
that control room is waiting there hand
hovering on a Photoshop toolbar
well they're virtual hands the one
that's Billy
Peter Capaldi Peter Capaldi is that
right the inimitable powerful white
Peter Capaldi but for the viewers I'm
not I would have been drove up a dropped
car that he drifted TARDIS Drift Doctor
Who TARDIS drift I would watch that also
by the way by the way horn on listen
whoever is watching right now
Challenge is there Doctor Who TARDIS
trip you know what to do if I don't see
it by the end of this verge cast you're
dead to me
go where you can say Chris look there
are only two roles that I've ever wanted
Denzel Washington for one is master
chief the other is doctor who's been
told the Master Chief isn't he
he wouldn't been if they had made the
movie like eight years ago when they
said they were going to you Denzel they
have failed to make that movie they
really have
maybe it's because who cares about Halo
I mean the general public they made the
movie that was like not cool people of
course like Microsoft beloved beloved
franchise yeah cameo games killing stuff
yeah the game but shoot people who shoot
really well alright I love halo don't
kill me
go on god this i'm slap-happy I don't
know what's been going about your fun oh
you want tape of the Moto X yeah moto X
by Motorola I love this phone I've
decided I really like it yeah
Pierce said he was gonna buy one it's
not the highest end phone in the world
and but it's great and it has a bunch of
really nice and the more I the more I've
used it the more I'm like I'm ordering
one of these as soon as I can do a
custom look and I have to say like III
haven't asked for the stock and and I'm
just kind of like you know what I enjoy
using this phone more we are live this
has more of the conveniences that I need
in the phone in a post spec world in the
Moto X I mean the iPhone is evidence
it's crazy where this phone here's my
one the X is the same size screen and
just feels incredible way smaller it's
like ridiculous and I have to say
holding it using it is way way easier
there's a good thing though the screen
stole the screen is not good I mean like
if you're on like a really heavy like
black with white text you definitely see
that kind of tearing right that that you
see on an AMOLED screen but that for me
is so few and far between and I see it
and I'm not using my phone way around to
when it's when I'm not using my phone to
read black text and white I'm not using
my phone to do a lot of like heavy
reading I'm using my phone to do
flipping through feeds like looking at
the front page emails yeah some IRC
stuff or anything I'm just
constantly reading no no I'm not reading
like books on it and the advantages
outweigh the disadvantages a lot of
people do I see people on the train all
the time they're like this and I'm like
really it's a three now you've talked
about the battery life on this phone
it's great it actually seems better even
the last couple of days yesterday I went
home or two days ago and I had 40%
battery life left which is highly
unusual I cannot wait to use the Moto
maker tool yeah David got to play with
this is the event I have not used it yet
I'm so excited to moto make look look
you don't understand I've been like
every time I get a phone that I'm asking
for this for you yeah yes I have I
actually do you remember me talking
about this like years ago on the end
gadget cabinet you here's what I don't
like about my to make and this is like
the next generation of this go ahead
it's awesome cuz there's so many it's
like IKEA you need gonna work here and
they have like 50 this is like a Kia
it's well you can definitely motor make
a Kia sure no you go to Ikea and like
there's they have 50 of everything and
every color and then it's like ah this
is awesome and you buy one and you come
home like oh I just have this one it's
not nearly as cool as it was but it's
completely different from everybody
else's collect them all that's right you
don't want to like the next generation
of this is to be able to motor make like
50 cases I wants a snap stuff off your
phone people put a case on there done
set it and forget it
just like that like the whole if the
whole hook of this phone is like being
able to like customize it the fact no I
think it's like this it's it's like a
nice piece of jewelry or a watch that
you love yeah it's that you buy look
there's a thousand different watches
okay they're all really unique I mean
each watch mean you're wearing a watch
I'm wearing a watch you have a watch and
they're all completely crazy and
different thousand yours is blue you've
got this black really streamlined thing
- my grandfather's watch with a new
strap like they're very distinct we've
picked these things out we said this
matches Who I am in my style and we put
them on and by the way kind of
incredibly down the line here you're
wearing like a black jacket you've got
your black watcher you're wearing this
like kind of like plaid blue shirt with
your blue watch and I forgot like a red
shirt on and like this red banner and I
think they're really appropriate that's
what this is this is like this is you
know more for you than everybody else's
phone right but think about I mean it's
very kgs for that you had where you
an incredible rampage of I'm still
waiting for several backs still waiting
for several backs for my but like if it
is if I wear a different watch my we're
different clothes like I feel like being
able to change some alimentation yeah
like if you bother I think of its that
one yeah like you should be able to pop
it off yeah I think if it's that
important you if you really need to
fashion it up that often you could buy
some keys just thinking about remember
old Nokia candy bar but nobody really
wants a whole defense press on you know
they were Express on and then you can
but that will fail your whole thing no
those were hugely popular so usually
popular but you don't they have entire
like like middle middle Western malls
middle Western why do we keep saying
it's Midwestern I have this problem
where I talk like him in the 20s
I don't where's that Photoshop by the
Western malls you know low-end drug
dealers piercing pagoda yeah like weird
Cornelius proposed 79 had the the
replaceable backs where when you put on
a back it would automatically match the
color scheme of the UI yeah to the back
that you put on all I'm saying is the
Nokia phone I had I could walk into my
do automatic and get any number of like
Dragon Tattoo backs for it yeah like
crazy like what for what my old Nokia
can you you found the one cool thing
about this phone then one of the coolest
things about it sorry
and somehow I've managed to nitpick it
look Apple's gonna release six different
colored iPhones is that which is which
is preferable one you can totally
customize or one you could add it's the
same problem it's like the apples ads
are awesome cuz all the colors are in
them so you need to be super duper rich
is what you're saying cotton buy a bunch
of different phones one for every day of
the week movie you think about it the
same way you think of a car where you
you pick the options you want in the car
but the difference is that you own the
car for a long time you're only gonna
own this phone for what year maybe
that's true exactly sure yeah you'll
trade it in in the year you get a new
funky design I just want a new phone
every day that's all I'm saying well
that's true you work at a place where a
new phone every day is almost not usable
I bought this I bought this phone I've
been I'm being told and telling you I'm
being told that the photo shop
be told the Photoshop is on my phone you
get that let me describe to you that I'm
seeing Josh de pulsky they're seeing it
there see yeah you're not seeing it I
mean is this seriously just with a beard
and glasses cuz it does look like me
he's a little bit bigger than mine which
is hard hard to believe the mouth is
wrong and the mouth well look if I do
that but if I do that with my mouth look
it's really back to the main terrifying
Wow I'm really sorry for the audio
listener this is really a video chance I
will say that one - Beyonce remember
when I was in doctor here a little bit
sexual member when I was the a fourth
doctor so it's here what's your bottom
line on the on the bottom line my and
you love this thing
what oh this thing is great hold on let
me see if it which Dan did it great I
think a picture you guys that's how fast
it took to open the phone and take a
picture and that's okay picture it's the
worst
and now here's the worst I can just do
that yeah yeah I have used this what
this is way faster than your iPhone it
doesn't work the first time so you
sitting there going on I'm already
instagramming a photo of you guys on a
second let me put a filter on it cool
I'm picking a filter now our god I like
this one I wonder how much quite a bit
would be my guess anyway look I'm fine
myself pleasantly surprised oh wait hold
on are you are you from Locke from Locke
okay so alright uh his mic is not
working you pull it out oh yeah you did
pulled out yep oh boy
what is this that's just my face on his
hair that's not that's not
that's not the right way to do this
still that hair looks pretty good yeah
my back it's a bun in the forum we're
good we okay hold on wait so sue me
you're unlocked I'm not you're locked
okay here we go so somebody we hold on
that we have to be get how we get in
start us how you get no no we can't I
can't I'm looking at you Oh Chris you
count us off if somebody should say hey
look at that amazing what blank and then
we're gonna go that'll be our cue okay
oh no you're already pointed at it wait
wait my lock picture snap run okay ready
okay that camera done really yeah Wow
you you had to see you have it go like
that well but what's weird is what's
weird is I mean I didn't focus or expose
like I just like do you didn't take the
picture I took the picture just not like
a let's see your picture it's a crap
picture I mean I took it as fast my
picture is pretty good yeah but you took
twice as long twice as long I don't know
about that oh wow this is embarrassing
this is embarrassing week we could get
this why was look at this look at the
detail the detail that's terrible it
kind of looks like he's in a midst
pretty good picture I mean it was
exposed to the lights love how small
bezel is on that phone it's really
impressive anything that's that's a
trick they learned with the razor I
don't know all I'm saying is it's faster
to take a picture with this then with
though I deal with any of them with the
one or the other has the swipe too but
then you just do it but give it that you
know it's but no but but but jelly bean
has a swipe over to the camera as well
it's not a swipe over it's you just
swipe up on the lockscreen that's what
their thing is it swipe over no I'm
saying like look it's a different way
explain look it's that which is faster
than going like this you know it
actually isn't though from lock it's not
anyway this is we're back to this also
also you know you know what else you
know what else it does is is it does it
from anywhere else in the phone so if
you're in an app oh yeah I'm always like
got a waggle to a camera camera angle
got a waggle to a camera
the Moto X got a waggle to a camera
feature of that of that phone though
I'll kid outside is the the pulsing
notification which is something that you
can do with AMOLED and out with LCD I so
I hated that is I thought I would hate I
thought I would hate that on what
there's a new app so Dan c4a wrote a
piece today those two features that the
can wag I'll just go with a camera and
the active notifications are now out
like in the pet store but not as moto
they're not moto but you're not gonna
get the battery the same battery profile
no of course
because yeah I'm sure look I'm look the
point is doesn't matter at the end of it
you love the phone no I think it's a
good phone I'm surprised how much I like
it and I find myself increasingly liking
as I've used it and here's the deal
we've gotten to a point here's the point
we've gotten to like I don't bet I don't
care about benchmarks that's the number
one just for me so you understand like
when I think about phones now I've spent
a long enough time thinking about and
worrying about in reviewing phones that
I can tell you that benchmarks aren't
really my big question my question is
how does the phone act and perform
day-to-day and the galaxy s4 on the one
stock and the other non stock versions
are excellent phones yeah this phone is
an excellent phone for several reasons
some of them are different than that why
they say this and I caution but also the
iPhone is an excellent phone if you if
you're in are you in a particular guy
had been hoodwinked by Motorola phones
well that's my fear I will say this my
dear thanks remember that I always start
with them with the Motorola phone I'm
like this is great razor mat and then
like I'm on two months later or
something it's like wait a second this
phone it sucks yeah but that maybe is my
is my well this is a Google that might
be the cross that I have to bear this is
not really a Google phone but what I
will say is it's essentially stock the
things they've added are so minor and
also just so good that it's it's it's
browsing to say we kind of plateaued its
prospectus specs are not the main core
specs are dead
specs aren't dead but they're just not
it's like you've reached a certain point
where the operating systems have
plateaued in a way and and it's just
like we're not doing some out there
crazy processing it's like can it play a
game ok that's your most processor
intensive thing you're gonna do on the
phone
can it load a webpage but uh but then
the other thing is that I just think
with software I mean in particular now
that this is a natural stock device
basically a stock it's not stock like
it's gonna get the same updates that a
nexus gets but it's a essentially stock
operating system they have not altered
anything there is no skinning from
Motorola they didn't swap icons they
didn't do any of the stuff that they've
done on their other phones and it's you
would imagine that that means that it's
a much less difficult process for them
to get a new operating system ready and
approved right for a carrier which will
take some of the guesswork out of one
has for three and that phone doesn't
it's crazy to me the Google Play one and
did yours get updated
you got it fitted yeah which is like
grass it's a big win yes for it's not
gotten it yet at least mine how's it
interesting if you're out there and you
there was definite late everybody else
got a form yeah well they roll it out we
got one more phone this is about what we
do we do then we're nothing about the g2
g2 I just want to say one thing can we
pull up the video eighty event was crazy
in a different way the g2 LG how did you
came out the GT this week which is great
good for LG you found enormous screen I
like to think of it as their affair
galaxy and our galaxy s4 uh terrible
software design and they they're
literally they headline the press
release by saying we put all the buttons
on the back of the phone which is cool
like that looks it there's something
about that that seems interesting but
like this is your point like we're so
beyond like Ross specs which is what LG
would traditionally say yeah but they're
like we put the buttons on them that's
why that's why that's why Samsung is
like you know the thing where it follows
your eyes and the yeah oh and LG has all
this is like easy weird they've got this
weird multitasking you're seeing right
now if you're watching the video they've
got like you can pick you can answer my
phone should I picking it up which is so
stupid this is exactly and this is where
and this is where these companies that
don't you software really show their
true colors yeah this is so awful what
they're showing but you know this is
some of the worst software I mean it is
so I'm sorry I LG like this is so awful
I was rich one understand Chris tweeted
during the event likewise by this video
yeah it's like it's time for an
intervention like you know we love you
very much very much this is my kid might
one of my main
complaints about the skew the people who
are skinning it's like you think you
know software better than Google but you
don't yeah at all you're not even in the
vicinity
you look like 40 off like 14 guys
working on this in some corner office
they're like it's a back it's LG they're
huge company looks like the work of a
but that is crazy like what is that a
three-finger swing that'll be fun when
you have up when you have a app that has
panels yeah and you got panels open
three finger swipe
oh sure of course it is because you you
want it to be doing that on here that's
three fingers wide Benny cries I mean it
the phone looks crazy like in my apps
here I just don't understand no this is
feature this is feature creep yeah this
is this is vista this is the vista of
phones this is the Vista of phone
operating systems I mean just looks the
LG version of Android is Vista it's like
a bunch of ugly crap so here it doesn't
really work that well that is total
bloatware so here's the thing look I
would except for this design LG's
putting IPS displays and iPhones which I
think are better than Samsung's displays
like there's a piece of this it looks
like better designed better screen
inside this that's exactly a Samsung
phone and then the software is so much
worse like I don't understand why
anybody wants this software look the
software is hideous the phone is
anonymous if not completely ugly
the buttons are on the back and the buns
are in the back I give this at a glance
I give it a 1 oh sorry I'm sorry like
look I wanna I want to be supportive but
the look this is like I've talked about
this before but this is like sneakers
yeah this is wearing it we're thinkers
they know where it is sneakers I'm
always ready it's where does sneaker
wear at Foot Locker right now there's a
wall of the ugliest sneakers in the
world because Steiger people were like
how can we differentiate like let's put
a pump in it let's have some weird
plastic thing hey not this time it like
let's make it look like it's from the
Year 4000 in a poorly designed movie
from the 70s you know like it just
sneakers are gross because they ran out
of ways to make sneakers interesting
just a man you pissed off the halo
people and that sneaker heads no sneaker
but there are good-looking sneakers
they're few and far between psyche over
here like super mad no I agree you don't
talk about there are
lot of really really awful looking so
let's put some lights at the bottom your
sneakers well come on now I mean wait at
work I would definitely wear sneakers
with lights entry okay now you can
probably get them I just want you to
know where I am on the door please
please really tragic thing you just want
me to know where you are in the dark wow
it's a simple that's at RIT but anyhow
the really tragic thing to me about this
phone is that you look at you look at
something like the g2 and they're
obviously really brilliant engineers
working visa City they're obviously
really brilliant engineers working on
this device right know the designers I'm
not talking about the UX people what
engineers the people that like the the
you name of the g2 now yes can we get to
presentation you think they're really
brilliant engineers who came up with
these ideas no I'm saying that engineers
aren't coming up with ideas they're
implementing the ideas you say their
implementation is brilliant I'm saying
you're no I am NOT I'm saying that if
they were tasked with doing something
created by a visionary UX person you
could see how they could turn out a
really amazing phone leave me like
they're technically good at their jobs
yes but they're being given bad jobs
exactly I agree with you I mean I assume
that that's true we don't know that
they're actually very good software
maybe really buggy I don't know I
haven't used it I mean here's my here's
my in my mind's eye this is how I think
Samsung and LG work I think that they
say US Cellular needs a crappy mid-range
Android phone by this yeah next week
they put 450 engineers have a huge
amount of it yes later
do I ask for photo come on screen like
Samsung that's bad LG's presentation or
like we picked the perfect screen size
yeah and they helped please be this
graphic we're getting the grandeur that
was amazing they it's we Indy I went
into the yeah here it is okay you ready
like what does this mean the smartphone
group first off
there seems to be information maybe
we're covering it but there's
information that's contained within
those particular dots like they
represent something but we don't know
exactly what that glob like look here's
his line he's like we studied all the
phones people are holding right now if
we pick the perfect size which is like
I'm not sure that like that's what let
me let me figure out what you did you
look at the biggest photo you're looking
you saw the biggest phone and the
smallest if you look at the phablet
group it's like such a wide range of
things well they were worried if you
didn't have a circle you would know with
the dot it's like three times four times
the size of any of those donors and then
slightly after this there's another
slide where they're like and we've
pre-loaded ringtones from the Vienna
Boys Choir yeah and at the end of the
presentation the Vienna Boys Choir
played listen it was just a really like
this boils down to and and I think that
this can be all of the stuff that we
hate in these phones can be boiled they
are can you boil down to this it's bad
if this is bad taste this is what bad
taste looks like yeah this is what bad a
bad decorator does you know like this is
a otherwise normal phone made horrible
because people made bad decisions about
what would be red tasteful on it what
weight and what makes sense you know
and they're also the other the other
thing is that they're being they're
trying to find this thing which is like
they're trying to find FaceTime right
every company wants face him that's why
HTC has boomsound and cover flip or
whatever it's called yeah they all want
their FaceTime they want people to go oh
that's got that boom sound right cover
blast you know like Motorola did the
same thing have notifications but that
is what it does it's like an active
notification and it actually is
tastefully done and it works well I'm
not gay I'm not trying to heap praise on
this but this is one of the few times
I've seen their their driving assist
stuff like it's actually done pretty
elegantly it does something you really
would want yeah and it gets out of your
way
it's surprising because most of these
guys are like just keep keep the make it
really visible keep throwing it on top
of other stuff and and and use cartoon
colors and use cartoon cars but also
just like it's dumb some of it's just
dumb stuff you know yeah like the thing
that follows your eyes it's kind of dumb
yeah if you what's the situation I was
deeply engrossed in a chapter of my book
and then my 10-minute like limit was up
and I had not turned the page right what
is that turn 10 minutes from from
interacting with the screen right well
it's whatever you have your timeout set
to but it would be 10 minutes from
touching the screen again it's whatever
I'm saying that the maximum or whatever
yeah 30 minutes whatever yeah so what is
the book or whatever you're reading
where you're studying intently but not
doing anything on the screen at the
phone like if you're watching like a
long video but they usually turn off
this standby right doing what's
happening and yeah some of LG's branding
is knock-on with the words Oh n
capitalized and answer me with the can I
just there's one more we should start
combining you guys these like mashups go
ahead there's plug-in pop answer B so we
can plug in five plugin pop like it's
like the slides through my deputy remain
it's like what we up Lorraine town
perform there's a yeah we have the
Vienna Boys Choir I'm gonna research
plug in pop guys
it's like the ring toss a ring ring the
ring time that will legitimately make
you go insane yeah by the way plug in
pop with you when you plug in the
headphones it puts the menu it puts
another menu of apps over your listing
apps the but becomes a flaw I don't we
have a video for this it literally shows
you a graphic of a headphone plug going
into the like the phone on the screen so
you know that you've inserted headphones
 Bob the new LG all the time I
think my god dick is this plane but are
they plugged in I don't know I wish
there was a visual indicator so I knew
that the plug
let's plug in paint was inserted
completely into the headphone I mean I
just say David special super sarcastic
at least LG didn't call them L answer an
elbow anyhow well that's good so we need
to do mashups of features yeah like plug
and pop could be what's the razors have
what is the cover
what is the cover thing on the one feed
buzz busby is a website I know that it's
like one feed feed feed yes so what is
it what is weather features on here plug
a pop-up joins app link pop blink on
like me blink blink on I'm sure as a
Samsung no no because I just have an ass
in front of it it's ass blink yeah it
would have to be s blink blink Sam cause
Sam sends me tea service can we talk
about other topics so LG introduced the
g2 it's a big phone and in your choices
sorry oh yeah all right guys we got a
wrap-up
we do well not being like we got to come
to an end I'm one I'm trying to get to
the next top here here's you got a pic
you got a poem so you can pick more Xbox
disaster mmm you can pick Sony topics a
little dry or you can talk about the
fatberg and the fake burger oh let's
ever let's talk about two very
interesting story
laterz they sound related yes they're
not and there one is gross and one is
awesome
yes my opinion okay so on on Monday
morning the is it Monday yeah Monday
morning the in the in London the world's
first ever lab-grown hamburger was
cooked and eaten now this is a hamburger
that is constructed using stem cells
from a cow from Oh from a cow fetus I
believe and they basically like build
five ounce cultured beef burger
constructed from 20,000 protein strands
grown from cows stem-cell protein
strands grown from just to put your head
around this concept this is they they
and they didn't harm the animal they're
yeah this is a this is a pain painless
deathless actual meat hamburger right if
you can understand how it doesn't have
any fat no doesn't mean fat because
we're bad come from right right but okay
and just two more stats cost $325,000 to
make yeah I took a weekend yeah and it
was entirely paid for by Sergey by
Sergey Brin
which is Google which is insane but so
so this is a huge deal this is I mean
the beginning of potentially a huge and
by the way we have something coming next
week that you'll want to something
coming next week that you will want to
see on this and beyond
so get ready cuz something really really
I believe it's next week I could be
wrong to coming up but we have something
coming on this that is going to go way
deeper on this story but but the idea
here is I mean the potential is
incredible if they could get this up to
scale and and it is safe and it tastes
reasonably like a hamburger right
there's quite a bit of flavor said one
of the writers yes one of the there was
actual food critics that tried this the
potential for this is just like
incredible I mean it could solve world
hunger it could eliminate an enormous
amount of greenhouse gas issues and
ecological issues that are caused by
farming and by meat production which is
like one of the most destructive not the
most destructive let's talk about
vegetarians though I mean what does I
would hit this in a second what kind of
dilemma okay there's no dilemma for me I
mean cuz here's the deal no animal was
harmed to make it no animal was killed
to make it
so I have no problem PETA has offered a
1 million dollar Awards the first person
to develop lamp grand chicken I mean
this to me is yeah this to me is the
answer to the veg I mean my vegetarian
complaint is I do not want to be
involved in the death of another
creature
so this harvested stem cells and grow
them well yeah but I mean they're not
killing the animals or harming the
animals as far as I understand I mean if
they were hurt if they were torturing
animals I'd say yeah I'm not interested
in eating it right you know even if like
but the idea but I understand something
I've read on this said that you could
potentially get something like 500,000
cows worth of beef from the stem cells
of a single cow in if this were taken to
its logical conclusion or something in
some insane statistic like that I that
don't quote me on that
mm-hmm but the idea here is incredibly
powerful and also just yeah it's super
sci-fi yeah just sci-fi that's crazy and
like the only thing I can think is you
know it seems too good to be true yeah
if they can actually figure it out let's
say obviously you're not gonna do it for
$300,000 that's like the experimental
that's like the research it cost and all
the stuff you need it's you gotta start
somewhere but if in 10 years you know
this is safe and it tastes like meat and
they can do it at scale that's a
game-changer right that's a world
changer and it's very exciting and also
kind of scary so that's the great
wonderful hopeful story that we started
Monday off with and then on the flip
side and by the way in some way related
well the fat yeah somewhere doesn't it
sure uh in the sewers of London a how
how big was it haha a bus fifteen tons a
15-time I just read the we've never seen
a single congealed lump of lard this big
clogging our sewers bled made an
employee a gigantic ball of fact and
sentence and sanitary napkins yeah but a
15-ton congealed ball of fat and
sanitary products was found under gross
under the under india in the lot in the
london sewer but but Vlad brought up an
important point which is that they don't
specify whether it's a single deck or a
double-decker bus
that's a big difference inside 15 tons
do they do the math find out how much a
double-decker bus right now honey find
out how much a single dagger Bao sways
and then boom fair enough
yeah oh my god this video please don't
please don't
I mean there's so much fat in the sewers
they're not using it to generate
electricity I mean this is amazing
well this is disgusting beyond
description I mean our hero was really
gross
unlike Abunda at one point on Monday I
was like huh that grown beef yeah in fat
fat burger
these are elites there might have been
something else too it's it's it's
sickening and also if you hold I mean
that to me is the because of the future
of the verge no that is the beginning of
a futuristic sci-fi horror film yeah
where the fat burger obviously becomes
sentient no I'm sorry I wrote it a DS
for the post and headline is crazy
a terrifying robot that shows you the
emotions slime mold can express this guy
I don't know what that means
oh god we're showing fat bird come on
this is that's okay guys NSFW take the
kids out of the room here's a British
guy he's like I couldn't believe how
he's the chief flashy Bob here it is the
next Doctor is Chris Paul yeah Doctor
Who number 13 Keith Luscher from South
Wales I don't know if who's from South
Wales I just made that up
but um here they are going after the fat
burger hunting the fan who would go down
if they were like hey listen if I don't
care what job you have in London if they
were like listen we need you to go down
there's a 15-ton blob of fat fat
sanitary napkins and we get it go down
there and clean it out I'd be like I I
quit and I'm gonna tell everybody I can
about this situation so they don't get a
job here it's weirdest how joyful the
British press seems like they're now a
documentary about that bug yeah that's
like the fat bird is is there it's like
after the Royal baby what else you have
to be excited not like we've it's been
like two weeks of nothing now we got a
fat bird the most upsetting thing to me
actually is how quickly the entire
internet congealed on a name a name deal
yes by the way let's be clear nothing
ran into there's no Titanic situation
here some unfortunate flusher yeah chief
flusher
as awful and terrible it's a great title
I always can that be my time chief
flusher chief oh yes
is that it that's a we should I'm gonna
just on it go ahead and by the way I
just want to go ahead and say if you're
gonna I know what you're gonna you're
gonna send me an email and say let
somebody else talk
who people are gonna email me and say
Josh you talk too much
listen I was diagnosed at an early age
with the problem being from a loud
Jewish family and as a result I just
yelled straight through every
conversation because I don't know if I'm
gonna be able to get a word in edgewise
oh we didn't talk about the Hyperloop
otherwise hi bro can I tell you this
would just save your emails this is one
of the most disappointing stories
Hyperloop phases problem and very
consumed except all your rich guys I fix
the puffs are you rich Donald Trump and
constantly now saying the words that I'm
seeing yeah which leads me to say insane
things that's the that's the that's the
product of a distracted mind neil i and
in our distracted age with all these
bleep sandbox groups calling to us from
from near and far
who would you pick Jeff Bezos or Elon
Musk
had to do what I just told you musk musk
cuz he smells great nos no I would
choose not what does he smell like
obviously must be musky he went all the
way there driving the car towards this
cliff I adore my Kindle and I adore
Amazon Prime but the green I gotta go
musk musk here's the edge or my Tesla
muscles just makes our lives a little
easier mono I mean there's a vision
there's a difference totally visionary
way IIIi don't know who I pick I'm just
saying head to head I think first off
together
unstoppable I wish they'd get together
on something yeah but Bezos is a Sorrell
super team business is a is a slow roast
yeah and and Elon Musk is like a flash
fry yeah okay
they have different qualities slow roast
the juices
you get the juices you get the the
flavor the hours of work you get the
fatberg with the flash-fry it's let's be
honest we it's fried yeah it's crispy
it's fried so you're saying musk is not
nutritious I think some of his stuff is
pretty dangerous pretty questionable the
Rockets would you want to get on the
Hyperloop for the trial run so here's
the thing well we have to worry about it
because he's not going to build the
Hyperloop any kind of downplayed sorry
I'll just I know you're gonna talk about
this story but go ahead just I was well
first I was saying Chris had a little
Tesla scoop this week oh yeah Tesla mr.
Tesla they're gonna build a an all-wheel
drive version of the Model S next year
the current version is I'm gonna use
more rear-wheel drive really oh but you
can't you can't in the winter that's no
good for you the word on the street my
street
we're not my street full of Tesla is
that is that they're going to produce
sort of like a hyper expensive version
of this car early next year that's super
powerful faster better stronger than the
current car the P 85 which is the
performance model and this is gonna come
before the Model X which is their new
SUV we had gall wings they don't come
going they come suicide doors yeah why
are this called suicide doors because
it's easy to jump out I don't know
actually that must be it it's easy to
jump out oh wait wait I see why cuz when
you're driving does you do a suicide no
cuz when you're driving you open the
door the wind pushes the door closed but
if you were to open it the other way it
would rip you out it would well would
hold the door open let's put it that way
yeah but that doesn't mean you're you're
killing yourself you could more easily
jump into onto the road the possibility

like tweeting about it like all kinds of
crazy stuff
he's like yesterday on a call Tesla's
earnings call he said I don't have any
plans to execute it because I have to
remain focus on SpaceX and Tesla if
nothing happens for a few years maybe
could make sense to make the hyper would
happen with Tesla but it is extremely
speculative so after all this hype yeah
I'm gonna be actually really and he
really did build it up I mean he
definitely made a point to talk about he
was gonna introduce stuff and he's like
this is a big one I think I kind of shot
myself in the foot by ever mentioning
the Hyperloop because I'm too strung out
design I'll provided quite detailed
design on Monday the best part about the
statement is that he's like oh I would
build this crazy like 6,000 mile an hour
thing but I'm too busy really I'm really
busy right now to save everybody yeah
