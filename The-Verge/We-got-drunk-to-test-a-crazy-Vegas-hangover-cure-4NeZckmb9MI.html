establishing shot
that's video team lingo for a shot of
the exterior of a building so when you
see that I think you're probably gonna
be pretty psyched
so we're drunk in Sin City in Sin City
so I apologize if I'm not making a whole
lot of sense
but I am theoretically at least a
science reporter and part of the reason
that I'm doing this is because I want to
talk about the science of hangovers so
I'm going to this place called hangover
heaven which is a really good name he's
a great man in fact when doctors are
hungover this is what they do they hook
themselves up to an IV - like rehydrate
themselves and like there are also like
vitamins and things in there that may
potentially help with like processing
alcohol and feeling less bad and how
much science do the like Hangover Heaven
people claim when they are discussing I
had a little bit of beer come out of me
how does another science type of event
that will happen in a man's life the
thing that I was going to say is that
there is some evidence for certain kinds
of drugs for hangovers and if you are a
big old nerd you can pull it on PubMed
yourself I'm not I'm pretty cool I'm
have to leave that to your kind
sorry so I'm hoping that they're right
I'm really really hoping that like it
will take 45 minutes for me to feel
better when I'm hungover tomorrow
because Casey is that going to Hangover
Heaven he
just gonna have to tough it out hey over
a hell y'all straight to hell oh Jesus
Christ
I look like my own dad which is always
how you want to appear on video
light is not my friend right now well I
think I have it better because I'm gonna
I'm gonna drink a lot of water and I'm
gonna take some believe and I'm gonna
feel like 80% better so I can't wait to
find out what her experience is like
because in a lot of ways like I do think
I have it better I mean don't get me
wrong I still hurt all over but they're
not gonna stick with needles today I
refuse me I'm not feeling good I I
sincerely hope I do not have a car
second I have done some dumb things in
my time but this is like I wouldn't say
a top three but maybe top five you know
oh yeah here we are
what's your hangover cure I mean I just
take a rub or neck surgery floor I had
to take a few more shots
I know I feel like a dog shitting my
mouth is dead and stepped on my head
I get it yes Magnus save my day I got a
little bruise right here yeah we do
yesterday yeah and it's nice that the
porter subs right here so we're gonna
get a sandwich and then we're getting
our drip eater sandwich and we're gonna
watch the interview so basically this
started while I was working in the
recovery room
I'm a anesthesiologist and seeing people
in the recovery room is post-operative
nausea and vomiting at a dizziness and
that type of thing and seeing that you
know it's same symptoms in the recovery
room they're exactly the same ones that
people have with the hangover and I
thought these same medications would
work well for hangovers I came up with a
protocol gathering at a few volunteers
and tried it out it worked great and it
was just a matter of figuring out a plan
that worked business plan that worked if
somebody could just distract me while
this is happening that would be really
great because you don't like needles I
really do not like I don't like needles
either to the best of our knowledge that
a hangover is probably caused by your
immune system what seems to be going on
is that there's a your immune system is
responding to the alcohol inflammation
seems to be the major cause of the
hangover you feel bad you're like a key
your stomach hurts like all the things
that happened basically when you have
the flu which like have nothing to do
with the flu virus and everything to do
with your like immune system fighting
off the flu virus pretty much there are
things that make it worse
dehydration is one of those things like
dehydration is not great for you in
general you know a maker hangover worse
is texting your ex-boyfriend at 3m and
just trying to figure out where things
went wrong between the two of you don't
text your ex-boyfriend I strongly
strongly recommend deleting all of your
exes for there's a lot of hear from you
it was never gonna work Casey so I am
I'm being rehydrated here what else is
what else is happening you also have
some intravenous alpha lipoic acid going
in which is a very powerful antioxidant
and then they're basically hydration and
a little bit of sugar well let me start
from the beginning that hangovers are
not dehydration right it's inflammation
isn't it yeah an oxidative stress and
the dehydration makes the symptoms worse
from a concentration in fact with a
hangover when you're dehydrated the
concentration of all the nasty stuff and
your blood is higher you rehydrate
people that concentration becomes lower
people feel better a little bit better
just from the rehydration and in terms
of inflammation is there an
anti-inflammatory thing happening here
or okay yeah if you had taken in the
advil today I have not guys actually
this will give you intravenous Advil
okay great a small dose it doesn't take
a whole lot so my headache has been
treated my nausea has been treated I
have been rehydrated and I've also
gotten some other things going on in my
body just to try to catch up from what
happened what happened to it last night
and this morning while I was asleep
overall what's your underwear now I
would I would get I would give it maybe
a one like I am I am feeling pretty
normal and recovered which is nice yeah
you can get back to your you know back
to your vacation back to what you have
to do here
so Liz how was hangover heaven
well the taxi ride to get there was
something but you know I started feeling
better probably after about 15-20
minutes and I was feeling pretty good by
the end and I am like obnoxiously perky
and like full of energy right now
maybe I mean like I might it might just
be like you know the placebo effect
that's totally possible but I feel good
I want to be clear I search the
literature for IV cures for hangover and
I didn't see anything
there's no evidence that this works that
doesn't mean it doesn't work it just
means we don't know that it works I feel
like there's a bias against research on
hangover is just because it's felt to be
so like superficial or silly probably in
the last 15 years there's been less than
50 Papers written on hangovers and maybe
even less than 15 but a lot of the
papers works for the social science
research looking at behavioral issues
rather than the actual blood levels of
inflammatory markers and that type of
thing
the kind of joke kind of like atmosphere
about hangovers probably needs to change
this is going to take some hardcore
science
I mean gas chromatographs liquid columns
animal research we don't know a lot and
that's sort of a problem so I would I
would like to see more work I would like
to see more studies I would like to know
more about what parts of the immune
system were involved
how other things interact and I feel
like once we know those things we can
actually potentially do evidence-based
medicine I'm going to continue to drink
because it's fun and so I'll probably
continue to be hungover I'm never
driving my ass to a clinic while
hungover to have a needle stuck in my
arm and be pumped full of god knows what
so let's meet somewhere in the middle
and find a way to get me back out on the
town to dance the night away I think we
can all drink to that
Cheers like it seems so silly that
people don't actually really study it
even though virtually everybody gets
hungover can you hear it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
