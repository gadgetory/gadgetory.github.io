the verge mobile show this is episode
number 69 for the week of number 18 2013
I am dieter bohn hi I'm flat sebe i'm
dan seifert and i am chris sigler you
had a long pause so I'm in a different
room uh because I'm in New York where I
live now forever and ever at least for a
while you had an opportunity dealer to
say that you were anywhere you could
have said anything in the world and the
listeners would have had no option but
to believe you and you decided to just
go with New York you could end it if he
had such Chicago nobody would believe
him either that's not a very control
your view people aren't even trying
anymore you're where you're just like
all I need to do is mention Chicago and
it's an automatic troll no put some
effort into it Dan at least I'm not
input keep see or whatever for kept see
pow keep see nawaz announce it coke ypsi
no it's not that's all yeah is it
spaghetti poughkeepsie right yes right
which you know i have no retort because
frankly there's nothing nothing really
great poughkeepsie is like a game that
Winnie the Pooh plays when he isn't
sharing his toys listen when I was in
elementary school there was many
sections in first and second grade
spelling your address so right well in
any case I go stop stop looking
Poughkeepsie man through lands a good
for people all of this urban environment
stuff is at least a depression one
actually not speaking of urban
environments Lena depression we need to
have a long deep heartfelt discussion
about how bad all of the cell phone
carriers all the wireless carriers are
in the city I thought this was supposed
to be like in Metropolis in fact
metropolis is based on this city and
they're supposed to be civilization here
and connectivity and well it was working
but New Year's
TT is dropping everywhere and there's
phantom data and Verizon recently like
it's come out there struggling and you
know like if you don't I'm going to be
lucky enough to get my singers you were
screwed in terms of getting a you know
internet connection I just like what's
going on I don't know what to do because
I get no AT&amp;amp;T signal at all in my
apartment however I need to have AT&amp;amp;T
signal so i need to get a microcell but
i don't want to pay an ATT bill so i
don't know if i can just get an AT&amp;amp;T
microcell without an ATT account I
pretty much can't so I pretty much have
to pay for that but it's really not
going to work because it's dropping the
other places need to go I don't want to
get a verizon account I'm all about
switching to t-mobile but I wanted to
actually work outside of the city and
apparently it doesn't so basically I am
giving up I'm quitting smartphones
forever that's the only option that's
left to me listen I can run around with
a Lumia 1020 guess it does urban
environments or feet so I of it which I
would just like to point out dieter that
you you mentioned that metropolis is
based on New York City as if that means
that it's supposed to be a wonderful
place now a perfect utopia when infected
it's a dystopia so I don't think that's
a very good an algae demand no I meant
metropolis of Superman not metropolis
the movie Oh 12 if metropolis the movie
is also based in New York ok ok I chris
is it that New York got more Michelin
stars in the recent ratings in Chicago
is that what's going on here Christmas
Toyota was trolling about Chicago I
can't plan is that it's also just let
not I mean of course New York has more
Michelin stars the city is three and a
half times as large said that's not even
a troll key metric is per capita the key
the key metric is per capita and I
believe New York beats Chicago per
capita as well am i right Chris and 2014
they're actually I think about even in
20 in 2013 York was a head butt
in in 2014 there buddy chris is just
funny because you know man you shouldn't
know that yeah that's really I know that
the per capita metric exists is because
of you Chris if you don't know all the
cities or excuse me all the restaurants
that are Michelin star rated in your
city you are not doing your job as a
human being how many Michelin stars so
Sbarro's have they're not even bib
gourmand they're they're not they're not
in the list anyway please let's let's go
back to talking about something remotely
phone related I was I what do you guys
recommend i do so sir peter uh part of
the reason that all of it kind of sucks
in new york city is because it's a
metropolis the big buildings in whatever
but no i agree with you it's supposed to
be this mecca for awesome cell service
and whatnot and it's really not at all
it's funny because people ask all the
time what cell phone service should i
get in midtown Manhattan and frankly
none of them really work that I agree
our office is located in midtown
Manhattan and you can walk a block and
lose all your signal and walk another
block and get all your signal back and
then walk in the third block and it's
all gone again I don't mind losing
screen I just want my signal to be
accurate the problem that i have with
AT&amp;amp;T in midtown is like it'll look like
it's fine it'll show me four bars of LTE
and everything's awesome but really no
there's no data yes there's a there's a
chipotle restaurant a couple blocks from
our office and well I say restaurant
with a very loose definition but uh you
know you can stand there and my ATT
phone will say that I have like five
bars of LTE service and I can't like
move any data in and out of that phone
like it's just complete dead zone but
the phone claims that it's got full
service well so this is exactly what het
nets are designed to solve right i mean
like the dream is that in the future in
the not-too-distant future 18t will have
thousands of small cells deployed across
manhattan and this will cease to be a
problem because I mean now you get like
you can imagine how like trying to
accurately and completely cover a you
know urban canyons like you have in
Manhattan with traditional cells is
extremely difficult for pretty obvious
reasons not not to give a
heey past but you can understand why
it's hard ya know and I wish that you
know like it was they should be giving
out these microcells like candy like I
should I should just whisper microcell
and they should have a truck at my door
with one they should come in so packs
like at walmart when you check out my
prepaid phone you just a shoe my crystal
the government they should replace phone
books with microcells instead and i just
have them piled up at your door getting
wet from the rain instead of the yellow
pages I I've been I've been thinking
about microsomes for a long time and I
think that they present a huge PR
challenge for carriers which is why none
of them talk about the fact that they
have microcells they're not Microsoft
Anna cells or whatever the pica cells
the reason they don't talk about them is
because the fact that they exist is an
admission that the network isn't perfect
so the only way they can offer them is
very quietly and without advertising
them and without talking about them
that's why you just never hear about
them well yeah but I mean everybody who
uses a damn that took knows that it's in
perfect and that word-of-mouth
particularly comes from such arid aight
mouse as data bones as an effect on
people and it might you know influence
you to go in looking with another
carrier what i would say from my limited
experience in New York is exactly what
the guys have been saying is I it's
extremely spotty so for example there
was one instance last year when I was
there with my head verizon sim cards and
L T and Verizon what it works when he
have good connectivity was just amazing
it blew my socks off it was just it was
like faster than what I get a home but
at the same time if you go if you can't
get that consistent if you can't rely on
it then it's not that much of a comfort
what I would say is that London is
rather the same way and it has a lot
less of the excuse that New York does
with the tall buildings because London
doesn't have that may skyscrapers but
it's just a spotty good coverage and
that includes both 3g and 4g I mean I'm
with the free network here and I have
the equivalent of
the femtocells that you guys are
disgusting but AT&amp;amp;T but I do have a
question and dieter is the man that's
ideally suited to answer it which is how
does New York compared to san francisco
in terms of coverage okay kind of gets
but so AT&amp;amp;T has completely not
completely if they have come a very very
very long way in San Francisco to the
point where it's probably the best
network out there overall it's better
than verizon in my experience in San
Francisco and t-mobile's new you know
not that great so it's actually not
quite a lot of percent flipped because I
don't think verizon superb in New York
but I wasn't expecting AT&amp;amp;T to fall down
as hard as it did in the places where I
need now that said when 18t does have
signal in New York it's fine and fast
except for those phantom things so it's
it's mostly a coverage and getting
around the building's issue I think
except in like really really densely
populated areas like like Midtown I
don't know i'm going to give t-mobile a
try i'm going to give i might i'm going
to give the microcell try the other
thing that sucks is like the perfect
solution is I should just port my number
to google voice and then like whatever
week I feel like using something and I
get angry at somebody else I can just
bounce around but no google voice says
that there's no number porting available
for my phone number I don't rust google
voice anymore I like there's no telling
when they're going to spring clean that
thing like they promised it's going to
get built into hangouts which maybe
that's another reason that's Justin
right oh I can't wait till that happens
and then you have like one phone app and
you've got your like regular phone calls
and your google voice phone calls and
like they're not like yeah but like
things like they did with hangouts with
SMS and hang out chats and they tried to
put them in one phone at or one app oh
yeah talk to each other at all and oh
yes I mean they got a fiction multiple
account problem all right no dieter the
other option that you have on AT&amp;amp;T
mobile is self I which was originally
launched with tmobile but is now
available on AT&amp;amp;T as well and
it's like a booster but a little more
clever it's also a lot more expensive
than a regular booster but you have a
remote unit that beams the signal
wirelessly to your base unit that
rebroadcasts it so but in order for that
to work your remote unit has to have a
lick a signal right it's got a little
bit to work with right well that might
might work and that one is nice because
it'll just work and I won't have to
actually like set it up a GPS located
account with the carrier or whatever
it's just and it also doesn't rely on
your internet the problem I have is that
when my comcast guys which is about once
a week I lose my phone too so will a
self I work cross across t-mobile and
AT&amp;amp;T oh I have to buy one for each I
think they're different units yeah
that's what I thought Jim before we wrap
up this topic I do want to mention that
sprint exists oh so spring and we'll
talk more about this later on republic
Wireless but let's talk about a no use
come on right now brings are we doing
right now um so I tested the Moto X on
republic Wireless which you know their
whole deal Paul Miller did a big piece
on Republic a couple years ago when they
first launched in beta and their their
whole concept is that they offload as
much voice and text traffic to Wi-Fi as
possible which is you know more a valid
of a concept now than it ever has been
because hot spots everywhere you have
Wi-Fi in your home you have Wi-Fi on
your office so ninety percent of the
time you're just connected to Wi-Fi you
don't even need a cell signal for
anything and then for that other ten
percent of the time they offload you to
the to the cell network and their plan
pricing is from five dollars which is
actually just Wi-Fi only you don't have
any cell access up to 40 for a sprint
voice and LTE and limited across the
board and they have a let's say it's a
$25 plan that's unlimited voice texting
and 3G data and then a ten dollar plan
that's unlimited voice and text but no
cell data which is kind of unusual and
interesting so you can see how that's a
really good option you just want you
know and also the five dollar option the
Wi-Fi only is great if you just want to
have a phone to take overseas because
then whenever you're in Wi-Fi access
anywhere in the world it just acts as
your regular
with your regular phone number so and
the Moto X is price really aggressively
to 299 off-contract locked to republic
but it has its own rom it shipped
straight from Motorola they don't like
cook it themselves and like re bundle
the phone and then ship it out to you
Motorola is actually making it in their
factory and shipping it straight to you
with the Republic rom and it worked
really well but what I wanted to say
these if you sprint is that they use the
only cell network that uses sprint
behind the scenes and Sprint's vocoder
is like a national embarrassment like
can you define vocoder for people who
are not uh it's it's daily yeah yes it's
the algorithm that they use to turn your
voice into bits and unpinned rhyme and
vice versa well no so the funny thing is
funny you mentioned the pin pin drop one
thing one really curious thing about
Sprint's vocoder it's extremely low
fidelity it's like it's I don't know how
many kilobits per second it is but it's
definitely it's audibly way lower than
what anyone else uses and one of the
weird things about it is that when no
one is talking it shuts completely off
to the point where you you think that
the call dropped so I found that I kept
putting the phone down in my face and
saying is the call still on or not oh
yes it is and I put it back to my ear
because like you know with a normal
vocoder you can kind of hear a little
bit of hiss in between talking but with
this it just goes completely dead which
is kind of unnerving so and then when
people are talking just kind of sounds
like a Charlie Brown's teacher so it's
like it's completely worthless not
completely worthless but moderately
worthless is a calling device the irony
is is that like sprint is was the first
carrier in the US to offer any HD Voice
option and yeah yeah there's so few
that's unattainable that's all I've got
a little bit of a lead in HD voice I
mean well it's very it's device-specific
right yeah that's the high and if you
don't have a device that works on it I
don't even know what the latest actually
you know a funny thing so when we went
to this this last sprint event when they
were talking about their crazy
spark with the superfast charges bumped
Mike from the super fast internet speeds
with the three different bands that they
use just actually in New York right so
they were talking about HD Voice and
apparently HD voice gets encoded
differently depending on the network
hardware so like I forget who's where
but like Erikson's in one corner and
like alcatel owns another like the
southwest corner and like somebody else
does the northeast corner of the US and
they're the first they'll get HD Voice
rolling but it only work within the
network so it'll only work between like
alcatel networked calls and then it
won't be till next year that they
actually have HD Voice working across
those different networking systems it's
completely screwed up yeah I mean I mean
it's not Sprint's fault that's just how
it works but it's insane to me that well
high-quality voices of that complicated
I would say this is pretty well i would
say it is doing that there's a standard
like when they laid out the network they
should have said the only way we're
doing this is if this is interoperable
well that's what they're doing that with
the rocks my specific you can't just
like turn on any sprint phone and call
any sprint phone again HD voice i know i
don't know what is different with the
implementation with tmobile but as far
as i understand it is not device
specific and it's also so it's also only
within sprint you can't call anyone else
and i don't know about you guys I don't
know anyone that oh no that's not sure I
know one person who with a sprint phone
so like that there's there actually
isn't anyone you can call to experience
HD voice it's like it's come a
non-existent feature the chances that
the person that you know that has sprint
also has a phone that is compatible with
it and is also in an area where the it
actually works are like you know the
Lions will win the super bowl before
that happens so hang of things that are
completely impossible somebody explain
to me why so to explain to me why the
first like other than like the nexus 7
whatever the first like big mass market
phone to get android 4.4 was on verizon
and it was a motorola phone
the Moto X on Verizon kit kat is rolling
out for right now and it beat yeah
everybody else would be on nexus for it
beat the unlock Moto X it'd be like
everybody it beats a google play edition
iht one and the samsung galaxy s4 the
only explanation I can come up with is
that motorola and verizon have been
pretty cozy for many years but that
still doesn't really explain it because
verizon is notoriously thai tasked with
with from her update so III don't get it
I mean when I thought to arise in Galaxy
Nexus right yeah when I talk to them
about the the Moto G I was like why
don't you have Kit Kat like well it just
got released like yeah but you guys are
in the PDK the PDK is the platform
developer kit where people like HTC and
motorola so your own by googly yeah but
there they don't get you they don't get
special treatment they're like look yeah
we know where we get to look at the
stuff early but it's not until the day
that they actually release it that like
you can really start building on it and
it's not until you know you also have to
get like all the chip makers on board
too so like there's always going to be a
lag time but we're working as fast as we
can I was like okay well you know that
makes sense it's still stupid but it's
fine I understand so I was expecting it
to be a little while but they blasted
that thing out and then it's just up on
verizon of all places like yeah i don't
know what to do about that i really like
i need someone to explain to me how to
think about the universe now because i
said i suspect i SPECT chris has nailed
it in so far as verizon might've put
pressure and motorola to make that
effort and I feel like I'm not well hang
on there III don't think verizon would
because no but if your horizon why would
you want motorola to put out the awesome
software update on its branded phone
when you could have it out on your
filthy lucre droids that you make more
money off of lest we forget that the
verizon galaxy nexus which is actually
listed as a galaxy next or a nexus phone
uh with the you know all of the factory
images supplied by google and everything
is still on android 4.2 point2 it's
never going to get android 4.4 but it
doesn't have android 4.3 which the other
galaxies next
devices have uh so there's just like so
many things here that do not add up to
why this happened the way it did yeah
it's not like they are speculating this
boy in any way selector Aizen is
suddenly awesome because they're still
playing games with the verizon version
of the nexus 7 there it's not out yet
they said they were waiting for KitKat
which is bonkers um so it's not like
verizon is all of a sudden like pure as
the driven snow and like super
consumer-friendly it's just like this
weird confluence of like i don't know i
don't know what to do what that's my
point and like i said then this is
speculation we don't know but if you're
looking for motivation for motorola will
prioritize one over the other i would
think well if you go by google play
edition who is looking after you
interest it's just your phone if you go
by the unlock code again it's your phone
nobody's going to motorola and lobbying
on your behalf whereas verizon in a rare
moment of insight might have decided ok
agency had this lead on us with the moto
maker we can kind of steal some thunder
back with the moto x by having the
KitKat update first that might be you
know one reason why they might have
pushed for it all right now that you put
it in terms of politics and trying to
screw the other guy now it makes sense
to me okay yeah but the day hate America
you're right at the end of the day if
you're a verizon moto x customer and if
you're not a verizon moto x customer you
can be one for fifty bucks on contract
so motor makers available for everybody
I think that does that expired it was 50
bucks it's crazy how they did it got
fast yeah I mean that well it's it's now
100 bucks which is still a great deal
for the Moto X yeah but this past
weekend they ran a deal uh which it
could still be going on I could be crazy
but I thought maybe it expired by he'll
actually wrote the article I mean it's
gonna it's gonna be Rocky bucks again
soon I'm sure that there's gonna be all
sorts of all my deals for it yeah come
black friday it'll probably be free yeah
uh so you know it's a great value and
the fact that not only is it a great
phone that we've proven time and again
through our reviews and our experience
with the device uh it's a great value
and it's
at the latest software from google so
yeah nobody cares it's reportedly only
sold 500,000 units and yet nobody's
buying it yeah I don't get it like I I
don't understand why the Moto X is
retail flop it has all the like
hallmarks of what a phone needs to
succeed and what you can't tell me that
people are going into this into stores
and saying I know Samsung I want to
Samsung i'm going to buy nothing but a
samsung I mean maybe they are but it's
like I think a lot of people are and I
think you know a lot of people a lot of
the people that work in the stores the
actual sales reps are very familiar very
comfortable with selling the samsung
voices and you know when it comes down
to it when the people come in are like
what phone should i buy that i could
totally picture sales rep being liked by
samsung or you know by whatever their
favorite phone is or whatever poetry
thing again this is something that you
need a few generations a few iterations
of a device from a company for people to
develop a comfort comfort zone with it
because the weather I feel right now the
LG g2 is the best form that you can go
out and buy it's the phone that i'm
using and I make no apologies about
using cyanogenmod on it until LG
straighten out their skin you do have to
oppose not abusing the icons guys I'm
sorry you're breaking news here right
now this is a courtesy of a mic isaac
you go to Twitter's blog post they've
heard they've got them these are
shelters that are announcing for their
app but more importantly if you look at
the vine for it at about the two second
mark you can see some of the accounts
that they've got that you're set up
around the Twitter office and one of
them is to office whichever
Fisher is the account or a bathroom at
Twitter's headquarters Wow and it's not
verified though though
um all right I'm sorry I your time about
the g2's back button and I had better
care because I can't ever hear about
that again ok so just face it for was in
the face it back but seriously I just
not a lot of magic challenge your point
because you just said that it's the best
android phone that you can buy and they
know just like I have to install I have
to install software to fix it because
it's broken out of the box like got the
best phone that you can buy this is the
best phone that you can buy and I'm not
alone polar Bryan feels the same way and
he's Paul Broun of motor co and he's a
smart ass guy in England so there you go
Wow but the reason I raised doesn't
Stephen Hawking live in England I think
he lives in the u.s. busy in the US okay
I think it wasn't even for a while
anyway um but the reason I write a razor
g2 is because to me the g2 and the motor
works pretty unique in just how crazy
smaller devices compared to the screen
size and like I haven't seen phones like
them any other phones quite like them
and you know if you were to tell me that
I would love using a 5.2 inch phone I
would just say that's crazy but right
now having use the g2 extensively I
literally cannot go back to using an
iphone 5 like forage size is too small
for me and then there's a whole gmail
app fiasco which is still not improving
at all but you know my thinking is
people might go into a store the my cg
tudom I see a moto x and they might say
that's pretty nice hardware but I don't
trust these guys they haven't done a
good phone for months or years or
however long before they go in and
they're like my mom or my my kid doesn't
own a g2 and a kid doesn't own an LG
they don't notice right ahead it doesn't
have the Tegra right that was me yeah
you know when you're in the store and
there was some oh yes right man they
have the tickler inside it rain on flat
remembering that anecdote I was like six
months ago pretty sober to be talking
about legit pandas yeah it's been a
while wow it's the big that actually
predate
me so oh that was before you well you
were where you you were here for our all
of our triumvirate and for other stuff
damn we educated somebody so somebody on
Twitter said that before us he did a no
vote trifecta meant and no no no troika
troika that's right Erica and hopefully
we educated some other people about
quadriga because as we are now um so
let's talk about I think from reading
it's a big phone so you don't want top
of the moto moto g oh yeah God the Moto
G got a lot of stuff happened last week
so yeah the Moto G it's uh probably the
best phone i've ever touched that has a
retail price of under two hundred fifty
dollars if they don't use nothing but a
G thang as the song for the commercial
for this phone they have missed out on
one of the most amazing opportunities
for so many places they could go with it
I they could go they could pair up with
50 cent and and market is a g-unit uh or
you know nothing but a G thing I mean
yeah that was good could go that's good
dad yeah I know that Patrick anyway so
so tating it is like the hip hop phone
and you've got a limiting your audience
yeah but those songs are like you know
that they span all time and space and
genre yeah pretty sure that uh fifty
cents song was number one unlike all of
the Billboard charts that it could be on
for quite a few weeks so yeah but then
does the other thing the Moto G is
intended to be sold in areas that might
not have a big boy chart right because
there's something over its targeting
here hip-hop is a cross-cultural I bet
they noticed it's American it's just it
crosses boundaries man it just so
everyone's everyone's American now and
like so anywhere understand so all right
so the Moto G is a unlocked phone that
is actually it's it's kind of like a
mid-range device that Motorola is
selling at an entry-level price in the
US you'll be able to buy it for 179
bucks for an eight gig version or two
hundred bucks for a 16 gig version
but not like you one but not until q1
right yeah but motor role is really not
pushing it hard here in the US because
this phone is designed for emerging
markets and areas that smartphones don't
have the kind of penetration that they
have here in the West and in developed
markets so people can actually get a
really good experience on the Moto G for
not a whole lot of money and it's
actually like really surprising the
screen is four and a half inches and
it's a 720p display in many respects it
looks nicer than the 720p display on the
Moto X because it's an LCD as opposed to
AMOLED so it's got a great viewing
angles great color it's not as
oversaturated it's got a quad core
Qualcomm processors its got like a real
processor in it uh it's it's responsive
it the build quality is just about the
same as the Moto X um but mission
together like this two things that are
down it's missing LTE and it also has it
why would make yeah it was a crappy five
megapixel camera yeah cameras not that
great but like you know it takes
pictures I mean if you hear it if you
compare it to other two hundred dollar
phones like it's a much better camera
than what you normally get on a
two-hundred-dollar phone like you gotta
figure this thing is going to be priced
against the like lumia 510 the Firefox
phones uh and then like whatever Samsung
Galaxy a sibling ever yeah yeah yeah and
this those are like terrible devices
yeah there's no really bad so the the
well the Lumia 520 is pretty good I
guess that's a rare exception what is
not it's not an easy display it's not a
quad-core processor it's so know a lot
of other things that it's not I was
totally with you and I still AM that
this is a pretty remarkable device for
the price ice nice but a bunch of people
when I was tweeting about it were
talking back to me and a couple dm's to
that like it's actually not that
remarkable device if you look especially
in China which of course the Moto G
isn't going to China but a bunch of it's
a bunch of like phones in this range are
being sold
around this price it's just we're not
seeing it here because it's not none of
it's coming to the US market and a lot
of it is is located in Asia and then the
main thing is that like the margins on
phones have distorted our sense of what
they cost may be well I my retort to the
the Chinese phone argument is that you
know I I can't say for sure how the
level of quality that those phones at
selling around that price bracket and
China are but I imagine it's not as nice
as the Moto G I've actually liked having
used and touched the Moto G it's
actually really well put together it's a
really nice screen you know it's not
doesn't feel like it's gonna fall apart
in your hands and then none of those
Chinese phones have access to the Google
Play Store which the Moto G does and I
honestly think that that is a value
quotient right there which is makes it
more valuable to me and I think many
other people over like a lumia 510 for
that matter um so yeah there's i'm sure
there's like plenty of phones that we
never see here in the US i don't know
how many are actually hitting these
marks at the moto g hits that's all I
was just going to say there was that top
end a sciphone which is quite cute and
fun in terms of like the desired and
using it so I mean the competition isn't
Oh absolute garbage like I will totally
agree on those galaxy ace you nothing
has nothing as a 720p display well first
response max let other mate what wvga LA
and then most of these things have Q HD
displays at best and they're not good q
HD displays yea all I'm pointing out is
that if you're not going to be all that
bother about the camera or LTE
connectivity and things like that maybe
they're there are well-designed phones
in that price bracket they're not all
completely not to garbage but something
else that kind of stands out to me is
how and maybe did this to date this
point about the chips be cheaper than we
might think a quad-core Snapdragon
processor in that I mean first of all
Qualcomm is just owning the entire
market right now which is yes but for
and it seems to be because their pricing
those chips aggressively because I am
surprised I'm surprised to see that kind
of power in something like the Moto G
and you guys are speechless a surprise
well as you know it's great sear even
400 which is Qualcomm's lower end lineup
but it's the first one that we've seen
at least here in the US or that I've
seen that has a quad core version of
that processor we saw the 400 in the one
mini and in the HTC first with a
dual-core chip and it was okay it was
passable but the quad core is actually
noticeably faster and maybe it has to do
with the fact that the software isn't as
heavily themed and things like that and
what just well-meaning doesn't have the
Snapdragon 400 first chosen 6 knots it's
a Sephora the one mini is definitely a
400 dual-core 400 i reviewed it man you
gotta be a 400 I think it was talking to
be wrong then then HTC just slipped I
don't buy me in that case let's talk
about the Lumia 1520 the giant phone
which also like this is a watershed
device because I believe it marks the
first time that we have written the word
phablet in an article without immunity
apologizing for it we broke down and get
it this is that this that's the term now
they're called fat okay just a sec
typically cones are here we've accepted
that note 3 is a very good one we've
accepted that the Xperia Z Zed whatever
it is is gigantic it's just what they
are now they're big and we're just
calling them phablets and we're not
sorry anymore and I'm so sorry it is a
Snapdragon 400 into one mini I was wrong
did with blue something explains doesn't
happen very often can someone explain to
me why the chronic is not on Spotify I
just want to play no I just want to play
nothing but a G thang how long have you
been looking for like 10 minutes there's
there like 20 cover yeah dude just go to
youtube I was saving any song that I
haven't been able to find a ug yeah
every other mobile show Chris you like
disappear and are focusing on something
and I
like you're working because like you
know I know stuff is going on in the
business of the version never stops and
sometimes I am doing that too but most
the time it's you but really you're not
working you're just like cruising
Spotify 30 tracks there's no shame in
the game don't hate okay i can say with
back i can say goes back because i
interrupted by mentioning snap around
400 and the living 1520 if i'm not
mistaken has a snapdragon 800 inside
right then ah that's correct yes it's
the first windows phone with a
Snapdragon 800 it's got two gigabytes of
RAM it's really really fast it's
definitely the fastest Windows Phone
that I've ever used a Windows Phone
typically is not slow to begin with it's
a very responsive user interface ah but
the Lumia 1520 is noticeably faster when
you are opening apps and switching apps
and things like that ah and at this
point it really just feels like the
Windows Phone animations of constantly
opening that fan and closing that fan to
do things is what slows slows you down
more than the processor so that's a
that's a kind of a good thing to see um
the screen is tremendous here I have it
right here oh god that is big oh god I'm
really holding back from uh it's really
bright it's got great viewing angles if
I tilt it to the side here uh it's
actually really really bright outdoors
as well so it's really awesome outdoors
it's got all of Nokia's tricks for
polarization ClearBlack I works with
gloves all that fun stuff so it's a
really it's a great display um and then
the Bill of the device is pretty much if
you took if you're familiar with the
Lumia 720 and then you put it on one of
those medieval stretch your things and
stretched it out nice that that design
um but yeah it is a six inch display and
it is very much a very very big phone uh
it is pretty much impossible to use one
handed uh and you know it's open up the
on-screen keyboard here you could just
see how massive that on-screen keyboard
is it's actually the on-screen keyboard
is taller on the 1520 than it is on
27 which I find a highly hysterical Wow
and uh you know and that kind of just
gets to my point of Microsoft did the
bare minimum to optimize Windows Phone 8
for a device this big or a screen this
large itemized most of the car apps
right well they say they did you know
they you could see on the screen here
I've got three columns going so I can
have more tiles in one space uh it makes
for a bit of a jumble and a lot of stuff
going on so it's a bit intense you can
see they're all flipping and all that
fun stuff so i don't have to scroll as
much which is nice none of the tiles can
be stretched out to the full width so
you are still limited with two columns
but that is the biggest noticeable
difference between this and every other
windows phone microsoft says that it
optimized the core apps but it did like
the bare minimum in the email app I can
see about half a half of a more email on
the list I could see one line preview
more on the context I can see maybe like
two contacts and on the app list I could
see for more apps before I have to
scroll ah but that's about it and that
is different no browsers exactly the
same uh and so when you compare it to
like here I've got the UH what do you
compare it is an amazing massive tripod
is the background so here's a huge thing
and here's another key when when you
look at how much bigger it is than say a
925 which is not really a small phone to
begin with I you'd expect to get far
more out of that giant screen real
estate and I think wow you know they
didn't really do much of it at all so
it's just like bigger for the sake of
being bigger the fonts of giant the
icons are giant everything is giant the
925 was an iphone when you first brought
it up next oh yeah that's compared to
the iphone with you really want to
continue the iphone horizontally so we
can see if it's wider than the iphone
east hall yeah i'm sorry i'm trying to
try to keep the screen on but i keep you
know obviously it's a giant screen and
I'm touching it as I move but yeah so
you can get an idea of how big that is
so it actually doesn't fit in my front
pocket
I can't sit down with a front pocket and
in my back pocket my pants it like
sticks up by about half an inch see this
is why you need a galaxy round or g flex
right the only the only pocket that I
can keep it in is in like the inside
pocket of a blazer otherwise it's just
it's just far too large it also doesn't
fit in my American side cup holders in
my car oh and that's another point good
but in that pocket of a blazer which
people might not appreciate I had an AC
one max in is that exact position and
what what do you what would happen is
that my jacket will start to tilt in the
direction in which the phone is I'm not
joking like it is the leading it's it's
heavy as well you know nokia phones
aren't really like to begin with so you
know this the size of of massiveness is
heavy and so you know the thing that I
have that the issue that I have with it
is that there's obviously a market for
these big phones I think Samsung's
proven that they you know they're three
iterations into the note line it's
actually a really good advice if you
wanna a phone that's really giant you
know the note offers a unique experience
the problem is that nokia and microsoft
aren't offering a unique experience with
this and the software gives you the same
experience you might see on a 10 20 or 9
25 without like really any difference as
opposed to the the extra column on your
home screen you know how close does this
thing to just like you're kind of just
wishing it you had windows RT on it you
know who wishes that Windows RT anything
with those are Dixon has its own issues
uh but you know it's a fing days I made
windows 8 I think yeah yeah like I think
a more fair comparison is to say like at
what point do you wish it was just a
dell venue pro or venue 8 or whatever
they're calling it or write like here's
here's a comparison to a 2013 Nexus 7
and you can see that it is nearly as big
as the nexus 7 the difference obviously
being that the Nexus 7 has real tablet
software on it so you know I think that
the the 1520 gives us a lot of preview
as to like what the next windows devices
will be like with the awesome processor
an awesome screen um but then its
you know it never once in using any
Windows Phone have I ever said gee i
wish i had more cpu like yeah never it's
just not an issue for that platform
right right and I mean unless you
compare them side-by-side you know
you're you're 95 or whatever if you
happen to own a windows phone is not
going to suddenly feel slow unless you
compare it side-by-side with a 1520 it
is it is a tick faster in animations
it's just a little bit more responsive
it's scrolling is a little bit snappier
but you know like like you said like I
said Windows Phone has never been
wanting for for more power so yeah I
mean the good thing is that it's now a
1080p display which the older phones
were not 1080p displays and this has no
issue pushing around the 1080p display
so that's good to see and it's the
typical build quality is great from
Nokia the camera is kind of average I
think that's one of the bigger
disappointments uh this is a it's a
PureView camera I uses the same
technology as the 1020 but it's a 20
megapixel version so it's not as extreme
as the 41-megapixel one but it is not as
good in low light as the iphone 5s it's
definitely not as good in the light as
the 1020 and it's just slow it takes a
long time to open a long time to take a
photo and a long time to save that photo
so it's no that's terrible oh that was
my little silver lining that I was
hoping would be the true for the new cpu
processor exactly and thats things up
that's what nokia was said what happened
they said you know this new processor
let us do a lot of photo things faster
and things like that ah but it it's slow
compared to you know comparable iPhones
and Android devices so so really it's an
issue with yourself to a rather than
hardware yeah I think they could
probably improve it software-wise that's
a feeling I'll yet did you try any of
the you tried to take any role photos is
that compared to go to TV oh yeah it is
it shoots um so when you normally take a
photo by default it will shoot a 5
megapixel image and a 19 megapixel image
and say both of those and that's really
where it slows everything down is when
it's saving those files the 19 megapixel
image
Yuri crop and do all those fun things
with nokia software uh the other option
if you go into settings you can have it
saved a 5 megapixel jpg and 819
megapixel dmg file which is a raw format
that is kind of universal when you do
that you lose all of the ability to
recrawl and play with all the fun stuff
on the phone so it's pretty much you
know if you just want to put thrown in
Photoshop and tweak it from there um I
didn't actually spend a whole lot of
time doing that because the last thing I
want to do is is take a photo off my
phone and tweak in Photoshop but if you
want to do it it's there I think you'll
have more fun with the 10 too funny
thing that because it's a better camera
she yeah totally teachers birds who
owned a 1020 I think that's going to be
the overwhelming theme of our podcast
today um no listen I mean I'm still just
like dealing with the fact that like
I've accepted that phones that are this
size now yeah here's a so I have the one
max with me as well so you can see the
this 10 20 is about the same size as the
one max which I think we said was too
big and then the the Z Ultra is here and
this is actually a bigger wow so that's
six point four inches um so these are
phones you can put them up to your face
and make a call there are things with
phone like features and capabilities
well and witty and you guys are never
gonna convince me to say fabulous I'm
just quit and safe that but I mean like
I've I just kind of throw my hands up in
the air because you know it's either use
a lot of words to describe this or just
say one word that I don't like very much
so what's the one word you don't like
very much Oh family I don't say man
phablet it's a fabulous fabulous day
with your phablets oh you know what
actually no instead of this i think i
just want the porsche pineau 982 are we
seriously talking about that thing is
that has one I am going to do a live in
box
I'm currently wait did I get the numbers
right on the on this phone the pinion
pinner what's it called phenomena 998
ooh that's right that 982 it got it
right yeah so to get in books and
started I would just like to say to the
outside of the way we very fine
detection we need to we need to let
people on Twitter know that we're we're
doing a live on I you allowed to put
this thing out there you under any sort
of embargo Vlad little bit mad well if I
had any shame I would just like do it
but yeah uh yes I'm allowed to put it
out there okay just ask him i justjust
on the topic of the world I don't want
to live in um I am unhappy that today we
heard Samsung has actually shipped
800,000 galaxy Gear's and Chris
enlighten me about the most works on a
selling half a million I know what is
sales the other is shipments but still
the fact that even retailers are willing
to commit to 800,000 of those atrocious
pouches when do you have they made those
are in Russia how many bestbuy
warehouses does it take to hold 800,000
a galaxy Gear's until Samsung takes him
back it's a good question dude so Kwame
um are weakened editor here at the verge
he did actually point out something
worth noting which is we were all joking
and making fun of the original Galaxy
Note now I'm not saying nothing no stop
just let me finish just do it it no a
bit of it we were everybody was yes we
were yes well I'm not saying this is the
same thing no but I am saying there's an
interesting parallel there that maybe
just maybe we could have AG interface in
one like the shipments rented sales is
it the possibility difference between
the gear and the note is that the note
isn't actually a a good good product
right it's a good product and the gear
is like fundamentally not it might be at
someday if Samsung actually like updates
it and makes it better but the one that
you buy today is not a good product not
only so that's the key difference yeah i
dunno x
backed any egg on my face with regards
to the galaxy gear it's also you don't
eat eggs so I how would it even happen
what we're not even going to go there
the egg okay we do eunuchs the egg is
like the perfect food and I'm saying it
there's a do professor who is like the
PR guy for eggs because they have the
perfect protein breakdown and give you
all your necessary fats and all of those
good things anyway I do eat eggs I make
amazing omelets now you should come to
my house ok so the phone all right wait
wait plaid do you eat cheese ok I see
you're making an omelet without cheese
it's a travesty ok carry on I do make
homeless with that cheese and yes the
post designer bags sorry dude there are
French people who just offended I mean
there's a whole country just offended
there's a little freaked by the way so
France just issued a travel advisory
against its its citizens traveling to
chicago so i don't care about offending
the French what why why don't why
doesn't why doesn't France a lot people
go to Chicago because of the crime no I
think I'm going to be swindled into
eating something that they think is
going to be pizza and it's not pizza
wait wait Chris hurry up to the truck
just is that is that for real yeah yeah
she can't go Tribune published it today
Wow okay I mean they thought about uh I
was gonna try and make a surrender joke
but I couldn't come up with anything so
let it go okay so blank buried the
reason i am showing this box is because
like the very purpose of this thing's
existence is in the accessories and in
your imagination so you have to imagine
the fine texture of this box okay so
then we open it up then is more
blackness building up the anticipation
and then there's these two thinks this
is a low point for the original show
right now it's really fitting that
there's two things here in the
foreground because one of them is the
phone itself which has steel and it
looks a little nice to being honest with
you
well it's real leather which might piss
a lot of people off you know animal
rights and whatever also blackberry tell
me it's real Italian leather made of
Italian cows I don't know if that
matters to you and but it has a shin on
the bottom right no it doesn't it's flat
no but it's got like a little instead of
being straight across it like has a
little chin chin a chin like a z10
doesn't doesn't go down as far on the
bezel underneath the screen that's what
I'm saying yeah it's like rounded off on
okay okay i was thinking chin like we
know not like it not like yet not like
bruce campbell chin like a yeah not one
the patrice forward yes climb that goes
down right yeah yeah he's got a little
bit more does the stainless steel part
of it but seriously if even the
blackberry guys who were showing this
thing to me they were struggling to come
up with differences from the said 10 it
so it's the same internal same processor
same screen all that jazz yeah it just
has 64 gigs of storage why didn't they
go with the I mean the cool thing about
putting into 981 was this was their
crazy keyboard and going metallic and it
didn't fit with you know the other
blackberries they should have totally uh
just done the q10 instead of the Zed
time I mean this really is one way or
the other honestly when you look at this
thing the p 9 9 8 9 9 9 9 82 it's it's
just as it 10 with the top and the
bottom of the p 9 9 9 9 9 8 1 yeah did I
could have done this in a minutes worth
of work and I don't do design now Glen
with the with the original / nanana Nana
the blackberry customize the software
side like special Porsche icons and
things like that is that any different
with this one or is it the same software
do you get a unique BBM pin but way way
way way that's that that's important
let's get through the trivia first and
we're not really we've spent like 10
minutes on this wait this is this is the
Porsche secretly franco on this it's
a Porsche theme ringtone but it isn't
actually an engine noise okay
and boots up and shut down animations
have that pd porsche design logo
happening and from what I understand
Porsche Design guys just like this other
group which is licensed to use the main
basically that they have nothing to do
with the actual Porsche designers but
anyway none of that matters to people
who interested in this here's what
matters this is the other hugely
important part it's a credit card sized
thing which makes you a literal
card-carrying member of an exclusive
club and you have a unique pin now what
I'm going to say is that exclusive club
is going to matter to some people and
not going to matter to it's going to
matter the people that were civilians in
this relation I mean it you it really
depends on how you define that Club
that's it whether you want that phone or
not yet price tag also is worth
mentioning is two thousand four hundred
dollars totally worth it yeah well if
you want to justify it in Hardware terms
that you have a charger adapter for
every single region in the world and one
of the tiniest freaking batteries ever I
mean I look at this barrier I just I'm
just embarrassed on their behalf like
seriously so somebody did a calculation
and they said you could get something
like a thousand sixteen gigabyte moto
g's for the price of one of these I mean
the reason this phone exists is because
it's profitable right like that they
sell it in like two regions where
everyone is a billionaire and they'll
sell them and I mean the phone costs
marginally more than a regular z10 to
make and there's the other thing the
only premium material here is the
leather and write it right yeah I'm
saying like if they probably have a
printer that is what volition thing Oh
fantastic conversion with only 500 be
made and I can still see them every one
of those are review units that the funny
thing the funny thing to me is that like
the people who buy that if I actually
saw someone who owned this I'd be like
dude this just means you couldn't afford
a virtue like
hahaha poor man's Vertu's all its wow I
really like the the acura phones is that
it's a decent way but I mean you just
offended everybody who's listening to it
soon owns an accurate but sure i would i
would buy it i would be i'll be grateful
if i could buy an acura i'd be super
happy not not in New York you wouldn't
be well no all right we should we should
probably wrap up pretty soon I do want
to take a brief moment to say that new
FCC Chairman Tom wheeler is not at least
in his first couple of weeks week
however long it's been the Super Pro
carrier tragedy that we were all
expecting that'll come later but so far
Chrissy seems to be like do it okay he
is not the worst person on the planet so
far which is encouraging yeah I think
that he honestly I mean this might be a
little overly optimistic but it almost
seems like he was motivated by the
amount of momentum that that Clyburn
generated he's trying to keep that up
but um he actually just circulated
moments ago a memo on how he wants to
take action on moving the country toward
an all-ip infrastructure which is code
for ripping out the landlines I which
there are many many forces at play in
that conversation and it's it's still
open for debate whether that's actually
a net good thing for consumers aren't
that bad thing so that the the jury's
still out but that that literally just
happened so he's moving very quickly and
he's using in every memo I've seen of
his he's using very strong language he's
saying you know we got to do this right
now we gotta act he actually put a like
a time window on that memo he sent to
see of large and president of CTA is
like I want this resolved by December
with the phone unlocking stuff so that
the dude is looking to move we'll just
see if he can keep it up and what's
what's this drama today Chris I know
that you you don't have any strong
feelings about this cell phone unlocking
thing that yes my goodness so there's
this story I believe it originally
appeared in the new york times about how
carriers are pushing back on a a
proposed requirement to uh to load
phones with software that would allow
users to remotely lock them if they're
stolen carriers are allegedly pushing
back because they're great that's going
to cut into insurance profits because
the insurance plans which are very
popular are also very profitable which
is why every time you go to say it best
buy and you buy a three dollar CDR
they're like do you want to ensure that
for two years for twenty five dollars
and so and so yes I agree in principle
that that you know remote lock and wipe
is great I think that it that this is
kind of bizarre and misguided and a
little backwards for a few reasons one I
can't think of any other physical object
owned by american citizens where the
government requires that they be
modified in some way to disincentivize
people to steal them look we don't we
don't require we don't mandate alarms or
low jacks on cars which are obviously
very heavily stolen things and secondly
auto and secondly carriers just took
action late last year on a national imei
blacklist so there there is a way to
prevent these phones from being used
after their stolen but ultimately the
question becomes like I I think it's a
British well I got a national I me I
blacklist doesn't solve the problem
because a lot of these phones are
getting shipped overseas so that you
actually need to disable the unit itself
right you right but that gets to my last
point which is that regardless of how
you approach this you're still not
solving the problem of a of a shady guy
coming up to you and taking your phone
because they're not thinking about
whether oh well then I wonder if maybe
this phone is going to be remote
lockable they're just like gank and then
they walk away yeah what I mean the idea
is that if like if they if it becomes
