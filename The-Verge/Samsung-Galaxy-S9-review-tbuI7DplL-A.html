from Samsung now if you squid even
slightly you might think you're looking
at last year's Galaxy s8 because the
differences between it and the s9 are
well minimal at best but this is the
Android phone that more people will buy
than any other this year and it does
come with a few new things that those
people appreciate and besides it's not
like the SI is a bad phone to start from
the overall design of the s9 is
unchanged from last year it's still a
glass of metal sandwich it still has
curved glass on the front and back it
still has an extra wide 18 point 5 by 9
display and minimal bezels it's really
nice and it's really well made but the
glass back is kind of a fingerprint
magnet and it can be slippery to hold
the smaller s9 is the 5 point 8 inch
screen while the s9 plus is a six point
two inch display both are Super AMOLED
panels with 2965 1440 pixels of
resolution both are really nice to look
at with vibrant colors sharp resolution
and excellent viewing angles they're
also slightly brighter this year which
is always appreciated if not always
noticeable and they still remain the
best displays you can get on any Android
phone
they even up to par with the screen on
the iPhone 10 provided you don't mind
slightly more saturated colors the s9 is
the same fast wired and wireless
charging as before the same
ip68 water resistance as before and the
same 3.5 millimeter headphone jack as
before if you're looking for a high-end
phone with a headphone jack in 2018 your
choices are fewer than ever so it's kind
of great to see Samsung stick with it
for the s9 now the big design change is
the placement of the fingerprint scanner
which is the move from the side of the
camera to just below it it's much easier
to use in the SI it's especially if
you're using the larger plus model but
it's still weirdly small and too close
to the camera I frequently swipe on the
camera lens when I'm trying to use the
fingerprint gesture to see my
notifications which is kind of annoying
and then of course there's that dreaded
bixby button which is still there it's
still in the same spot just below the
volume buttons on the left side now you
can disable it from launching bixby now
which is
progress but samsung still doesn't
provide a native way to reprogram it to
something more useful now and it's worse
it's annoying and at its best it's a
little fidget button that you can press
without having to worry about doing
anything if you actually disable pick
speed the other new hardware feature
here is stereo speakers which basically
catches Samsung up to what everyone else
has been doing for a couple of years
they are noticeably louder and fuller
than the single speaker on the SI and
they're really great for watching video
I'm not gonna say that the best phone
speakers I've ever heard but they're
still great and I'm happy to see them
here the rest of the hardware
improvements are all on the inside it's
got Qualcomm's news snapdragon a 45
processor either 4 or 6 gigabytes of RAM
depending on which model you choose and
a new LTE modem that supports even
faster gigabit speeds now those respects
we're gonna see in virtually every
Android flagship this year but Samsung
is the first out of the gate with them
performance at least during my review
has been great everything is really fast
and responsive and the network
performance is just as impressive as
last year's and to be honest noticeably
better than the iPhones though unchanged
of the size of the battery in the
internal storage you get a 3000 milliamp
hour battery in the s9 and it's 3,500
million power battery in the s9 plus
both of them has 64 gigs of storage and
microSD card support I really would have
liked to see Samsung increase the
battery size this year it's not to say
that the battery life is bad on either
model but it's not the best you can get
and heavy users are gonna even deplete
the s9 plus battery after a long day so
despite all of that sameness Samsung did
upgrade one important aspect to the S
line and it did so in a pretty big way
the S lines rear camera is all-new it's
kinda improved sensor and a new variable
aperture lens that can physically switch
between a really bright F 1.5 and a
smaller F 2.4 aperture the s 9 plus
skeins ii telephoto lens for portrait
mode stuff like Samsung used on no date
last year on top of that everything is
optically image stabilized samsung
claims significant improvements in
low-light photography over the s8
scamper and it's true that the s9
definitely can take some really great
photos in low-light the F 1.5 aperture
let's in more light than last year's F 1
point 7 lens and the improved processing
helps reduce noise overall and unless
impressed with a switching aperture
feature it feels more like a parlor
trick than anything else
now since a digital camera can just
compensate its shutter speed for how
much light is in the room I don't really
ever feel like I would ever need to
shoot at f/2 point for now if you are in
the pro mode of the camera app you can
actually switch between the two modes so
here for an example or shoot this image
at 1.5 and then I'm gonna shoot this
image at 2.4 and overall there really
isn't much difference between the two
images the F 1.5 has a slightly blurry
background then the F 2.4 which has a
little bit longer depth of field but in
terms of like sharpness there really
isn't a difference there so I'm not sure
why I would ever shoot a F 2.4 on this
phone I'd probably just leave it at 1.5
and forget about it
the s 9 + is ii telephoto lens is
similarly gimmick Samsung's live focused
portrait mode just isn't as good as
apples or Google's at separating a
subject from the background and in
challenging lighting conditions the
image quality is kind of bad the s 9 can
shoot 4k video at 60 frames per second
or slow-motion 1080p video at 240 frames
per second which catches us up with what
the iPhone can do now both modes produce
nice quality video but you have to make
sure you have plenty of light for the
slow motion mode where you'll see a lot
of noise in the video overall the S
Alliance camera is definitely an
improvement and it's very good on its
own but if you weren't a fan of
samsung's image processing before you
still won't like it now sure there's
less noise than before and the colors
are pleasing but all the images
definitely have Samsung's look to them
which is different than what Apple or
Google scampers produce at this point it
really comes down to personal preference
but it's definitely something to be
aware of and one thing I wish Samsung
did spend some time on is the front
camera on the s9 it's the same 8
megapixel camera as found on the s8
it does have autofocus which no other
front camera has yet to replicate but
its portrait mode just isn't as good as
Google or Apple's so all that stuff is
great and it's gonna keep the s9 at the
top of phone rankings for most of 2018
but there's a ton of other things that
Samsung is pushing with the marketing
for the s9
here and to be honest you'll probably
never use them it's almost as if Samsung
just couldn't help itself the first up
is a our emoji Samsung's take on the
iPhone tens an emoji feature here's how
it works it scans your face and then it
produces a bitmoji looking character
based on a hundred points of your face
and that kind of maybe sometimes looks
like you then it takes this character
and it creates a bunch of reaction guess
with it that you can then send in
messaging apps then there's also some
weird-looking animals that you can
create video clips with like you can do
with an emoji on the iPhone now there's
a couple of issues with Samsung's AOR
emoji first off Samsung isn't using any
special tech to capture your face or
movements it's just relying on the
camera so tracking is pretty bad
second the characters it creates are
just the wrong kind of creepy and nobody
have tested it with has been like oh
that's something I like and then the
animals on top of that are just kind of
weird it's definitely something that
Samsung built just to compete with Apple
and frankly it's not very good now
Samsung is also trying to eighth the
iPhone 10's face ID with its new
intelligent scan feature it combines
iris scanning and face detection to
unlock the phone but it's still slow and
now it shines a bright red light in your
face when it scans a good thing there's
a fingerprint scanner that's easier to
reach on the back because that's faster
and more reliable than Samsung's face
scanning options next is the new super
slow motion mode in the camera the s9
can shoot up to 960 frames per second
which sounds really neat but it can only
do so for 0.2 seconds at a time and only
at 720p resolution now there's two ways
you can shoot it you can try to manually
trigger it to capture the point two
seconds of action you want or you can
use an automatic mode that looks for a
specific movement in an area of the
frame and then capture a slo-mo when it
detects it but in practice both are
really hard to use and they're really
more frustrating than anything else
worse you need a ton of light to make it
work and even if you have lots of light
imagery quality is kind of crappy and if
that wasn't enough there's the awful
music the app overlays on the clip
automatically if you don't bother to
edit it after the fact
now Bixby it's not new but it's still
here and it's still bad it's kind of
fresh go to paint and it's slightly
faster than before but it's still way
slower than the Google assistant and
isn't as good at parsing my voice
commands there's a couple of new
features like an integrated makeup store
that lets you try makeup out virtually
and then buy it directly from Sephora or
covergirl but I really can't imagine
anyone using that more than once anyways
here's what I look like with a face full
of makeup and then there's the perennial
complaint with Samsung's software why
are there so many duplicate apps the
unlocked s9 I've been testing has two
email apps two gallery apps two browsers
two app stores and two payment apps now
a couple of Samsung's apps are good
mostly the Samsung Browser and Samsung
pay but the rest are inferior to the
Google apps that are also installed on
the phone which just makes them kind of
annoying and if you care at all about
software updates samsung is one of the
worst manufacturers when it comes to
delivering new versions of Android as of
this review last year's Galaxy s8 still
doesn't have Android 8.0 in the US and
that was released by Google over six
months ago okay so it sounds like I just
took a huge dump on the s9 but like I
said most of these bad things can be
ignored you can turn off fix feed
never bother to use a are emoji or super
slow-mo and disable most of Samsung's
apps the only real sticking point for
some people will be Samsung support
update history but that leaves the rest
of the s 9 which is actually really
great still has modern design it has
great performance a great screen and a
very good camera outside of the display
the s9 isn't a class leader in any
category but it's good enough in all of
them that the whole package makes for a
great phone chances are if you're
spending between 700 and 900 dollars on
a new phone this year the s9 is gonna be
one of the best options you can get but
if it doesn't do it for you
you might want to wait for Samsung's
next big thing
