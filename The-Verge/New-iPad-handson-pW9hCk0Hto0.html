are standing here after the new ipad
event with the new iPad you can see here
it looks a lot physically like the iPad
2 it's a tiny bit thicker a tiny bit
heavier basically imperceptible to most
people the back pretty much looks the
same you can see it's got an ipad on it
they're not calling it the ipad 3 not
ipad HD the big story i think with this
device is the screen and I can tell you
you know videos not going to do it
justice and photos are going to do it
justice kind of like when I first saw
the iphone 4 it just looks like you're
looking at a glowing piece of paper it's
actually a little bit weird it's an
incredible he just display probably the
best I've ever seen not just mobile but
overall it's just an incredible looking
looking display inside its got a 5x CPU
which is an upgrade to the a5 and it
does seem a lot speedier it's going to
improve GPU of their cognitive quad-core
GPU cpu remains dual-core and there's
also upgraded cameras the camera on the
back is now a 5 megapixel shooter can do
HD video one of the cool things in the
new iphoto is that you can actually do
this it has a mode where you can hold
down on specific areas in it let me see
if I can get this where you can adjust
well that's actually addressing the
whole photo but if it you see here if
it's on somebody's face it knows that
you're on skin tones and you can
actually change the skin tone just in
that area so it's a pretty impressive on
certain images for instance images with
a decent sky in the background let's
take a look at this one it will detect
at its sky you can go here and see that
you get a control for darkening or
lightening the sky itself so really cool
and non-destructive which is one of the
nice things about it if you're worried
about getting in here and editing photos
I think for photographers is going to
become an incredible tool given the
resolution of the screen but overall a
big improvement on what was already a
great product the ipad 2 is solid ipad 3
or rather new
ipad is a you know it's pretty killer
this display the processor the new
software they've added it is an also
same price point very few complaints
here we're going to play around with it
a little bit more see some more of the
software and we'll get back to you but
for now this is a josh from the verge
