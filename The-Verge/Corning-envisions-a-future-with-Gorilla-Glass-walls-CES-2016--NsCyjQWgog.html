first official day of CES and I've just
checked out Corning's booth you might
know Corning is the company that makes a
Gorilla Glass which goes into the iPhone
and a whole bunch of other smartphones
but here at CES today they're trying to
show off their vision for how Gorilla
Glass can be used in a whole bunch of
other applications a one possible
application for Gorilla Glass is in the
car Corning has announced a partnership
with Ford to put Gorilla Glass in some
models of the GT and Gorilla Glass is
lighter than regular glass so if you
have one of the layers in the windshield
made of Gorilla Glass that gives you
less drag on the car and it's better for
fuel consumption as well but Corning
also thinks that you could use Gorilla
Glass in the console so because the
glass can be bent it allows it to sort
of bend the screen to fit the contours
of the dashboard itself elsewhere
they're looking for applications in the
home so they demonstrated a matrix of 10
55 inch panels that are sort of all bat
bonded by Gorilla Glass and it could
basically replace a wall in a futuristic
home Corning says that you'd want
Gorilla Glass for this because of its
durable qualities because people are
going to be bouncing into it all the
time and that's a that's another reason
why they've been demonstrating things
like Gorilla Glass cupboard touchscreen
office table
she thinks could be used for
productivity software in offices and
again they think that the durable nature
of Gorilla Glass is important for this
because you know you're going to be
setting down coffee cups and so on so
yeah this is the first official day of
CES so stay tuned for a whole lot more
news from the show floor you can check
that out at the verge calm or
