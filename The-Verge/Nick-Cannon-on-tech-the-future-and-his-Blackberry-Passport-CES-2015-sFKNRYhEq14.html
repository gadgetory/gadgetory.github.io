we're here in the verge lounge talking
with the CES entertainment ambassador
Nick Cannon so Nick we've been here for
a couple of days you can give hope days
maybe the show so far shows outstanding
man I mean CES 2015 is just it's
different than any other year in my
opinion I've been here for you know
probably half a dozen times you know
over the past six or seven years and I
feel like the energy for 2015 is more
focused on enhancing your personal
experience so seeing that and everything
from wearables - you know driverless
cars you know it's like how can we make
your life better with technology and
that's kind of what I've been seeing
that's all you're wearing like a
wearable right now actually I don't have
one on right now like I said I my wife
watches it has a diamond conductor this
is this is different actually you know
the the wearable thing I have a few of
the obviously everything from Google
glass to the Samsung watch that connects
to the galaxy but I'm not really I
haven't found one that I can't live
without you so that world is it's it's
new to me I saw something really cool
that was it was an app connected to a
shirt to where you could change the
words on your t-shirt oh I thought that
was kind of dope I was like I would rock
that won't it soon I don't know it like
I got to have something different
everyday like you know going up on a
tuesday every dunno so your
entertainment ambassador so and you're
trying to have a connection with
Hollywood and the tech industry that's
the purpose of my ambassadorship very
firm it's it's really to make sure that
the world of entertainment and
Technology understand each other and
coexist and actually benefit from each
other I mean because you can't have one
without the other honestly but I think
it's more or less that the the
entertainment industries should
recognize all the
can get from partnering with a lot of
these tech companies and exploring the
tech space so we're having conversations
with these tech companies on the floor
and I mean I have it somewhat I mean you
know kind of I've been handling my
original business here that I've been
doing with you know from headphones to
my tablets and stuff kind of finding new
ways to licensure and market my own
company incredible but then you know as
the Ambassador they kind of seen things
on another scale as well with some of
these major companies that are doing
some phenomenal things like the
Samsung's in the Sony's and all of those
companies that have been doing it you
know before I was born
right okay so you've been making tablets
you're making headphones and you
obviously you're on the floor and like
checking out the business everything so
as a celebrity you're getting into the
space yeah and there's a big push on the
Hollywood sign and the artist side to
like look what is that like on the
creative side on the creative side I
mean is it it kind of I would say
simplifies the process of being creative
because all these tools have been placed
at our fingertips to allow us to create
content and connect with our fan base in
a much easier way than ever before I
mean you don't I mean there's people
getting rich off of you know YouTube and
vine
and Instagram post you know I mean it's
really interesting to where as an artist
how you can express yourself creatively
I mean I've seen you in the vine videos
like a king bathroom way yeah so like
all that is funny stuff well I would
think would be daunting like there's so
much out there yeah you got a pick and
choose right I mean I actually I'll be
honest I haven't jumped into the world
of snapchat yet right because I don't
really understand the benefit of it I
was like that's kind of wasting my time
of something make a video and it
disappears right
it's a more social man it's probably
snapping us right now yeah but then it
goes away right they'll never see this
ever again
it sounds like I don't understand that
disposable content concept especially if
I can't make any money off of it right
it was fun but only the people who saw
it in that 24 hours ever got to see it's
like a great story like man you should
have been there that's what the name of
the app should be called you should have
been named Wow I mean god it's been days
here yeah just trying to share these
stories with everybody yeah
personally I'm tired yeah it could take
a lot out of you man Las Vegas in
general particularly then you get into
this Convention Center in this space
with you know every company you could
ever imagine with new gadgets and it's
it could be system overload really
quickly so you got to pace yourself
right and I'm you're everywhere like you
were open and whatnot yeah yeah like
what is that like like I mean I think my
life is always constantly on the go from
DJ and last night I did a hosted a
couple of dinners
we got a few dinners tonight that I'm
speaking and you know being the
ambassador at the same time still trying
to be the businessman to sell my
products you know meeting with retailers
and Asda it's it's uh it's interesting
but I embrace it and I love it I mean I
always say my vocation is my vacation
and I was built to work
all right so as far as your art like and
your music nemesis and everything that
you do as far as producing and
television yeah you have a lot on your
plate like you have to be just
overloaded it's all one gig to me it's
not you know what I mean I don't see it
as a whole bunch of different things you
doing it's when you think of it it's
just like it's all based in that same
sense of providing content in different
ways and things that connect to the
content you know I mean when you think
of someone who runs a record label or a
movie studio you don't look to them to
say man you got so many artists or you
got so much it's more about you know
what is it that you're actually focus on
you focus on the company you know what I
mean you're not of course you got to
focus on the individual projects and
whatever movie you're making at that
time span or whatever artist you're
promoting at the time but the CEO of the
company runs the entire company on a
level so I kind of feel like that I just
see everything that I do is all the
different projects that fall up under
the umbrella of my incredible company
all right and like for me I've been
following the work since like all that
days thank you sir and I mean coming
from that period like doing it for years
yeah like how does that compare like
that time to now man I was I was telling
this to somebody else like you know I
was an 80s baby people were aware of me
in the 90s like I remember to connect
with your audience and like you could
dial a 976 number and get a message from
your favorite artists and it cost you a
dollar a minute but now it's like just
the connectivity of entertainers and
artists with their fanbase in the
community it's so much information out
there and there's so many ways to really
be close and really actually have a
different type of experience than who's
ever been presented to us before so I
think it's a
fabulist I'm in it to really be an
entertainer and to be an artist because
there's so many ways you can get your
art out there what's your favorite
memory from that time from that time oh
man I definitely have to say because you
know I started out in the game as more
of a behind-the-scenes dude a writer and
a producer helped him write and produce
a lot of those you know classic
Nickelodeon shows it was always really
fun because I was a kid I was a teenager
and to be able to be a part of that and
be treated like an adult and and then to
see what all that stuff flourished into
is outstanding and like what's happening
now like what do you admire most what do
you enjoy most right now I mired like
the growth of my company I mean that's
an easy end yeah yeah no but honestly I
say that not to sound like facetious or
anything but just the idea to say you
know it's the the pace that everything
is working and happening in
entertainment and tech and for me to
kind of be on the forefront of that and
be one of the first to say hey this is
what we really want to do and to say I
remember I was woke up one day I said I
want to make a tablet less than a year
later had a tablet right that's
outstanding I never thought anything
like anything like that could actually
ever happen it's kind of cool so talk
about like what you use like we talk
about phones everyday tablets every day
and like the Absinthe everything we do
like what's your basic for us I mean I
have all of that stuff you know
obviously but they're not me being a DJ
right you know I'm always figuring out
the the best way to rock a club on the
moment applejack just walked over there
a good friend of mine he's using the
pioneer see DJ's I'm still on turntables
they got I bought those the other day
just to see I wouldn't can I start just
walking into the club with a flash drive
instead of my laptop so long stuff like
that that's you know I'm always focused
on that cool stuff in the music space
and like what phony news I got them all
man literally all of them not all I got
three phones that I use i mean i have
the iphone 6 plus I got the Samsung
Galaxy 5 I got what's the BlackBerry
called the passport really yeah yeah I
like buttons
I got a button man mica on our staff
like he just loves the blackberries and
those physical keyboard I think that
ends the password just felt to be bit
yeah but it's not too much bigger than
other phones
it's just square yeah I liked it yeah
the cool screen has the buttons I use it
you know it's again like a device
there's something different for me if I
want to write like a really really long
email
I'll use my bike and it's just because I
can go the touchscreen emails I can't
stand that stuff all right in terms of
weirdness I'm gonna get a little weird
girls gets a little weird starting with
CES we've seen a couple of weird things
okay what are the weird things you've
seen here Wow ah that's always weird in
the space of Technology a weird in space
of just people walking around you can
pick and choose you know what I the
things that really intrigued me is
definitely some of the stuff like there
was this virtual program that kind of
took your whole face and was able to put
it anywhere and it kind of reminded me
of like that Total Recall Max Headroom
stuff uh that's kind of weird
you never like that's that's a little
scary yeah there's some lawnmower man um
that but then I mean honestly it's it's
a it's a city of innovative thinkers
that you got some interesting
I've been pitched quite a few
interesting concepts and investments
that you know somebody was trying to
pitch me a digital skin I don't even
understand what they were saying but it
sounded really weird like why would I
want my skin to be digital but uh hey
features old never know we are we
walking around here with digital skin so
I don't even know what that means
digital yeah they it's they have a way
to make your skin digital just like just
tapping just like I've seen things like
that projecting onto yours yeah yeah I
think that's I think was more but like
it's tattooing the day like I didn't
have enough time to understand what they
were talking about all right
and I mean we've gone on record like in
the past just like being in Vegas and
being in Vegas for years like this is on
my second year but Vegas can be
up yes just putting that out there
so basically like I was in a car the
other day and just like our driver was
like yeah man I've seen some things like
behind the green door things like weird
but what have you seen like just in this
town like I mean it's Vegas and you see
every Pig it's like it truly is what
happened is here most of the top tries
to stay here but you get out see a lot
of I mean I love this city but you see
just it's it's a lot of hustling going
on see a lot of people you know trying
to take advantage of tours and it's
unfortunate but you know it's the way of
the world too so I think it's one of the
greatest cities ever but you gotta be
careful out here definitely gotta be
careful all right so what's your
favorite thing going on right now in
life yeah my children yeah they have a
favorite thing ever but I mean obviously
