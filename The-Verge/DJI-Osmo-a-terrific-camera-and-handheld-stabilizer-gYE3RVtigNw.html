industry from Facebook to Instagram
snapchat to Flickr we love posting
pictures of ourselves
Pawel the selfie stick industry on its
own is a multi-billion dollar annual
business hey what is that this is my new
extending clip as the cameras in our
pockets get better and our mobile data
connections get stronger increasingly we
want to post video not just still images
the problem is the cameras in our
pockets are better but we're not better
camera operators that means most cell
phone videos end up looking like a shaky
mess DJI the Chinese startup best known
for making drones is trying to fix that
it's taken the technology that it used
to revolutionize aerial imaging and put
it into a handheld stabilizer called the
Osmo for $650 you get something that's
cheap and easy enough for the average
consumer to use but produced a
stabilized video that looks like it was
shot by a Hollywood professionals the
handle and camera the Osmo alone weigh
just half a pound it weighs a little bit
more when you put on the smartphone
mount your smartphone acts as your
viewfinder you connect it to the Osmo
through Wi-Fi and then you can use this
to see what you're shooting change your
camera settings review what you've found
the Osmo shoots 4k footage and 12
megapixel stills you can also do 120
frames per second slow-motion the
battery lasted about an hour an hour
testing the Osmo has a trigger on the
front and that lets you Center the
camera and toggle between modes you've
got your standard grip here your
flashlight and a grip where you can hold
it sort of underslung like this and of
course this being the ultimate selfie
stick the Osmo can point out and capture
what you're seeing or triple tap and
duck face we decided to take the Osmo
out and test it against your average
smartphone the hyperlapse app and the
professional gear that our video crew
uses we put the results side-by-side so
you can judge for yourself
after spending a few weeks at the Osmo
the question in my mind is still who
exactly is this product for is the
average consumer going to shell out
hundreds of dollars just to get a
perfect home video on the other hand are
professionals gonna choose the Osmo
because it's cheaper and more mobile
even though the video quality isn't
exactly up to what they're used to what
I can say for sure is after spending
some time with my Osmo it's gonna be
hard to go back to shooting video with
the phone in your pocket yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
