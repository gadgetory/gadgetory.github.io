portable laptop chances are you're
looking at a Mac Apple's laptops have
dominated the segment for so long it
seems like no one else is even trying
anymore but HP is trying to change that
narrative with a new Specter it's an
ultra light ultra thin premium Windows
10 laptop with an equally premium price
tag it's easy to compare the specter to
the macbook because it's so light and
thin but it's really like HP took the
best of what the macbook offers and
blended it with the best of what the
macbook air offers it weighs just under
two and a half pounds measures a scant
ten point four millimeters thick when
it's closed and it's a 13.3 inch display
with a full-size keyboard the HP is
selling this for 1169 to start but the
unit that I've been testing which has a
core i7 processor eight gigs of RAM and
256 gigs of storage cost 1249 the
specter is really striking to look at it
has a dark brown finish that stands out
from the sea of aluminum silver
computers it also has this really shiny
gold hinge catches your eye but it also
catches a ton of fingerprints which
means that it doesn't really look so
great after a few minutes of using it
the next thing you're going to notice
about the specter is that it doesn't
have a touch screen it doesn't detach
and it doesn't try to be anything more
than a traditional laptop the 1080p
screen isn't as high-res as you can get
on other computers but it's perfectly
sharp at this size my only real
complaint here is that the hinge doesn't
tilt back as far as I'd like it to which
makes it a little uncomfortable to use
when I'm standing at a desk the keyboard
is really nice to type on it's got well
spaced keys and much better travel than
Apple's MacBook the trackpad is also
really good too it's smooth and glassy
and tracks really nicely it's a little
small and feels cramped compared to
other computers with larger trackpads
like the MacBook The Spectre relies on
USBC for all of its connectivity but
unlike the MacBook HP gives you three
ports instead of one now two of these
support thunderbolt connections for fast
data transfer and all three handle power
definitely more convenient to have
multiple USB seaports and just one but
because USB C is still really new I have
to carry around a bunch of adapters to
plug anything into it
unlike the MacBook this vector has
Intel's more powerful chips inside so it
doesn't really get bogged down too
easily the core i7 chip and the one that
I've been testing has been able to
handle everything I throw at it whether
it's multitasking web browsing photo
editing or any other productivity tasks
you're definitely not gonna be gaming on
this machine but for productivity stuff
the specter definitely has enough
now unfortunately that performance
doesn't extend to its battery life the
spectra can last about five to six hours
between charges with my daily use which
isn't enough to last a full day and
definitely less than I can get with a
comparably spec MacBook hair the battery
life isn't so bad to be a deal breaker
but if you want the ultimate road
warrior machine the specter probably
isn't it the size of my complaint to the
battery life the specter is really an
excellent laptop it's really well-made
it looks great have lots of performance
and it's so thin and light that carrying
around everywhere isn't really burdened
Apple may still be the king of premium
laptops but HP is shown that it can play
this game too and as a result the
spectre is an excellent laptop talking
