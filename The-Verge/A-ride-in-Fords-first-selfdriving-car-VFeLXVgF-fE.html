here at Ford's product development
center in Dearborn Michigan checking out
Ford's approach to autonomous vehicles
the self-driving cars space has been
heating up in recent months as the
technology is moving at a rapid rate
in August Ford announced plans to bring
a fully autonomous vehicle to the market
by 2021 with level 4 autonomy level 4
autonomy is when cars don't have
steering wheels or brake pedals so for
the uses three electric magnetic sensors
inside of its autonomous vehicle
including valid Ines lidar a system that
uses lasers to create an overlay map and
detect objects around the car the next
generation of lidar will be introduced
this year to Ford self-driving car the
lighter will be more compact and will
enable cars to see further in the
distance and help with left-hand turns
Ford also uses radars and cameras to
understand the environment around the
car now in two years by 2018 Ford says
that it will be offering rides to its
employees around its campus using an
autonomous car and we're not entirely
sure whether these cars will have
drivers inside of them but one thing is
certain that is that Ford is working
very hard to ensure that they reach
their goal of level-4 autonomy by 2021
so what does this mean for the future of
transportation mark fields is the
president and CEO of Ford and he told me
that he thinks self-driving cars will
minimize crashes and make the use of
cars more efficient Ford is working with
regulators Google uber and other
automakers to figure out exactly what
autonomy looks like in about five years
it's very likely that self-driving cars
are going to be a very real
and the question is now are we really
ready to take our hands off of the wheel
