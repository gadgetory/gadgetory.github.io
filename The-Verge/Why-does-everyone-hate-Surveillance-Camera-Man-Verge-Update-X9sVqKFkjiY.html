just sitting in a park or you're walking
down the street or you're having a chat
with your friend outside a coffee shop
and suddenly someone walks up with a
camera and begins filming you
what are we doing here what is your
purpose
do it Oh taking a video
all the times taking videos I'm just
taking a video why why why why not why
not
slant um who are you doing
is there a difference between this and
all the other surveillance cameras on
our lives
is home effect are you along with this
this is the work of surveillance camera
an anonymous filmmaker in films people
without the permission can I help you
okay very very without explanation
beyond I'll take a video for me you're
in there
why huh why
he's been doing it since late 2012 and
as of October 2014 there have been 8
videos all of which have now been
removed by YouTube the first video he
makes elaborates on this mission after
filming this guy for a little bit he
explains will get this way here we go up
you ever go to the grocery store and
others like surveillance cameras
everywhere
yeah it's not a big deal just a video
the premise of his art or whatever you
want to call it is simple what you're
already being surveilled everywhere you
go anyway
so what's the difference I don't care
it's just a video I don't want on it
he's right cameras are everywhere every
atm most stores street corners nerf guns
we're starting to put them on police
officers in fact Barack Obama has just
pledged 75 million dollars to make sure
that police have cameras police also
have their own drones and let's not
forget all the cameras on consumer
drones New York City has about 4000
surveillance cameras Chicago has about
10,000 now think about every computer
every smartphone and every Smart Watch
they have cameras and then of course
there's Google glass a person wearing
Google glass would be getting almost the
same identical video as surveillance
camera man but our reactions to the two
are different rather than my own ours
there's actually sure yeah I'm shooting
there's something about glass that's
just more passive than surveillance
camera man but seeing someone actively
surveilling a fuck you with a camera
it's just well offensive oh oh fuck all
dude nice take a cop on top yeah lower
gravity won't fucking back up
so is surveillance cameraman a more
obvious reminder of the hundreds if not
thousands of other cameras filming us
each day whether or not these videos are
effective in delivering that concept is
still for debate
if you peruse the comment sections of
the reddit threads you'll see some
people praise him for the idea and can't
get enough while others say they
understand the message but that he's
really just exploiting people and making
them feel uncomfortable and I can see
where they're coming from there's
something about the videos it's just a
little Tom greeny how much does yours
get the hell away from me are you gonna
cheaper for me though let's go let's
come let's go you calm down Oh
motherfucker but he's capturing people
in a rare steak one I rarely ever see
pure raw unfiltered emotion and an
intense rage seemingly emanating from
some primitive part of the human brain
you get that camera out of my
motherfuckin face I swear to fucking
calm down people in surveillance camera
man's videos are for the most part mad
as hell as they should be it's an
invasion of privacy
it feels eerie and wrong but it's not
gonna be long before videos exactly like
this will be taken of you by you there
are actually a few restaurants in San
Francisco that have outright banned
Google glass for concerns about being
videotaped but for now it's still
novelty I guess if there's one thing
that you can glean from surveillance
camera man it's that we need to take
regulation extremely seriously
these cameras are creeping into our
lives and if we get complacent we won't
realize that somebody needs to say no
they're only gonna security
yeah out of my face I'm sucking away
from the camera and instead we'll just
say
I never had somebody take that much
interest in me before</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
