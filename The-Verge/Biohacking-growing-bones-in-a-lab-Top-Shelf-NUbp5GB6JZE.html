biology better it's breeding new kinds
of plants building prosthetics finding
ways to go beyond what our bodies can
let us do two years ago I tested this
for myself
I got a magnet implanted in my finger so
I can sense metal and motors and later I
added an NFC chip so I can read it with
my phone they've become part of my body
but homebrew implants can only do so
much so what's happening on the cutting
edge of biohacking
where people are changing nature in ways
we never thought possible
founded by two former Columbia
University researchers epi bone isn't
trying to add new tech to our bodies
it's trying to replace something the
pieces of bone that people lose because
of cancer accidents or congenital
defects and it's come up with a
completely new way to do it around the
time that interchangeable parts began to
be used on the assembly line we started
kind of to view the body in a similar
way if you needed a new heart you know
you might get one out of a person or
engineer a new one using technology but
the idea was let's replace body parts
but now we're really at this stage where
a lot of people think of the body as a
renewable resource of cells as opposed
to just a summation of parts and so lots
of groups around the world are dedicated
to growing different body parts so how
would you describe what you're doing
here where it's pretty simple to
describe we're growing bones from stem
cells we've grown human bone for years
we have not put this human bone in a
human yet we and we hope to do that next
year
for the first time what would it look
like actually if you have a bone problem
how would you get a bone grown so we
take two things from the patient the
first thing is we just take an image so
a CT scan will do that has
three-dimensional data that we can map
to digital fabrication devices we use 3d
printers and 3d micro milling machines
to mill a perfect shape bone scaffold
and a to machine a corresponding
bioreactor we also take a sample of fat
tissue from the patient and out of that
fat tissue we take the stem cells so we
put the stem cells into this bioreactor
with the scaffold and after three weeks
we have a piece of living bone that we
can then use in surgery so right now you
take a sort of segment of bone that
exists yeah use it as sort of a
structure to build the actual bone
around is that yeah or inside we're
using a D cellular eyes
bovine bone so a piece of cow bone we
strip it of all cellular material and
then reinstalled once we extract the
cells can take the CT of the patients
and design a graph that would perfectly
match the defects that we want to graphs
like this oh yes so you remove all those
cellular materials that is foreign for
the patient's then you live with with
just the structures and we reintroduce
the patient cells in there that actually
seems really conceptually simple oh
that's a key thing we we want to make
the process as simple as possible so
that eventually we can scale up so
that's why we have this by reactive
system that allow us to just put the
materials we need and put the cells in
set it up and let it grow
so if we're starting from a bone block
with no cells on it we can we're limited
by the begin the size of the starting
material but with 3d printers it's just
the size of the printer that's
delimiting exactly yeah and if you think
about like well there's a lot of people
that are working on making 3d printers
be able to print all kinds of things so
we're what we watch that with excitement
right now we can do 3d printing it's
it's a nice system that allow us to
create the exact structure but the
microarchitectures of the scaffolding
material is still very different from
the micro attic I can take you off the
bone the quality of it still hasn't
matched the native structures of the
bone so what makes this better than the
current procedures for transplanting a
bone um so right now if you transplant a
piece of bone it's from a cadaver
so either from a cadaver or from
yourself if it's from a cadaver you have
to kill the bone before you put it in
the body and so it's it's not alive and
it doesn't interact with what's there if
you cut a piece of bone out of yourself
it's alive and it can theoretically
connect pretty well with the host tissue
but then there are oftentimes mechanical
mismatches and the shape isn't perfect
and you have to have a second surgery so
after time our bone becomes more and
more integrated into the body wall the
alternatives become you know seen as
scar tissue so epi bone is working on
real world practical solutions to a
problem we've had for ages creative
studio New Deal design meanwhile thinks
cyborg bodies are coming so how will we
use them among other things New Deal has
worked on the design of the Fitbit light
rose light field camera and Google's
project ara phone this is gary and meet
the president and founder this is a
sketch rendering off the under skin
project this is essentially an implant
it has two nodes going under the skin
and that brings this provocative notion
of actually implanting things under the
skin and then how do we interact with it
what do you think is the kind
interaction that people would want to
have with these implanted devices like
what do you think they want to think of
them as it's a very distilled and
personal form of UI interaction with the
space around you or with other people
the other side will be more your
personal health and your personal
control panel some of the graphic user
interfaces is a little bit far-fetched
now but it could be could be there if
needed how do you convince people that's
not actually the scary thing that
they've seen in a bunch of movies where
you have tracking devices attached to
you you already see that there's so many
implants and so many technologies that
are coming you know replacing organs and
so on I think we don't like to discuss
it because of the creep factor of it but
it's right there you know people are
replacing joints replacing eyes it's
just around the corner so I'd rather
have a design opinion or even a debate
over it rather than living it only to
doctors and technologists because I do
feel that some of the humanistic
elements are missing from their
discussion topics but that's not to say
scientists aren't making any tangible
leaps you probably know Autodesk for its
architecture software but for the past
couple of years it's been working on
something called project cyborg a design
platform for biology research on a
molecular scale and synthetic biologist
Andrew Hessel a distinguished researcher
at Autodesk thinks that's just the start
in fact he even thinks he can use these
tools to treat cancer so this is a model
of Autodesk's first synthetic virus Phi
X 174 it's a virus that kills ecoli
bacteria you can think of it as an
antibiotic so this is a 3d printed model
of that virus and wherever there's a
different color it's a different protein
but you can see that there's repeating
patterns when the virus infects an e
coli cell the genetic material goes into
the e coli and it starts to produce
these proteins which then goes to
produce these part of
and it kills the e.coli cell and make so
many of these particles it splits the
the coli open what's really significant
as we demonstrate that the digital
infrastructure for synthetic biology is
now so accessible and so capable that we
can start to make these agents really
fast and really cheap you know one thing
I thought was really interesting that I
saw was the sort of open source cancer
curing projects that you were working on
at one point what was sort of the idea
behind that your cancer can now be
studied to the molecular level and a
custom-designed drug being manufactured
in a very short period of time and
tested on your own cancer cells in a
laboratory and you can score engage the
results of that it was just estimated a
few weeks ago that it's costing upwards
of two billion dollars now to research
and develop and bring to market a new
drug that's just not sustainable
especially when it can take 15 years to
make a new dress well how do you hack
that system how do you change global
pharma and I realized well you can do it
if you stop making mass-market drugs
because the longest and most expensive
part of developing a drug is going
through phase clinical trials so if you
make a drug for just one person
you kind of get around that your cancer
is different than anyone elses not only
will your experience in being treated be
differently but you need a unique drug I
was fascinated by something called an
uncle it acquires which are viruses
really weak viruses that can only infect
cancer cells they can't infect normal
cells because they're too weak but they
can kind of get an in on the cancer cell
start to grow kind of giving a cancer
cell a cold break the cancer cell open
and actually release more viruses that
could go on and infect other cancer
cells so the idea of synthetic biology
to make uncle it advises done in an open
framework you can engage lots of
researchers and kind of build on their
experience and do it for just one person
at a time one of the most compelling
cases was published earlier this year by
the Mayo Clinic where they treated two
people with resistant multiple myeloma
with a measles virus they demonstrated
in both pace
that the measles virus targeted the
cancer selectively that's great in one
patient they had full remission of the
cancer with a single treatment of
measles virus so going from really an
end-stage resistant cancer to being
cancer-free is about as miraculous a
result as you could expect it could be
years before 3d printed viruses or a
standard cancer treatment or our bones
are grown in tubes our health sensors
are built into us if it ever happens but
these are only a few of the things that
people are doing to try to change our
very bodies to fix us or make us better
and in a few years who knows what's
going to happen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
