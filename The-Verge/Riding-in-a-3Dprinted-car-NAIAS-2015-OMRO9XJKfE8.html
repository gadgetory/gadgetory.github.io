standing in front of the local motors
straddie
now this is a 3d printed car
almost everything you see here comes out
of a machine that extrudes plastic there
are a few components that they add on at
the end but by and large this thing
comes out of the plastic tube and
they're actually building one right here
at the Detroit Auto Show this model is a
prototype basically these things aren't
on the streets yet and then I can be
available for purchase for another
twelve eighteen months they're gonna
come out of what they call a micro
factory which is a little tiny space
where they have the 3d printer in
Washington DC or just outside Washington
DC so there's a sort of prototype
drivetrain here it only gets 40 to 60
miles on a charge that's gonna change by
the time of chips the batteries are back
here behind the driver and passenger
comfortably seats to it wasn't any
problem to get in or out it kind of
looks weird to get in and out but it
actually isn't bad at all driving around
in this feels icing only like a regular
car granted it's very low to the ground
and relatively small and the the
windshield is you can tell a little bit
low so it's kind of more of a go-kart
but a very comfortable go party it's
quiet it's all electric I don't know if
I'd want to take it out on the street
but if you did and got into a fender
bender just 3d print yourself new park</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
