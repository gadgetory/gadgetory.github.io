market every year we think that pumpkins
can't get any better and we can't refine
what it is we do anymore
and every year you know the pumpkins
keep getting better and better we're
here at the Brooklyn based pop-up shop
of maniac pumpkin carvers founded by
Chris Soria and Marc Evan it started as
a hobby but after a huge order from the
New York Yankees this seasonal business
took off we've recruited a handful of
other artists that were friends with if
you can draw on paint you could probably
carve pumpkins
I mean we're carving sometimes 50
hundred plus pumpkins within a 24 hour
window so why do you think brands are so
attracted to like promoting through
pumpkin Halloween is one of the biggest
holidays in the u.s. so it's a good
go-to for advertisers we did a time
lapse for Jack Daniel's we've done a
time lapse for Disney some of the more
individual personal requests will be a
lot of signage we've been getting like a
lot of will you marry me pumpkins but my
favorite thing to do is carve live and
sometimes we carve humongous pumpkins
and last time we did a really cool piece
where it said Luna Park and we cut
pieces out of other pumpkins and then
attached it to the big pumpkin so it
looks like the tentacles are like
bursting through the pumpkin and we've
actually shown our pumpkin four years in
a row MoMA we've done van Gogh's Starry
Night one of Matisse's cutouts
Magritte's treachery of images and I'd
watch the screen so we're dealing with
pop culture but we also are really
interested in elevating the art of
pumpkin carving itself we also get a lot
of portrait requests which is one of the
more difficult things to capture in a
pumpkin you're not just capturing the
image it has to look like that person
you're really trying to create a
likeness so could we try a virtual ogo
maybe we could like Halloween Halloween
Halloween it up a little bit yeah
add some bats make it a little spooky a
lot of these tools you can get them at
any arts and crafts stores and they're
usually used for other things so like
China markers for drawing out your
design linoleum cutters ribbon loops an
exacto knife paring knives and the only
thing we really use that's
specifically a pumpkin tool is the
pumpkin scooper the technique and method
that we're using is subtractive so it's
almost counterintuitive like deeper you
go the more light you're bringing out
and so what happens if like you make a
mistake on a pumpkin you just have to
like throw the pumpkin out and start
over there are ways to save pumpkin
that's kind of going the wrong direction
every once in a while it's passed the
point of no return and we have to toss
it actually what may happen more
frequently than that is our typos so how
long does it normally take it's like
you're doing a pumpkin this size if
you're doing like a logo I guess a logo
a magic about an hour and a half and how
much would a face take a face could take
four plus hours so we actually cut the
back out not the top it's very little
you could do to preserve the pumpkin
there's like techniques that people talk
about like putting Vaseline on the cut
areas or like spraying it with lemon
juice but the best thing to do is put a
creek just the best way to preserve it
just take a picture yeah the light that
we use it definitely punches through the
pulp better than candles and it also
eliminates the need for fire up until
now I've been just kind of guessing and
carving the different depths that I
think the values show up in but now that
the lights in I could see all like the
linocut strokes and everything and on a
macro level it's almost like landscaping
now you got all the techniques and you
can win all the pumpkin carving
competitions because it's not really
fair for us to enter them anymore you're
like so good it's like rude it's not
cool we judged them now the spirit of
Halloween should be like celebrated with
everybody you don't have to be a
professional artist to enjoy pumpkin
carving and everybody should do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
