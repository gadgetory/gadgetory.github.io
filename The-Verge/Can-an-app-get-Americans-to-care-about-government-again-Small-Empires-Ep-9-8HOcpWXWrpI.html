inside of this massive marble structure
all the laws the United States of
America are created now the current
Congress is known as the do-nothing
Congress they haven't been doing a lot
of that in fact their approval ratings
are abysmally low thirteen percent and
they are among the least productive of
all Congress's in recent history but
it's an opportunity for a company called
Capitol belts to actually bring
transparency choose a process to allow
our representatives to get real-time
feedback from their constituents about
the bills they're about to vote on and
perhaps actually make this
representative government we have even
more representative of the very people
who make it possible I'm Alexis Ohanian
start-up founder and Y Combinator
partner over the last year I went on a
two hundred event book tour and met
people building small empires all across
North America now I'm back with a new
season revisiting some of my favorite
stops for their tour government has
never moved quickly it's designed to be
a slow process they'll be much debate
and consider decisions but in the past
few years the American public has become
increasingly dissatisfied with the way
Capitol Hill's they're behaving
especially in the wake of one of the
least productive Congress in recent
history this inefficiency and lack of
action is something a lot of people
would view one company's capital bells
is taking a novel approach by alerting
constituents whenever a congress person
is going to deliberate on a bill and
letting those constituents give their
thoughts directly to the congress person
by means of a vote Capitol bells is
trying to use technology to make the
centuries-old processes and hungers more
responsive to the needs of space America
I am Ted Henderson I'm the founder of
capital bells what use capital bells for
Congress repealed work in Congress
Capitol bells is an app that helps them
do their jobs better for constituents
for um a capital bells is an app to
share our positions and to connect to
Congress it's a modern version of the
real life Capitol bells that have
alerted Congress to votes since 1890 so
you've got sensors around DC that are
picking up the signals coming out of the
Capitol building right identifying it
and then bouncing it right back in
real-time to everyone's phone who's got
the app right how did you get this
system installed I was a staffer for a
congressman Kildee
as soon as I was off the hill I realized
I didn't even know when votes were
happening I was just in down time I was
like all right well I'm gonna apply to
my next legislative assistant position
and you know while I'm you know not
doing anything all make an app in the
mean time and so I called up the clerk's
office and it's like where can I find
the API for the bells and they say
what's an API
it makes the vote alerts happen who
makes the bells buzz we go welp there
are these radio-controlled clocks and so
when is the button and all the clocks
will will buzz when they get the signal
like alright great
you know what's the frequency how do we
get going why hadn't anyone done this
sooner it seems pretty obvious I think
of part of is just that most of people
on Capitol Hill aren't engineers like I
am their local science majors and
English majors and it's a analog
community we have here on Capitol Hill
and you know it's been working this way
for a long time there's a lot of sort of
institutional inertia and things don't
change and that's why we kind of we have
a chance to do so much here they're not
taking advantage of modern technology at
all it's almost even gone worse now
because you know while we do have email
email has actually stopped us from one
thing that did work in 1980 which was
working together face to face in Spain
time together why is it important that a
member of Congress can now see not only
hey there's this vote happening but also
here's how my constituents feel about it
well if they can't see how their
constituents feel about it what are they
basing their votes on aren't they
representatives what's the plan for
Capitol balls is a business there are
over 300 million people in the US who
need to have their voices heard there
aren't being heard and if we can capture
Congress we have the the conduit to
connect them to Commerce Capitol bells
is clearly onto something and it is
important what is less clear is whether
this is just a cool project or can grow
into being a big business now plenty of
big businesses started out as cool
projects look at Facebook but the
challenge here for Ted and his team is
continuing to maintain this platform's
authenticity while also turning it into
a profitable business what does the
technology like capital bells do to
change the way business gets done here
it makes the operation of Congress more
transparent right you know what's going
on all the time the for capital belt
believe it or not which is we're talking
with like three years ago
when I wanted to know if a bill is being
voted on I had to literally call
somebody a congressional office and say
hey Wendy of voting on the bill it
doesn't seem very efficient it doesn't
know it will not
not efficient but also like unlucky I
know who to call
but now anybody across the country can
see when a bill is coming up that can
see what the history of that bill is and
then it's very easy for them to take
action how can the government be so
disconnected at a time when technology
is playing such a vital role in every
facet of our life part of it is a
generational thing you know the
congressional offices are older are over
our shoulder and most of the people in
there they're older people number two I
think a lot of the innovation that's
going on is is if you're not looking for
it you don't see it entrepreneurs don't
have the time to be up kind of walking
around Capitol Hill and talking about
what they're doing so you actually have
a situation where there are people in
office with power who are totally
disconnected from how the world is
technologically is there a solution for
this because it seems to be a pretty
fundamental issue I think the technology
is disrupting everything every industry
and government is one of those
industries but I do think if you look
out into the future you see a whole
series of tools that will enable your
average voter to become much more
educated about the issue and to organize
with like-minded voters and then to hold
their representatives accountable and I
think that is going to lead to a better
more effective government the way the
federal government does procurement and
does IT is just generally not very
efficient
how do you go about bringing technology
into an industry like government that
has generally been really reluctant to
government and technology have very
different logics and operating
principles government is supposed to be
slow and deliberate injudicious
technology is about in many ways
disruption innovation and a very quick
pace and so what I've seen for my time
working on the hill and the executive
branch and out the open gov foundation
is the difficulty really is sinking up
this the pace at which things move our
mission is to make government
accountable accessible and
understandable to citizens using
technology right now your government is
making new laws new taxes new rules that
directly impact your life did you have a
say in shaping them why should
government be accountable to its
citizens right I as a citizen it's
really easy to feel disenfranchised from
it all the government stems of the
people by the people and it's supposed
to work for the people and that all adds
up to accountability it was baked into
our Constitution and it it's hard to
find around here sometimes today so
there's a lot of talk about opening up
the data within government but there is
a big difference between taking laws for
instance that are currently in a dead
tree book right and turning them into
PDFs versus turning them into machine
readable data can you talk about that a
little bit for many the PDF is the
apotheosis of internet-based document
technology it works but it doesn't work
as well as it could explaining the value
proposition behind open data and all the
things that it can do with you is the
first place to start and I think that
the technology community has not done a
good enough job telling that story like
we can help you government people do
your jobs for citizens way more
efficiently and effectively at lower
cost with open data and open source
software what do you think of a modern
internet tool like Capitol bells
I love Capitol bells I think it's a
great hack in the the original sense of
the term looking at an internal system
like the house radio system for votes
and getting that very very tiny in the
grand scheme of things data point at
to your mobile phone and attach to all
of this other information that's
available about what Congress is doing
is brilliant I high-five Ted every time
I see him what's what's been the biggest
challenge so far you know you're you're
starting a start-up that is working with
the government that's usually an
industry that does not rank very high on
the list of industries startup founders
are excited to work in this isn't
something that's sexy to most you know
people in Silicon Valley and to
developers and to that word show and you
know one of the hardest things for me
has actually just been you know finding
technical people to work with you know I
came so you know we've we've raised
money now and you know it's still
difficult to find good engineers to
actually you know get applicants to find
you want to you want to be on the
founding team of capital bells how do
you go about thinking about building us
into it
big-time business I want capital bells
to be where the data is so I want to be
able to say here's what's happening
right now
here's what's happening Congress here so
typing your state capital here's what's
happening in two agencies here's the
data of government here's what your
government is doing for you right now
and here's the metadata of you know what
those people are doing and what these
people are thinking a government that is
by the people and for the people should
be open and transparent with its data
that data belongs to us after all the
three hundred years ago in this country
was getting started it was a lot harder
to spread ideas there are only so many
quilt hens and horses to go around but
today because of technology like the
internet and software it's a lot easier
in fact the thing that's holding us back
today isn't the technology it's the
rules rules that have been in place for
centuries that keep us from going
forward
you look at a place like this that has
gobs of money that has lots of power and
influence well why doesn't have the best
tools to do its job their rules barriers
they're up here of people that make laws
love to make rules and the body is
governed by Technology rules and
Technology infrastructure that are out
of date and so things like open-source
software it's not clear if you can even
use it here and that was actually one of
the main reasons that we left the hill
we have to get the heck out of Dodge and
create this in an infrastructure outside
of government it's because there are
rules that straight-up prevent really
cool innovative stuff from happening
inside the walls of government I think
in the ideal world we stay and we
improve the institution from the inside
but right now
we have to do some work to change those
rules and make the house open-source
friendly just like the white house down
the street can enough people using an
online platform be enough of a force if
they all say yes we want this bill to
motivate someone on the hill to be the
first one to say all right I'm gonna get
behind this cuz it normally seems like
they're just looking to their peers
around the hillford for that first step
well members of Congress have hacked
because people ask that's part of it
many of them bring their own agenda they
might read what's in the papers but if
people ask Congress will act and that's
really what it comes down to this is
another opportunity to give Congress an
idea of what the people are asking for
what does the average citizen get wrong
about Lobby they assume that money buys
action that special interest control the
agenda and control the vote that's not
how it works it's not how it works
you're not gonna get access with your
dollars you're not gonna change white to
black or yes to no but you are gonna be
able to support the people who support
your thought so that will give you the
opportunity what money does is gives you
a seat at the table what we're able to
do electronically through Capitol bells
is give average citizens a seat at the
table with all the things you'd be doing
giving your experience and everything
why Capitol
well one of the things that I missed
most about the time that I was on the
hill is working together with my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle I
hope that Capitol bells will provide an
opportunity for members and staff to
communicate with each other in ways that
they haven't done three years there's a
lot of information on the street these
days a lot of it free but there's very
little communication and what good could
Capitol bells do by connecting these
people I think they'll be able to do
their jobs better I mean they really
need the exchange of information there
is not that much discourse that goes on
between members members of here from
Tuesday to Thursday they don't make
Washington their home anymore and as a
consequence even the staffers don't have
the kind of relationships that they had
within their party or across party lines
for as long as there's been voting there
has been voter fraud and for all the
advantages of software that make it
possible for people to have their voices
heard from all over the world also let
people fake voices from all over the
world plenty of social platforms can
wait and so much later to deal with it
look at things like Instagram and
Twitter that are right with fake
accounts Capitol bells is not one of
them they need to have 100 percent
authenticity from jump they're not a
hundred percent authentic those
representatives aren't going to trust
those votes because they're not coming
from their constituents they could be
coming from anywhere Sam a senator from
New York and I see that there is a bill
that's come up and I can see on Capitol
bells how my constituents believe I
should vote on it how do I know that
they're actually my constituents
constituent Ally's right now is based
off of emails and calls that they
receive so you can call a congressman's
office and say hey I'm so-and-so and I
live at such-and-such address and here's
my opinion but they don't really know if
that person's coming from the place that
they are you know we have an online
system
a web-based system that's you know open
and it's covered all districts you know
we can actually track which districts a
user is voting from yeah we can you know
see are they are they just trying to hop
around a whole bunch if you start trying
to vote in different places we can see
that you've switched multiple times and
it looks like you're gaming it and we
can basically you know give your Wang
hey you know you've changed your
location three times in the past three
months you really have to make sure that
you get your address right or else you
know you're not gonna change anymore
right now your votes gonna get wasted
with capital bells the most important
thing that it does is it tells you
what's happening on floor it tells us
that we're in session
it shows us the bills are going on right
now that they're considering and it
gives us a play-by-play of you know what
has been happening on the floor so seven
minutes ago they've just begun forty
minutes of debate just suspend the rules
and pass this bill HR 492 for I think
it's really interesting now with
technology you know every staffer is on
her iPhone
checking media they can they can see how
much people like the photo they took of
their lunch wouldn't it be interesting
if they could get a sense for how people
are feeling about a bill it would help
the wildfire of what goes on a 24-hour
news cycles every crevice needs to be
filled with information that's part of
why we're trying to lend some some text
textual nature to it so that there is
you know some quality to that discourse
you make sure some Canadian doesn't fire
up this app and try to have her voice
heard on Capitol bells well currently
you can only download it from the United
States App Store
how do you then make sure that the you
know good congressman from the state or
whatever knows that every one of those
votes is coming from a constituent
instead of some sneaky Canadian
I guess I don't all right fair enough
what was there anything where to go that
surprised you going into this every time
that I think that I'm on the cusp of
something new that horizon just kind of
gets farther and farther away like it's
a it's a constant struggle you have to
constantly push it together to the next
level why do you do what you do are you
jumping out of bed because you love
bringing data to the world from from the
bowels of government I get out of bed
every morning trying to give people a
voice and what happens in their
government whether it's at a state a
county local or a federal level there
are so many people in this country who
are brilliant who have good ideas who
are crying out for government to meet
their needs that they should be that
aren't heard because they aren't rich
they don't have lobbyists they don't
have an influence and they don't get
through and where technology comes into
that is it makes government
fundamentally able to listen I do think
if you look out into the future you see
a whole series of tools that will enable
your average voter to become much more
educated about the issues and to
organize with like-minded voters and
then to hold their representatives
accountable and I think that is going to
lead to a better more effective
government awesome
I'm hoping for it because we are their
bosses me my vision for Capitol bells is
that we have tools that don't just let
constituents say hey here's what I'm
voting on but you know allow you know
you and me be able to form into a group
and say hey like we want to share our
votes together we want to we want to
bring strength in numbers to an issue
and like I know that Alexis you know
you're like really like on the ball with
Internet policy and I want to make sure
that we're all following you all that
policy and you know we can make sure
that you know it's not just my voice or
your voice as all our voices we don't
know for sure if Capitol bells or some
other service is necessarily gonna fix
government but at the very least we need
to try anything that helps our
representatives be more accountable to
their constituents is a major success so
to that end ring the bell and cross your
fingers and hope for a better more
responsive government of the future
marketing your business is already in
the central part of being successful but
the marketplaces move far beyond
