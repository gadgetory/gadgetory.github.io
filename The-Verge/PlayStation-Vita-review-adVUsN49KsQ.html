the PlayStation Vita Sony's latest
dedicated gaming portable in a large
step forward evolutionary from its
previous playstation portable now
compared to the PSP he was actually
obviously larger about 23% overall and a
good bit heavier - it's nothing too bad
though I mean taking it on its own its
hefty but it's not too bad it is just
however just big enough to make you
think twice about carrying in your
pocket a nice thing compared to the PSP
the d-pad and face buttons are actually
smaller but they're noticeably snappier
I did over the L and R button thankfully
the Vita also swaps out the single
analog nub you've got here for something
actually usable these dual analog
joysticks it's not quite as comfortable
as a PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360
controller but it does get pretty close
which is actually impressive for a
portable console I could actually see
myself playing shears and racers on this
for many hours at a time
the display is probably Vitas greatest
asset Sony's opted for a 5-inch OLED
screen there's some seriously impressive
viewing angles and colors it's also got
a capacitive multi-touch screen it's
useful for obviously for controls here
in the video and also handful of games
menus and of course an on-screen
keyboard now what's unique to the Vita
itself is this rear touchpad in the back
unfortunately though there aren't a lot
of launch games to support it and even
then I haven't actually found a game
that does it well some of the launch
titles like FIFA and little deviants
basically what they can do is required
you know exactly where you're pushing
without being able to see it's imprecise
and you'll pardon the pun it takes some
time to get feel for where exactly you
are both the front and the rear cameras
are VGA and while there is a camera app
I really really wouldn't recommend using
it everything came out pretty muddled
the big reason is the cameras is
augmented reality apps
and guy which isn't available at launch
but it should be coming pretty soon
after now inside the system there is a
quad-core arm cortex a9 processor a
dedicated graphics processor and five
launched games like Uncharted and
wipeout gorgeous and smooth but one
thing worth noticing is uh this is a
launch title and like most launched
hauls for any system load times have
become something of an issue something
worth keeping mind for actually going to
use it for a portable system you're
going to be waiting a lot while if you
have a short commute this probably isn't
something you're gonna be able to use
and a little time you have so
graphically the gain especially on the
launch trials I can try and wipe out
look really good this is absolutely
gorgeous the frame rate is great the one
thing though for most people there would
be enough like there's enough higher-end
iPad and Android games that look
comparable in graphics if you are that
kind of video file obviously this is
going to be something you really strive
to get you're definitely knows the
difference I get the feeling a lot of
people aren't going to care enough with
the graphical difference between this
and a game like dead space for iPad and
Android so the veto S is actually a
brand new platform for zoning and it's
clearly inspired by smart phones for the
most part that's actually a good thing
the whole interface is actually
different by touch with one exception
you can't use buttons at all you'll
notice the theme background is changing
we'll get to that a second icons just
like most smartphones you can hold down
and you can kind of move them around if
you want panel by panel too you can
change the theme make this gray if I
wanted or alternatively I can use photos
it's pretty intuitive if I swipe right
from any of the windows what I'll do is
I'll actually get the last app I open
this is the live area basically gives
all the information I want I can
continue the game from where I was I can
go to the special website basically
anything the developer wants they can
add to the live area if I press the PS
button what I'll get is six of the last
apps I open just going to give you an
idea of where I've been in a person
videos will take you straight to the
relevant content
honestly this task switching right here
is probably on par with like even the
latest Android Windows Phone certainly
iPhone but Sony's guy here is actually a
very quick system the one knock I'm
going to have against it is that it's
well frankly it's pretty ugly I mean
this is this is a very odd and bizarre
and kind of gimmicky interface as you
can see to delete apps you actually roll
it off I'm sure a lot of people will
like that it just feels really weird to
me aesthetically very unappealing but
it's also very efficient and very snappy
so beyond gaming Sony's added a bunch of
apps here most of them though are like
social lead about the same thing
party friends group messaging or for
getting a hold of other PS and Friends
trophies you can look at your PSN
account
near is the newest one what you can do
is near as in your social app which
ideally will show you other Vita users
you've passed by or are in your area
when you've checked your location and
you kind of get a feel for who's around
you it's a cute app it's a kid app but
it's nothing you're really going to care
about network operators you can use if
you have the AT&amp;amp;T 3G account you
obviously your music you get your videos
remote play is the same thing you got
from PSP there's not a lot of
improvement on that one it's still
fairly low resolution compared to what
screen you have here but you can use
remote play to basically play your
PlayStation 3 off the TV web browser is
functional enough but not something I
recommend using day to day it's worth
noting that it doesn't support flash and
as of launch if I have the game running
at the same time if I try to go back to
the browser it's going to make me close
and you game I'm playing now Sony did
say that they're going to change that
Sony's update the PlayStation Store to
make it very touch friendly almost to a
fault same you got your featured got
your new releases which obviously is not
a lot what's interesting of course is
for this time unlike with PSP at launch
any of the games you can get in cards
more or less are available on the
PlayStation Store you can go ahead and
download without disk as you can see a
lot of them are going to be cheaper than
the kart version themselves that's
interesting of course at launch you can
get a lot of the PSP games you can
download these there's no way to do cart
conversions if you have PSP games right
now
you're going to have to probably rebuy
and download so he's offering a number
of them they said more going to be
coming slowly trickling out but you do
have a pretty good list at launch and
this is just the p2 s right here so for
the PlayStation Store you can get the
minis which Tony's been pushing pretty
heavily download videos you're looking
Media PlayStation Vita games is actually
kind of interesting
all these launch titles Sony's actually
offering as both physical media and both
downloadable the downloadable titles are
actually cheaper even though it's softer
the same thing it's actually nice little
trend we kind of hope it continues now
if you're gonna get physical media the
one thing I noticed is the cases are
actually much smaller than pretty much
anything else out there except for the
DS but I like the DS games when you open
it up it's a laughably small
card it kind of bears wondering why you
have a case as big this meter cartridge
is more or less exact same size than SD
SDHC those kind of cards obviously
capacities pretty well it's pretty
snappy and it's which you have to use
revita
it's one of those things you would be
very happy that you have a small case on
the bookshelf in the year going to be
very sad when you open it up and realize
there's nothing in here alas there is no
eternal storage and memory cards are
sold separately basically I'd say spring
much requirement to buy one of these at
launch even though they don't come
bundled which is all frankly it's kind
of a shame problem so not only do you
need this for downloading and saving but
most video games will actually require
storage so in some way shape or form
you're going any internal storage there
is none for the Vita and you're going to
have to buy Sony's discs because this is
a brand new proprietary memory card
prices of course range from $19.99 for
four gigs going all the way up to a
whopping $99.99 for a 32 gig card on top
of the memory cards the system itself
costs $249 for the Wi-Fi model or 299 if
you want 3G capabilities that said you
won't be able to download files larger
than 20 Meg's which rules out pretty
much any game on the PlayStation Store
and you also can't do multiplayer over
3G which basically leaves the
functionality to a few social apps and
updates and maybe a little bit
downloadable content look if you're
looking to use the plumie des outside of
Wi-Fi clouds
I'd recommend get something more
versatile like a mobile hotspot and pay
the little extra money go ahead and get
the Wi-Fi model what it ultimately comes
down to is investment the Vita is a
brand new platform the games are all
going to get better from here on out and
already you're getting access pretty
large backlog of quality PSP titles not
to mention the collection on launch game
site isn't too bad for PSP owners and
fans of Sony's franchises the Vita is
kind of a no-brainer the PlayStation
Vita is hands down the most powerful
gaming console ever often performance
that aspires to this generations home
console market and while yes its size
and battery life makes it less suitable
for portable gaming on the go those
looking for the latest and greatest will
not be disappointed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
