Congress 1999 Nokia is announcing a
brand new third 3:10 again and his big
highlight is the game snake again so
being responsible journalists that we
are the first thing we did here at MWC
2017 let's come over here to play snake
all over again I just let me tape as
Nokia 3310 itself it's a really cute
really cool phone it isn't identical to
the original 3310 but I'm not sure that
everybody wanted an identical phone it's
nice to have it as a throwback the first
thing I notice is this isn't the classic
Nokia snake which I think we all know is
that I'm buried and never going to come
back again I guess it has a whole bunch
of I don't know if it it feels more like
remix of snake I mean this is survival
horror game where you're a snake eating
apples but going through the levels and
stuff and kind of runs counter to the
whole idea of the third free time being
a return to the dumb slash feature phone
experience because the thing that makes
the 3310 so popular today is that it
doesn't have all the smart features
right so I would rather just have a
monochrome snake
without any of these graphics without
any of these simulated levels and walls
and things out there I must say the
apples on screen actually really cool
because they're really pixelated in a
cool way
and maybe there's just a nostalgia
speaking I think there's going to be a
lot of the staff speaking around these
very temples which is just super basic I
mean everybody could make these but the
fact that they're not ears and their
code nook is just invoke so many
memories for people I mean so many
people would have grown up just texting
and calling and playing snake under 3310
and the big powerup in this game is the
scissors which slow you down and cut you
which in this game weirdly enough is
good thing
so this survival mode actually the one
that feels most faithful to the original
snake even though it looks so different
and it doesn't work the same way it does
the general thing of accelerating speed
and increasing your length as you go
along
did you try to spice it up with these
extra explosions and things showing up
on the screen but the biggest threat to
your survival is generally yourself but
you know I'm actually enjoying this I
forget all those extra levels and you
know 10-second run throughs I don't care
for them but just a classic survival
mode with the silly power-ups and bombs
that you supposed to avoid and things I
like it
you know this third free tank can do
other things besides just playing snake
it has a calculator
and it works as a camera that's actually
quite terrible but it's all for in a
nice way in that you always know it's
been taken with your 3310 so you can
think of it as like a signature filter
and as a V powerup which does oh it's
like a magnet for apples
as cool
for the lazy apple devour out there
I need those scissors to survive there
we go
so honestly if I have any reservation
about snake this version of snake it is
the whole idea that oh crap they've just
putting up walls and things is this
whole idea that you have to cut yourself
to keep going it's just not really good
life advice I have to say don't run
around chasing diseases guy's not even
snake
so obviously this isn't the snake that
we all loved and grew up with is
different it's more colorful it's fatter
it takes corners in different ways but
still just like the 3310 it's just silly
and fun and just extremely hard not to
like or even love it's a bit of
nostalgia and at a show like MWC where
it's all future talk it's all 5g and
metal devices and super fast processors
and etc and fast screens it's nice to
just have something or wouldn't familiar
