some things to say about a TMT I figured
this way instead of looking silly and
talking to myself I will use their ad
approach hey kids is it benefit your
network to be crap or is it better to
have a good LTE high-speed network in
New York do you really think the
question you want to hear is hey Billy
what's what's better bigger or smaller
it's a lot of say and not a lot to do
and we'll have a little fun now I'm
gonna give you as many facts as I can so
pain points first time I got together
with as many customers as possible and
they said here's what we hate I don't
want you to lose sight of this list
because this list still is the way most
carriers do business binding contracts
fusing rate plans and Bill's high device
prices by the way when we started device
choices in device upgrade restriction
and I'm gonna dispel some misnomers as
to what's happening with t-mobile it's
not this device and I'll give you some
stats it's this concept it's the no
contract it's what we're going to
announce today we threw out annual
service contracts if the way you want to
respond to this tactic is to say no
there's a contract on the device it's
not really good go for it it's
if we suck just leave us no contract was
huge is huge will be huge we are going
to redefine a stupid broken arrogant
industry hopefully it digested quickly
from John that what we're about at
t-mobile we are shaking up the industry
dramatic changes upon us and I want to
talk about the dramatic change we're
delivering on the network front so we've
been really working hard last 18 months
modernizing our electronics adding
capacity adding HSPA in a new spectrum
band for HSPA for t-mobile in nineteen
hundred megahertz this reforming thing
we've talked about we have a big growing
4G network
so for my team out there you guys Rock
okay you guys are awesome here's my
theory oh it's really an
abbreviation
it's short for oh I'm tied into an
F in contract and I kick it out for two
years and I'm gonna hold that toilet
written phone to my head for the next
two years
nananana today I'm announcing a totally
revolutionary phone upgrade program and
it's called jump protection against
everything that could possibly go wrong
protection against it being possessed
against it walking off against it
breaking in half or taking a swim or
most amazingly and most interestingly
protection against you just don't want
it anymore
I want to turn our attention to another
big announcement that we're making today
simple choice for all families no credit
checks now I got one more thing to say
and it's a quick one but an important
one and that is that we are delighted to
starting next Wednesday become the
exclusive launch partner of the Sony
Xperia Z's my final comic to you is this
is going to continue this is uncarrier
phase 2 what I want you to know and and
this should you know drive a bit of fear
into the industry we already know
uncarrier phase 3 and we know when it's
coming and it's not that far away so
I'll leave you with this little teaser
as to what's going on and what's coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
