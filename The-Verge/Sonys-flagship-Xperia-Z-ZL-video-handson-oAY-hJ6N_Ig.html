taking a look at the Sony Xperia Z this
is the company's new flagship smartphone
for 2013 as you can see he's got a very
large display this has got a 5-inch
1080p HD display with a pixel density of
440 PPI uses Sony's Mobile BRAVIA Engine
2 technology for enhanced colors and
clarity when you're viewing photos and
video otherwise you're looking at a
pretty standard slab square smartphone
from the front it's covered in one
hundred percent glass on the front
Gorilla Glass material but along the
sides you can see it's got a squared-off
design a bit different than the curvier
designs that we've seen before and it's
got some pretty cool hardware accents
here he's got an aluminium power button
next to the volume rocker the back of
the device features an all-glass panel
as well using gorilla glass tempered
glass for greater durability and it
features a 13 megapixel camera with
Sony's new Exmor RS sensor that allows
for HDR video in addition to HDR still
recording and high-speed burst mode 10
frames per second until the device gives
up the hardware is actually pretty
solidly built and well-constructed and
if you notice all of the ports here have
flaps over them because it is a
water-resistant device so it can be
submerged in a metre of water for up to
30 minutes at a time it's running
Android 4.1 jellybean at launch with
Sony's custom user interface here the
company says that it will be upgrading
to Android 4.2 at some point after the
device is launched Sony's done a couple
of different things with the software
namely here to enhance the battery life
of the phone it's got Sony's power
management software that allows users to
enable a stamina mode which will disable
all background applications when the
devices displays off the company says
that you can extend the battery life by
nearly four times with the stamina mode
engaged you do have the option to
whitelist application so if you wanted
to allow a email
application or social networking
application through and to allow
notifications come in you do have the
controls there to do that powering the
Sony Xperia Z is a Qualcomm Snapdragon
s4 pro processor clocked at 1.5
gigahertz it's very snappy and
responsive in our tests here we really
don't see any lag or of any sort while
we're using the interface the Xperia Z
supports hspa+ and LTE networks sony
says this is will be coming to markets
globally by the end of the first quarter
but it still doesn't have announced or
hasn't yet announced a price for it
though it will be a premium device this
is a sony xperia ZL which is very
similar to the xperia z as far as
internal components go it's got the same
processor software and camera module
over the hardware is a little bit
different the same size 5-inch 1080p
display but it's a little bit smaller
and a smaller footprint than the XPS z
but the trade-off is that the device is
slightly thicker around and does not
have the glass panel on the back it is
also not water resistant like the Xperia
Z sony says that it will be launching
the xperia ZL in some limited markets in
the end of q1 when these devices launch
but it has not decided where exactly
those markets will be</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
