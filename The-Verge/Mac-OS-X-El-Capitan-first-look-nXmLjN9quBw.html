it's called El Capitan it's coming in
the fall but you can look at a beta of
it this July but we have the Developer
Preview right now let's take a look
there's two things to know about El
Capitan the first is that it's faster
Apple has added metal to it which means
that graphics render faster and in
general it says that apps launch faster
so if we launch the Photos app here you
can see it's spun up and launched pretty
quickly in terms of experience there's a
few different areas you need to look at
the first is window management so I'm
gonna open up Mission Control here and
you can see that it has a little bit of
a lighter theme and I can take a window
I can drag it up to this area add it to
a new space that's basically the way it
worked before but what you can do now is
you can hold your finger down on the
green spotlight button and you see
there's two different sides of the
screen here I can drop it in and that's
drop it into a split screen view and
then I can choose the other app that I
want to see in split screen like notes
and now I have two apps open in
full-screen mode but in split screen and
you can change the dividers between
these things and you can go back to your
main window and you can take another
thing you can put it into full-screen
mode I can go back to the desktop and so
on and I can take this thing and I can
drag it into this photos and calendar
and now I've got another split screen
view here so pretty convenient if you
use full screen apps it works really
well
spotlight search has also gotten better
in El Capitan if you start it you can do
a search for things like the weather in
Toronto and it'll give you the
information for that thing you can also
search for stocks all sorts of
structured data you can even search for
cat videos if you want to the other
thing that spotlight can do is you can
use natural language so for example I
could search for emails from Nilay and
it will show those emails you can use
all sorts of natural language I could
search for PDFs from June and there's a
PDF that I had open in last June about a
terrible Android tablet the neat thing
about spotlight is it doesn't just work
inside spotlight you can use those same
kind of natural language searches and
notes or mail or a whole lot of other
Apple apps and that's really kind of it
for the big system level stuff in
alchemy
there's a new system font there's new
support for other languages but the
really big changes come inside Apple's
own apps and my favorite changes are in
Safari so you can see here I've got a
bunch of tabs open and they're little
that's because they're pinned tabs
they've finally added this that
something that chrome is done for a
really long time you can see here I've
got a bunch of tabs open so I don't have
to reload the page like I do with the
bookmark and they're just sitting there
loaded or ready to go which is pretty
great the other thing that they've added
in Safari which is cool is if you have
something making noise like this Jimmy
Fallon video you can just click in the
address bar to mute it and if you hold
your finger down on that button it also
shows you all the tabs that have sound
going so you don't have to deal with
being embarrassed in the office anymore
now speaking of things that Apple is
finally doing they're finally adding
transit directions to maps so you can
add a transit layer to your map screen
and you can see here I can see all these
subway lines and I can even zoom way in
and look at an actual map of the
underground station of a particular
subway which is pretty cool and you can
click on a thing and you can see what
the delays are at least in New York it's
not available in a lot of cities to
start but they'll be adding more as they
go
it is everywhere in China which is
interesting mail has also seen a big
improvement Apple says that it can sync
messages faster they've also added some
new full-screen mode so if I go into
full screen and I start a new compose
message I can start a bunch of them and
you can see that they are separated out
into tabs and if I minimize it it's it's
down here at the bottom of the full
screen so I don't lose it the other
thing I've done in mail is they're
trying to add some structured data so
I've got this email here that says you
wanted me for lunch at 1:00 p.m. and
Apple has added a little thing to let me
automatically add it to my calendar that
works for basically calendar entries in
contacts but it's not as full featured
as what Google does with Gmail with
flight tracking information and package
tracking and all the rest so if there's
one app that sort of sums up what makes
El Capitan cool it's the Notes app
Apple's added a ton of new features and
functionality so there's really boring
stuff like I can bold text but you can
also do other neat stuff like you can
add checklists for shopping milk eggs
butter in the dairy section but on top
of that you can drag images into it
there's an image you can even drag URLs
into it so if I drag a URL in here
you'll see that it's created a neat
little you know preview card that tells
you what is inside that link you can
also share map locations to note so if I
want to save this thing in this a subway
station into my Notes app pops up a
little thing and now I've got that
reminder in my notes there it is the
reason that note sort of sums up how I
feel about El Capitan is if you live in
Apple's ecosystem if you use its Notes
app if you use its Maps app it's great
because everything sort of talks to each
other and works together really well and
then spotlight is able to search all of
it with really natural language so it's
cool if you don't live in those worlds
you don't quite get all of those
features so your email lives over in
Gmail and your notes live on Evernote
and you know whatever else and that's a
fine way to live but it's not
necessarily the way Apple wants you to
live what Apple wants you to do is use
all that stuff together and if you buy
in it feels really compelling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
