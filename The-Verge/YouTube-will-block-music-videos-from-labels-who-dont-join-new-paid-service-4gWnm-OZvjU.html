musician whose videos garner millions of
views on YouTube but he's also an
independent artist and as such he could
disappear from YouTube in some countries
in a matter of days here's what's
happening according to the Financial
Times YouTube is preparing an ad free
premium streaming music service which it
will begin testing internally with plans
to launch later the summer as a part of
that youtube is creating new licensing
deals with music labels and according to
youtube's head of content and business
operations if labels don't come to terms
then youtube will block their videos
from the site in their respective
countries and not just the new premium
tier but it's ad supported parts as well
so far record labels representing ninety
percent of music industry have agreed to
the new terms that leaves ten percent
that are holding out for a better deal
so who's in that ten percent independent
labels like Domino and Excel and between
the two they've got some pretty big
names there's the previously mentioned
Jack White as well as Adele the Arctic
Monkeys m.i.a Tyler the Creator and
vampire weekend a source familiar with
the situation has confirmed the verge
that most of the details in the
Financial Times story were accurate
youtube doesn't want to launch a paid
service and then be forced to show some
videos in ad-supported mode or offer
users the ability to take videos offline
but not be able to offer that for big
name artists it's a tough situation
YouTube is taking a very hard line
approach but a lot can change between
now and the launch of its new service
YouTube is far and away the world's
biggest online video platform a
principal driver of attention two
singles and behind radio is the biggest
discovery platform from the music so
it's no wonder YouTube thinks it can
play a little hardball
