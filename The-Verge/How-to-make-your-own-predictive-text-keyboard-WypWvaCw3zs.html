text memes online where you start with a
writing prompt and let your phone
keyboard finish the rest type I was born
and then let your predictive write your
autobiography all right let's see what I
was born to do I was born to be a
professional calculator player I was
born to be a professional calculator
picker it's true like so much of Tecton
RI predictive text actually came from
good intentions like helping us make
less mistakes and type faster when we're
texting but from what we've seen of the
means online we also know that there's
some pretty creative use cases you've
probably seen the work of botnets to do
is online like this parody Coachella
lineup poster made up of fake band names
generated by AI they actually have a
tool online that lets anybody make
predictive text means and I'm gonna show
you how to do it the tool that botner
created is actually pretty similar to
the predictive text on your phone but
instead of a suggesting words and
phrases that you often use you can
upload a source text to help you sound
more like a voice so for example if you
uploaded a bunch of Yelp reviews and you
type out the service was it'll suggest
words like terrible or very good and I
wanted to learn more about how this tech
works so I called up bot next video CEO
Jamie brew Markov chains which the basic
assumption of a Markov chain is language
is just a series of states and from each
state you've got a bunch of options
there's a limited number and when you
take one of those options you move to
another state so your current state
might be a drink word sequence I went to
and then you've got a bunch of options
about where you go from the sequence I
went to and one of those might be Paris
and so you take the option that's called
Paris and now you're in a new state
called went to Paris and you've got a
bunch of options and words that could
follow went to Paris and one
the important things about that model is
that once it's moved past a word it
totally forgets about that word that it
used to be F and it only remembers the
current state that you're in
so as you're writing with your sentence
and you're in the end of three words at
the end of a 10 word sentence the model
of language doesn't remember anything
about what came at the start of the
sentence and it's not using that
information to guide the suggestions to
come next it's really just like tunnel
vision down to those three words that
you're on right now and that's that's
the core of how we assess words there's
a little extra flavor that we throw in
but it's surprising how much you get in
terms of just like sounding like the
text that you fit in just from something
something as simple as let's look at the
sequences sequences come right after
that so but language often just works
that way to make yourself understood
you've got to start with a structure
that people understand and then tweak it
to show the specific meaning that you're
Turner's brickster and comedy writing
probably works that way even more than
in regular writing but I think we're
doing regular alright so now let's jump
in and try bought an expert octave
keyboard it's browser-based so it's
really easy to get started they have a
list of custom voices you can use but
I'm going to go ahead and load in my own
I got a list of Sanrio characters and
their personality descriptions from the
Wikipedia page so I'm gonna put that in
and try to make my own Sanrio characters
my makeshift Sanrio keyboard suggested
words taken from the official character
bios like aggressive and mouth 'less to
create the names and bios for my new
characters then i just drew them based
on those descriptions the botnik
predictive writer feels like an exercise
and creative writing think of it as a
tool rather than something that just
dumps out a bunch of words because it's
really a collaboration between you and a
machine you can shell for your words
around if you don't see anything you
like or you can save a word if you see a
particularly good one you can even
combine two keyboards like the Sanrio
characters with McDonald's item menus
the best predictive keyboard creations
have some kind of
component like these fake boat names
impose on kotas of real lifeboats or
Photoshop ads for beef try it out for
yourself and see what kinds of weird
things you can make thanks for watching
I want to see some of the weird stuff
you've made so tweet them at me write
them in the comments and be sure to
