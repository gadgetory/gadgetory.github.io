characteristics you might reasonably
associate with the concept of
self-driving cars unless you're in a BMW
self-driving cars yes that is in that
case you're looking at adjectives like
crazy insane nerve-racking
we went out to Las Vegas Motor Speedway
a few miles from our home base here in
Sin City to check out a new research
project at BMW where company engineers
push self-driving cars to their hairy
limits the official company line is that
it's all done in the name of safety but
in reality is the most terrifying fun
you can have at the hands of a fully
automated robotic car I had the chance
to ride one of them and it's a seriously
surreal experience the driver or more
accurately the passenger sitting in the
driver's seat
presses a couple buttons before the car
simply takes over and blast through a
twisty track with no regard for the ham
sandwich still sitting in your stomach
dicing on the cake came on lap to where
BMW had intentionally wet the track to
induce a prolonged oversteer the car
handled it perfectly staring through the
slippery turn better than most humans
did and recovering without skipping a
beat in other words the car wasn't
really self-driving it was self drifting
but as I mentioned before BMW says this
madness is all in the name of safety how
can we control a car in a very critical
situations at the border of the driving
dynamics when the car starts to drift
how can we pull it back on the road and
how can we how can we manage the
critical situation as a very important
part of setting up a complete system for
real autonomous driving OneTouch access
to automated high-speed joyrides might
not ever make it to production but BMW
says that the research it runs here will
help to get you a fully automated car by
2020 with many variations of partial
automation long before that in fact many
of the technology is linked to
self-driving like dynamic cruise control
lane detection have been in production
cars for several years now
still I pay extra for this way extra</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
