Sadiq and I'll never tell you what my
real name is all right it's Timothy
Clement this is 90 seconds on the verge
project our lives google has announced
that it will host a conference in April
for its modular smartphone concept the
first project ara device could launch
early next year for as low as $50 each
of its so called phone blocks will be
upgradeable later of course and if
project ara doesn't have a tie-in with
the next lego movie it's dead to me the
story of mass government surveillance
just took a very creepy very invasive
turn
according to the Guardian Britain's GCHQ
captured webcam images from millions of
Yahoo users the NSA is said to have
assisted in the program known as optic
nerve which ran from 2008 through at
least 2012 and yes there was nudity in
somewhere between 3 and 11 percent of
the images that gathered personally I
think they were just curious who posted
in Yahoo Answers and finally there's a
new nutrition label that reflects how
Americans actually eat for the first
time in 20 years the FDA has proposed
changes to the nutrition facts both the
calorie count and the servings per
container have been super-sized
a new line for added sugar has been
included meant to highlight one of the
leading causes of obesity in the United
States listing vitamin D and potassium
is now mandatory
while vitamins A and C are now optional
and this is my proposed change for the
new food pyramid it's a pizza that's it
for today's top stories
coming up tomorrow is twitch plays t see
a postmodern remake of The Truman Show
where a hundred thousand people
simultaneously try to control my actions
come on guys I really have to pee</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
