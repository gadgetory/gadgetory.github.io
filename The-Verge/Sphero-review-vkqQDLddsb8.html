this is fear oh it's a Bluetooth
controlled ball and it rolls the ball
looks and feels a little like a baseball
it's about the same size and it's a
translucent white color but there's all
kinds of stuff inside of it it's got a
compass and an accelerometer and a
gyroscope all to help you control the
ball with your phone there's also an LED
light inside which can show thousands of
different colors and that's one of the
coolest things about the Sphero is all
the different colors it can glow it kind
of looks like it'll light up a rave it's
super easy to setup it connects via
bluetooth to iOS and Android devices and
it pairs really easily and then connects
automatically as soon as you turn it
back on after that
most of what you do with the Sphero you
actually do on your smart phone there
are five apps available for both iOS and
Android that let you do things like
drive the ball around you can change its
colors there's one that lets you play
golf there's one that lets you take
pictures with your phone while also
controlling the ball so you can mess
with your pets and then take pictures of
it and there's one which I really like
that lets you actually draw a route for
the ball and then have it follow it so
you can draw these crazy complex routes
around your living room and have the
ball go where you want it to
unfortunately for right now that's about
all the Sphero can do it's a cool fun
device that gets sort of boring after
about an hour of use and hours about
right because that's how long the
battery lasts to the apps are fun and
gimmicky and the company that makes the
Sphero called Orbotix has actually come
out with an SDK so other developers can
make apps for the platform and people
come out with cool apps this could
actually be a really fun device but for
right now it's something you'll take out
of the box play with for a couple of
hours and probably forget that it exists
and unfortunately at a hundred and
twenty $9.99 it's a little expensive for
a pet toy which it's great at and just
kind of doesn't do enough for everything
else
