astronauts lucky for them nASA says it
will start accepting public applications
for the first time since 2011 NASA isn't
needed mini astronaut since the shuttle
program was cancelled but now they need
new recruits however this is your
standard job application where you
sending your resume come in for an
interview there's a lot of
qualifications the candidates must meet
and a lot of candidates you want to meet
them
last time thousands of people applied
and only eight got the job I don't know
I like our chances me too well
applicants must pass the NASA astronaut
physical which includes the following
requirements distant a near visual
acuity their eyesight must be
correctable to 20/20 good blood pressure
not exceeding 140 over 90 standing
height between 62 and 75 inches SpaceX
and Boeing are creating spacecraft to
take a stress the International Space
Station we could ride in those aplans
must also be US citizens nASA has a
spacecraft - it's called Orion and I
don't we can take that to Mars totally
and you must have a bachelor's degree
from an accredited institution in
engineering biological science physical
science or mathematics followed by at
least three years related progressively
responsible professional experience or
at least 1,000 hours of piloting command
time and jet aircraft alternatively a
doctoral degree would be acceptable in
lieu of experience so it doesn't look
like Lauren and Sean will be going to
space anytime soon but they can write
about it on the Virge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
