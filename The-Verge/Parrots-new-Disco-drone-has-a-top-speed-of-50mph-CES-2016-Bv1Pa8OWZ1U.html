today we're at CES 2016 looking at the
parrot disco fixed-wing drone the parrot
disco is a foam body drone with a
plastic frame that could fly up to 50
miles per hour with a 2 kilometer range
the parrot disco weighs about 700 grams
which means that you'll have to register
this with FAA if you're gonna fly this
in America the camera is the same as the
parrot bebop 2 a 14 megapixel fisheye
lens it has a maximum range about 2
kilometres and it can travel up to 50
miles per hour the body is made up of
EPP foam and it's built off a plastic
frame the parts are replaceable both
wings are detachable as well as a
propeller one propeller in the back one
cool feature about the parrot disco is
you can just toss it in the air it'll
take off it's gonna need about a hundred
meters in order for it to climb to about
50 meters so you need a bit a runway in
order to fly this once you launch the
drone in the air can be controlled with
the sky controller which was unveiled at
CES last year the battery life will let
you fly for about 45 minutes on one
single battery charge another cool
feature about this drone is ultrasound
camera on the bottom of the drone that
helps it land autonomously this is only
a prototype model and they hope to make
this available to consumers in 2016 so
if our parrot has not announced a price
for this drive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
