today is a pretty big day for the past
few years we've been asking for a
high-end phone with stock Android but
instead got great devices with extra
software or Nexus devices with subpar
hardware that'll change today because
google is selling the HTC One and the
samsung galaxy s4 directly without
additional software from either
manufacturer or the carrier they're
available unlocked and unsubsidized
meaning you'll need to spend 600 or 650
dollars and use them on a GSM carrier
like AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile from a hardware
perspective these phones are literally
identical to their carrier branded
counterparts the only difference is the
logos on the back of the galaxy s4 the
processors radios screens cameras
everything is exactly the same so really
the only differentiation between them
comes down to software if you're
thinking about buying one of these
phones you basically need to make
yourself a little decision matrix first
do you prefer the hardware on the one or
the gs4 then once you figure that out do
you want a stock experience or not the
HTC One still has a nicer feeling
hardware with its aluminum unibody
construction unfortunately that's where
most of its advantages end the galaxy s4
although it still has an annoyingly
slick plastic a design does a better job
with stock Android that mainly comes
down to buttons the galaxy s4 is a back
home and menu button or the HTC one only
has home and back on both you double tap
home to multitask and long press for
Google now but on the HTC One you have
to deal with an annoying three menu bar
on legacy Android apps which shifts up
your keyboard that terrible plastic back
on the gs4 is removable though which
means you can swap the battery out and
add an SD card for more storage I wasn't
able to get any apps working on the HTC
one's IR blaster but I could do it on
the gs4 on the other hand the one still
has better speakers and beats audio I'll
be it not as finely tuned here as it is
on sense running about six hours on our
test neither phone offers the best
battery life we've seen on an Android
device but both are better than what
we've seen on the manufacturers custom
versions the story was the same on our
benchmark tests the galaxy s4 seemed to
be just a hair faster not so much as you
actually be able to notice that leaves
the cameras is the most important
differentiator between the two devices
the galaxy s4 maintains its 13 megapixel
rear camera while the HTC One retains
its 4 megapixel ultrapixel
camera you're making the trade-offs
you'd expect if you've looked at the
regular version to these phones the
galaxy s4 takes sharp images but it
still can't hold up to the low-light
performance on the one the HTC one on
the other hand doesn't give you a lot of
detail if you need to crop the image so
that's hardware if you're comparing the
stock Android software experience to
their custom counterparts it's all about
trade-offs the biggest place will be
making sacrifices in the camera both HTC
and Samsung have thrown a lot of little
features into their camera software and
while most of them are neat what's
really helpful is the improved camera
interface at both offer Android stock
camera interface simply feels too basic
for the quality of the cameras that it's
tied to I will say that in almost all
cases I was able to match the image
quality of the skin versions with the
Google versions in most cases the images
came out virtually identical in my tests
the sole exception being that HTC Sense
handled low-light just a little bit
better than stock one side note the
stock android galaxy s4 did have
significant shutter lag as compared to
the other three phones here but if
you're not concerned with a tweakable
camera experience there's really a lot
to like here actually it's better to say
that there's a lot less to hate there
aren't any garbage carrier apps clogging
up the works it's great to be able to
have access to Google stock calendar
messaging app launcher and the other
apps again the additional features and
bits that both Samsung and HTC layer
onto those apps still feel out of place
in many cases and rarely add that much
benefit although I will say if you're
heavy exchange user the stock email app
on Android is still as abysmal as ever
you also get access to the latest
Android features like the daydream
screensaver and home screen widgets
presumably the benefit of being on the
latest version of Android will hold but
these builds technically don't come
straight from google so there's a
possibility they'll be held back behind
the nexus still they're likely to go up
dates way ahead of the carrier versions
HTC blinkfeed Samsung's crazy eyeball
sensing technology and all the rest of
those custom add-ons always felt like
there are meant more for a showroom
floor demo than actual day-to-day use
having tried both devices without them I
can't really say I miss any of it so
what should you pick you'll need to run
yourself through that decision tree I
mentioned earlier are you on AT&amp;amp;T or
tmobile can you afford enough subsidized
device are you okay with losing some
camera features in exchange for a faster
cleaner software experience if you've
answered yes to all that the only real
question left is do you prefer the
hardware
functions and camera quality of the gs4
over the physical beauty and
loudspeakers of the HTC One either way
both these phones offer the best Android
experience we've seen yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
