Capitol building the building full of
hundreds of people who have literally no
idea how the internet works but there
are a couple of people who get it
senator Al Franken is one of them he let
us into his office to hang out and talk
about the future of the internet so
senator Franken thank you for for
joining us today very well be here
pleasure I on your what do you call this
it's not airwaves not airwaves are pipes
are tubes
you're tubes are tube so is that that's
right well let's that's what what the
internet is it's a series of series of
tubes yeah you have an interesting story
first of all I think that people kind of
they know they know an old Al Franken
yeah and now there's a modern reborn Al
Franken a beautiful political butterfly
how did how do you go from one to the
other
oh it's really odd I it made perfect
sense to me a lot of the comedy I did
starting in high school was satire
political satire and on SNL wrote a lot
of the plays I did a lot of stupid silly
comedy comedy comedy stuff but always
was very very interested in politics so
one thing I think is really interesting
like your political trajectory over the
past few years is that you've been very
focused on technology you're obviously
very focused on privacy lead the
Subcommittee on privacy and acknowledge
in law why why have you chosen to kind
of like lead in that area as opposed to
all the myriad other things that you can
choose in the same well it's just an
interesting area I mean we have on the
Judiciary Committee which I didn't ask
for I mean I thought you know 90 of
these people are lawyers why should I be
on that because I'm the best actually
yeah I actually was for the best and
I've actually been interested in
constitutional issues for a long time
but I also came from out of
the communications industry you know
telecommunications industry so what was
kind of interesting is that when Comcast
NBC came up I sort of felt like the one
who understood it the most yeah on the
antitrust subcommittee so I felt like
this was an area that I kind of
understood better than then most of my
colleagues on judiciary so I thought I'd
jump in and we kind of I'm kind of
invented it you know the Subcommittee on
privacy technology and in the law and
and also it just constitutionally
Goodwin Liu who was turned down he was
this brilliant law professor who was
turned down because he was so brilliant
and asian-american yeah and they didn't
want him they didn't confirm him well
the Republicans didn't want him
confirmed because you're so brilliant
and young that they knew well okay he'll
be on the Supreme Court someday if we
don't stop it now yeah and so they did
and but he was you know criticized by
the Republicans for believing in a
living Constitution and they and and he
kind of said well a living kind of
course the Constitution's living because
not everything that existed that exists
you know has existed existed then for
example and they use tell the telephone
the founding fathers did not anticipate
the telephone and at a certain point the
Supreme Court had to decide what were
people's expectations of privacy with
the is-is-is wiretapping a telephone
yeah a violation of the Fourth Amendment
and they thought it was so you need a
warrant to tap someone's phone and in
the same way just every technology has
to be sort of seen through that lens
right well so the lens of both it
enables all this inter communication
enables new innovation but then it also
enables government to spy on you or the
lens of theirs well it's not a
government spying on you necessarily
very often
this is actually it's corporations are
able to get all this information so it's
actually a little different than what
most people thought of privacy law good
most people always thought of privacy
law as the government mm you know
finding out what you're reading or the
government finding out Big Brother hey
brother
this is now corporate said rather and
and people don't I think people have a
fundamental right to privacy and they
have a fundamental right to know what at
least what's being taken and being
stored and and control over whether it
goes to third parties and they don't so
you've proposed you mean you've held a
few hearings on it you did a location
tracking one a few months ago hearing
that you just held the hearing on facial
recognition technology and how they're
being used when I thought it was
interesting what that is you had
Facebook's head of privacy in there and
then you had the FBI in there right do
their interest a line can you regulate
both of them with the same kind of law
or do you have to split them apart well
that's a really good question uh yeah I
think you're gonna we're gonna have to
split them apart and I think it might be
easier to regulate the FBI you know I
mean frankly it's just that I mean
Facebook literally has I guess what 900
million yeah they're popular it's
popular and that means in this regard
they have these face prints of maybe one
out of every you know yeah seven people
on earth or something you know I think
people are more comfortable making rules
to contain government than they are to
you know private enterprise or or
corporations or right private entities
so I think that actually leads me into a
whole set of issues or I'm net
neutrality right because you were a very
firm supporter of net neutrality they
had always been yeah yeah I've them I
mean it at that moment you were a
particular vocal supporter yes when the
FCC was debating it now it's well when
the FCC was debating
and when the house tried to overturn it
yeah and so I was very disappointing
that thing
our readers know that I'm I do a lot of
swearing when we talk about net
neutrality God passionately believe it's
important well you know quite a lot of
House members the internet did just fine
yeah before without net neutrality just
hilarious that's my favorite thing I saw
I mean House members would get on the
floor and go what you've seen all this
expansion of the internet without net
neutrality why I have it now yeah let's
go you I would calmly say that's we
don't want to change anything yeah
that's the architecture net neutrality
is the architecture of the internet has
been the architecture of the internet we
want to preserve that that's my answer
so what home they've been my Commons
well I mostly do a lot of like fist
pounding so I mean have you heard for
example there's rumors that you know the
iPhone has FaceTime video calling and
they're gonna enable it over the
carrier's right they're gonna enable so
you can do it over 18 Verizon's like
mobile networks and there's rumors that
a CT is gonna like charge you for it
right as an additional feature but it's
just the same data yes so why that's
wrong that's so that's in your opinion
just completely wrong yeah
is there anywhere I agree with you I'm
asking is there any I think that you
that you have a thing called network
management as I what we call it you have
right to do that and if you're
overloading and crashing because people
are using something that is making that
happen you have right though yeah say
you can't do that yeah we're gonna have
to charge you for that to incentivize
not using it all the D&amp;amp;D centum eyes
right but so relation seven disincentive
you're we're gonna punish you ATT should
slight beyond the rest and say well for
for doing something that would make our
network crash if everybody did it okay I
could see that that's network management
that I can I can understand that but
that's not what this is that if this is
like tiers of service yes and I that
that is not that's wrong so because
that's not the architecture we've had
to me that protects innovation hmm that
that freedom has been what has created
the innovation over that's net
neutrality right and that's so you and I
are having like even at this level which
is like pretty high level let's talk
about the basic concepts a pretty nerdy
conversation right about net neutrality
in the architecture of the internet not
as nerdy as I imagine most of your own I
have but I will nerd you out you can it
doesn't take much to nerd me out so I
think that's that's we're going well
don't be too impressed with my
chairmanship yeah your stats that you
can nerd me well so I mean isn't that
the problem I mean you're trying to
explain this concept that my readers
kind of instinctively get the you've
even the lovely we're talking about it
you seem to understand your staunchly
supportive of yes but one level out of
it you've got an entire Congress or the
people who don't seem to understand
what's going on and I don't have any
technical expertise yeah I mean you have
the cert through everything that's going
on in Congress sometimes people there's
people who do understand things but
pretend not to there are people's very
knowing like there is self-delusion
there is not wanting to know I mean
there's all kinds of levels here and
there's voting with your leadership yeah
and etc and and their corporate
interests and that tend to I don't know
if you've heard of this thing called
Citizens United
yeah anyway so yeah so so you don't
think a corporation is a person I don't
I don't and I you know corporations can
live a lot longer yeah and they are
shorter but no they're they're not close
the piece a if you never you can't break
a corporation's heart it's really
disappointing actually I try every day I
should read some my editorials about
AT&amp;amp;T so we've been talking about this
balance between the public interest the
private interest you've been talking
about corporate interests
one of the things that our readers
always talked about when they talk about
corporate interest of course you have to
worry about it's coming right through
our mics yeah that's okay people that's
one of parts of the sound it's real it's
real you'd pay for that you'd have that
sound effect to make it seem like you're
at the center okay so one of things our
readers are talk about when they were
worried about corporate interest yeah
and what the internet is SOPA and PIPA
sure you are a co-sponsor protect IP
sure what the hell happened there ma'am
well you know again a no better champion
than an open Internet I also care about
intellectual property rights yeah so in
the corporate interest win is that what
would happen there over no actually the
Internet guys were screaming from get-go
right don't do this and it went through
the Senate and it was only in the house
of like there was a real traction when
Google and Wikipedia blacked out so what
happened no I didn't get to got traction
believe me when tipping Wikipedia Disher
gotten traction in the Senate - and we
heard those concerns and very legitimate
concerns my my concerns were both the
openness of the Internet and they're
also about you know I had someone in my
office from a shoe company in Minnesota
it's a very well-known shoe company and
they get ripped off all the time there
so we were trying to target was overseas
you know other country road websites
that pirate yeah
intellectual property again the concerns
of folks that are I'm sure watching
today were heard loud and clear you know
and and people are pirating
fake pharmaceuticals that are dangerous
they're pirating a lot of stuff that
people's jobs depend on mmm and so that
is it's trying to find the right spot
there but for now I don't see us that
revisiting that anybody you think you
think it's dead well it's certainly dead
for now and I don't you know we would
have to figure out how to cuz I think
probably most your most of your viewers
believe that people have a right to
their intellectual property in other
words have a right to our founders were
many of them were authors yeah and an
inventors and so they believed in I
don't know you know we wouldn't have a
747 these days if we wouldn't have a lot
of this this stuff if you couldn't
patent thanks for example so and so that
has to be you have to find a way to
protect that and at the same time
protect everyone's rights so what I have
an open Internet so what I'm hearing is
like there's a balance right between in
that case a balance between kind of
media rights
you know copyright it's been like what's
happening on the internet now the rights
is almost consumers to do stuff the
media as they wish but how do you
balance at a legislative level a place
that has historically been pretty
unregulated in terms of behavior and
also enable so many new kinds of
behavior that you might block with it
with additional regulation how do you
how do you balance sort of making
transit you know it I guess it was how
narrowly are you what behavior we're
talking about it for the behavior is
well we're I think we were trying to
achieve and it was trying to stop
foreign websites from pirating yeah you
know clothes and yeah pharmaceuticals
software and movies and all those kind
of things so that's the guy behavior
which is an illegal behavior in this
country is illegal and this was a try it
wasn't a
to get at the foreign but can you do
that with a technical solution of like
let's mock you with DNS or can you do
that with it another way because the
technical solutions that bother people
right yeah but the problem is that you
had no legal solution because they're
foreign entities and we don't know where
they are
Frank is really nice thanks for talking
to self</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
