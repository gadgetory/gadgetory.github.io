hello welcome to the verge cast I'm
nilay patel i'm ross miller and this see
your thing is david pierce david oh no
bro still sort of shocked that I'm here
this is amazing super-weak polities our
room for the technical difficulties we
literally had to just put the laptop out
make David a floating head yeah look
apparently the city of Los Angeles does
not know how to how to build an Ethernet
connection no google fiber so David I
don't out it this is the way we had to
make it work David's in a laptop sitting
on a desk sitting on earth in a building
I'm and I'm on I'm on this my thigh he's
using box it's a beautiful is it have a
color screen does it know I'm fascinated
by my thighs like touch screens really
yeah it's it's like I get to eat
actually I'm happy to have no ink is
fine my thighs are the color touch
screens it's like you've technologies
run amok you've literally you've gone
too far novotel no I have to say it's
been awesome I've had to tether
constantly all week and the best one was
this little I think it was a novotel
it's a little mifi that I could just
like scroll through and like kick
everybody else off on it and just like
should we not totally else off and be
like the bandwidth his mind everybody
get out does it have did you scream the
band with his mind each night every bill
opportunity and then actually just set
the room on fire and that's good that's
great uh look so David's here David's
well he's not here he's here in you look
for the people listening on audio alone
hey David you can pretend the david is
here you don't know what I'm doing
people watching in the video I'm very
sorry about Ross his behavior I have
ultimate power here look whatever we
have is much of David as we need
generally we have too much David and it
has been so first of all this is the
verge cast this is where discussed the
week in technology news culture news
technology news culture culture the
culture of of news if you take those
words you match them up any way you want
and that's the show we make and it has
been bonkers we took use just utterly
crazy it started on Monday with Sony
know it started with Microsoft Apple
Sony in that order right and then kind
of in the middle in 10 it was like I
will do a thing no no yeah so it was
right after that did I think tuesday
which is position but he didn't do the
press conference so David you were kind
of sore the Nintendo thing was her
things so there wasn't I mean they did
like a they did a live stream that they
didn't want to like tell anybody about
and they just kind of like went into a
room and they were like guys we have
some games everybody's cheering the
background I guess for like Nintendo
yeah we're tender so hard it best by
then he went to best well let's
start let's do the chronology so David's
at e3 we'll talk about Apple afterwards
let's get get 3v3 real quick um so i
would say that sony has emerged from e3
as like the darling of the show for
doing virtually nothing different than
right they like their that they they've
succeeded by maintaining the status quo
which is there like and used games will
work the same as used games at work
always done since 1986 yeah and the
console doesn't come with a motion
controller so it's 399 which is how much
consoles have cost me and it plays games
games are awesome there's no special
interaction don't worry about the camera
I just yeah it'd be control yeah there's
like there's no motion controls or not
like so in because of that because
they're just like we made a game console
everyone's very happy with them is that
your take on what Sony's doing I mean I
think it's a little uh thatthat's a
little sort of simplistic and I think
what Sony did here with it was really
smart was play like really really hard
to the game or crowd because that's all
those are the people who were here like
there were 5,000 people or whatever at
this Sony event on monday and like just
to just like set the stage here they
both had these in like big sports arenas
in los angeles not in like theaters not
in little rooms like this would be were
a root sports arenas it was like this is
where people have concerts and instead
they're like let's talk about video
games like that's the that's the culture
here people here are obsessed with video
games I was like I got to the microsoft
thing like just shy of two hours early
and there were four
hundred people in line ahead of me it
was unbelievable I've never seen
anything like this Wow um but so what
Sony did here was basically say like
just sort of over and over like we love
gamers and Microsoft hates gamers
Microsoft just wants to like give you
ways to watch TV and we want to let you
play games and like it was a brilliant
move for this I don't know what it'll do
in the sort of grand scheme of how much
they sell compared to Microsoft but for
here they really did sort of come out as
the darling because they said over and
over like we love gamers and we talked
about they get this and I want to talk
about Microsoft it because that video
sony released a video and it's
particularly used game thing right that
I think really cemented them is like the
favorite of e3 which was yeah during the
press conference they had a video and
they're like how used games works on the
ps4 it was like a two second clip of
somebody handing somebody else a game
which is cool right and that's what you
would expect right sure about what they
didn't say was what about the games you
download from PlayStation Network what
about the free games that you know that
they're giving away records PlayStation
plug there's a lot of stuff that they're
not making clear because the interesting
thing so I i met with marc whitten who's
the chief product officer for xbox and
as headed up a lot of the development of
this stuff and i asked him about that i
was like listen like I basically said
everybody sort of thinks you guys suck
right now because you don't let people
sell their used games and he he kind of
brushed me off he was like uh he sort of
said were in transition he was like we
are clearly moving towards this digital
place where everybody's gonna download
games and that has its own thing and he
made it sound like the drm stuff that's
gonna be there it's gonna be very
different from what we have now where
you can just like hand somebody a disc
and I think I get the sense for
Microsoft that they don't care they're
like look in two years everybody's gonna
be downloading all these games anyway
and like we'll wait until then and we
think then we're gonna win on other
stuff yeah which is really interesting
so it's like it there they're making
this big bet that like three years down
the road they're gonna beat Sony so
badly that they can afford to like look
like the bad guy yeah well I mean in
their history I mean and I I think this
actually gonna be seen for they'll show
that mean Microsoft's history is like
you know they they were the dark horse
with the xbox the original xbox right
they came out of every 60 they were
headed a curve on a lot of things people
said they were dumb right nobody wants
play multiplayer and then they
completely dominated the last generation
so you can see why they're like well
do that again but right I don't think
that that was another thing that mark
wouldn't said was he was he he said when
they come out with the first Xbox they
had an Ethernet port and not what was it
like the narrowband connection for
people who had modems and people freaked
out and he was like this is the same
reaction we get every time we launched
with new stuff and he was like we made a
calculated bet that we were going to get
beyond that and we were right and then
they did stuff architectural e that he
was like we didn't see the kinect coming
but we had that we like had the
technology that was ready for something
like it he was like we were constantly
making bets that if this thing lasts
eight years we need to be ready for we
are eight years from now now I kept
being like what what about today and he
was kind of like I don't care but the
thing is all those things they were
adding like they were additive it's like
we're not gonna take away from what
you're used to we're just gonna augment
and what you liked or not it's gonna be
there uh this is more of a restrictive
move though like the 24-hour thing is
just like well hold on well let's talk
okay let's just lay out the differences
between the two all right cuz we don't
know I mean EA could publish games the
ps4 and add all kinds of deer into this
game right place Sunday's basic just
doing a lazy a fair approach do what
everyone right but Microsoft is saying
like you need to connect once every 24
hours things won't work unless you do
right and gay it's up to game publishers
decide how they want to enable sales
right yes and use retail partners and
you can't transfer to your friends so
they're actually implementing system
level drm whereas Sony isn't that design
Sony's publishers won't do it right i
mean that's that's like in the
publishers are the ones who matter
ultimately right i mean right that's
where all the games so what what what
what's Microsoft's doing it's different
day we can you explain it to us cuz they
finally explained to be three so I mean
did they though like this sort of did uh
but it's yeah i mean i think it's it's
really what you said like microsoft is
is doing they're forcing you to have a
connection there forcing you to use this
whole kit first of all you can't use the
xbox without the kinect like not only
are they sold together they can't be
used separately but really if you under
connect the xbox doesn't work that's
that's what I'm told Wow which seems
wild to me and I'd like deeply hope
that's not true but like people who know
these things told me that um and but yes
it's Microsoft the one thing I
haven't heard a good explanation floor
and like I think Marc Whitten was sort
of stupid to that they're sort of stupid
to forget people now for two years from
now but the one thing that they have not
explained in a way that makes any sense
to me is the 24-hour check weird like if
you have this system DRS system level
drm for games then why do you need to
constantly be checking to see if I'm
online and constantly pinging back to
the surface like I don't it just doesn't
make sense to me that it works that way
yeah but you know let me just be blunt I
don't care look I don't care I mean like
in my world everything else i own is
online all the time it's a pretty small
market of people who really care about
that stuff right i mean it's it's like
people in the military and like i've
heard like college students bitch about
it ya know but i but i will say the
thing that really kills me the thing
that like the my favorite quote of this
holy through is somebody asked Don
Mattrick like what do you want to do if
you play if you want to play online and
he just without missing a beat when oh
you can just buy an xbox 360 yes oh the
biggest dick moment I ever heard my life
it's like yeah by the eight-year-old
consoling right but it's like that's
their strategy he's like and to some
extent I kind of get that that's their
strategy this is like they're hoping
that can last them you know another two
years until we are in this digital space
where bandwidth isn't a problem and
where people don't care about
downloading games and where people don't
care about you know not sharing games
and they're doing some stuff with like
family sharing with the xbox live stuff
that makes a little more sense but
they're hoping that kind of that the
xbox 360 can like last them long enough
and it makes me wonder that if Sony
wasn't coming out with the ps4 now if
Microsoft would have tried to wait like
another year or two to do the xbox one
really God the name is so bad every time
I hear an xbox one I think of the first
Xbox it's not going away it's been it's
been like a month now right yeah I know
it's that's that's for something today
so let's go over at Shoney's
announcements would they would they have
to show us III beyond it works exactly
the same as a ps3 when you hand somebody
a game oh right so Sony's whole thing
was like it yet it was like big
Microsoft burn for forever and and we
interviewed Paul interviewed Scott
roadie from Sony and for top shelf which
is coming up later today nice promotion
nice well done yeah give yourself a
dollar
nor show and scott was literally talking
about they were rehearsing at the event
before they were rehearsing their event
while Microsoft is doing theirs and like
watching Twitter and Sartre and soph 499
and he said everybody started cheering
in the Sun on like high-fiving and like
it was ridiculous um but so Sony comes
out and says like all this stuff
basically about how they're better than
Microsoft and then kind of dives in the
game so we still haven't seen a lot of
entertainment stuff from Jillian we
finally got see the hardware which was
good I actually got to like almost a
given as you look at hardware well what
and well it looks like it looks like if
you took a ps2 and a VCR and you're like
you know like that's what I like I i I'm
gonna make these go together I mean but
I the bigger question you what set-top
actually does look good I mean at least
it was some credit for like not having
that what was that noise David it's like
David just belched don't you just
received a notification I just made me
laugh uh he laughs like a okay look it's
secret no that was skype telling me that
I'm online no good good just just in
case you didn't thank you for joining us
now look yes they're all gonna look like
black boxes but I just think to this
this generation is really boring I think
they look really boring i think the
original 360 looked really cool i think
a ps3 looks really cool it looks crazy
as hell but lately which ps3 the first
very first year the first the 1i have
that one's the uh the that the 360
was like a novel design I think the 360
slim or the stealth box which nobody
picked up on those I tried really hard I
think that is really cool um I thought
that the original ps3 slim and not the
new one with a with the new one looks
over the new one looks like literally
like a plastic it's like they went to
Kobe you know you've been not gonna saw
four years do you have any idea about it
it is uh because we're what you think we
just use like our old discman parts to
make appt yesterday that looks like job
but I thought those the first few
iterations of the xbox and ps3 looked
beautiful and then these new ones look
terrible both of them look bad straight
up and the xbox one looks like garbage
and now he s the war looks looks boring
David you've seen these in person so I I
the xbox one I like less and less
as time goes on it just has that like
ugly glossy thing next to the big fan it
just doesn't look good the ps4 is is too
i think like a two big version of
something that's actually kind of nice
looking like it has the angled front
which is sort of cool and it's like a
little like catamaran e stack with the
space in the middle and that's kind of
nifty but but I can yeah there's a
better word for it but I'm going to
catamaran I mean do you know it's like
the waspiest thing that's ever been said
on the road chest you should be wearing
a boat are you wearing dark shoes right
now i am i'm actually on i'm actually on
my catamaran right leadership putt few
callers it wow that's good that's great
day for you la boy so I have my ray-bans
over there you and I weekend that part's
not a lie unfortunately but uh yes I
think like that the Sony made a two big
version of something that actually could
have been sort of nice looking so are
they both limited by the fact that I had
to build pcs cuz these things are pcs
right it's a patient gone to the PC case
mod guy Simon like do you have any old
neon lights that we can use sure I mean
like just some liquid cooling we could
just like light out is that what it mean
like is that what it is they're just not
a key solution and and I think the
biggest problem that they continue to
have is they just need fans everywhere
cuz there's so much power and it's like
always running at full tilt it's always
doing this crazy stuff so like when you
have to be venting out of every
imaginable surface like it's really hard
to do and the thing is I think I my
theory is that people just don't care
like whenever we've complained about the
design before yeah people are is just
like whatever and and the one thing that
they both did is build boxes that like
if you don't want to notice them you
don't really have to wear is like the
360 you were gonna notice like it was
there and it was like a centerpiece of
deuter living room whether you liked it
or not and these you can just sort of
like stick away next to your blu-ray
player and you know be done with but you
don't you don't need a blu-ray player
anymore lets you you can use the stick
away exior yeah that's all that's left
the team everything's taken next your
cable box much Wow we get cable okay why
it's like your ugly friend you're like
you come with me and I'll look great I
look awesome does your cable box so I'm
gonna start going to barge the cave wax
it's gonna be great yeah check minute
look at this first then then look at me
hey beautiful
yeah okay what were you saying rods uh
so I have to ask you since like Xbox has
been pushing this entertainment thing
and I I was wondering when he's gonna
like add anything to it they don't
really have to do they like we can
assume the ps3 capabilities does netflix
does hulu does amazon i Jes everything
except TV exactly and stuff at Matt and
I obviously I think Microsoft Stevie
implementation is silly so right but
Microsoft is pushing whole hog with the
TV stunning like they will get there
they will do something Sony hasn't made
any indications but by the time
Microsoft gets there well TV and cable
be as big of a selling point I'd like
cuz they're they're going at a rate that
cable is also kind of like kind of
meandering off they'll hit some point
and like we'll be doing internet video
anyway um I don't know I guess anybody
saying all the services will just come
to the ps4 I think so anything at all to
you about television David not really no
they talked about like flixster and
redbox instant and like it's clearly
something there thinking about but I
don't think they're concerned with it
nearly in the way that Microsoft is and
that's sort of weird to me because like
if I'm if I'm Microsoft or if I'm Sony
rather and I'm catering to these gamers
who are sort of by nature you know nerdy
or people more willing to hang out and
hack their hardware those are the people
who are going to want to like go through
the work of getting all their TV and
stuff set up and I think a lot of people
who buy xboxes are not going to ever
know that it controls their TV and a lot
of people who buy ps4 S will want it to
do that and it won't and it's like it's
a weird thing that Sony seems just sort
of willing to ignore but for their
target audience it would make a ton of
sense right so let's talk but um well i
once i'm a games is I haven't paid any
attention to gratis coverage because i
was at cuz i doing the apple thing real
quick the last piece of this is the
motion gaming stuff right yeah and you
wrote a piece saying that you really
liked what Microsoft is doing with a new
connect that it's really interesting and
then Paul wrote a piece there was like
Sony's giving up a motion gaming and
somewhere in there is like the reality
right which is the potential on the Xbox
is really great for the new style of
motion gaming but because Sony isn't
doing it it might not happen and that's
kind of the sense i'm getting what
what's your take on it yeah I think
that's I think that's
really fair and I think Microsoft is
going to end up being hurt by the fact
that playstation or that Sony doesn't
seem to care all that much about motion
gaming but the big thing for me was that
like Kinect is going from this sort of
gimmicky thing where like it used to be
in Madden games like you would stand in
front of your TV and you had to like you
had to like literally pretend to hike
the ball to yourself and then like fake
throw it and that would be it or like
all of the moves were big and bombastic
and you had to scream your TV and now
like the Kinect is so much better and so
much more aware and has so much more
data that it could do these much smaller
things and so you watched the one of the
coolest games I saw that one hour 10
ones i wanna play the most is dead
rising 3 this big sort of open world
zombie game and they he was playing and
sort of running around in at one point
this zombie like jumped on his back and
he literally just went like this and
just shook it off it yeah and it was
wild and it was just like this sort of
instinctive reaction that he had is like
it off and it the kinect like sees this
watches it happen and we can all be my
mother playing super mario yeah jumping
with the controller and a I'm gonna go
movie just for a second so hey hey just
for a second just like it so I rots hey
I do it so if I'd worst Danish I just
like play dead rising 3 like this the
entire time and like yes it does look
this invincibility mode this is a
comment in dead rising just I want you
all to know that what I'm looking at is
extremely I'm gonna find this you just
keep going get really yeah just you keep
shaking I damn i can actually no no this
i'm not waiting for you you'll get just
me again in a second just let's get
nobody missed a lot you know it's really
just all right just hang on are you a
shake when I tell you to shake a good
what's on it it's fine various types no
no okay wait now shake dead rising 3 god
mode this is the worst this is the worst
forecast moment all I am this is like a
lot work don't come any more the longest
six seconds great experience oh you have
experience excuse me all right David
your back to nothing anybody how are
hello David it's better this way like it
let's talk about games yeah I mean it
seems like the connect stuff and I'm
just gonna it seems like the kinect
stuff is great and that's cool but yeah
unless everybody uses it it won't be
great so like Microsoft first party
games will be awesome right and all the
third party developers are going to have
to
mike sucks going to like kick him some
is microsoft indicate they're going to
do this at all cuz i mean like
Electronic Arts happen someone's gonna
make clone do you see that yes yeah I
you who's behind you thank you my
teachers like a phone just came up from
underneath its John lagomarsino no but
so if you're like trying arts and you're
making a call of duty or sorry
Activision you're making call of duty
why what instant if you have to make
connect stuff because you're not gonna
do it for PlayStation I no one's gonna
buy a Playstation i right so what was i
I don't know i'm not i'm not convinced
that people will to be totally honest
and a lot of the games that we've seen
and again it's early so a lot of people
just aren't talking about some of the
things that they're making and it could
certainly change over time but for right
now a lot of what we're seeing is is not
involving connecting like big meaningful
ways or motion gaming in any way and a
few of them have like add-ons for kinect
we're like you can do a thing with a
controller or you can do it with kinect
and like maybe it's more fun like
there's this moment and rise where you
like press a button to call your archers
or you can yell archers and they come so
it's like whatever whichever you want to
do is cool but on the one of the really
interesting things we've seen here is
that there aren't a lot of games that
are really really dependent on it it's
like an add-on and it's other that
rather than like a big change for how we
act so let's talk about games what are
the best games you've seen you through
this year uh so this is the problems
we've seen a lot of games and we haven't
been able to play live it's rough mom so
it sit there there a ton of cool games
we saw a lot of thumb during the demos
quantum break seems super ambitious and
may be awesome watch dogs is gonna be
incredible yeah I'm the rise son of Rome
this like 300 e game yeah or you just
like murder people ruthlessly all the
time and that's as far as I can tell the
whole purpose the game actually looks
really cool uh-huh gear look this isn't
it this was a long set up here just tell
me about Metal Gear can you tell me what
the hell is going on metal gear and what
key face up wait wait in anytime you
ever asked that question can you tell me
what the hell is okay that's applicable
for the this high one Daniel E seems
like it's a torture simulator yeah like
those ones were not the old ones like
the least had a plot about what and by
the way i just read the metal your wiki
cuz i tweeted that i would pay a million
to
six hours later uh yeah I would I
tweeted that a million dollars to watch
Hideo Kojima explained the story of
Metal Gear looking for someone like
wouldn't you just want to be in that
room where he was like ok yeah I was
like wait what is the story of metal
gear and I went to the wiki and it's
insane it is unbelievable now it's like
torture simulator like that trailer is
like basically like look you push the
button torture the gun David David did
you did you see the red band trailer
from it'll go and banter there's a red
band one at the very beginning basically
just added some way somehow implying
that the at the other trailer is like
not gruesome or you have is the
beginning of the other trailer there's a
child yeah I'm spoiling it is a child
you can't boil a trailer it spoil
trailer thank you cuz are so today when
you see this your note he's like there
are more hands in a child's guts and you
can see the guts and they're trying to
pull out a package that's a lot can we
pull out your trailer back there I can
you know whatever him whatever you do
can we just I would like to watch the
trailer I know like you can fancy the
rating of the Vord cast here the right
hand have you ever seen the red band
verge cast it opens his hands in the
child that sounds to her we're just
dancing the whole yeah why why uh so do
you see it and you didn't see any metal
gear stuff I didn't know we were running
around it but it's the same thing it's
like if you've seen the trailer you've
seen what we've seen here and that's
been sort of the frustrating thing about
and so who you haven't been able to play
any of these games the next gen consoles
so we got to play rise a little bit we
got to play some of the other games we
got to play killer instincts the new
fighting game yeah we got to play arkham
origins to do batman game but we only
got two played on a ps3 I got to play
some of the sports games we are so
there's there's stuff floating around
but it's some of like the really cool
games like it's really clear that
quantum break they have built exactly as
much as they needed for a trailer and
that's it welcome our break is the one
that's like also the TV analog right dry
sci-fi show right it's it's a mix of ya
to mix of like a TV show and a game and
the conceit is amazing and if they can
pull it off it's gonna be really really
cool but it's gonna be really hard did
he address the fact that sci-fi is doing
this how it defines and it's kind of
like not connected at all like they try
to make it connected it's like not kind
of working evidence I do you have the
trailer back there I see you working all
right what's your buns my ETA hey don't
worry I really do not want to see this
trailer
no by then we have to watch it okay a
Jedi wanted I would like to get a live
reaction shot of David watching this
trail you can't see it from here
whatever I'll just hear it technically
off somewhere um sorry David I have to
ask uh so when I was growing up like
killer instinct was the fighting game
for me like it was my favorite of all
time how was the the new one it it's the
same like it's a fighting game no I mean
that's the thing in like to some extent
that's a really good thing and that's
been one of the interesting things
seeing here is like they're they're
building some stuff into these new games
and some of the best ones are like
really trying to do cool new
technologically ambitious things like
destiny trying to marry this sort of
open world game with a first person
shooter it's like halo and warcraft and
it seems wild and it's gonna be really
fun and I'm really excited to play it
and I was another game we didn't
actually get to play because there's
it's clearly not ready at all um but a
game like killer instinct is just like a
better-looking version of your game that
it's always better sounds appropriate
seems to be the same way and like
they're all still video games and they
look nice sorry are pretty let me show
you the most amazing video game else on
this is a red band trailer can we for
Metal Gear 5 we please all says we're
gonna watch was reception yeah viewer
discretion highly who are our viewers
it's they're fine they're they're fine
look it's red look oh my god this is my
mean snake look like kefir at all by the
way David can't can you see the screen
all the way over here I'm aware that
there's a screen I can't really see
anything I I seriously want to cut away
before can somebody narrate me like an
you narrate this for me there's a man
turning a wheel do we he's charging he's
gonna torture a guy with electricity now
well she's sparking the things together
not for any nation then he's torturing i
know that's a girl that's a lady to lady
oh well so I'd like to okay we can we
can stop this now I was reminded that's
your any ideology as far as i know all
over the neighborhood metal gear now are
now robots controlled by a central AI
known as GW you know we don't roll by
the Patriots wait wasn't that for all so
that's what he says yeah look like the
New England Patriots you
the new ink Tom Brady tortured a woman
and then you knew it that's that's why
it's what he's doing I mean mmm oh crap
what right forgot the name of Tom
Brady's first wife Bridget Moynahan
that's Bridgette muy yeah thank you
thank her look that game to me seems
insane but that's like the level of game
like the stories these games are getting
so like wildly tilted into crazy like
barriers like the pin it like everyone
else is going to wear metal gear is
because it you can't make 50 games in a
series without constantly upping the
stakes right III better there is no
other game in the world like metal gear
in the metal gear saw and you know you
look at the wiki it doesn't make sense
but kinda makes sense in that world yeah
why do you want to talk about
storytelling in games um and I kind of
want to bring brian bishop over she
around you he's he's somewhere around in
this this area he's mostly just hanging
out with George Lucas and Steven
Spielberg right like we're tossing about
storytelling in games nobody's talking
about from so uh David you think you're
gonna come back for for WWDC talk though
so don't count okay all right I'm let me
I'll go get Brian good i'm gonna dim the
screen what is brian not available to us
I thought he's real Brian's coming he's
just like six feet away from me so when
I say go get I'm just gonna do waive it
okay then we're gonna do this great when
we hear Brian talk we'll we'll just put
the screen back good beautiful this is
quite a little bit of business if you do
look look look reel productions
production values there I just just do
it again all right tell me about
storytelling it there's not much to say
really cuz that's what it is right but
now I'm gonna explain to you metal gear
solid okay so actually it's nice no way
no what no what is this stephen siller
enjoying Lucas are you trying to uh no
so Steven Spielberg and George Lucas
like they had this talk and Brian was
actually there he did a couple stories
on it probably trying to pull it off but
the two things that were interested me
one was he talked about the they talked
about the utter demise of the theater
business as we know it look more like a
Broadway model mm-hmm so that was
interesting these things become more
events in the day and date stuff with a
home the theater just kind of happens
more yeah and the other thing that was
interesting to me was a storytelling
they're like it's never gonna be
Shakespeare yeah like you're not video
games and video games yeah why is that
I hear Brian I hear Brian um but there's
just one line that allows like by its
very nature there cannot be a plot in
the game I think the thing they're
getting at is like you become an active
member and so you yourself are making
these decisions or you're not making
decision you don't have an emotional
resonance to ya things always been the
issue either you're kind of along for
the ride which then is not really a game
it's more of a movie we're actually
having material impact in which case
you're always gonna do the right thing
are you gonna die and reset your saving
lowes there's no there's no emotional
resonance for you there's no like
nothing at stake choices don't matter
right Brian are you back are you here
hey guys what's going on Brian Brian
were gonna fade you up well you are look
at that oh yeah television magic right
there whoo Brian so you were you were
you talked to Steven Spielberg today oh
yeah we say a slap he's a cool bro he's
cool yeah so ya know it's a he and Lucas
they spoke of that panel at at USC on a
Wednesday that USC had an interactive
media school kind of opening up and Don
Mattrick from Microsoft was there
supposed to be about the future of
entertainment in terms of you know new
art forms and that kind of stuff and
Lucas quickly turn things over to two
things he wanted to talk about because
George Lucas needs to own every
conversation is what we learned why it
is this a bad thing I mean sound like a
way more interesting conversation than
it was gonna hear from George Lucas and
done that oh yeah no it was fascinating
i mean Mattrick was you know very
polished in our message where you know
scoobert and Lucas were actually talking
about real that they were
passionate about you know and it was a
it was awesome Noah's fascinator station
games can't have a plot tell me about
this what they say yeah well Lucas's big
thing was that you know tell me there's
two different things there is a their
storytelling which is one person you
know it's like me telling you a story
about how I did this thing whatever and
you think about the plot and what
happens and the stories and the
characters and the themes and then
there's games my idea is once you have
agency or free will and something and
it's not really a story anymore it's
it's something else and you know Lucas's
point was that you know games basically
you know they're just now adding
characters to movies that realize that
makes it a richer experience but they
don't have a set plot and that kind of
hinders we can do so his notion is that
line Nia that Ross was mentioning about
you can't have fought us it's you know
saying that it's like you know you can't
put out you know a sports game which is
what Lucas is saying video games are
more likely because players can do
whatever they want essentially
mm-hmm but I mean look here's your
here's my here's my response that's
because a I would point out that roger
ebert made this exact argument like five
years ago and was like roundly shot down
by the games community right well this
works argument was that or video games
art or not and I think I think it's easy
to say any creative endeavor can be our
that's kind of looks like a given when
you step in what is the entire thing was
like a game of chess can never be art
because it's a game right you win or
lose and there's a mechanic mechanic
creates drama and drama creates emotion
if you're only metric is you're creating
a motion and that's art like then a game
of chess cart so little video games
can't be that because the story you
can't invest the story when you make
when you have an unlimited number of
consequence free choices so what he
right well he should have said was it's
not storytelling looks like a painting
doesn't have a story is just a freaking
painting sometimes right that's the
differentiation is like you know it's
storytelling a basically traditional
Nordic narrative storytelling I mean to
be fair it's not live video games are
video games are something different the
whole conversation calls out for a
different definition which is really
interesting because we're now in this
space Rahul are trying to meld narrative
you've got quantum break you've got you
know you know the destiny no video game
and TV show or not destiny I'm the
sci-fi show and drawing a blank defiance
defiance thank you you know where people
are kind of trying to merge the two and
you know we need a new definition
because that's the way things are going
but I it's a nuanced target but they're
right it's not traditional storytelling
it's just something else that can't have
emotional impact but it's not you know
at one point Lucas compared Spielberg
you know what he was doing to to Homer
which is really really hilarious in
spirit that was hilarious but in a sense
that's true like that traditional
structure of I'm going to tell you a to
be here's what happened is going to take
you on a journey it's not the games are
doesn't mean games are worse or better
you know in my opinion is just that
there's something different sure is it
even worth it to try to tell a story in
a game because every game now is full of
story right i mean that's and there was
a cod versus piece there's a great piece
about III that was like we keep building
all this technology and upping the
graphics level and increasing the
interactivity and they're always like
and then we'll be able to tell even
better stories about our characters i
don't remember i wish i had opted out my
head where this link was um I think
that's everybody everywhere talking
about gaming right but there but the
point of this piece and I will find it
will put it in the post wave one that
the verge hats goes up but the point was
you're lying right you're not building
all this technology in the service of
better storytelling you're not building
it to make deeper characters or anything
that anybody actually cares about you're
doing it to create first-person shooters
and all these games all of the bleeding
edge games for all these systems are
first-person shooters or possibly
third-person shooters right I think
you're saying like I will say the best
video games driver I've ever had like
that ever experienced and this is gonna
be the word one is left for dead and
there is no story it's for people who
all just have equal footing in there
fighting zombies and like literally I
think it's like uh joy success Griffin
macro like who will sacrifice himself
for other peoples with three people can
get out there like that's a great story
to me but it also speaks to like what
video games do best its immersion like
their world building there may be side
stories that happen other characters
doing their thing but when it comes to
you controlling yourself like there's
only so much you can anticipate for that
right there kids awfully tragic cuz you
have a machine gun or a cheat code right
there's also things like what tell tales
doing you know the walking dead is
really interesting because that is
you're going on an emotional journey
there you know you feel bad if you do
bad things I mean they have ways they do
it there's a technique there's a
Clementine character it's not just like
here we're telling you the story there's
tricks that they're using essentially
right that is an emotional experience
and I think that's the gray area that's
interesting and if anything you know
that's what's developing now and that's
maybe the area that Lucas was jumping
over and not kind of seeing because he's
simply thinking of you know like you
said Neil I triple a first-person
shooters and then you know the movies
you see on television or a theater
there's this new emergent ground that
we're interesting things are happening
it's just not what we think of as
traditional storytelling or narrative
they're not frankly I find it
intolerable i mean that's just it's just
so much like it's funny I feel very
binary I feel I understand Spielberg's
pain uh no it's I do it's either I want
to relax and like not do anything or I
want to like play a video game and it's
very rarely that I want to do some weird
hybrid to in the middle and to ryans
point like I actually I think month ago
I started doing the walking dead game
yeah and I had to turn off because it's
an emotionally trying game like when i
play games most the time i'm just trying
to relax and hang out like walking dead
i'm actively involved and there's so
many unintended
consequences like the choices on making
that I don't realize yeah I have a hard
time conning choices my regular life the
unintended consequences of it should i
do every day are like alrighty terrible
alright Brian I'm gonna kick you out get
out get out of my face I love you guys I
really enjoy talking you will talk to
you again look Ashley won't know we're
gonna talk to you at man of steel later
okay well we just talked about now then
bring David back for dub dub alright
fine we'll stay here and tell me about
Superman without soiling it is it
possible for a Superman movie to be good
my theory is no I think know also and I
saw it earlier this week and I still say
you guys are seeing it I haven't seen
I'm gonna see they're not gonna spoil it
here's what I think you can be a Batman
guy or Superman guy and I think the
world is full of Batman guys where Ben
ladies and the Superman faction is dead
it's over and done with here's what I'll
say and we had you know Todd Gilchrist
for a great review for us basically
talking about how the movie was you know
the you know it was like basically the
son of two fathers in this case you know
Nolan and Zack Snyder yeah and it
definitely is that it's it's a zack
snyder movie first and has Christopher
Nolan character beats if you loved you
know the way that sucker punch and
watchmen worked and looked then a lot of
the stuff you will dig if it's not so
much your bag maybe you'll have problems
with it I think what it does whether you
like it or not it does prove that
Superman can work in a modern context
cuz that was the big question right he's
a do-gooder he's a you know you know he
have any workouts because we're very
like cynical it's an angsty Superman
it's a guy the way when you said that
out loud the computer literally made an
error beep sound I want that skype
doesn't believe you cuz I don't know I
just don't it's like look it's the same
problems video games how do you raise
the stakes of anything when your main
character can do anything right what are
the challenges that he will face and as
far as I can tell the challenges well
another character with the same
abilities always has to appear in either
kill him or blow up the world okay
that's every Superman story from now on
till the end of time I mean the larger
option story of course you're correct
cuz it's gonna be some sort of villain
the stakes have to be that big because
apparently every movie has to have
steaks where it's like a James Bond
thing if the world isn't you know isn't
imperiled and nobody cares the main
character he can do anything right so
what they do is they internalize it what
happens is basically the struggle what's
interesting about and this is the Nolan
influence I'd argue
that it's about Superman's internal
struggle dealing with who he is what
it's like to be you know in a world
where you know he's not accepted it's
very much about you know his son Colonel
struck with who he is I got actually dis
effect and they look at a fighter i hate
it whenever it's not i don't think it's
entirely successful I have you know
horse I perfect no matter what I do that
but as the worst does he shave my god
look look no I'm gonna go see it maybe
maybe my mind will be changed I'm just
saying as a concept like that for me is
right like Batman's a detective that's
all I got to say he's a really easy
detective yeah I think it proves the
character really were effective soon as
successful as i would have liked it to
be yeah i think it's gonna be huge it's
already made like I think 21 million
dollars if I gonna break June records
it's already made a hundred seventy
Superman Returns made a bunch of module
in that well super turns made 200
overall they're expecting this is gonna
make a hundred Elise by the end of the
weekend and Superman had a five day
opening weekend Superman Returns did
this is gonna kill superman returns no
good finally something visual it let it
find the taste of that can oh look I'm
saying how did I go sit I'm just I it
just to me it's like how how do you make
back here they tried really hard to make
the character relevant I just don't
believe that it's possible right I
believe the world the world has
transitioned transitioned to a Batman
state and we we we are we are in our
heart of hearts America our Batman but
you do realize these Justice League both
yeah that's a doll how do you is it dumb
all right oh that's dumb all that
crossword look I don't knock on wood
you're coming out here right away we've
now hit the point of our chest where
people are gonna send an angry note
saying I don't understand games I'd
understand comics and both of those
things are true I don't understand
either of those things and I like most
Americans know the Batman is awesome in
video games are killing people can you
go go go get David I'm gonna fade you
down ok guys do you do your little
business your production magic Ross
Miller senior editorial producer the
verge making making a quality for her I
it up right down thank you guys um so
weird have an iOS 7 you were there
though I was there so
Josh and I spent Monday was a big day
for us Josh I were at WWDC that
President teen was III I WWDC for us was
a crazy as ever so the room two thousand
more people in the room at WWDC this
year that's what I people told us I'm
just paralegals like they just fit more
chairs and things like it's always
sitting no chairs yeah and and we were
very like you know like applets it's
funny like comparing how Google and
Google's in the same room like three
weeks right for i/o literally the same
room and just comparing like how they
run their events is like very
interesting it's also a developer focus
that are supposed to put iOS developer
done they both are right but just
comparing like Google had a show like
yeah there was like a village set up
outside you know they had like partners
they're demonstrating stuff like Google
zeikos it's a much smaller event if he
were people but it's interesting how
much bigger the number they have just
they just do more stuff right like
google has chrome and Android and a TV
plan so I was just watching all that
unfold was very interesting Apple is
very focused yeah well just mean that's
just the two it's funny chiz like I want
to talk about WWDC I'm back I had talked
about all right here you go so anyway so
we go in there and we do we go through
henan item hi uh you know it's a Tim
Cook keynote much different vibe um much
of it was let i think that the sort of
parlor bet before the keynote was
whether johnny i would get on stage
right a lot of people thought he would
he had to basically he didn't he had a
video I think his video is ridiculous
has he ever been on say to them he's
gonna he's been on say hi phone thing he
did no he did a macbook air ocean he he
was on say he explained it and he very
slowly talked about extrusion which ever
ever just go watch that that's amazing
um is that the term for pulling things
out of the envelopes no it's because
that's how they make the the bottom
panel the air right they extrude a piece
of aluminum and then they they'd all the
CNC operations it's like great it makes
it makes milling aluminum seem like the
most interesting thing you can do wish
it probably is anyway said Ivan catan
sage he did a video about iOS 7 which if
just just watch it with like new eyes
you know like at the time it's like very
emotional you're seeing all this new
stuff there it is like keep in mind this
is the big interface reveal for iOS 7 so
we're seeing all these new features
we're seeing all this new stuff he's
talking about it but if you go back now
that iOS 7 is kind of familiar and watch
it you're like wow he's talking really
slowly I'm like you're stupid but he's
just very slowly explaining to you that
like Apple is better than you it's kind
of it's kind of a unique I think a lot
of the reaction to iOS 7 came from this
reveal and I want to talk about that a
little bit more because I think there's
some really smart things here I think
there's some really dumb things here but
I think the way they showed it off and
then the way they've talked about it
since are so different right that it's a
lot of the initial reaction came from
this video night I encourage people just
go washed in because it's this really
interesting anyway so wait go ahead sony
III can you explain that a little more
actually cuz I've been the you know the
way you've been out of e3 I've been kind
of out of WWDC this and and I've seen
like a lot of the reaction online and a
lot of you know the way people are
talking about it ahead of time and like
I tweeted something snarky right after
it happened but uh what so this this
this video was the first reveal yeah so
this is so yeah so the way WTC structure
was there like and now we have a new
version of those tan it's called
Mavericks right major new icon Craig
federighi he was now the head of
engineering for iOS and OS 10 it was
like the star of the fifth yeah he's
great he's great presenter yes extremely
handsome in five days very I can spend
one day of my life looking like Craig
federighi that day would be tremendous
uh you know he's just be very much
smoother a polish a great told a lot of
jokes like just on his game right great
presentation for us 10 OS 10 is getting
a lot of features are like power user
features um it's not like the finder
ends up yeah tab finder they've got tags
like you can tag in the file system
there's better better multi-screen
support for full screen apps it can get
iOS notifications which i think is
interesting and kind of random it's just
cool stuff I'm actually really excitable
you can reply if you get a message
messaging identification you can click
right on the notification reply which is
like what you just do that for the
iphone right everybody's asking you to
do this on the iphone it's like three
years fine fine do it they're just like
move it overnight
dear but like so you know us and and
then they're done and they you know now
let's talk about iOS and Tim Clark
introduced to the video Johnny I talking
and then after that's done federighi
comes back out to demo everything but
what the disconnect was and I this is
really i think they clearly had some
concept of why they made these changes
right and they never said why right
there like we just knew was time to make
changes we reconsider the entire
interface to get rid of clutter and did
you know think about layers and depth
and and it's like okay you knew it's
like you knew you had some answers like
some questions and here are your answers
but you are not telling me why those are
the answers but in any way shape or form
and didn't really get rid of clutter at
all i could think the same it looks like
a complete mess yeah like just an utter
garbled mess like I think command
control center it's the new you swipe up
from the bottom you get all these icons
and stuff in control center it's like
why doesn't that go up the screen all
the way right like why is that why does
that only cover half of the screen I was
orders of the screen there's like all
kinds I the number one criticism iOS 7
oh you know we've we've now had the
developer builds are out in the world
we've had a chance to play with it when
you aren't when you look at the lock
screen it's a swipe to unlock and
there's an arrow pointing up underneath
it it but that's not how you will mock
the phone like it digitally you still do
the same motion but you can only do it
one direction so if you swipe from the
right to left it just like down circulus
if you swipe up you get control center
and so it's like it's just this very
confusing like it's it's almost like
they've expected people to internalize
how the iphone works so much that they
can add in queues for other behaviors
and expect that your muscle memory will
keep you within the realm of sand right
so if you if you're a new person you
pick this up you're not gonna get it
David I'm sorry menurkey one second if
we're gonna tell one minor nuance that
I've been watching those people don't
exist no first of all fair enough I
think wasn't a thing god that's that's
not an unreasonable expectation I don't
think like I don't think for Apple to
say you know that you swipe left to
right to unlock your phone so we're just
gonna I don't let you do that move on
other stuff I don't think that's
unreasonable at all I would say that
it's the pendulum
swung too far I think the everyone's
screaming for redesign you've got all
these textures all these real-world
objects you know you need to clean it up
make it better and what they did was
they they radically changed the core
ideas of the interface and I'm just
saying look the thing they didn't do
they didn't explain why they cheat like
they reach the answers that they reached
and if they just done that they're like
look we know we need like an interaction
model that's like you know controls
happen on this layer like we're building
all these layers and like here's why we
think the layers work they do mm-hmm I
think people would have bought into a
little bit more instead it was like a
lot of like here's our interface it's
really flashy and then they like stopped
all right and that's one thing it's
weird because it seems like Apple is
usually really good at doing that
they're usually really good at saying
like this is you know here's how we sort
of imagine the user interaction and kind
of guiding you through like here's why
this looks the way it does yeah and they
just date I guess just didn't do that
here like that it might exist this video
of Johnny I've like whispering to you
about how design is simplicity and
simplicity is the essence of design it's
like that's great dude and I I
desperately want to get drunk with him
like I just want to know what he talks
about um I just I'm just curious like
that to all the I bet it's not as easy
always talk really sure about your beer
well it's it's so yellow like I mean
just the yellowest yellow I could find a
head it's so simple yeah it's just like
you know it's it that's fine but like
usually in those moments when you reveal
a new thing you explain why the newness
makes sense I just didn't see any of in
like I am told over and over again by
hundreds of angry Apple fans on Twitter
that if I was a developer and I was
there and I was of the sessions I would
hear Apple explaining to its developers
why they made these choices and I
trusted that is true and the developers
aren't the people they have to be
explaining this right that's the thing
like the developers have to make apps
and that's great but ultimately people
have to use the phone and millions upon
millions of people have to use the phone
and let's not forget like come whenever
it comes out this fall like the people
who do not follow this as well as they
do like our parents or whatever they're
gonna wake up they have an update and
then their phone is entirely different
and we're gonna get phone calls about
that far absolutely and not just
different it's that's the thing
the pendulum has swung so far with ios7
that it's um it's like really bright and
gay I think it looks like board shorts I
think it looks like like like hollister
or like curly like white board shorts
like neon print on them the pallets are
super bright the colors are neon there
it's just they need to just bring it
back a little bit and I i think they
honestly didn't know I think it's very
trendy in terms of design and I think
they need to bring it back to timeless
but I think that's really important for
them to do here's my big question and I
tweeted a picture of the control center
saying it was hideous and a bunch of
people responded saying the background
is the biggest problem and I think that
might be true because they've seen a
couple of people running it with like
with third-party app icons and it's not
quite this like stock out of the box
thing that Apple wants you to have and
it seems like the biggest mistake Apple
made was just having this like horrific
parallax each inning background where
like it doesn't have to be that bad and
you can like pull it back a little
yourself is that I know it's fun to do
that that is true i mean it's all
transaction right what's funny is that i
remember very clearly when the first OS
10 came out and i would down I was in
college and I would download themes for
my OS 9 that made it look like I was 10
and nobody knew it OS hadn't really
worked like and all the windows are blue
because people thought the windows are
blue instead of just being translucent
to the stock blue background oh wow and
I think that's kind of what's happening
with Iowa seven right now is that we're
we're seeing all these interactions all
these translucency of these filters all
this stuff interact with some things at
Apple's setup and not with what it looks
like in real life right but at the same
time it's like why is it translucent why
is there a button in control center that
turns on the light is a flashlight but
if you push the camera like switches out
to a camera app like those are
inconsistent interactions right like
yeah and some of it makes sense and some
of it doesn't why they have it today
view which is very much supposed to be
like Google now right so you open the
Notification Center you click on today
it pulls in your mail pulls in your
calendar and says it but it doesn't like
do google now stuff like it doesn't like
read your email might tell your flight
information which is fine it's you know
apple doesn't have that service but it's
also like i can't plug in my third
calendar to that so if I if I as I do
use gmail and summarize for mail and
calendar like I like iOS 7 doesn't they
don't help me out and I just like I
don't see it like they need to expand
the universe like they're turning it
into more of the computer right but
giving it real multitasking they're
giving it all these there's a bunch of
new Bluetooth stuff for watches and
health monitoring which is all looks
very cool they're doing game controllers
which i think is awesome right and they
have prototypes and I like the reports
out of wwc that I've seen like they're
building their working with logitech to
actually build like game controllers
that fit overly that you can't obviously
see how that stuff will come to the
apple TV right there doing all of this
stuff to expand the functionality of
their devices but they're not doing
stuff to expand the world of software
that you run and experience on those
devices there it's like it's window
dressing like they think they've
repainted the interface but they're well
and that's fun right if Apple can do
their own services in a way but apples
milk it's just sense but they're not
doing extreme ill clear mail clients
this new i work in iCloud thing doesn't
seem good no so that seems awesome oh
let me know so it's like if it does okay
that's fine but one part of it seems
awesome let me be clear all right it's
really super hyper advanced right it's
like I was talking to like other people
from other companies and they're like
that I cloud stuff is the most advanced
stuff we've seen on the web like in
terms of building a web app like drag an
image onto the thing and the text reflow
is like very few people are doing that
stuff yeah we have to see like what how
many browsers will it run on you know
like there's some questions there that
stuff is great but then all of the
backend stuff which is like he wrote a
really great web app without thinking
that it's on the web so like then stuff
like the live collaboration like how
it's going to work across platform like
like if you send it to 50 people like
where the documents live how you can
share them all of that stuff is still
like open questions so it's like Apple
is really good at building the web apps
they're not really good at building the
web services I think that's going into
wwc I think the criticism that we've all
gelled on I wrote a piece on this is
that if Google is Apple's competitor
right then
the problem for apples at Google's
getting better at services faster than
apples getting better at design right
and I think all we saw 3d out google's
getting better faster sorry I've been
talking about recently Google's wedding
getting better at services fashion
apples getting better at design and even
like the hardcore Apple fans have agreed
with this notion like John I got this
line I stole it from John Gruber who
stole it from an apple employee yeah
down the line right nothing at wwc was
about services they were I was all about
design and I just want to like focus on
the notion that Apple can't rely and
design this way they can't show off a
new mac pro be like we still kick ass
the design and computers basically Phil
Schiller said we can't evade me more my
ass that's great man nobody has ever
said that you can't innovate in computer
design or tablet designer phone design
like clearly you can do those things
where your problems are is your service
offerings compared to your biggest
competitor are subpar and like that's
reality like people in their consumer
lives rely on other big service
providers like you know hotmail and
yahoo mail are still like the most
common mail providers like out there
Gmail's third iCloud I don't think is on
that list in that way in a meaningful
way and that's just email there's so
much other stuff so if you're going to
build an integrated hardware software
service solution you need to elevate
your service offerings to the level that
your hardware and software are known to
be at but then wouldn't their counter be
that they've built this incredible third
party app ecosystem that sort of
alleviates that'd be great let me licet
gmail is my default mail client well
okay fair but then I mean that's yeah
that's a huge from but the back rounding
stuff they've improved does help that
you know that stuff is cool the idea
that you can get a push notification
silently in the background right that
will like is he that will update an app
and you'll never know you just update
the open twitter and it'll just be like
they're all that's great they've caught
up to Android in that respect
tremendously whether we're Android is
pulling ahead and where Apple may not
even want to go is Android is quickly
turning into like a little computer
right and the iphone is turning into
whatever it's strained and that's fine
those paths can be divergent but at the
end of the day I don't think the trend
of i have an iphone which is the phone
that i want to have and i've replaced
most of apples apps with
party apps that hasn't changed and
apples are really worried about that
because once the experience of using
those services is subpar on the phone
and I'm replacing all their stuff with
other peoples that means might is my
willingness to change platforms for a
better experience for the services gets
higher I mean we've seen this happen at
the verge like this is everybody's
everybody's Android on the verge right
we had this huge shift from everybody
using an iphone to everybody using
Android because the google experience is
so much better and it became something
we became really reliant on and it's
like for gmail and google calendar and
Google Drive it's like it's not it i
will say like if you you know that's
just because we run our business on
Google a track right but like I think a
lot of people run their lives in google
apps like my sister my wife like my
parents like their googled up like they
just use google stuff because they trust
Google Google's there for them and it's
there no matter where they go where is
with iPod with Apple it's like you have
to have your device or have your
computer like it's not it's just tightly
integrated or it's not as dispersed it's
tightly integrated to a device now if
you have like if you're all windows DUP
which I know a lot of our readers are
like the iphone is actually like so
better for you than android phone
because it's better exchange especially
now with office for the mayor's office
right like there are differences i get
it but like I feel like Apple spent all
their time focused on look at our
crazy-ass design and they did not
explain why they reach the design
decisions they made apart from you know
they're they're really feel good videos
about why they say no to 100 projects
only yes to one which is like okay but
why is everything translucent like just
tell me tell me the answer that question
and they did not address I think they're
their failings in the service space they
didn't they talk about I called once and
it was to bring it to my work which is
like that's great but you didn't this is
your developer conference and you know
else is running pieces about how I cloud
is failing developers you know what we
got a bigger cheer than iWork for iCloud
if they would've been like and now when
you play a game on your iPhone it syncs
to your iPad and like that's all I would
want so they didn't get there um maybe
there's an endless amount to say about
wwc but those are those are kind of like
Mikey mmm like takeaways and I know it
sounds super negative we've gotten a lot
of
you're being too negative at WWDC but
the stakes for this one we're so high
and what people wanted were so high out
of this ios7 refresh that I think that
the criticism is warranted because I
think Apple showed up and they thought
that they won the day and I think the
reality is they did a lot of beautiful
things with ios7 they did a lot of
extremely confusing things with iOS 7
and they still haven't I think that the
the notion that you're going to upgrade
the software on your phone and
everything's gonna be better and it's me
automatically better than Android it's
not there yet I think they need to
explain how the services tie-in why the
software makes wait does yeah I mean
it's just to me it all feels really
defensive it feels like they they read
all this news about people saying oh
it's skeuomorphic the design hasn't
changed since 2007 and so they came out
and said let's just change everything
let's make sure that no one can accuse
us of having a design that we've had
before yeah and and seriously and it's
like this big thing of like oh it's
stale and they're not paying attention
and they're not innovating and they're
like well you can't like you know in the
sense that innovation can be a bad thing
but you can't accuse Apple of not
thinking differently and blowing it up
and starting over and like maybe that's
what they were going for me turn it back
I think we can talk about Saul David we
seriously have to go we have to go we
have to go oh where am I going we are
the studio is kicking us out so our
Studios goodness yes they have something
after this look well look uh Microsoft
people I hate your platform android
people it's a fragmented mess in Apple
people i mean just chaos you're all
doomed and like their game video games
are terrible and comic books are for
children and that's the verge cast
everyone i'm gonna go cry rock and roll
done are we done I don't know if we're
done or not you can tweet at us I'm just
keep talking you can tweet at us how
they turn this off it turns out
