iPad it went low-cost and small with the
Nexus 7 then big and high-resolution
with the Nexus 10 with its new $399
Nexus 9 available today Google has taken
its closest shot to the iPad yet the
Nexus 9 Hardware should look familiar
it's quite literally last year's Nexus 5
smartphone stretched to a tablet size
but this time HTC is building the device
instead of LG some of HTC's influence
can be found on the metal trim around
the 9 and front-facing speakers but this
is definitely a Google design through
and through the 9 is available in three
different colors but our review unit
here is a basic soft touch black the
sides of the tablet are metal but the
back is soft touch plastic and it's
really prone to catching all kinds of
fingerprints and just human grease it
feels ok but it doesn't feel nearly as
nice as Apple's iPad Air's or iPad minis
little details like the power button and
the volume rocker feel cheap and low
rent it weighs just under a pound which
is in spitting distance of the air to
Zoe and it's a bit heavier than an iPad
Mini it's just under 8 millimeters thick
not as thin isn't there - but definitely
thin enough to not make it much of a
difference but though the Nexus 9 is a
smaller display than the air 2 it feels
much closer to Apple's larger tablet
than its mini versions it's comfortable
enough to hold for longer reading
sessions but it can be unwieldy to use
in one hand the 8.9 image displays the
same resolution and aspect ratio as the
air 2 but it's just not nearly as nice
looking the colors often look washed
there's a visible air gap between the
glass and the LCD itself and the
backlight is easily visible on the sides
of the screen it's not a bad display for
a low-cost tablet but when the Nexus 9
is playing in the same price bracket or
higher as an iPad it's just not up to
par the front-facing speakers are a nice
touch it's something I wish Apple would
implement on the iPads they're loud and
clear and even though my hands cover
them when I hold the tablet and
landscape they don't really get muffled
as a result there's also an obligatory 8
megapixel camera and flash on the back
of the nine and a 1.6 megapixel camera
up front for video calls
neither camera is hugely impressive but
they get the job done for what they're
expected to do in addition Google is
offering a keyboard case for the Nexus 9
it pairs over NFC and Bluetooth and it's
also about 129 dollars unfortunately the
case isn't available for purchase yet
and Google wasn't able to provide one to
us in time for this review well
regardless of its hardware the Nexus 9
is mostly showcase for Android 5.0
lollipop lollipop is the biggest revamp
to Android in years and the Nexus 9 is
the first device shipping with the new
platform there
new animations new design ideas and
better performance all over the place
it's the best Android has ever looked
and felt and it really lays the
foundation for a modern mobile platform
the animations are pretty informative
and the new multitasking menu is nicer
to look at and nicer to use the whole
platform itself is just downright pretty
Google has updated many of its core apps
to integrate with lollipops new design
and features including an all-new Gmail
app that works with virtually any email
account and the new calendar app that
displays contextual images and pictures
based on your appointments it's a great
platform but there aren't many places
outside of Google's own apps where it
takes advantage of the larger display on
the Nexus 9
it really feels just the same as a phone
OS stretched to a larger screen there
are some neat software tricks Google's
specifically built for the Nexus 9 you
can double tap to wake the screen and
the okay Google Voice command works even
when the display is off just like
Motorola's Moto X the 9 is the first
Nexus device to come with a 64-bit
processor it's powered by Nvidia's Tegra
k1 it's got a ridiculous number of cores
and 2 gigabytes of RAM but even with all
that processing power the 9 lags in
places where it shouldn't and apps take
an awful long time to load the 9 can
handle gaming fine and HD videos aren't
our problem but it gets really warm in a
short time with just moderate activity
and it gets downright hot when it's
doing something intensive like playing
boat simulator the Nexus 9 is Google's
best attempt at matching the iPad but
despite the new processor better build
quality and improved display Nexus 9
still feels 2 steps behind where Apple
is and nearly $400 for a 16 gigabyte
model the Nexus 9 is playing in the big
leagues with a minor league team making
it tough to recommend to anyone other
than Android diehards
