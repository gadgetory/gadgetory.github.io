we're here at photokina 2012 in Cologne
Germany checking out Panasonic's new
Lumix G H 3 except we're not actually at
a bar we're at Panasonic's massive booth
inside a huge convention center in
cologne but bar no bar what's
interesting is this new camera the lumix
dmc gh3 it's the successor to 2010's gh2
and the gh2 was never really a pro
camera but pros really loved it they
could hack it and change some of the bit
rates and up some of the features and so
what Panasonic did with this camera is
actually bring a lot of those features
into the new model so it's the same 16
megapixel sensor has a new tilting LCD
it has an improved viewfinder the auto
focus has been improved basically across
the board it's designed to work just
like a DSLR it just has a micro
four-thirds sensor as you can see it's
enormous it's especially for a micro
four thirds camera we used to them being
small with small lenses but this very
much feels like a DSLR and it's being
marketed like that it's going to be two
thousand dollars so it's in the same
price range as canons new 60 and nikon
d600 and it definitely is designed to
play in that same market it's got a ton
of video features too that was one of
the things that panasonic said the gh2
is used a lot for we actually use two of
them to record our podcasts and things
like that and so it has a ton of video
features it has timecode it has a
headphone jack and mic input it can
record 1080p video at 60 frames per
second it's just designed to be a really
really pro level micro four thirds
camera and it's actually one of the
first we've seen this is a as expensive
a micro four thirds camera as we've seen
produced and it's going to be really
interesting to see it has a obviously
much smaller sensor than a full frame 60
or even d600 and we're going to be
really curious to see what happens with
a camera like this that's designed to be
used by pros
