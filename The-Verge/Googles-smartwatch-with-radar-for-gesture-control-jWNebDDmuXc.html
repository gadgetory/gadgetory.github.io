Google's special division for making
basically crazy technology dreams come
true you may have heard of some of their
projects they've made project ara which
is a modular smartphone they made
project to card which turns your jeans
into a touch-sensitive fabric but today
we're looking at something called
project soli
they've basically taken radar and turn
it into a tiny tiny little chip so small
in fact that they can make it work
inside a SmartWatch they're working on
the power issues they're working on the
software this is all still very much a
prototype but it's a really amazing
prototype so let's take a look so slowly
works by radar and what you do is as you
move your hand closer to the watch the
radar picks up your hand and it can see
how close you're getting and once you
get in close that's when you can start
doing fine-grained controls so right
here what I'm doing is I'm literally
twisting in a virtual invisible dial and
that is switching around the interface
on the watch so in addition to working
with LG on making solely working a watch
they're also working with JBL to make it
work on a speaker you can push your hand
towards the speaker and the speaker
lights up and then you can flick your
fingers to start the music and flick
your fingers again to stop it
so that's what any type had to show us
with project soli this year it's really
amazing but again it's still just a
prototype but with these partnerships
they are working towards putting these
in real consumer products someday this
isn't just a Hey look what we can do
when we're done it's let's build
something and hopefully it won't take
more than a couple years to get there
you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
