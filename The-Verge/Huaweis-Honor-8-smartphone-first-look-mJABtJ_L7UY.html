verge and today we're taking a look at
the new honor 8 the otter 8 is not a
totally new phone it launched in China
earlier this year but the big news today
is that it is coming to the US one of
the first things you're going to notice
about the honor 8 if you haven't seen it
yet is the glass back and Huawei says
that there are 15 different
manufacturing processes that go into
making the back of this phone to create
these unique light refractions here next
thing you'll notice are the dual cameras
which I think we're going to see more
and more of in smartphones these are 12
megapixel cameras one captures a colored
image the other one captures a
monochrome image that's supposed to be
more crisp and more detailed and then it
marries the two together to produce a
photo basically this is a long way of
saying it's supposed to take better
photos there's also a fingerprint sensor
on the back which is not new for Honor's
smartphones or for smartphones in
general but this one also doubles as a
smart key which means you can program it
to launch certain apps or even do things
like take a photo depending on how many
times or how long you press on it it has
a 5.2 inch 1080p display 423 PPI it has
a 3000 milliamp battery has 4 gigabytes
of RAM chips with either 32 gigabytes or
64 gigabytes of storage is expandable
through an SD card and perhaps more
notably it's the first honor phone to
come to the US that is shipping with
Huawei's Kirin SOC so that's why ways
own processor it ships running Android
marshmallow but should be upgradeable to
nougat and it does have Huawei's on skin
on top of Android very quickly I'll take
you through the camera app since this
isn't something you'll get on every
honor phone if you swipe to the right
here you can see there are 17 different
modes you can use to shoot with you can
shoot Pro video and they're different
manual controls Pro photo you can adjust
the aperture both as you're shooting a
photo and as you are looking at your
photo in post so it's pretty cool camera
app the honor 8 will ship in the US and
three colors pearl white midnight black
and cypher blue and it goes on sale for
pre-orders on August 17th and company
says it ship by the end of
months is selling unlocked the only
thing is we don't have the exact price
yet once we have that information we'll
be sure to publish it on the verge comm
so you can check it out there comes a
said it wanted to bring the 5.2 inch
version to the US market specifically
because they think that people here just
like to do things using one hand that
sounds dirty Bluebird</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
