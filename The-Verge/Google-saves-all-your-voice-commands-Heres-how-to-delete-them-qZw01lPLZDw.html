sort of smart device in your home an
Amazon echo or a Google home they're
great they work really well but the
other day I was poking around my Google
account and I came across this weird
clip
okay Google hotel a sleeping giant
mountain turns out Google assistant has
been recording all of the conversations
I've ever had with it that's weird
I don't remember most of these
conversations yet here they are and
Google hasn't forgotten Google says it's
storing this data to improve the
assistants voice model but what else are
they using it for
and can we delete this data actually yes
and it's pretty simple we already know
that Google uses a lot of your data for
convenience features like the types of
YouTube videos you like to watch your
location history in maps or autofill in
chrome so if you open the my activity
page instead of your Google account
you'll come across a buffet of personal
data including everything we mentioned
before your Google assistant searches
and the exact location and time of all
of your queries this might scare you at
first but keep in mind that asking for
location centric data like what's the
weather inherently involves having to
know where you are this is a lot of
sensitive data and even though Google
home hasn't had any voice breaches like
Amazon Alexa it is worth knowing that
you can still delete everything so let's
delete my voice recordings from my
activity first go to my activity
google.com also just so you know most of
these steps are similar on mobile and
from there you're gonna find all of your
previous search history from the
beginning of time to present day and
from here I can filter by voice products
so I want to delete just voice
recordings from my Google account here's
the filter and here's everything from
yesterday earlier I asked what's my name
and from here I can click on the
hamburger icon select delete and the
query is permanently deleted from my
account
purportedly from there I can also go to
another query from 1109 am the same day
click on the hamburger icon click
details and I can get some more specific
details as to what device I used what
app it was used with and even location
if
pinged I can still go on the hamburger
icon over here and select delete and
that's that it should come as no
surprise that google has this sort of
data on you after all it's how it's ads
and services work right now there's no
telling if deleting this data however
affects the way that these services work
for you the only thing we have to go on
is the pop-up that says deleted data
can't be recovered which leaves me under
the impression that deleted data from my
Google account is permanent but without
official confirmation from Google I'm
skeptical
while having access to recordings is
great if you want stricter control on
your Google data you also have to be
able to face the truth but if you're
going to use a machine that relies on
voice commands to carry out functions
you need to be able to give it those
voice recordings in order for it to
improve and to function otherwise turn
off the lights yourself thanks for
watching let me know what your favorite
smart assistant is in the comments and
be sure to stay tuned to youtube.com for
slash silvered for more videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
