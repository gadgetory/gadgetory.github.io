the single best VR headset I've ever
used for more than half an hour at a
time
technically the Viper free is not the
finished HTC vive that's going to be
coming out in April but from everything
we've seen the Harper looks almost
exactly the same the downside of this is
that the pre definitely has kind of a
1980s jacking into cyberspace field even
compared to other VR headsets it's a
little bit bulky and it's got this large
front facing camera that should be able
to show you the outside world when you
hit a button or you go out of bounds of
its trackers then there are these cables
back here which run down into an
incredibly long cord that you're gonna
have to steer clear of as you move
around with this cable so long because
the vibe actually gives you a lot of
space to move around in but thanks to
these two boxes around here called
lighthouses and what they do is spread
lasers across a pretty large section of
the floor and then sensors on the
headset and controllers will pick that
up and calibrate exactly where you are
in virtual space to okay I've got my
headphones plugged in it's adjusted so
it's not gonna give me a headache which
it will if it is even a little bit too
tight I'm gonna put on these headphones
and I can actually see where these
controllers are because in the game they
appear as a pair of hands so this is job
simulator and it's mostly an excuse to
throw things around with your controller
so this is where the vibe really comes
into its own because I'm actually
walking around my office cubicle getting
some donuts throwing some cups of things
photocopying some phones and this
obviously looks clumsy because that's
kind of the joke of the game but it's
really precise and so if I hit this
button it feels exactly what like what I
might be doing with my hands normally I
can get some really bad motion sickness
in VR if you're moving even a little bit
in a game but here I barely even noticed
it that's mostly because when I walk
here it is one to one motion I am
walking in physical space and virtual
space so this is a game called final
approach you are landing air
and generally being a flight controller
so obviously I have a lot of space here
but not everybody's going to and that's
pretty okay for the vibe a lot of the
games you really only need to be able to
move a little bit in every direction
enough to land these little planes
it's even got a setting for just
standing absolutely still he's crashing
all these airplanes crushing them
horribly so the controllers are
obviously one of the best parts of the
vibe because they really let you feel
like you're interacting with space this
is really what sets a high end headset
apart from something like Google
cardboard which is that you're able to
create things you're able to really
affect the environment you're able to
actually get something that feels just a
little like reality I'm playing tilt
brush right now which is a 3d painting
app it's really detailed and really
responsive but it's also a sign that the
controllers really could be designed a
little bit better they're a little bit
heavy and being able to hold them like
remotes is great sometimes but sometimes
it also just feels kind of unnatural it
feels like I'm twisting my hand in weird
directions to paint when I would be
holding something like a pencil most of
what you do you do with a little
trackpad here and a trigger here but
there's also a home button right under
that trackpad which is a great idea it's
a pause menu it's the way you launch
games but it's also right under my thumb
so when I'm doing something really
exciting look there's the whole steam
menu that's great so like a lot of VR
the vibe asks you to just imagine your
relationship with a computer is
completely and fundamentally different
you're not really inputting commands
you're actually using yourself and
putting yourself into some version of a
game it can feel really natural and can
turn some things that are you know great
but a little mundane in the real world
into just amazing experiences so I'm
just hearing ninja training
slashing fruit as one does the thing
that's really unique about the vibe is
that your body feels the effects of the
things that you're doing that might not
be great in the long run because it
means that it kind of limits how much
you can do with the experiences
but it's really fulfilling the promise
of virtual reality so I'm going to
withhold judgment on this until the
actual final version comes out but
everything I've seen so far has been
fantastic and the big question is going
to be whether they can put enough good
experiences on this that it's worth
using in the long term it's nothing else
it's the first time I've spent five
hours playing a one-minute fruit ninja
demo so I'm optimistic</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
