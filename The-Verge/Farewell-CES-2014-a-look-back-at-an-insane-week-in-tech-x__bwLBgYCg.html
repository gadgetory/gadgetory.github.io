insane you know I'm sorry for people who
live in Las Vegas it's a terrible place
to be as a city dump the show is can be
very stressful
lots of announcements lots of companies
cheerleading their products and talking
about their amazing innovations the food
is bad the show can often be
disappointing in places but it's also
often exciting and interesting in
fascinating it works there were some
very cool things here we saw some stuff
that I think God is pretty excited oh my
god but oh my god what's happening it's
IRL Gran Turismo it's a blast
oh this is the car of the future right
here oh boy this is awesome I want to
take one of these home right now coming
up throw everything will be fine yeah so
we'll find us out here right we're gonna
go through periods where your smartphone
is able to get dramatically better but
on the flip side we're gonna have things
like the Model S and bullet trains and
doing infrastructure and energy
initiatives and things that are like
really big the most terrifying fun you
can have at the hands of a fully
automated robotic car
what's amazing about this is that we get
the entire Virg team in one room with
our video team with our product team and
everybody's like in one big room for a
week straight we're having conversations
in real time about stories that are
breaking
we're like swapping ideas what's amazing
to me is that we have a team full of
like brilliant incredible fascinating
funny people and I think that we all
like each other which is extremely rare
I feel and that is what makes us kind of
awesome regardless of what the shows
like and if we find something cool at
the show that's like a bonus we got a
fire truck here it's the best thing ever
right off the horn earlier now I don't
have any experiences left to have
see you in the future suckers</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
