verge mobile show where we talk about
mobile things facebook we're going to
talk we're going to talk about Facebook
and we're not going to talk about the
fast and the furious because we are
missing chris ziegler is on location
report I don't think that's a good
reason to not talk about the facts the
furious I just want to think we just
talked about to fasten figures anyway
they got a release date or something I
don't know whatever I'm dieter bohn I'm
glad 7 i'm dan seifert and it's episode
43 it is the week of april fifteenth i
am learning how to use my new desk chair
I'm sitting instead of standing and so
I'm doing a lot of bouncing around and
it's killing me but it's so worth dying
to have a chair what Jerry said what
motto is it it's some knockoff of the
knock-off designer something or other I
don't know that it's some important it's
not like an Eames but it's some like
well-respected chair and it's a cheap
knockoff of said well respected sure so
nice um so yeah I'm going to d2 Davis
right so why don't we show you the chair
I can I could stand up and lift the
chair into the view of the camera if you
please do and then can send us about the
office in the meantime oh my god we're
good I'm supposed to talk about the
office yes yeah so I'm in our studio uh
in New York it's one of our new studios
and you weren't a I'm wearing a
shirt and I do have pants on because
when you're in a studio with other
people you have to wear pants this
certainly worth beginning to a mobile
show ever Dida was that ahem minute I
think it might have been I told you it's
knockoff of a decent shirt okay well
okay well county doesn't have a minute
knockoff okay yeah I'm satisfy had a
transition set up for this but I totally
talk let's just jump into the news so a
dive into mobile is happening right now
all things D puts on a conference I
don't know how often they do it but
fairly often is it's at least once a
year maybe it's twice I don't know
they've they've got a bunch of speakers
that come in and drop little hints and
nuggets of information and then
concurrently with that we just saw a
story go up on PC Mag by Sascha Segan
and the drumbeat of excitement for
motorola actually releasing an android
phone that is good and isn't completely
beholden to verizon is getting stronger
so Dan you talked about you wrote about
this uh this just right size story right
uh yeah I mean it feels to me what's the
what's the so um pcmag was able to speak
to Jim wicks who's Motorola's chief of
design and he said a lot of things that
are like the things that we want to hear
when somebody's talking about developing
a new android phone he said that they're
working on a stock Android device so
something that's going to have the stock
android software without a whole lot of
bloatware and then it's going to be
quote a just right size which he didn't
specifically say what size that would be
but we can assume that it's going to be
smaller than the you know 4.7 4.8 or
five inch devices that are very popular
in dominating the market now for
especially for high-end Android devices
so I mean this is I feel like we talked
about this at every single mobile show
Vlad and I and all of us have been you
know clamoring for a high-end Android
device that's a smaller size and running
stock Android and we were almost there
almost there with the first so close I
mean it's it's a mid-range device that's
got you know an old version of stock
Android it's very comfortable to use in
one hand but you know it'd be great if
Motorola was able to pull through on
this and then actually make this happen
when you say all of us but there is
actually a disturbing disturbance to our
agreement which is actually I think Neil
I was saying he wanted a bigger device
than the first yeah and he wasn't seen
what was going on with him i guess i saw
i haven't actually confronted him about
that
but I saw that earlier today and I
negatives 4.3 right yes so I was
bouncing between the first and the nexus
for today and I gotta say I think like
4.5 is is my happy zone it's my happy
spot I think if if the bezel is
appropriately small and actually that's
one of the things that the this motorola
guy actually pointed out in his
interview was that the bezels and these
new devices will be made as small as
they possibly can be which means you
know that you can fit a bigger size
screen into a smaller size device and so
if the bezels inappropriately small size
then maybe 4.5 inches is a sweet spot
for that I think 4.3 inch is great but
the interesting thing to me about this
is there they're dropping hints about
this you know next upcoming full and
they're finally saying we're going to do
something like stock Android which is
great I mean they you know their last
sort of statement in this regard was
basically will do whatever horizon tells
us to so that's good news but it it's
not the X phone right like that's still
something else that's the feeling that
that I got from his comments at least at
least one what pcmag reported it didn't
he didn't mention X phone or anything
like that and and everything that we've
heard about the X phone has said that
it's going to be like a high-end high
spec you know lack of a better phrase
balls to the walls type of device so one
thing that he did mention in this
interview was that they aren't going to
be chasing specs with these new phones
or more focusing on experience so a good
sign dude yeah I mean it depends on what
you're considering specs if he means
that we're going to put mid-range
processors and you know smaller
batteries and lower amounts of less less
amounts of RAM in the device and no
that's not a good thing but if it means
that like we're just not I mean what's
look and I'm willing to compromise on
right now screen size camera screen size
and resolution not quality but
resolution because like ATP yes I don't
need 1080p and I don't need 4.8 inches
that's what she said but
no but you know I mean that that's
that's aspect that I would be willing to
compromise on purse right okay then
we've taken that on board and the guys
motorola really gonna put into action
but that's actually a really good way to
tied into eric schmidt's appearance its
dive into mobile conference because when
he was asked about motorola what the
planning and they asked him whether it
will be a new android smartphone or
tablet he said think of them as phones
plus 0 which might mean which might mean
as Dan was saying that the motorola x
phone is indeed boasted walls everything
super specter cetera it might mean the
thing I've found yeah whoa yeah this is
you need to know what else I melton I
mean what I was thinking is actually
would go but I thinking is these 5 point
something 6-inch devices which as far as
I'm concerned are just one step too many
I'm you know that they don't really do
anything just right you know that
they're perfect so they don't fit
anybody's needs correctly yeah anything
number five inches you can call a phone
anything over seven inches you can call
a tablet but between five and six that
just seems like a dead zone my hope is
that what he's doing is just saying like
it's so amazing it's such a powerful
computer it doesn't even count as a
phone anymore it's phone plus like
that's what I'm hoping he means but what
I'm afraid he means is that there's some
extra phone gimmick now if it's a watch
or some other thing great that's cool
but it's just something about that
sounds nerve-racking to me yeah so I
mean the only thing is loading is plus
size that's the only way that I can read
it phones phones plus referring to size
and uh I was ok nevermind actually since
Chris isn't here we could we could make
a joke about there being a lot of big
and tall stores in Chicago and so they
make bigger things very much
letting it go and that's a motorola
design a phone so so maybe that's the
inspiration that's Ted uh I mean if you
only collect your focus groups from this
little demographic where everybody's
rights it's a phone that's gonna look
like a deep-dish pizza if you want to
send your complaints about our residents
the city of Chicago you dresses chr is
at the verge com that's the appropriate
place to send your your complaints uh so
okay we've got mid-range hopefully high
ish range mid high medium high medium
well range phones coming relatively soon
from motorola like I I'm expecting if
they don't announce these things that I
ill but it would be awesome if they did
but I'm expecting we should see these
things early summer is my hon chan well
I mean we see them announced early
summer and then you know on shelves by
back to school or whatever they call
that the august-september time yeah I
want to do sorry too but I went to the
wrong Eric Schmidt quote because I that
first one is not the most exciting one
like the first class plane you can read
it a million different ways the other
thing I'm reminded of is guys like
Lenovo have you talking about the pc
plus era right right so the PC era is
over now is a PC plus and then it will
be the pc double plus good set reception
so you can read that whatever way you
want to read it the more interesting
compelling and factual story from
Schmidt is to say that Motorola's
working on pure Android devices
righteous the thing we've really been in
you know gagging for yeah well fewer
android devices I'm all for that but
just another point of view as I hear he
was like a cure sorry I thought fewer uh
well right pure you just totally I was
gonna make I had a whole thing that if
you're as good as well I'm happy to help
pay for fewer and fewer phones hopefully
that means that what it's not going to
be just droids right like I want to see
a phone from Motorola
that I actually want to buy like you
guys remember the atrix HD yes I do that
for the Virgin like it was totally like
a workman like passable phone there was
nothing that was like stupendously bad
about it was just you know hey it's an
Android oh yeah bad battery life could
have been better yeah fine but the
camera kind of sucked I think I'm just
execute there and not you know give
everybody else besides verizon crap then
i could be pretty excited I would be
happy to use a motorola phone you know
cuz cuz you know I believe in America
well I mean here's the thing here's the
thing motor oil is always done really
well with and that's like the
engineering side so the the phone aspect
of it is really good the microphones
have always been really good the sound
quality is really good the reception
quality has always been really good but
then you know it all kind of falls on
its face on the design side so you know
if if this influence from google is
indeed legit and you know Google is
having a hand in directing things and
Google is influencing the the look of
the devices like it does with the Nexus
line then you know maybe they could
coalesce and and make a perfect device
that performs really well and then also
looks really well and is nice to use and
is pleasant to use let me just switch to
correct myself it wasn't Eric Schmidt
who promised appeals to stock Android
experience and that's my own phone
because actually today has been full of
news because that in to Baba has really
developed to taken off in other things
have popped up so I'm actually catching
up with a laser to the show blaring the
centrist let's make a virtual show blab
feeds the verge story time I mean
sometimes I spend more time writing than
I do reading for this website I mean we
all know we do this at CES and oh those
of it so I think that that just speaks
to how hard-working committed I am
unlike Chris who's off at the actual
conference today he's he's he's doing
work he's put up some posts he's not
just gallivanting although he isn't the
entire wrestlers day
shot dreaming about the release of fast
7 can I say how awesome is that we know
that the release date of fast 7 before
fast 6 is even in theaters I was just
thinking about that is awesome uh okay
put together these show notes because
you've got facebook home bits like
strewn all over the news is I'm sorry
it's been a busy day I through this
together like five minutes before we
came on the air so you know Yolo your
yeah Wow somebody's gonna say in Chris's
absence okay well I mean let's just do
it because there's a whole bunch of
Facebook News to talk about as long as
we were talking about Eric Schmidt we
might as well get into the comments he
made about facebook home at dive into
mobile e he said that it's a tremendous
endorsement of google play and of you
know Android and ecosystem presumably so
that's great like Google at least Eric
Schmidt although Eric Schmidt is prone
to saying crazy things that maybe the
rest of the company wouldn't want under
sec well you know what's funny is I saw
somebody I think I'm avi Greengart an
analyst tweeted this today that Eric
Schmidt is not known for being the best
source of google news because he kind of
just goes off the rails and says things
and you know maybe it happens maybe it
doesn't maybe the company feels that way
maybe it doesn't but I mean if your
google you got to be super happy that we
talked about this last week that i like
the the facebook home skin is at least
like respectful it doesn't get itself
too much into the OS and do a whole lot
of stuff i mean that may change
eventually but you got to be happy that
they didn't just straight-up fork
Android right and at least so far
facebook's comments about why don't they
fork Android why don't they launch our
own alesso have all been about well why
would we do that because even if we have
something amazingly successful we're
sewing and reach ten percent of the
market we want to reach you know one
hundred percent of the market or as much
as we possibly can get so if your google
like the fact that you're playing
ecosystem still works on facebook phones
has got to make you happy you have to do
yeah I mean I think Google can look at
facebook home just like any other
can you know from any other Android
manufacturers I mean yeah well Google
doesn't have a problem with sense it
doesn't yet have a problem with TouchWiz
it might depending on how that goes
because it doesn't have a problem with
you know Sony's a custom interface
because all of them are just you know
eventually funneling people into
Google's own services of gmail and
google play store and google talk etc so
the only thing that I could think of is
maybe you know uh the the emphasis on
facebook Messenger which is huge and
home and a big focus for for for
facebook might be a little worrisome to
Google if it's trying to capture a lot
of people in to talk but since google
has pretty much ignored talk entirely
for I don't know two years now Wow but
yeah so I mean it may not worry too much
about talk but of course then there's
this rumors that we've heard recently
about a Babel which is uh Teeter is such
a pebble Rosen he's babble trolling me
uh which is a unified chat service and
then it becomes a much more interesting
discussion to have about you know maybe
hang out with us at all is not a unified
chat service its unified II its unified
esque it's it's google talk and they're
gonna eventually do some like it tell me
what Babel is because from what I can
tell it's just google talk rebranded and
they'll eventually bring in google voice
messages and they'll maybe give you a
unified client that has SMS in there so
it looks like a unified client but
really it's just all the stuff that
google has now on a single app which is
great uh but it's not synergy right i
mean things that i will answer the
question that thing then that's fine i'm
all about that I guess but I'm not I'm
not as excited about this as i was about
synergy on webos in 2010 how awesome
question for five ways when Google
actually brought us to announce it
instead of us gathering all the rumors
and speculating and dismissing it before
it's even coming to fruition around the
poster Jeff Oh Jeff rotary yeah I know
it's a gorgeous roundup oh sweet you
discussed it last week I'm very happy
what I'm saying is give cool chance to
announce the thing before we dismiss it
as being an interesting was a fun event
lad I will take some encouragement from
the fact that Google Talk has been
essentially abandoned and untouched for
such a long time particularly a mobile
google knows the importance of all these
messaging clients we had that rumor
about google taking over whatsapp which
was unfounded and uncorroborated but and
shot that I like my word up it kind of
made sense and we just posted I believe
whatsapp slave stats which are kind of
crazy about having more users than
Twitter messages and Facebook that
absolutely blew my mind the fact that
that whatsapp has more you more active
users in Twitter I found that very
surprising and incredible and for the
fact that it's a it's a paid app right
like you have to buy it to use it and
then if you I believe on Android it's a
subscription or something like that so I
mean that they're actually you know
charging people to use it and they have
more active users and Twitter which is
you know one of the most talked about
free social networks on the planet right
now so yeah I mean look if you're I'm
going to bring this back if you're
wondering why Facebook cares so much
about messaging this is the answer
whatsapp is the answer Ellis and I went
to Facebook's campus and interviewed a
bunch of people about how they created
chat heads and like that the source of
where that came from and why it's so
important to the company and Ellis put
together a really great feature on it
and the video team put together a really
great video you should go look at all of
those things but the bottom line is like
this is what's happening right now on
mobile these messaging apps and at least
in the u.s. people aren't giving
whatsapp the attention it deserves for
the number of users it has and how
important it is and you know they're
making money but there's just a million
of these messaging apps the drivers
would be crazy but if this is why
Facebook is putting their little chat
bubbles on
everything on Android if they can get
you to use it and they also just brought
the service that's the other news today
they brought it to iOS you can get chat
heads on iphone and ipad but of course
it'll only work inside the facebook app
and you know i tried it i use it it
works really well inside the facebook
app you drag the little bubbles around
and you could swipe them down get rid of
them you know so on and so on I guess is
longer talk about iOS Willis I mentioned
that they brought stickers uh okay yeah
they're cute I mean i'ma give you things
via yeah okay so instead of sending a
little winky face or an emoji a little
emoticon thing or whatever you get this
larger larger picture and it's a cute
little face or a piece of fruit or
something funny and they come in packs
so you get a pack of like all the alien
looking stickers and all the yellow
smiley face stickers and the bunny
stickers and some of the packs are free
some of them cost a buck or whatever so
path sells these I think line was the
first messaging app to do this so kind
of like poke Facebook is taking
something that had kind of gotten
popular on other messaging apps and
integrating it and you know they're fun
you know instead of just sending a winky
face you can you know you don't have to
like tap tap it and then it goes in your
field and you can enjoy just tap on the
little sticker and boom it gets posted
hippo can before Facebook I don't know
about this what's up who had poking
before Facebook it's no joke was yes
this actually snapchat so poke is that
the facebooks version of ephemeral
messaging where you send somebody
something but it goes away after they
look at it and you also have Mark
Zuckerberg voice sing book yeah but you
know they like poke is not a raging
success but they did learn stuff from it
they're going to use that data I think
that Ellis mentioned something in his
piece that there's another feature
coming for for facebook messaging that
that is based on the lessons they
learned from folks something like that
so they're going to continue to add
stuff and they're going to continue to
push really hard to get you to use their
service to just talk to people I
says whatsapp and so is google because
you know something needs to replace SMS
and something needs to replace BBM and
people love using their phones to do you
know talking they love but that's what
phones are for their for communicating
with other people directly and duh
everybody wants to like win I gotta stay
I've been using chat heads on all my
android devices since it was released to
the market last week for us right yeah
well yeah I mean I've been using it
because Facebook was smart to integrate
SMS if they didn't integrate SMS with it
I wouldn't i would have tested it and be
like oh cool and never seen it again i
don't really get a whole lot of facebook
messages but you know it works awesome
and i love it and like you know i can be
catching up on my twitter feed and you
know someone sends me a text and I can
boom reply right back without ever
leaving my twitter app or I can you know
be reading something and you know it's
just it feels like you know the way that
messaging should be done on a mobile
device it's like right there it stays
out of the way when I don't eat it but
it makes itself it's focused when I do
need it and it doesn't take me away from
the task that I'm doing a hand uh or
make me completely switch around and you
know I showed it to my wife and and she
did not care about the facebook home
announcement at all even though she's
his facebook all the time on her iPhone
um she's like I don't want this on my
home screen I don't want this on this
cover I think this is stupid and I
showed her the chat saying she's
actually like well that's actually
pretty cool because i always i hate
bouncing around between different apps
to you no reply to text messages when
i'm doing something else so I think you
know Facebook really did hit on
something smart with the way that the
chat heads I you know stupid name and
everything are implemented on at least I
on Android noises then let me actually
bring it back to the point where I
disagreed about Google treating this is
just another Android skin I know your
point was being made about the fact that
Facebook isn't infringing on Google's
territory and it isn't trying to take
over the entire Android
experience an environment the weather
amazon is trying to do but the
distinction with Facebook is just so
many users Facebook has and how many
uses it can bring to the Android
platform we know androids become near
enough ubiquitous has a massive market
share it has a millions and millions of
activations Eric Schmidt cited the
latest number jet was was in the
hundreds of millions and you're saying
that by the end of this year he
anticipates they have a billion Android
devices out there with probably a
hundred thousand of them running
Gingerbread but whatever here besides
that though even that being the case
even if you have a billion devices
there's always untapped markets and M it
also stressed it's not about the two
billion people that are already
connected to the web today are already
connected with a mobile device or
smartphone today it's about the next
five minute and about when they'll be
connected how to be connected what
they'll be doing and I think that's so
so part of what to have success as far
as I know what's happening says when
these developing markets and that is
probably part of the reason why it
hasn't been such a big emphasis over
here any in the u.s. because correct me
if I'm wrong but you know people use
whatsapp to replace SMS and in in the
markets where it's been successful
there's SMS is still pretty high cost
right you have to pay for a bucket of
messages or per message whereas here in
the US most people are on unlimited SMS
plans that are baking under their voice
plan and there's you know a little
reason for them to switch to another
service because their their monthly cost
isn't really going to go down right
right exactly but what I'm saying is the
reason we might underestimate what taps
influence and importance might be
precisely because of what he just said
because it might have had some success
in the US but not the same as his head
in another market and the reason once
app is important the reason Facebook is
important is because people like details
what was it no your wife down cuz cuz it
deters work
very okay but people like your wife
let's say for example or details aren't
our favorite example person they might
be using facebook status of interface
and all of a sudden there's a little
pop-up they're saying why don't you try
out facebook on your mobile device and
where do I go to get facebook home on an
Android device and then BOOM Google
setting another Android device so yes
when Eric Schmidt says facebook home is
a big endorsement Google Play he's
absolutely right because Facebook could
have to the detriment of the user
experience absolutely if it we could
have tried to do its own app store could
could have I don't know plugged into
amazon stuff so could have done
something else apart from google play
but key there's no reason that they
couldn't in the future either i mean oh
yeah plants on developing this heavily
they've said you know monthly updates
and they already announced their next
ones coming in a few weeks in the middle
of a so there's no reason to get it's
fixing to people you can play you will
start spending some money the google
play app so you will you will at least
experienced the ecosystem and you start
appreciating the good apps are there
until I mean what this actually makes a
lot of a facebook to do its own app
store what this is really about is money
right so is it is the amount of money
that can that a company that can be made
off of a phone in terms of advertising
and in terms of app sales and music
sales and everything else you say is it
a zero-sum game or is it you know this
is the sky the limit when you hit the
point of diminishing returns so if I'm
google the only reason I'm concerned
about facebook home is that it will when
they start putting ads on cover feed
then it will diminish you know people's
tolerance for ads and other places where
Google makes its money and you know
eventually the law in the long game you
know Facebook could do a fuller take
over and you know move away from google
play but for now I think that it's it's
all about well hey we just sell for
android phones it's great for us and as
long as Google can make money off of
those android phones it's not a problem
the it's when it's when people like
start turning on ad blockers because
they're sick of facebook
ads and they you know associated out
their phone or it's when they stop
buying stuff in Google Play I don't know
that Google makes that much money after
play anyway that's what it becomes an
issue but it is also the services like I
said it's ads and services those are the
two key ways in which these companies
are going to be able to make the money
hardware is just painting the obvious
that you can't rely that to be the
driver for your future income right
pretty pretty much Apple can do it
because it hasn't sir it has the entire
reputation it has a track record etc etc
and it also is extremely vertically
integrated and actually having so much
control over its production chain and
being able to source materials and
things like that I mean I don't know
what it was a few weeks back we're
talking about HTC one of HD suppliers
not considering it a premier customer
anymore right so companies like HTC who
are relying on hardware and design just
buy them by itself or the ones who are
in trouble now so see ya again facebook
home is kind of going a good thing for
android today but it depends on how
vicious Mark Zuckerberg is going to be
in the future and how how much land
grabbing they want to do right it's a
good thing for now yeah I think that's
all I've got I mean I'm really
facebooked out guys I mean I you know
reviewed the phone last week was it last
week uh yeah it was last week I looked
at the updates to I iPad an iOS on
iphone I feel like there's other
Facebook stuff I'm forgetting i know
there was this story on Bloomberg
yesterday that like somebody some
product manager had said that well yeah
it'd be great if we get it on iphone and
like they spun it into well they're in
talks well no they're not really um it's
not like in order for something like
chat heads to happen on either Windows
Phone or iOS those companies would need
to you know maybe need be willing to see
like control of like the home screen
experience looks like
to Facebook and I just don't see either
Microsoft or Apple being interested in
that all right right okay the chit chats
also make Nixon no sense with windows
phone interface they just don't yeah
they're they're persistent notifications
that are at that actually work on our
actually useful so of course I mean yeah
you you want to make them work on
Windows Phone just make it square
instead of rounding there you go they
tried squares actually that was one of
the things they were was yeah the best
the other thing is that on the windows
phone home screen you can actually pin
contacts and pin their faces that I'm
sweet but that's not the point of chat
heads at least to me the point chat
heads is I'm browsing a you know the web
and then someone messages me and and now
I have to bounce out of the the web
browser to go into the messaging app or
go into this message or respond whereas
you know chat heads response i'm not
saying the windows phone has an
alternative that i'm just saying imagine
you actually do that you've actually
actually have a group of people you
contact so regularly that you just pin
their faces to your home screen and then
you have chat heads on the side it is
going to be an utter mess with visually
make with your wife's on the home screen
and then you got your chat on the side
for the other oh hey do you think people
have ever had like really massive browse
over how big a tile they get one person
so sweet haha hi did you know hierarchy
I don't think that's you know that's
like going back to that classic Seinfeld
episode where you know Jerry's and a
higher speed dial with his girlfriend
than her mother is or something like
that I don't think that argument has
ever happened to put Windows Phone
device though just just a hunch I'm so
no surprises some sign photos already
done the whole hang go Jerry made it all
the way up to emergency he was in the
emergency speed dial so for when you
need an ambulance first of all problems
as long as we've got my Windows Phone we
should point out Tom put up his review
of the Lumia lumia 720 excuse me um and
you know it looks like a really good
high-end mid-range how do i how do we
characterize this phone it's like
it's like mid mid you know I think it's
it's a mid-range phone but it's a really
nice mid-range I would characterize it
as one of a growing number of devices
that just crying out for stock Android
that's it like I know your name I need
to give that category of devices a name
the HTC first is the first direction and
get it right so it's a service name but
yeah other than like basically like the
camera is the the point where I feel the
most pain on these devices but it's
amazing what a mid-range phone is now
like the 720 and the first it's like
totally acceptable for a wide range of
people and a company seem to be getting
the point that like you need to make
these phones at this price point
actually decent and um I mean maybe it's
just the march of technology I mean I
hate to use this word because it's it's
overused in so many different ways but
you know it's it feels like the
trickle-down effect right yesterday's
high end is today's mid-range and that
seems like it's its trains like
essentially the 720 is a slim down a
thinner nicer-looking 900 right it's got
a similar screen resolution similar
trying to look and feel ram on the 720 s
a bummer though yeah well I mean the
resolution itself is a bummer because
it's only an EVGA but and it is it's
already frustrating because is the 720
just put a 720p display on the bus and
begging for it right yeah absolutely
begging for it it's like it's like the
ultimate troll you know this is like I
mean I look at it and I just think of
the HTC 8x absolutist year yeah
absolutely i as far as I'm concerned
this is Nucky's very good answer to the
HTC when I an 8x before the 720 though I
mean what I I you know that's a really
hard called either because I mean I
guess you know Nokia's been branching
out at software services and offering
them to nokia devices but the the big
draw for me at least is if i'm looking
in the windows phone
old and I'm you know exclusively looking
in there no he has a huge advantage over
the other manufacturers with its
exclusive app services between ok music
now Nokia drive has been you know made
available to other phones but you know
there's there's other ones as well that
are really more compelling than what the
other manufacturers offer you know with
this phone world would make a great
theme park I would totally go to Windows
Phone world what do you anticipate
seeing there apart from lots and lots of
books yeah well they're the rides would
have to be you know getting on a
floating square and going shooting
across a black ocean you could have like
a free-for-all drop for Nokia's market
share just called no keys Marcus shared
it's just sorry it was too easy ipod you
could have a hedge maze of trying to
find quality apps yes yes that's that ok
the hedge maze yes yeah awfully slow
music angry today cuz like the thing is
we all liked the idea of windows phone
was just like we can't use it we want to
and that's what makes ya to keep the
hate mail from coming in next we're
gonna hate on blackberry actually do we
have any blackberry hate today uh we
have we'll do a story you know I don't
know if the time you put your bagman I
believe everybody because this is melz
we've hit Chicagoans we're hitting
Windows Phone we wanna make sure we get
everybody else fast in the furious yeah
it fast enough years it's a terrible
terrible series if I was America and
I've embarrassing and I can say that
because I know Chris Conte cover an
entire ocean in few seconds oh I'll
survive I'll live at least another thing
you know it worse and faster the Furious
for people that like BMWs oof ah and
double sours and and and bright bright
colored sneakers yeah are we done no
sorry that was busy the Windows Phone
bit the point about finding apps is is
them such a frustrating thing to me and
to many other people meet someone the
guy who reviewed the 720 I think he
under rated are giving it a seven
I i would spend just as much time
playing with the 720 as i did with
Windows Phone 8x I really love this
planet that but the hurdle that every
Windows Phone has to overcome is the
lack the lack of apps and not just that
but also the amount of crap that there
is in the woods alone at the Windows
Phone store now that's crap in every
store though oh yeah but it's worse
there there there are so many fake apps
there's so many duplicates there's just
too much crud no I do Google Play is
just as bad it's just that they've done
a decent job of showing you the stuff
that's good right well Google Play in
and the App Store have the good stuff to
show you exactly that's the problem yeah
in Indiana plan I wanted to just raise
is that Microsoft is exhibiting some of
these same issues or Windows 8 I've
actually started using it boot camp it
on my imac lady and it just some things
everything looks good and and their
whole emphasis on fast and fluid over
mobile and desktop is absolutely present
and accounted for in a software and I
know the software and the pinnings a
really robust the some of the decisions
they make end of regulation that they
need to do are just bad and and the
windows a store it's just as bad as a
Windows Phone store and these things
just need to be fixed because Microsoft
is increasingly turning into the
software version of Sony as far as uncle
eating my eyes insofar as they do a
bunch of things right and a bunch of
things better than other people but then
they screw up basic things that you kind
of expect them to be able to get right I
think that's more valuable to this
podcast and trolling Chris oh you're so
wrong all right hey why are we talking
about google glass we have big huge
google glass news yesterday that's in
our purview right right only talking
about it because it's purely theoretical
now they're the rolling of the
production lines they get we aspects and
they just release package
at least a SDK it turns out with the
really interesting thing is that you
they're not letting developers charge
for apps or put advertising in their
apps we know what the apps look like now
they basically all are part of a
timeline of cards and so you kind of
inserted the timeline it pops up and
then it goes away and you can scroll
through so it's kind of like a instead
of a vertical scroll through google now
you've got like it like I don't even
know how to think of it I'm totally
screaming at it with the camera here of
cards that pop up you can go to the
playground at the SDK thing and they've
got code examples of how to make a card
really basic JSON and HTML you can
actually go there and like play around
and like design your card directly on
the website it's pretty neat i made some
troll ish cards to drop into IRC to make
make fun of people at the verge last
night just one question hero how much is
google plus plus and which walmart do i
go to buy mine from okay yeah sure it's
like it's just launching to the people
that pay for the the developer versions
for like yes the Russian oligarchs and
Josh but like don't you think that this
is I think it's talk it's totally within
our purview I mean it's it this is like
I love you and everything is good enough
for you can tell come on I mean no come
on where the verge mobile show does not
mean that you know we're gonna forever
talk about slate devices that you hold
in your hand eventually mobile
technology is going to shift and
transform and change and I think Google
glass is one way that it's going to be
going yes and if I can say Eric Schmidt
for the 11th time this podcast because
obviously things were only source he
said during his interview he said that
there was this prediction made about how
you have about 10 IP addresses about
your body within however many years
right this point was that the next big
horizon or the next big development will
probably be in things like fitness and
medical equipment ingestible pills that
would transmit data about your internals
and tell you how terrible that big mac
is for your body in all over social
so absolutely this stuff's happening and
I actually think going to do something
I'm busy playing Tetris on my watch yeah
I think you're busy trolling me as well
but the reason I'm not excited about
google glass everybody else is because
we are still struggling to figure out
how to deal with 4-inch display how to
best use it how to get people the best
interface I think I think we're really
primitive in terms of software
interfaces for handheld devices I mean
four inches seven inches whatever when
you get into actual tablet sizes were
spoken about that how tablet UI is part
of Google's big sort of software problem
with Android and it's one of its biggest
weaknesses that is to overcome so given
how slow our development is we're
getting something as comfortable let's
say as a 4 inch 5 inch device to be well
to maximize its utility I just look at
these tiny little displays that you get
on google glass and just I just don't
feel any happy anticipation and its
people going to screw it up and forget
it right like what is this interesting
to me is because like look at the
interface that they have designed and
it's it's this weird interesting mix of
completely ephemeral notifications and
like actually useful stuff but they it's
built for a thing where you only have a
couple of ways to interact with it
you've got some voice but you know I
don't I don't want us to stop thinking
about how to interact with digital
things because we haven't figured out
that is the first thing I mean we'd
still be using you know Apple tues and
TRS and whatever else oh sure I'm just
using their file cost performance to
indicate future predictions I actually
think like it could be interesting like
the the UI that they built it's clearly
not too heavy for you know what this is
and it you know depending on what people
make for it it could be interesting now
the big question is you know one I mean
there's still the creeper question right
do you really want camera you know
pointing at you all the time
the other question honestly is one day
under standard use like that's not
enough yo that is not a I mean yeah
we're not fine where do we find that's
not enough on our smartphones so yeah
yeah that doesn't enough yo no sé I am
I like my pebble less you know two three
four days depending on how much I'm
screwing around with it and that how
much how much tetra circulating how much
Tetris I'm playing how much I'm changing
watch faces which is a lot now that
they've released an SDK and you can you
know download them honestly I wouldn't
be worried about having a camera facing
over time yeah if you're in public you
don't anything awkward and weird ever
you're you're a classy guy you live a
classy life I'm I do embarrassing
horrendous things all the time I I'm
surprised I haven't fallen down during
this show I'm sitting there I'm
surprised I haven't tripped over
something like look what I'm gonna say
is if you're in public in any sort of
circumstance alley again speaking to the
developed world rather than the entire
world most of the time you have ten or a
dozen cameras facing you because people
have their phones out right right you
get it you get longer on the ground it's
phone phone phone phone phone headphones
plugged into a phone phone phone phone
like I want to use my phone but I look
around I just feel like it's 1984 and I
want to break out of it so I put my
phone away in those circumstances you
silently rebel people yes I silently
judge everyone which is a national
tradition here in the UK just be a
little bit different and then you can
judge everyone that's the trick ok I got
nothing else a book I mean I do but that
clearly you don't want me to talk about
class anymore so what's one so uh what
is going on with sprint like this is
crazy to me I mean this is something so
this justice recap the news this week a
dish network threw out a bid to
to purchase the company for twenty five
point five billion dollars which is a
larger number than what softbank and
they have variously gone after so okay
actually I mean we could go on and on
yeah this is you know the story line
does my ears like whatever the satellite
we could go way back but like to start
with the dish saga dish really wants get
into wireless they made a bid on
clearwire to try and keep to try and get
into the wireless game to try and keep
sprint from basically fully acquiring
them as part of the deal where softbank
is buying sprint and like through some
financial mechanisms and borrowing or
whatever it looks like sprit probably
managed to make that not happen because
they have shared blah I don't even know
but so dishes like all right fine you
won't let us buy your subsidiary we're
just gonna buy you as they may offer to
buy sprint out from softbank like
they're just they're just like the like
the craziest like cell phone murder
trolls there are it's amazing I guys
totally hilarious it seems crazy but I
mean that's a really serious bid right
like that's something that sprint has to
uh you know seriously consider and in
the interest of its shareholders because
it is more money than what soft Bank is
offering uh and then you know it's a
dish has made the argument that it's it
can offer a lot more benefits to sprint
and Softbank can because it's a US
company and they already have
infrastructure and other things set up
here etc I think disagrees yeah of
course something disagrees and and
that's you know definitely pop act like
you know what we did he know right you
guys might be happier together so you
know but it's it I think it'd be pretty
crazy uh if dish did end up purchasing
sprint it would leave so far you know
right now ATT and Verizon both have
either sister companies or they are you
know offer the services themselves of a
home broadband fiber based internet
service it would give sprint a home
internet based service through satellite
but and then it would leave t-mobile out
in the cold
so that that would just suck so bad
thinking about it right now creating
this hegemony of ah I don't even live in
the US and I'm scared for you guys if
you just have three or four even four
major companies and they have control of
your broadband connectivity oh come on
janitor's world five companies control
loading channel five percent of all
media like we're already swollen guys
you have to fight it yes you got to put
that phone away give a disapproving look
I know that it sounds scary to have yet
another giant corporate hegemony um but
I gotta say Charlie Ergen uh guy charged
a dish is hilarious 200 well he's not
allowed on success is not John Legere
hilarious no let's not go that far he's
pretty good like uh we'll put a link in
the show notes he was at the dive into
media conference to talk about dish and
talk about the hapa and everything else
earlier this year and um I mean he's
just super funny i I'd highly I really
enjoy having him uh you know running a
cell phone company listen don't
undersell softbank CEO because this guy
is extremely ambitious he was inspired
by steve jobs i believe i think chris
wrote up a really nice profile on him
when the whole softbank offer was put
forward initially i think actually one
of our I think Jeff did in Japan just
alright Curt I know I know Chris was
involved in it because he was he was
saying how soft Bank CEO is a complete
badass and we need to write write about
it and discuss it so this potential
there there's something for us to
explore on the CEO front which is
evidently so important to data but more
intriguingly also dish of describe their
proposal is a merger so not necessarily
a takeover and there was a rumor
suggesting that what the dish is trying
to do here is
put together the foundations for
potential future merger with tmobile
down the line which is a room d-3
shaking his head so I'm good I'm just
like in my sense like Verizon offered to
buy some spectrum off of clearwire
recently we had this crazy you know if
you read the SEC filing about how the
sprint softbank deal came together all
of these sec filings always got the
company a so this and company be set
this and that company d yeah I think
frozen verizon the verizon clear oh I
think they were like company j yeah
company yeah is is way down the line I
mean if you're if you're an executive of
a wireless company or a company that
wants to break into wireless in America
you must just be spending all of your
time drinking scotch and smoking rooms
trying to make sneaky deals with people
that must be all you do because that's
all they're like this there's all their
due time for given how much crap we see
these people trying to you know get
together and do stuff it blows my mind
like how much like back what what what
drink do you think Charlie Charlie Ergen
orders the data this is what executives
doomed that's the whole point that's
what you learn in those NBA's that
people take smoking rooms or during the
ride drink on the rocks hold the
something else no need howdy LA and the
olive the fact that there's even an
olive in the conversation shows that
you're never gonna be but do you drink
yes yes I drinkwise inside milk soy milk
I'm drinking coconut milk lately
unsweetened dude you know what coconut
milk you need to check your ingredients
because Oh No Deal is terrible there's
nothing there's like there's like this
is what I'm saying one of these almond
milks and literally there is a brand of
almond milk in the UK where the first
ingredient is sugar because it sucks
sugar in them open and you have the list
ingredients by size by pure volume just
like water sugar omens no
put something percent it's yeah and
that's corporations for you there you go
it will push the end cuz of the smoky
rooms sit I think we're also bit
outdated now smoking rooms are I don't
know man way back there with Lucky
Strikes in happy well I don't know I
think I can't you have that in like a
private club where all these guys are
going to be right well I I just I just
think modern executives modern CEOs are
a bit more health-conscious nowadays so
maybe maybe to do it in poorly lit
gymnasiums or something like that Thomas
maybe to do what I'm breaking a sweat
and matching it up in front of one
another wow I imagine that if that's a
deals get done it's like you know what
if steam room which is fought me on the
scale if you Steve Ballmer challenges
even eat up and says dude if you could
do 40 push-ups on your knuckles on your
knuckles right I will give you a billion
dollars per yeah I promise I'm Stephen
Elop surprises him and does those
push-ups and this is why Nokia now gets
a billion dollars EU from Microsoft so
good but on what serious point actually
on a more serious note thank you because
I can't think about these hangouts and
the fact that i have this custards
colored background I'm not sure bring us
back on topic dude this isn't telling
this isn't topic and then I thought
about when people get caught in on skype
unlike official news broadcast and
things like that and you have professors
and academics and the way they prove the
academic credentials most of time is
that their background is always a
library stack full of books and the more
academic they are the more uniform house
books are like vol.1 thick leather bound
volume to volume 3.45 I think Dida has
volumes but i think is something like
yellow hospitable in at home is that why
light yes i think he's got the
your games it'll crash I'll snow crash
nice new media politics who train
manifesto by 50 50 shades of grey the
city of tomorrow and it's planning
little caboose ta what's up Priya pretty
hipster collection but but my point was
that over time all of these things are
kind of eroding and all of the furniture
that used to have in in your regular
living room things a con topic this
isn't something that bear with me go
there with me it's just the topic comes
at the end it's like it's like I don't
know what's a good analogy but the good
stuff comes at the end but it's fair
with me here I really hope it does the
point is all the regular furniture that
people used to have like if I want to be
well informed I would do well to have my
own library specs like I known as in my
house in Bulgaria one of one of the
walls in one of our biggest rooms in the
house which is dedicated to libraries
and books and that's how you got your
information now these are the older
books that my parents read and then
their books that I would have access to
but now you can just get it in phone now
you can just get it in a mobile device
and in a kindle so either even the whole
reading experience doesn't degenerate by
going digital but you can get all of
that contracted and the other phone it
was actually a study that just came out
that the way our brains work we
recognize letters as physical objects
and so moving into digital actually
impedes our reading comprehension
because our monkey brains can't handle
digital words as easily as we can of his
accord it's true fair enough although
where's the pill waiting for the a
little no one's is to two-dimensional
coming whether or not Kim the Warner
book page just saying man science can't
argue with science oh yes we can if it's
statistically based a statistically food
piece of research you can there is such
a thing as bad science that's true but
you can't argue with good size this is
great science there's less okay there's
also weird science uh
from the mid 80s ladies did we get to
your point lad did it happen did we hear
it my point data is that this home
mobile and digital revolution I'm
including large screen TVs in this
because i was thinking i don't actually
need one or want to use one because
there are old these are the devices of
the Moshlings on like the mobile digital
revolution is changing everything and
that's what I had noticed recently that
even the way we furnish our homes is
going to change like nowadays the people
who actually do dedicate space in their
homes for physical book libraries or
either legitimately into the physical
tomes and get actual pleasure out of it
or just hipsters who want to present
themselves as being academically well
you have to the data to the data Jones
close the world the two could go
together I'm just okay so you can be
both vain and in love with physical
books i grant you dad I've made my point
we can move on we can move on this way
to CEOs oh really she posed this podcast
in reverse order because it's gotten
better and better instead of them hey
hey t-mobile met I don't even there's
nothing I could possibly bring out that
happen in the mobile world that is
anywhere near as interesting as what
just happened oh the flag resistant
retailing and how blackberry freaked out
yeah okay we've seen these like they've
returns of outpaced sales stories before
and they usually end up being wrong and
usually the companies like know whatever
but blackberry totally flipped out and
they said it's absolutely false and they
asked for regulators to investigate the
issue I don't know I mean I they did
better than I expected the last
quarterly call and they're going to have
their blackberry live thing in orlando
next month so hopefully will actually
release the the q10
because that's the one I think I'm ready
for no I'm serious look use the fact
that we're still waiting for that too it
is ridiculous actually they need to get
that thing out the door I actually do
what wish that they would make a
vertical slider because because they did
so well with the torch naked all right
what's a torch I still see torches no I
mean it'sit's it but it was a bad device
that's what they executed so well with
the torch is what I was trying to say
well I mean I think that given the
constraints of the operating system that
they were still working with but that
wasn't the problem with the torch the
torch was it had a bad screen and a bad
keyboard and like that was the two
things that you want on a vertical
sliding portrait keyboard phone is a a
good screen like obviously a good keep
March I thought it was okay if you
compared to like a bold keyboard I mean
it was no comparison is flat it was
mushy didn't have the big wheel savages
me too keyboard to the torch keyboard so
that's that's kind of everything you
need to know right there let me throw in
a laypersons experience here because
Thomas Ricker who is our European editor
and one of our most senior voices in
most experienced voices on the side
decided to listen to Paul Miller ones
and bought well advised his wife to buy
a torch home so Paul Meadows like I'll
not do does he the torch it's kind of
nice so then Thomas is why she bought a
torch and she was just thoroughly very
disappointed with it surprising Thomas
still married well surprisingly indeed
because Thomas brings it up every time
you see spoke is like a pro remember not
to so maybe dieter maybe if they're able
to rely actually execute well on a new
version of the torch how we're doing
people in the background Katie mayor
come on this is great no helmet yep
Levi's holding the first that's what he
wants everybody to know yeah the eye on
Sergei phone okay so I have neither oh
my god second person is this is terrible
completely over like a real-life chat
head I'll leave now I think that's an
excellent way to wrap us this episode in
the merge mobile show ladies and
gentlemen with real live chat heads the
verbal will show thank you so much for
watching and listening and bearing with
us we're go get some sleep and drink
heavily not in that order if you want to
follow us you can and you should we're
on twitter i am at back lawn Vlad's I
flats above dan is DCC for Chris who's
not here is Zed power not GV but just
said we're all at verge you can email us
you can leave a comment on this post
right now or when they put these show up
properly and thank you so much and next
week are we back oh one one one thing
that I'm getting a reminder that we're
up for a bunch of webbie's so go vote oh
