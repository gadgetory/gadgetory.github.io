interface for mac and pc with real-time
UAD processing and what that means in
humans speak is the interface can run
all of the UAT two powered plugins
library on input with no latency this is
a mixing console that represents what
Apollo actually does inside and here
you've got these plugins running so
these are classic vintage plugins
emulating exactly what these pieces of
hardware did but now they can run on the
input right into your dog or your
reporting software so that's a pretty
cool thing the next cool thing that's
really neat about it is this product
also you is used to run plugins inside
of any recording software like pro tools
logic live garage band etc you can run
our plugins right off this box as well
so what we're seeing here is the ability
to run our plugins on the input or run
them on the background while you're
mixing and again you have access to the
best-sounding plugin is on the market
today some of the other things that are
cool about the product it's the first
Thunderbolt audio interface available in
the market an option cards locks right
into the bag and you can connect it to
the latest Macintosh computers there's
also some new pcs have been announced
with the latest technology of
Thunderbolt this product will be
compatible with those computers which is
really really exciting it's got firewire
800 standard which can connect to any
laptop imac but it also has Thunderbolt
so for the lace computers from an apple
that don't have firewire like the
macbook air specifically you can
actually hook up Apollo right to your
computer and it's got all of the DSP
processing built in so you don't need to
worry about how powerful your computer
is this box has all the power the
product is available in two different
SKUs a duo and a quad and what that
means is one has to shark DSPs one has
four all that means is you can do more
plug-in processing on the front end and
the back end when you're using using it
in that way
Flo the product will be shipping in
March and again you can find out more
