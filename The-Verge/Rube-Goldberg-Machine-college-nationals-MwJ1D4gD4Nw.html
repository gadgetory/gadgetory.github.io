jack-o'-lantern and a bus it's a ghost
which pulls a string which tore his
candy into a jack-o'-lantern
just about everything that could go
wrong with that has gone wrong we have
rebuilt that jack-o'-lantern probably
dozens of times and every time that we
would reset up the Machine something
would move like the back wall would tilt
just the slightest bit and we'd have to
redo it all again that's Rebecca Taraki
a freshman at Penn State University and
she's in Columbus Ohio for the 2015 Rube
Goldberg machine contest college
students from all over the country are
here to show off the funniest smartest
most ingenious contraptions they could
come up with and they're pretty serious
about it we would work ten to five at
the very least every Saturday and Sunday
you usually run later than that starting
November all the way till now we put in
almost 800 hours in the past year we
slept about eight hours in the last 48
hours it's been driving and doing this
in early mornings and late night hours
I've spent 16 18 hour days working on
this I think I've like woken up in the
middle of the night like oh this is how
we can do this and Rodan it down and
lots of fun
so Rube Goldberg machines were invented
by a guy named rib Goldberg they
surprised Rube was a famous cartoonist
but he was also an engineer in one of
his cartoons is about an engineering
professor named professor Lucifer Dargan
Zola Butz
who built the wackiest most complicated
machines to do the simplest tasks the
competition challenges teams to come up
with their own real-world Rube Goldberg
machines designed to complete a specific
mundane task the objective of the
machine this year is to erase a
blackboard
I think there's a certain amount of
people that would just say it's
pointless because if the goal is to
raise a chalkboard won't you just
release a chalkboard we're taking the
hardest approach to get there but I
think that curiosity in this makes this
one oh like really understand how things
work and just have fun with it so the
rules for the Rube Goldberg competition
college nationals are pretty simple your
machine has to have a minimum of 20
steps and a maximum of 75 you can't use
too many power tools and you get 10
square feet in which to operate but
since one of the goals of the
competition is to honor rubes cartoons
the spirit of the machine is important
to they'll judge you on like wins Akala
t and use of everyday objects and like
laughs barometers so how funny it is my
favorite part of the machine is probably
the slime it's really fun to watch that
one go especially because we have little
pink pin that hits the balls and they
just roll up which seems impossible but
it's just mechanics honestly I would say
my favorite part is our turkey destroyer
just for the laughs quality at the Penn
State competition the emcee was like oh
man if there was an award for best
turkey destroyer you guys would have it
he's not lying it was pretty cool with
so many moving parts the machines are
delicate to say the least
of course building them is one thing but
then you have to break them down and
move them hundreds of miles and put them
back together and pray that they work
just getting there with the machine in
one piece can be a challenge
Iowa State almost didn't get there at
all we wrecked the car once it's our
second rug it took a lot of fine-tuning
of how how much is the right amount when
they arrived at the competition the
University of Wisconsin team found that
the Machine sat a little uneven and it
made the Machine behave unpredictably
we've had runs something that's run a
hundred times perfectly and then all of
a sudden it will not work as the wall
what what do we do well how do we fix it
we change it you know that worked so
many times before and it Heather were
three times but do we touch it I don't
know this year produced Society of
Professional Engineers took the first
place but that didn't even really matter
everyone there was just happy to let
people finally see these contraptions
they've been slaving over I think also
everyone was glad to finally have a
reason to goof around with science</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
