official languages we spoke French and
English interchangeably and often in the
same sentence without ever missing a
beat but even with two languages in your
back pocket some things just don't
translate it needs interpretation it's
about humans or machines turning one
word or idea or something only one of us
understands into something we can both
appreciate uni is a tablet that can
capture and interpret American sign
language and translate into spoken
English
Brian hate Campbell is a CEO of motion
savvy the company that's developing
unique where did the idea for you come
from the overall idea I know sign
language change the voice I mean that's
pretty common
did I hire some deaf people they know
it's also feared Omaha waffle really did
contact sea of sign language actually
being captured by kanima and trap that
in some ways it's tough if the amp is a
project we have to prove our tea at the
port of leap and have poor deaf
community and with all that the core of
your mission is harder you know you saw
leap motion and you thought hey this is
something that we can use the beautiful
thing about Libre actually are two
cameras and idea to allow for death if
touch them you can put your hand
together you can overlap the doctor cool
thing about Lee okay such a breakthrough
in gasps recognition technology you have
something called a Stein builder you're
allowed to record the Pacific time and
Phi I was able to it so for example no
my sign is for a pizza pizza another
potion time for pizza pizza so I wish
time builder I open it up click record
time pizza apply that enable to it then
left I my sign they'll come out the boys
pizza which is very cool
sign builder will be an integral part of
Union when the tablets widely available
but the offline demo Ryan has now is
still pretty impressive so as you see we
have two buttons off screen you have a
sign button
I have a listen button I'm gonna head
and fresh this time right now
hello my name is Ryan
what's your name don't you have a vision
button that out and Democrat that hello
my name is Alex
nice to meet you this will be a
game-changer really cannot just jog but
after talking to fear me making you
spend I mean those deaf people I know
day within the deaf community need
nothing wrong with that but it's also a
Rizzo of as active communication option
and backed up I'm hoping to fifth with
this product
seeing union action was amazing and you
can really see how it might one day make
getting around in a world that largely
doesn't speak sign language a little bit
smoother but what about people who have
lost all mobility Jonathan Volk ah is a
brain injury researcher at waz row
Center in Albany New York he's
responsible for developing a computer
brain interface system that allows
people to control computers and type
text within minds so I'm just going to
measure your playlist circumference of
your head and I'm the length of it this
is a brain computer interface system
that a very simple one that's intended
to be used by people who are severely
disabled people who may be totally
paralyzed and really lose all means of
communication so its purpose its
immediate purposes to restore simple
communication and control to people who
have lost it see your eye blinks right
there if you blink your eyes almost
interesting there are a matrix of
stimuli that are presented they can be
you can have a matrix of letters and
numbers of function calls various kinds
of things the person might want to
select and that's a flash you see that
so every time it flashes you just count
when the person wants to select a
particular item the flash of that item
produces a response on the brain that's
different from all the other items
that's called the AHA response or the
oddball response and that's what I'm
focusing on all letters
yeah you're paying attention and you
want the eye so you're paying attention
to the eye and you notice how many times
the eye flashes me really ignoring
everything else so after a series of
flashes after a series of repetitions
the system can tell with considerable
accuracy often very high accuracy what
you want to select and can make that
selection
okay so if you could make it simple you
think of a three-letter word typically
how long does it take for somebody to
get used to the system and really feel
comfortable the the system that you're
using really it's something that's a
matter of a few hours but it does
require the setup it does require the
cap and the gel right and the person
helping women yeah yeah but I'm someone
who's paralyzed that that thoroughly is
gonna need help in any case theater you
know you mentioned this will help people
who have you know limited mobility and
who are unable to communicate what
exactly what conditions are we talking
about how the one that is seeking the
most attention and most of the people we
work with are people with a Mitrovica
lateral sclerosis or Lou Gehrig's
disease so in their variety of other
potential people with high level brain
stem stroke speak with high level spinal
cord injuries they're a variety of kinds
of disorders that might make a person
candidate for this and people are using
it right now in there there are you
ready male there are yes there are a few
people who are using it right now at
homes um what's what's the future of the
system what are you trying to improve is
it is always going to use gel well no
hopefully not there are a number of
companies now who are developing dry
electrodes hopefully we'll get something
that eventually that people can put on
just like a hat look good etc and the
electrodes will be there they'll make
contact with the skin and they'll work
we're not quite there yet but we're
moving in that direction
do you think that you know the whole
area of brain computer interfaces are
they getting is that area getting more
attention it clearly draws a lot of
attention
both scientific and popular attention I
think that will continue to be sustained
as long as the things are actually
delivered when you do in the laboratory
you're about two percent earlier right
and you're actually having people use it
as yes that yes I mean the kinds of
BCI's that we can look at in the lab are
a lot fancier and ultimately perhaps a
lot more capable than what you were
using here but the thing about that is
it's reliable and it could be used in
real life without us hanging over you
clearly technology is getting us a lot
closer the kinds of systems that allow
our favorite aliens superheroes and
sci-fi villains to talk to each other in
fictional worlds but when it comes to
communication there are certain nuances
that machines might never fully grasp or
convey and that's where human
interpreters come in Sarah Wilson is one
of the best she works as an interpreter
at the United Nations we're properly
conveying meaning is of the utmost
importance how does one become a UN
interpreter I think first and foremost
you one has to have a real natural
curiosity about what's going on in the
world also being a bit of a natural
performer what's the performance aspect
it's a stressful job if you feel nervous
you can't let that be reflected in your
voice because otherwise you would be
doing a disservice to the speaker and it
would also call attention to yourself as
an interpreter and the idea is for us to
convey the intended message of the
speaker as accurately as possible
our sincere gratitude to all of those
who supported our candidate thank you
very much mr. president
what exactly is the difference between
translation for translation deals with
the written word and interpretation is
the spoken word there are different
modes of interpretation here at the
United Nations we do simultaneous
interpretation and when you say
simultaneous interpretation at the same
time we don't work on the basis of each
word we work in units of meeting so once
you have a unit of meaning
then you will render that into in my
case into English well while you're
doing that you're also listening for the
new information is coming right and
that's something we call split attention
you have to be able to divide your
attention between taking in the
information and processing it and also
monitor your output enough to make sure
that you're making sense what happens
with of speaker is speaking in an angry
voice we try to convey that somehow it
may be through the emphasis that they
place on a given word so that's
something that we have to be very
attuned to how do you think that the
current technology to translate what
people are saying how does that compare
to an interpreter I think that the new
technologies definitely have their
applications that can be very useful I
do think in the context of conference
interpreting that a machine would never
be able to replace a human being because
our understanding of the nuances of
meaning as human beings we have a
capacity to
detect and emotions and emphases that
that I don't believe a machine can do so
we've seen the machines that are working
towards doing the very things that make
UN interpreters great but at the end of
the day the human brain is still the
ultimate interpreter
it's the processor that other machines
are trying to catch up to body language
sign language eye movements speech and
breathing rates we take it all in
without even thinking about it
maybe one day machines will be able to
do that too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
