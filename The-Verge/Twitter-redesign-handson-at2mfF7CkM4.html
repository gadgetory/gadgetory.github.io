I'm here with the new version of Twitter
called Twitter fly just came out this
afternoon and it's a total design
overhaul for Twitter designed to make it
a little more coherent across platforms
Twitter's always kind of look different
depending on what app you use and
they're trying to make it a little more
consistent the most important thing is
they boil it Twitter down into basically
four different hubs first is home which
is basically just your timeline but it's
been simplified and kind of cleaned up
it works faster basically in every app
that we've used but the most part looks
generally the same then there's Connect
which shows all your @ replies and
mentions but it also show you new people
following you really easily and it'll
show tweets of yours that have been
favorited or even who's retweeting you
which is pretty cool and you could use
to be able to see who or that you had
been retweeted but not by who or you can
just break out and see individual
individual mentions of you if you want
to get rid of the other stuff there's
also discover which is designed to help
you find new stuff there's the trends
and the hashtags like they're always
work but there's also a lot more
personalization now you can see based on
where you are or just who you're falling
like it's a lot more personalized to
what you might actually be interested in
rather than Twitter as a whole then
there's me the other hub which shows
this is list or subscribe to but it'll
show you who's following you your
profile at a glance lists and all that
stuff and there's a couple of cool
things like you can switch accounts just
by dragging left on that button or if
you want to see your direct messages
really fast you just swipe up that's
pretty cool so but more than anything
it's just an aesthetic overhaul it's
much prettier the app tends to work a
little faster and you can tweet easily
but as far as do features there's not
that much they've actually removed some
from the app like used to be able to
swipe to do stuff for long press on
Android to reply and you can't do that
anymore and some stuff is harder to find
but it's definitely a much simpler
easier to use app so as you can see here
the website has been redesigned to it's
got these same for hubs home can I
discover and then means over here on its
you got this same funny tweet icon with
a feather in it for some reason but it's
a little more simplified they moved the
sidebar to the left for some reason
but it's easy to get around and replying
to tweets is a little simpler than usual
just pops up a profile and you can get
into it easily you tweet from the
sidebar now so again it's mostly
aesthetic overhauls without being huge
changes but the app looks a little nicer
and it's a little more kind of an ipad
app style than a used to be so as you
can see here the app has been changed a
lot we've got join us turns droid here
and then my droid x2 and as you can see
it just works it's a little smoother and
a little faster it's got basically all
the same information everywhere it just
looks a whole lot nicer but I really do
miss the ability to long press or swipe
and be able to retweet or something they
just there's nothing there but it's
there's a lot more information shown on
the replies page and the connect page
here you can switch back and forth but
again if you've used the old app the new
one will feel pretty familiar just with
some uniquely new information there's
also the mobile app if you want to use
it for Android is you know just the same
you'll barely even notice you're in a
different app than the Twitter app
itself it's pretty fast and you know
goes full screen when you want it to
it's pretty nice and again it's the same
experience all over any platform so once
you use Twitter somewhere you'll
immediately know that everywhere else</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
