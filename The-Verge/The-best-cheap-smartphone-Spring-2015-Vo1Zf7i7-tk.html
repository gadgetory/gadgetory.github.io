gadgets of this century they are
ubiquitous pocket computers that keep us
constantly connected entertained and
informed but most of the smart phones
you're likely to see the iPhones and the
galaxies of the world cost many hundreds
of dollars fortunately you don't need to
spend nearly a thousand dollars to get a
decent smartphone in fact there are a
lot of great options available for less
than 200 bucks if you're looking for the
best smartphone you can get for under
$200 look no further than Motorola's
Moto G it's got a great high res display
quick performance and easy to use
software it also comes unlocked so you
can use it on AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile or hosts of
prepaid services you can even use it
with a local SIM card when you travel
abroad to save on roaming fees a good
cheap smartphone is a lot like any other
good smartphone it needs to work
reliably be easy to use and have access
to all the latest apps and services the
Moto G satisfies all of those needs and
it doesn't look like a cheap clunker
either it's one of the few inexpensive
phones to run the latest Android
software and it doesn't have a ton of
carrier added apps that you don't want
or need and which tend to slow down your
phone or kill your battery prematurely
and since it's an Android phone there
are millions of apps available for it
calling an uber with a moto G isn't
really any different than using an
iphone or galaxy s6 to do the same thing
you just paid a whole lot less for the
privilege of doing so other phones in
this range like Sharp Aquos crystal or
blues vivo air have better design or
like Samsung's Galaxy Avant or HTC
Desire 610 can be easily bought at a
carrier store but those all either have
worse software worse displays or are
tied to specific carriers which doesn't
make them as universally appealing while
the Moto G is a great smartphone at its
core you do have to make some
concessions when compared with a more
expensive phone most notably the G's
camera is pretty bad in fact all of the
phones in this price range whether
they're from Samsung sharp Nokia or
Motorola have pretty terrible cameras
especially in low-light second the G
doesn't have support for LTE so you have
to make do with the noticeably slower
HSPA networks it's fast enough to browse
the web crusoe email post to Facebook
and stream music but if you want to use
your phone to tether to a computer watch
lots of Netflix or make a lot of video
calls on the go you're probably gonna
want something that supports LTE
if you look for LTE and you're on a
tight budget your best bet is Motorola's
other inexpensive phone the Moto e Moto
e is not as good a phone as a G it has a
worse display even worse camera and it
doesn't feel as nice in your hand but
it's $30 cheaper and has support for LTE
on AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile everything else
that's great about the Moto G applies
here too
the e has Android 5.0 without any
carrier bloatware and comes unlocked so
you can use it overseas easily whether
you're a casual user looking to avoid a
large investment or do you just dropped
your iPhone in a toilet and don't want
to spend $700 for a new one there are
plenty of smart phones that cost less
than two tickets to Disney World and of
those the Motorola MOTO G is the best
one you can get</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
