checking out the true grip a new
Bluetooth keyboard for smartphones small
tablets and computers that lets you type
on the back of the keyboard in order to
ostensibly help you be more portable and
only have to commit to one keyboard size
while you're using it all day long
keys are actually still laid out in
QWERTY but they're sideways so when you
think about it your hand is actually in
the exact same place and otherwise would
have been the keys are just sideways and
so you're still making the same
movements with your hand but that
doesn't mean it's any easier as you can
see the mouse here on-screen is
controlled by the accelerometer and the
device so it's kind of like a steering
wheel you can go up and down to move
your mouse the company says that
eventually you're going to be able to
page back and forth by doing a quick
flick but for now you have to do that
kind of stuff and spacebar on the front
of the actual device itself as well as
you have end and arrows and page down so
this is a let's give this a shot here
okay so I'm gonna try this right now
it's very difficult it's like learning
to type again like hunting and pecking
like I'm trying to find the T right now
and my left hand going up to the T it
lights up to give you some feedback
about what you're doing but that doesn't
really mean it's any easier to try and
get used to this you're taking your hand
kind of like this on a regular keyboard
and flipping it around to the other side
so as you can see you have to practice
quite a bit the company says maybe eight
to ten hours to become proficient on
this thing and might take even longer
than that for most of us who are used to
touchscreen and regular keyboards
trigger blasts for about eight to ten
hours on its battery the company says
and it's not planning the launch for
another another several months in the
end of 2014 for around $250
