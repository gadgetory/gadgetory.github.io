am here checking out the hyper kin smart
boy now we've talked about before if you
are emulating a game technically that
ROM is illegal but the emulator is legal
so the smart boys something of a
workaround it lets you have to play your
Game Boy and Game Boy Color and Game Boy
Advance games on your smartphone it is
really just to kind of the controller
but it's also a cartridge slot you can
legally use the games you want to play
so you put the cartridge in the official
Nintendo cartridge and it believes this
is a Game Boy now the final product
obviously you take the cartridges out
the game is going to close what's
interesting though is the safe state
which you do usually have emulators will
actually be transferred to the cartridge
itself as well so you can always pick up
using the cartridge and you're playing
it with what essentially feels like the
classic Gameboy controls now in terms of
software there's complain relators that
are actually available on the Google
Play Store this is a price you can come
out for both Android and iOS sometime in
q4 price is about forty to sixty dollars
actually feels really good really
comfortable it reminds me a lot of the
fat Gameboy this is an alpha bill that
might be a little thinner at launch this
is kind of a handmade model for now but
you generally get the idea you're
playing the classic fat Gameboy with
your cartridges all right now I'm
actually reliving 90s with a pokemon
blue obviously keyboards because I
Android Android has millions in the Play
Store you know probably a West Company
trying to figure out what the best move
is but they're from pretty confident so
this will be something you can available
for basically any four point six two
five inch phone you have an Android and
most compatible iPhone models it was
less that's kind of gist this is
literally turning your phone into a Game
Boy you're taking a very modern piece
technology and you're making it one of
the dumbest portables it's been around
the last few decades okay so so weirdly
love it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
