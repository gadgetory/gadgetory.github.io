and want to catch a glimpse of the
future Carnegie Mellon University is
probably a good place to start to get
inside the robotics lab you'll need to
walk past tank
he's a Robo ception a-- stand well
actually tank is really important to
this story but he isn't what I want to
show you right now this is looking at
this large geodesic dome covered in
wires you can't help but feel like
you're staring into a time machine and
in a way you kind of are but rather than
traveling through time this fin optics
to do is capturing it using an array of
cameras researchers here are able to
capture and then replicate any action
into a 3d model from a dance to a cello
performance it can perfectly reconstruct
these moments in time and while that's
pretty impressive by itself it's just
the starting point in a quest to
decipher an age-old code
so basically you can see that this is a
kind of geodesic dome looks like a
sphere we specifically designed this
architecture so that we can put cameras
as uniform as possible and you can see
also that we specially mobilize the
system so that we only design one panel
and we can duplicate the panel's one
panel is composed of 24 small cameras
and one high resolution cameras and they
are saved in the local hard drives and
in the end all the local data are there
transmitted to the NAS and so that
sounds like a ton of data like how much
data is in one minute of capture so one
minute of data is about 600 petabytes
that's huge data that's a big job in
fact to this point the Panoptix to do
has captured over 1 petabyte of data
that's about a million gigabytes and the
latest is well me yeah so while I'm
dancing those 500 cameras are capturing
every movement I make and after a couple
of weeks of processing it looks
something like this
this point cloud view is not only
showing a bunch of tracking points its
tracing the past they could take while
I'm moving around all right got a
stretch before that now motion capture
by itself isn't anything new similar
technology has been used to bring
digital characters to life and films for
years now motion capture technology has
gotten so good that an actor like Andy
Serkis can really inject life into a
fully digital character but to do so
requires a full motion capture suit with
tracking markers placed all over your
body even paint it on your face now this
works well enough for trying to bring a
dragon to life but it's hard to feel
natural in that kind of equipment the
Panoptix to do in contrast allows for
similar tracking but without any of the
physical markers you can just freely
move your body in a way that feels
natural and unrestricted which is a
necessity for them to capture what they
are really looking for really good quote
from Edward Sapir who's a linguist
he says there's an elaborate and secret
code
that is known to no one but understood
by all and he's referring to to all the
gestures that we use to communicate and
that's kind of the code that we're
trying to sort of crack or understanding
our goal essentially is to endow
machines with the capacity to understand
in social interactions so that's where
tank comes back into play
you remember tank the Robo ception
esteem e via camera and react to my
presence but he can't understand more
than what I typed to him so when I start
to get frustrated that he isn't helping
me find the panopticon or react in a way
that helped ease my tension which kind
of makes him bad at his job machines
have a very poor understanding of what
all those things are so for example if
if I'm not paying attention to you or or
if I'm looking at you paying attention
those are the kinds of things and
machines just don't respond to right now
and that's kind of a big deal studies
have suggested that when we communicate
with each other more than half of the
message we're sending is based on the
way we move our posture facial
expressions and gestures can at times
convey more than our words alone here
let me show you so now you can see me
and you can read what my body is telling
you even if my words are saying
something different maybe for my posture
you can tell them in a cramped little
sound booth or you can tell I'm excited
about this story that I'm nervous about
reading from a script that I'm
hopelessly improvising into a camera to
try and give you a sense of how
expressive body language can be when we
communicate each other we use many
interesting hand gestures which is
really important to communicate each
other but it's very hard to understand
why we are doing this motion when we are
doing this motion right I don't know why
I'm sitting I'm not trying to send you I
mean I guess I'm sending you a signal
but I don't know what it means exactly
usually we are using our gestures but
it's very hard to define why we are
using it's not we are not doing this
consciously right this is number
adjusters I mean I'm just like trying to
sit in a way that looks good okay I like
your socks by the way thank you I'm
trying to show off my socks that's why
I'm sitting like this and that's the
really weird thing about body language
it's something we all do unconsciously
and understand innately but if I were to
stop and try to tell you why I'm holding
my shoulders a certain way or moving my
hands I
wouldn't understand it and to be able to
explain it so if we can't explain it to
each other how can we possibly teach it
to machines well it turns out we can
teach them the same way we've been
teaching a lot of other artificial
intelligence systems machine learning
specifically a technique called deep
learning has produced a number of huge
breakthroughs in the last few years a
very simplistic view of it is you feed
machines a lot of data about a certain
subject like say driving a car feed in
an update about how we drive and we'll
be able to start understanding the
system at play and react in a similar
fashion the way we do most recently
google's deepmind watched a few years
worth of TV shows understand how to read
human lips now it can do that better
than most experts the panopticon enough
visual data showing how humans interact
it's deep learning system we'll be able
to tease out the structure of that
elaborate code making it possible for
computers to read and write our body
language possibly understanding a facet
of our communication better than we do
ourselves so if all this sounds familiar
you are probably watching the new HBO
series Westworld it's about a park
filled with robots that can so vividly
replicate human behavior it becomes
impossible to distinguish who's a real
human and who's not
so Westworld is science fiction sure but
to a quick youtube search for lifelike
robots and you'll find we've actually
made some incredible progress in the
last few decades and some stuff to fill
your nightmares
find you and me be good friends but the
benefits of these social robots could be
immense look at Milo he's a robot that's
being used to help kids with autism he
could help these children identify
social cues and emotional reactions that
they can sometimes struggle to express
and interpret themselves and robots will
also help us care for the elderly
so less Westworld and more Franken the
robot beyond helping accomplish physical
tasks future robots could become vital
emotional supporters as well imagine
instead of Robo ception estanque it
helps someone suffering from Alzheimer's
socialize on a more regular basis
identifying their mood and reacting
appropriately
there's many components that need to
happen before this works an AI in
particular needs to get better right but
I think that there will be a big
advantage in terms of how we will treat
machines once they start respecting at
least for example whether we are paying
attention to them or whether we are open
to an interaction and other sort of
social signals that that we use in our
daily conversations but if all this talk
of lifelike robots makes you nervous
about the coming of some Skynet that'll
wipe out humanity consider this teaching
robots this social behavior might be the
best way for us to foster a better
understanding between humans and their
creations so one way of putting it is
that we use machines and even robots as
tools currently but well what we will
achieve when they interact with us as
almost equals as we really find
collaborators not so we won't start
using machines as tools but rather as as
press agents that we can collaborate
with so I think in those terms that that
will be very important so if we want to
integrate machines and it's so
eventually going to happen they should
at least respond to us in a way that we
appreciate this research is already
being used by a company you probably
know well Facebook the social networking
giant and its oculus division are
working with researchers from the
Panoptix studio to find ways to make
avatars in VR more accurate and social
this could make communication with a
friend more intimate or it could give
Siri a body that can walk
and talk just like a real person</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
