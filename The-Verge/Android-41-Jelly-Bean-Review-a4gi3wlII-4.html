and we are looking at Android 4.1 jelly
bean on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus this is
Google's update for this year and the
first thing to note is that they spent a
lot of time focusing on performance of
something called project butter and in
my experience with jellybean so far it
really does make a big difference even
on this relatively old hardware
performance is way better than than I
expected it doesn't doesn't seem to
require a whole lot of power in order to
get the benefit you can see that the the
jellybean device is on the left here the
Android 4.0 device is on the right and
I'm getting you know much faster much
smoother performance on the Galaxy Nexus
with jellybean than I do with it on
Android 4.0 Matias Duarte had said that
Google had declared war on lag and it
really shows here you can see in the
browser that scrolling is much faster
and smoother on jellybean the next thing
that Google did with jellybean is it
updated its notification area with a
couple of really cool new features the
first which I'm showing here as you can
to finger scroll on any of your
notifications to show more information
and in addition to that on any
particular notification you can tap on
it and it will let you share or perform
other actions unfortunately not every
notification does this but a lot do and
it's it's pretty cool you can see if
there's a new sharing menu as well it
shows up in most places but not all so
it's it's really convenient to be able
to peek in at what you're looking at and
of course you can still swipe stuff away
to dismiss it one interesting thing is
if you long press on a notification you
get a pop-up link for the app info which
seems like a really strange thing except
what it does is it takes you right into
the app info where you can hit a
checkbox to turn off notifications for
that particular app which is really
convenient feature if you've got an app
that's just bugging the heck out of you
you can just turn off notifications for
it the homescreen and jellybean has been
very slightly updated when you try and
put a widget on a screen it will
automatically shift around the other
stuff on that screen to make space for
the widget and if the widget resizes it
will also automatically resize the
widget you can also push icons around in
the same way
you could just swipe up to dismiss it
instead of dragging it of course the
headline feature for jellybean is Google
now which you can launch either by
swiping up from the home button or
directly from the lock screen if you
don't have a security lock engaged and
what it does is it shows you a ambient
information based on stuff that you
search for on Google so for example here
it knows that I care about the twin
score it knows that I care about the
weather and it has that stuff pop up
automatically as I go throughout my day
it also can show local stuff as well and
you can tap on any of these cards get
more information for example here it
took me directly into maps and into the
the information for that particular shop
you can of course swipe cards away to
the right to get rid of them and
sometimes when you do it lets you know
that there are settings for that
particular card and so this is letting
you know that places will pop up when
you are near them on most cards you can
tap on a little three dot thing to bring
up particular settings for it and
basically you do get you know different
settings per card but you're not going
to be able to directly control cards you
can't move them up and down manually but
you can set a priority which will make
it more or less likely that it shows up
at any particular time so while there
are quite a lot of settings that you can
dig through to try and customize your
experience in Google now you're not
really meant to it's meant to just sort
of look at what you're searching for
with with Google search and figure out
where you live where you're going what
your flights are you know what your
favorite sports teams are and just
bubble that stuff up as it makes sense
to you throughout the day
and in my testing it definitely got
better over time you know it took quite
a while for it to learn where I live and
it took a while for it to figure out
where I work and you know what buses I
do and don't care about but eventually
it started to be really clever at
showing me bus schedules when I'm
waiting at a bus stop or of course you
know showing me the twin score when it
popped up the other feature about Google
now is it does voice search and it's not
really a series you can still perform a
few actions on the device but frankly
nothing more than was there on Android
4.0 and you know it it's not as
intelligent at Siri at understanding
natural language questions you you want
to type in a search directly but it can
do stuff like hear get directions and
when you do
choose you know if you want to bike or
walk or whatnot and there's also a
action bar that drags across and it's a
little timer bar and you know if you
just wait for it and do nothing it'll
jump right in direction so let's switch
mics and try out a couple voice searches
here launch Google Talk what is my next
appointment who is the President of the
United States Google American Airlines
1921 Minnesota Twins so as you could see
Google now isn't quite as good at
natural language and can't quite
directly adjust stuff on the device
itself but it does present you with
Google search if it doesn't have a card
for you which can still be convenient
and pull up information directly there
are a bunch of categories of cards here
we can take a look at the sample cards
to see what is on offer traffic weather
sports location stuff public transit
flights next appointment currency and a
few more and the important thing to note
is Google says they're going to be
offering more as time goes on another
new thing in jellybean is an updated
keyboard that has a predictive typing it
is able to guess what your next word is
and auto correct your current word and
it does quite a good job it's a it's a
bit like SwiftKey although it's not as
aggressive at putting in at suggestions
but you can type whatever you like in
and it'll take a shot at it and you can
jump up to hit the word that you would
like to guess you can also dig into
settings on the keyboard and choose how
aggressively you would like Google to
predict your next word while you're in
settings you're definitely I want to
check out the personal dictionary which
will allow you to add shortcuts so you
can type in a short key combo like
we'll say Kimmy shelter and we can
assign that to just a very short key
combo and then if you're back in any app
where you've got the keyboard up and
loaded you can just type that shortcut
and one of your autocorrect suggestions
will be the thing that you programmed in
one last text input option is offline
dictation if you don't have a cell
signal you can still use your voice to
type messages in and as with the Android
4.0 it will show your text as you type
and I found that it's not quite as
accurate offline as it is online but
it's pretty close so let's take a listen
however it does seem pretty darn good I
guess I can't complain Google also made
some minor changes around the rest of
the OS one of them is the camera app
which it still is relatively fast and
you can take photos by tapping the blue
dot but instead of having to tap the
little thumbnail up in the upper right
hand corner after you take some photos
you can just swipe to the left and get
into a filmstrip view of all of your
pictures and you can pinch out to take a
look at all of them together and you can
swipe them up to get rid of them there's
an undo button if you accidentally
delete something you don't want to
delete it's a feature we've seen on
other smartphones and it's nice to see
that Google has added it to jellybean
face unlock and jellybean is also faster
and more reliable than it was an Ice
Cream Sandwich which is really nice
they've also added a new feature called
liveness check which we'll watch to see
you blink so you won't be able to hold a
photo up to the camera in order to
unlock it which i suppose is a nice
security feature just turn it on
blink and it'll unlock I should also add
that Google has added talkback to jelly
bean which is an accessibility option
that reads out everything on the screen
and you can tap to have it read out
what's under your thumb DoubleTap to
select it it's great for the
sight-impaired but if that doesn't
describe you you obviously aren't going
to want to use it
Google Maps also got an update although
it's not exclusive to jellybean users if
you're on Ice Cream Sandwich or even
Gingerbread you'll be able to use this
feature it's out now it's making maps
available offline you just go to the map
area that you want to save pan around
and it will work offline it caps out at
around 80 megabytes now you know
area which is a little bit less than I
would like but it's still a good feature
to have if you have limited connectivity
where you live or where you're going and
that's Android 4.1 jelly bean it's a mix
of really great performance enhancements
that brings it up to par with other
smartphone platforms it's Google now
which I find to be an ambitious
experiment but not quite ready for
something to depend on every day but I
expect it will improve over time
and a mortgage board of other features
which fill out the platform and make it
feel a bit more intuitive I especially
like the the notification options those
are really great it's coming to the
Galaxy Nexus the Nexus S and the
Motorola Xoom in July unfortunately we
have no idea when other Android
smartphones or tablets will see this
operating system update hopefully it's
soon but of course that's going to be up
to manufacturers to decide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
