repository we ought to see if it can
fulfill its mission has received more
than 10,000 shipments it has in place
more than 80,000 cubic meters of Defense
transionic waste so it's accomplished
something but it's supposed to
accommodate more than twice as much
waste as currently there it's supposed
to dispose of the waste be
decontaminated and decommissioned so
that we can demonstrate technically and
to the public that we actually can do
that never been done anyplace in the
world this is the most geologically and
scientifically studied piece of real
estate in the entire United States the
main function is to dispose of
transionic defense generated transuranic
waste and all of those activities that
pertain to that the Carter
Administration was trying to figure out
what to do with Nick is our waste there
was a lot of debate public discussion
Congress was trying to pass laws Carter
came up with a program of saying we need
nuclear power in this country we have
nuclear weapons an atomic energy power
plant has already proved feasible the
future supplying of electric power to
entire cities is far from impossible so
the Carter Administration said we need
multiple geologic disposal sites in
multiple geologic regions eventually
came on Yucca Mountain experts
throughout the world agree that the most
feasible and safe method for disposing
of highly radioactive materials is to
store them deep underground the
facilities you see at the surface are
only a small fraction of the science
going on deep inside the distinctive
Ridge
we've invested billions of dollars in
Yucca Mountain and has been found to be
safe we've been preparing and planning
for Yucca for disposal since 2002 we
have high-level nuclear waste all over
this country and we needed in one
centralized location it's been our
policy that that would be Yucca Mountain
an isolated area of Nevada in the desert
90 miles from Las Vegas underneath a
mountain in the desert in one of the
most arid places in this country this is
one of those issues where the federal
government then tells a state you're
going to take this that doesn't really
work very well the state of Nevada said
we don't want this because we don't
believe that you did this in a
consensus-based fashion you didn't ask
us you basically just told us and so
then you know became a wrangling fight
for 25 years we still don't have a safe
way to dispose of the nuclear waste
until we figure out what we're going to
do with the waste and the cost it's very
hard to see nuclear as a part of our
future but that's where American
technology comes in let's figure out
what we're going to do what this country
needs to understand is there's nuclear
waste all over the place and next and
major population centers and MIT and
next to major water reserves
I believe that Yucca Mountain is a
suitable place for storage and I know
that there's controversy about it in
lawsuits and all that it shouldn't
America a country as smart as wise we
are be able to find a place to store
spent fuel when 2008 came around and
Senator Reid was Senate Majority lead he
basically you know asked to kill this
because he didn't think it was
science-based and this wasn't consensus
and we didn't agree to this and all that
kind of thing so it was basically killed
this is a wonderful day for Nevada to
make sure that this poisonous substance
the most poisonous substance known to
man isn't going to be hauled through the
streets of Las Vegas Reno Boulder City
and Henderson that you go just a few
miles outside Las Vegas and be a danger
to our water systems
our way of life including tourism it's
wonderful that it's going to be gone for
more than 30 years the state of New
Mexico has said no to being Yucca
Mountain being a high level waste or a
commercial spiritual repository so to me
when that subject comes up again not for
the first time not for the second time
not for the third time it's come up lots
of times and people have always said no
way I kind of say you know or what about
know do people not understand New Mexico
has as you know been historically a
nuclear state you know they're very
familiar just from a general base of
people in New Mexico of the nuclear
industry what it represents in all
facets of that right now we have a
certain authorization basis that says
this is what we are suited for the
disposal of defense generated true waste
and if called upon through you know the
congressional action to look at that
although today we are suited for true
waste disposal we will go through it
with the same rigor we did to ensure the
safety and the operational efficiency
and the environmentally sound way we
would approach it in the same way but it
all starts with congressional action
they have to give this the authorization
and right now with is limited with a
kind of waste and with the volume of
waste and we can put away right now it's
it's limited to defense
transuranic waste which is a mouthful
for intermediate level waste from you
know weapons research and production
there are two kinds of transfer and
equates to conduit contact handled the
kind that's in 55-gallon drum kinds of
containers and other containers that you
or I or anybody can walk right up to and
not get a significant dose of
radioactivity because the container
provides good shielding for
current handling of it and remote handle
transuranic waste which as the name
implies you and I can't walk up to it
without getting a significant dose and
in fact in some cases a dose that could
kill you pretty quickly so that waste
has to be packaged in special lead
shielded canisters taken to a separate
special facility of the WIPP site so it
can be handled remotely without people
actually physically having to handle the
canister this is where the cast is
transported into the stores shut and
what they do is they're lowering it down
you can see that green panel there
they'll lift that lid and it's lowered
down into a transfer area transport it
over and brought into the facility cask
in another room over there I think
what's the best thing to do is to go
we're going to go down the salt shaft
and we'll take a cart down there and
we'll follow the route that the waste
takes to go down to the disposal area
which will be down the east 140 drift
all the way down into the intake of
channel 6
when whip was originally conceived there
was the idea to actually have two
different levels where we are now and
one deeper for defense high level waste
that was struck from the mission so
we're still at only one level we could
go deeper we could go higher the
sequence itself is three thousand feet
you went about two thousand feet here
we'll get on this other cart here your
buddy in so basically what you're seeing
there is salt that's rock you can hit
that with a hammer and ring like a bell
we're going to go through an airlock
here these airlocks the reason we have
them is we have four different
ventilation splits and in all those
areas are kept separate some of it is to
control the possibility of if you had a
release of some sort controlling that
ventilation and that release and some of
it is just literally to be able to
control the air because you've got a
finite amount of air so the waste would
turn here this isn't going into an
active panel we're headed in into the
panel where the waste is disposed this
is the panel itself but this is typical
these rooms they're 33 feet wide minimal
13 feet high and in the case of a room
it's 300 feet long so the are a choices
brought down in this room and then these
Pistons the rams push it into the hole
and there's interlocks and there's
shielding associated with that to
protect the workers leave the shield in
place and they come in and they pull the
piston back and they put that shield
plug in place and then they push that in
also
so here's the CH way stack here's your
contact handled waste basically we want
to emplace this it's not a it's not
storage it's disposable permanent
disposal I guess you could always think
that the folks in the future could be
smarter than us and find some some use
but they would have to recover it would
just not be retrievable they'd have to
recover it in some way basically we want
to make sure that we communicate with
the future what we've stored underground
what those dangers may be underground
at the end when we close the first 100
years is called active institutional
controls and during that first 100 years
you have guards ito that are keeping
people out and keeping them from jolin
after that it's the passive
institutional controls the passive
institutional controls consist of three
elements and one of them is the designs
the actual markers that will be left
behind after we decommission the site
and return it back to public use so
during that the first hundred years we
would be building the passive
institutional controls piece which is
the markers the rooms putting on the
languages telling a message talking
thousands of years here we may not have
a United States and three thousand years
it may be a hole it may be split up
among several countries who's to say I
mean all those possibilities have to be
considered what do you think is in the
future for what do you think it's moving
toward high-level waste well I think you
know we have the land withdrawal Act and
it basically specifies that we're
supposed to have you know take true
waste it would take a an act of Congress
if you will to change that Act I have
never seen a scientific or technique as
scientifically or technically convincing
reason why salt and we could not
accommodate high-level waste history has
shown that there isn't a quick fix
solution to the problem we need geologic
repositories that's fine let's start a
long process to come up with that but
whippin New Mexico just like Nevada
should be not considered for that
because it doesn't consent New Mexico
shouldn't be considered for that because
it doesn't consent now you consider out
and hope that it's all going to be
resolved if the next election breaks
right and that's been exactly the hope
for 40 years and it hadn't worked now we
got a problem we got a problem in this
country that is very very difficult to
solve we don't know if we got the
answers here if you're looking for the
best solution you would be on that
search for the Holy Grail and you will
never get there if you stand around and
insist on your
yoga which people have been insisting on
for a long long time but have not been
able to pull it off we think the result
of that is an impasse a failure to solve
the problem where do you go
