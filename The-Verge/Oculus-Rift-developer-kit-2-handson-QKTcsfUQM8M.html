verge and I'm here with the new oculus
rift Developer Kit to the latest version
of the virtual reality headset that
oculus has been prototyping for over a
year now it's basically the same as the
Crystal Cove that we saw at CES but blew
us away at that show except all the
infrared LEDs are now hidden behind this
transparent plastic which is still
opaque enough you can't quite see
through it
it's got refined latency of sub-20
milliseconds there's a 1080p screen in
there now compared to the 720p version
the Developer Kit a year ago the lenses
in here have a new resin that makes them
a little bit better for the use and most
importantly it doesn't make you nearly
as sick as when you use it as with the
original developer kit was a bit of an
issue at first you could get sick a
little bit of motion sickness simulator
sickness when looking around the
environment particularly if you're
moving but now this camera here tracks
these LEDs the OLED display inside has a
low persistence screen such the pixels
don't smear the same way across your
vision it looks clear it looks at
glassing compared to the blurry
pixelated original so this is vr nights
it's an oculus rift experience by epic
and I've got this little this female
Knight it's a little avatar like an
action figure I'm controlling and you
can actually see my hands in my legs you
know sitting at this chair and the other
player as well but we're both control
like these like the animated action
figures they can roam around this living
room arena and follow her up this set of
bookcases over here is stacking
bookcases get some higher ground rain
down some fireballs across the room the
objective is just to smack this it's
other avatar a few times
to demonstrate my dominance so not only
am do I have this little avatar but my
body is also my virtual body and hands
are also in this game and so is the
other players I'm playing with somebody
else sitting right next to me on a couch
and I can just jump on their lap and
smack him around a bit jump up on their
head do a dive attack lots of objects in
the arena you can knock off it's a
pretty simple game but shows some of the
potential this for being more than just
first-person adventure games for sure
this is going to be three hundred and
forty-nine dollars for this developer
kit in July and pre-orders are opening
this morning at 8 a.m.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
