Mary Chandra who's the director of
product management Google TV he's having
a Super Bowl party all by himself in
this room I guess it's the TV theme yeah
always
yeah so you guys are at kind of a big
show but you're in the background of
like the big show
you're the platform that's that's mine
who is it it's Vizio and I school TV
Sony yep
LG Samsung is gonna do one later
you said they were going to want to show
their and do one later yep so but then
there's kind of like some big other
changes going on right yeah big change
that's right yeah so we we also
announced some chips up changes so we're
we're partnering with Marvel and
mediatek so ARM based providers chipsets
away from Intel away from in addition to
Intel I should say that's cool you and
aunt are still friends the arm yeah are
amazing I think you know one of the big
things we wanted to focus on for 2012
was getting price points down I mean we
know that ARM based chipsets maybe have
less power and then some of the you know
other like Intel basically these
high-end basis but price one was an
important factor for us and so that was
one of the main reasons why we actually
notice they're all kind of smaller
different type of form factors like
you're saying as we build you know we're
building buddy boxes blu-ray players and
TVs is that buddy boxes that's what you
call them
we like buddy boxes that is something
it's no it's cool Google's changing
industry once again with the bloody box
there you go actually let me ask you
about that um I think there's a big kind
of conversation with where the smarts
belong you know Samsung is one of your
partners there they're smart TV that
they announced on their own platform
they're doing kind of modular chipsets
inside we can swap in two parts say let
you upgrade yep but neither the other
kind of paradigm is let's build a buddy
box yeah and have that upgrade all the
time where do you kind of see this
really fitting there's a TV going to be
smarter you're gonna have a box you're
gonna have maybe a cable box that gets
Google TV integrated you know honestly I
think I think you're gonna have multiple
right because I think there's going to
be a certain set of users who just say
look I want to get an
TV and it turns out they have some sort
of functionality in there maybe it's not
the primary use of what they use the TV
for they you know maybe they use it for
traditional TV broadcast but they get
some functionality and features out of
it and I think you'll see another set
which is kind of the heart more hardcore
users who actually want to upgrade every
year or every two years you think there
are hardcore users who upgrade their TVs
every year
no not TVs okay buddy boxes so the ones
who actually want to increase their I
think it's great I just like the the
imagery of a hardcore user wants a new
buddy box every year that's really let's
just say how about a user who actually
loves the performance or the ability to
actually improve their TV experience
yeah a lot faster than obviously getting
a TV every five to seven years sure
anything you'll see in cable boxes
obviously is another area where I think
you'll see a lot more smarter functional
to them those are archaic boxes right
now they're gonna get a lot faster
innovation will happen on those devices
as well my personal opinion right now is
I think the the problem is less about
where you get the Smart TV functionality
is what actually happens when you get it
I don't think yet anyone's really nailed
a user experience of really what you
know read-up redefining what TV is
supposed to be yeah actually you have
the revision one Logitech Keyboard here
with the trackpad and I think a big
story it's yes I'm a huge nerd I think a
big story here is these remotes yep
Chris for our TVs now but what gets me
about this is that that is an old model
right that's the keyboard in the mouse
and now you're putting a PC in the TV
essentially yeah and the new remotes
they just take that and make it smaller
mm-hm is that still the right model are
there new ways of interaction you're
looking at - or are you just focused on
delivery no you know we are looking at
all all new type interactions I think a
lot of other vendors have also kind of
announced or talked about like gestures
one of them and voices and other one and
gyros another one I think you know again
from our standpoint we have a variety
different partners who actually doing
different economic analysis so one this
great thing about Android in particular
is that it actually enables all those
different technologies so we don't have
a bet on one or another but I think our
belief is interaction does have to take
a step function change look what's the
best way to bro down with your buddy ox
to bro down with your buddy box right
now right what's your favorite way my
personal preference is
a one-handed remote that I can actually
flip over and do keyboard and then do it
right so you're still doing trackpad I
mean that's that's kinda where yeah my
personal interaction that's I would say
like for others I think gyro actually
has a lot more kind of the we style we
style do more interesting stuff I think
both ends the TV equation need to be
revolutionary interface has to change
you guys are always doing a great job
with that
I think search is really cool and nobody
else does it yep but then the other part
is delivery and content and you've got
apps to that now yep and the apps look
pretty good but you're still missing the
piece where you integrate with like real
TV steps we've taken in terms of user
interface around search as well as the
TV movies app which kind of things it's
a user
it's agnostic to source whether it be on
live TV or whether it be on Netflix or
Amazon YouTube whatever it's just
showing you what three content is in
terms of DVR integration I think I think
there's a couple challenges there
obviously we have which is the set-top
boxes which are doing the DVR our older
set the buses and a lot of cases so why
are you doing the DVR essentially it's a
good question I think from our
standpoint we see a couple things
happening right one is that generally
the industry is moving to a little more
on-demand world right whether it be like
TV Everywhere or new content providers
like Netflix like human plastic all
these guys we see a lot more content
being accessible actually more time to
be accessible just on demand than what a
user has to go in program on the DVR
that being said I think you know if a
manufacturer partner comes with us and
we are talking with a variety of them
about potentially doing DVR that's
something that's something we're just
going to turn away but I think our focus
right now is focus on let's let's make
sure that we get a product out there
that is taking advantage of all this new
concept every month every year there's
more and more contouring online and then
we want to build a product experience
for system nails that my big question
there is how do you how do you replace
the cable box mmm optimally that's what
you're trying to do right how do you get
how do you get rid of that thing and
just say now you can watch I can watch
football on Sunday and I can watch
what's on the web yeah yeah I mean I
think I think there's a couple of
different things that could happen one
is that the traditional content comes
more and more online which it couldn't
we talked about is happening in not
obviously in sports not in every piece
but it's happening in general it's I
think that's what aspect the second
aspect is you know integrating with the
existing set-top boxes right so talking
with existing
people providers and satellite providers
you guys are having this conversation so
definitely having those conversations
how they going to say they're going I
mean it's a long process right it's a
long process and and I think but
anything is productive conversations oh
yeah they are actually have a productive
conversation to figure out what's the
right thing for obviously the operator
but as well as for making sure that
Google TV is doing the right thing for
users so Adobe cancelled flash removal
yep you were heavy on flash plus it
launched yep check out slash the best
thing ever and then Dobby is like turns
out flash mode will not so great flash
on TV we're going to kind of quietly can
as well where'd you play with flash now
are you still relying on it in Chrome or
you trying to get people away from it
get people I mean I think is there a
roadmap for flash on the television
through Google TV now or is it that's
just an over that idea is over I don't
know if it's over I'd say like we're we
again we our goal is for users to unlock
as much constant as possible so as much
as we can do that we will now you know
we're still we're also working actually
with Adobe and kind of figure out the
transition plan so I don't have anything
specifically to say about it but my goal
is to get as much content as I can
unlock on the TV I want to do it and so
however I can do that whether it be
through flash or maybe there's other
things to html5 let's do that but we
need to make sure that there is a path
to getting all that content if you look
what we see is kind of the future is
that you're going to see you know
hundreds of thousands or even millions
of new channels coming online coming to
your television which aren't the
traditional TV channels and I like the
example I love to give is there's an NFL
Channel today there's an NBA Channel
today why isn't there a surfing gym
mm-hmm right why isn't there a
skateboarding channel where it might be
it turns out that there is a long tail
of content that just just isn't it you
don't think of TV content today but we
actually want to make it feel like TV so
if you want a cooking show that's what
you're doing with YouTube that's exactly
right
you know you've partnered with LOX media
of course we're we're there exactly
coming to YouTube not me
Ashley I'd see this is the sports guys
but whatever somebody when you launched
you were all about chrome we're putting
chrome on your TV the best of the web
and then all the content providers
blocked your installation of chrome yeah
accessing the content I think you really
put the brakes on Google TV as a viable
than last year this year you're doing
apps are you getting better take up with
the apps and what's the relationship
with Chrome now what what chrome does
it's not a fallback because it's been
blocked everywhere so how do you see
those two things interacting well I'd
say so first of all I think the the
people who are blocking Chrome which is
it's unfortunate but obviously in the
right to do so
the it's kind of the obviously the head
content guys it's not to say that every
content actually box on Chrome I should
say is like it's a pretty limited I mean
obviously it's a traditional TV pants
right but that's what people don't watch
right now well I mean yes but although
they watch that only on TV today I think
the you know so chrome still provides
value for us right is there is a ton of
content that is not the the main TV
Broadcasting Network set is video
competi compelling video content that is
enabled by Chrome and actually I think
you see as more more of that content
comes online we get it for free you know
so to speak because we have to support
the web and as more in the content
company becomes available now that's
just because we went to Android Market
doesn't change the dynamic so the
realities of the broadcast networks
business model of you know they're
concerned about kind of monetization or
cancellation for existing revenue
streams and that's a lot harder problem
solved
but there's this bigger conversation and
throughout the entire industry whether
it's apps for the web
absolutely but which one's going to be
the future right and you know Google
straddles that line across Android you
know you guys make a Chromebooks yeah
how does that impact the TV is it apps
for the browser through you we are
trying that line as well maybe at the
end a day I don't think users care is
obviously a question for developers
because developers they might have
advantages or they believe there's some
belief that they have to be in choler
Android or doing html5 in chrome and
again from Google TV stamp but I want to
support both I don't want to stop people
from building content my my belief is
actually I think for the reason why is
remark was so important was wasn't
necessarily because we're getting the
broadcaster's to kind of build Android
apps what it was is that there are a
variety of applications that have been
optimized for the mobile and tablet
space and it turns out that that
interaction with those devices with
those applications has been simplified a
lot it actually is just a better
experience on TV then maybe a
traditional website that actually
is optimized for peace EU has a lot of
flash' heads and that type of stuff and
so for us actually unlocked a lot of
developers who are rethinking their
applications because they're now moving
to this new kind of Android world and
TVs a part of that versus to kind of
taking their traditional website so I
think you're gonna find it's gonna be
both like we're not saying we're only
doing one of you but you're saying
you're saying it's it sounds like you're
saying apps I mean you're saying it's
been simplified from taking off the web
it's packaged in there and a half I mean
and that's where you're going with the
market I mean is that kind of I think
okay yeah it from a from how quickly an
application can be optimized for the TV
experience I think Android Market is a
better path so let me ask you follow-up
question my internet market Lenovo is
here yep TV Ice Cream Sandwich you guys
are on Honeycomb yep they're on Ice
Cream Sandwich totally skin flick mad
running Android Market yeah how does how
what's your take on that is the guy who
runs Google TV you know it's actually
look I'm a part of Google actually we as
Google believe that Android isn't going
to be a successful operation so in the
TV space and there's multiple paths to
get there just like there are multiple
paths in the tablet space so but that's
not a Google TV that's that's not a
Google TV now they I mean Android is an
open source operating system actually
this isn't the first TV with right with
Android right there's been TVs in last
couple years but this is a halo product
from
I think I think Lenovo is making a big
bet which is great I think it's it's I
would argue the first good reasonable
implementation of Android on the TV
except for yours
well okay no but the I think you know
from my getting Google's perspective I
think we're supportive of Android being
I think we do believe that Android is
going to be the operating system for
television right I think there's just so
many advantages to it just like it
happened in mobile just like it's
happening in tablets and so our belief
is that the more that we can unlock the
better off it is now Google TV we
believe has some other digital
advantages in terms of how we're
thinking about the product and the user
experience but it doesn't mean that
Google's thinks it's bad and if they
have other devices out there right it's
one Android Market one set of API is
that people are building to which is
great that's good for the ecosystem cool
man
well thank you Rishi all right Theresa
Chandra director of Google TV and I'm
