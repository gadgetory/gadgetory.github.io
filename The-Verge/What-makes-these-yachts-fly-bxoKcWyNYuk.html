shoes and Hemingway's macho protagonists
who toil under harsh conditions and so I
was blown away when I saw the America's
Cup race take over the Hudson River this
is the elite technological competition
in the sport of sailing where boats are
literally flying
the original challenge for the America's
Cup that went over to England was from
the New York Yacht Club this bunch of
guys who got this boat that they thought
was pretty good and they took it over to
England for this race of the British it
advertised they gave 13 of the best
British yachts at Perot thrashing that
story is sort of what the America's Cup
is today the Queen asked and whose
second and her footman said ma'am there
is no second the boat is very very
powerful but their actual weight the
actual weight of the boats very low into
the great power-to-weight ratio that's
what allows them to slide
in the olden days our previous cups we'd
be lucky to make a 1% game which was
about 10% a year maybe 20% between the
cups
it's a incredible change and that's
because we're in this new whole way of
selling the books you can go fast enough
without creating so much drag that they
can actually have enough power to lift
the boat up out of the water once they
start flying they go much faster sort of
15 20 % faster because they've lifted
the hulls out of the water the
innovation is due to the use of hydro
foils in 2013 team Oracle USA - coil
designed to the next level in its 72
foot catamaran and it is the current
defending champion boats are going twice
as fast than they were just a decade ago
and have broken the famed 50 knot
barrier the boats are essentially
gliding above the water on the foils
which are called dagger boards as the
foils cut through the water fluid
forming over the upper surface of the
foil moves faster than the fluid on the
bottom creating the pressure difference
needed for lift at a certain speed the
lift produced by the hydrofoils equals
the weight of the boat and the hull
comes out of the water yachts use manual
power and the challenge is to make the
right tactical decisions grinding drives
hydraulic pumps which deliver high
pressure oil that has to be managed
carefully for maneuvers I think it's
possible we could see the boats never
touching down in the right wind
conditions they could sell the whole
race above the water it's been a
technical arms race since 1850 really
just starting you know we've gone from a
2,000 5,000 year old way of making boats
to something that's brand new not even
10 years old so in ten years from now we
could be on a whole new thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
