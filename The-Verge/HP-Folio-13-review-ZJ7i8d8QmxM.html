this is HP's first ultra book the folio
13 and as you can tell from the design
it is more aimed at business users
though HP's saying it is for everyone
the design is definitely reminiscent of
some of HP's business laptops like the
elite book or pro book it's got a nice
aluminum lid and a comfortable bottom
with sort of a rubberish feel but at 0.7
inches and 3.3 pounds it is much thicker
and heavier than some of the other ultra
books that said it is still pretty light
in hand and it is pretty thin given the
amount of full-size ports there's an
Ethernet two USB ports an HDMI port and
an SD card slot where HP really does
stand out amongst the other ultra ebooks
is both on its keyboard and touchpad the
keyboard is my favorite on any ultra
book to date the keys have a really nice
height to them and have a rubberish feel
to them that make them really
comfortable and unlike some of the other
ones it's backlit the touchpad still
isn't as responsive as the one on the
MacBook Air but it's pretty good for an
ultrabook
to finger scrolling is really smooth and
navigating is just fine the 13-inch
display isn't as bright as some of the
others on ultrabooks and it has pretty
bad viewing angles on top of that it has
a matte bezel that doesn't match the
glossy screen which I found pretty
annoying for $900 HP equips the folio 13
with a solid array of specs including a
Core i5 processor four gigs of RAM and
128 gigabyte SSD all of those together
provide good performance and the SSD
boots the system in 33 seconds and
resumes it from sleep in five seconds
even better it has great battery life on
the verge battery test it got over seven
hours of runtime which is better than
not only all the ultra ebooks but even
the MacBook Air however my biggest
complaints about the system come with
the software and the heat from the
bottom of the system the bottom of the
laptop can get pretty warm and it also
gets quite loud where the fan is located
HP also bundles the system with a ton of
crap where the desktop is littered with
links and shortcuts to websites you'll
probably never go to for $900 the HP
folio 13 provides the best blend of
performance battery life and ergonomics
of all the ultra books on the market
however it's not as thin and light as
some of the others for $400 more you can
get the MacBook Air which is thinner
lighter and has a better display still
HP has managed to make a really great
ultra book
