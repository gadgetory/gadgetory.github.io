and today we're at Amazon's UX labs in
San Francisco taking a look at two new
devices in the echo family this is the
new echo dot it works in some ways
similarly to the big echo now you can
use the dot as a speaker but you're
probably not going to want to use it as
a speaker because it's not that powerful
what you're really supposed to do with
this thing is either parrot via
bluetooth or connect it you can see the
line out here to a better speaker and
then have all the capabilities of the
echo through that speaker so just like
you can say to the regular echo you
could say to the dot Alexa call me an
uber or Alexa what were the results of
Super Tuesday and you would get a
response but it would actually happen
through your bigger better speaker the
dot goes on sale today and it costs
eighty nine ninety nine there is no deal
for prime users however amazon has put a
twist into the ordering process right
now you can only order one of these
through an existing Alexa device so you
either have to say to your Amazon TV
Alexa order me a dot or through the
existing echo speaker in order to get it
right now that's not forever Amazon says
eventually it will open orders up to
everybody so there it is the new Amazon
echo dot we also have a hands-on with a
new Amazon echo tap speaker so be sure
to check that out on YouTube and also
subscribe to our YouTube channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
