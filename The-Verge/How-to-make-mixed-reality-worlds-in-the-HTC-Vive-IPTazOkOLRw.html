reality video because it's incredibly
difficult to convey what people are
actually seeing inside a virtual world
but recently HTC and valve have been
coming up with a system that actually
lets you composite a real person into a
virtual reality world so we're going to
take a look at how they do it and we're
gonna show you how you could do it if
you wanted to try it the first thing
that you need for this is a green screen
what you'd need for any kind of cutout
of a person it has to keep the lighting
even and it has to create a flat
background but you'll be able to use to
overlay this person the next thing you
have to do is create a camera that
captures both the virtual and the real
world so you take a third vibe
controller and you strap it on top of
the camera and then the tricky part is
making sure that you're actually
capturing exactly the same view inside
the vibe and outside it the good news is
that once you do that they'll both stick
together so you can move the camera
anywhere you want then it's time to put
it all together you take a tool that
works with any unity or unreal game and
you composite all of these layers you
take the background of the game the
person on the green screen and then any
weapons or effects that should go in
front of them and you turn it all into
one flat video from right now HTC just
once developers to use this to show
people how cool their games are but in
the long run you can see it being used
for streamers for arcades and frankly we
could use it and it would let us stop
just describing things to you every time
we make a video just to recap if you
want to do it yourself here's what you
need a green screen some lights a Ford
valve controller a camera a vive system
some video editing know-how and a lot of
patience</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
