today at CES 2016 we're taking a look at
the ident alakh a smart gun lock so just
the other day President Obama took
federal agencies to step up research
into smart gun technology and has asked
the Department of Defense the Justice
Department as well as the Department of
Homeland Security to sponsor research
into gun safety technology at CES this
year one company is already ahead of the
curve with a biometric gun lock the
identical begin a ship this summer cost
three hundred nineteen dollars and
allows users to unlock their weapon with
their fingerprint in under a second once
the fingerprint registers and is
authenticated the lock falls off the
trigger portion of the gun allowing the
user to fire the gun lock is meant to
prevent accidental discharge and of
course preventing it from getting into
the wrong hands of the user the lock has
a lifespan of half a year and only takes
two hours to charge via USB what's
special about this gun lock however is
that it's essentially air gapped it
doesn't rely on an app or a computer
several users can directly register
their fingerprints of the device while
different profile settings allow one
super user to change permissions of
other users associated with the lock the
identity is the only smart gun lock at
CES this year but maybe next year at CES
will see more smart gun technology
thanks to the recent initiatives by
President Obama if you want to see more
