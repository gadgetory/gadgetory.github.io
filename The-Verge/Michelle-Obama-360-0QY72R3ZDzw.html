that's lovely tipping your head now but
look at that fantastic technology has
impacted Americans relationship with
government for 240 years we've gone from
stump speeches given on actual stumps to
radio to television now the internet and
things are moving faster than ever when
Barack Obama took office in 2008 he was
proudly known as the first blackberry
president but that Blackberry isn't
exactly proof of being tech savvy
anymore his administration has had to
rapidly embrace platforms like Twitter
Facebook in YouTube the public is more
engaged with government in more ways
than ever before but it's Michelle Obama
who's taken it even farther with her
initiatives aimed specifically at young
people she's pursued even newer tools
like vine Instagram snapchat and
periscope the first lady's office has
stood at the forefront of the changes
the White House is faced online while
still balancing her strategy with unique
authenticity somehow Michelle Obama is a
politician who's remained cool we had
the chance to speak with Michelle and
her communications director Caroline
Adler about how they pulled that off so
in less than a decade it's an enormous
amount change how did you think about
handling that change why do you decide
to so aggressively embrace social media
you know if you think about the campaign
this presidency we were always striving
to be kind of cutting-edge nowadays this
generation they're not watching Nightly
News they're not reading the newspapers
they're not watching the Sunday morning
shows they're on their phones so we had
to start thinking of creative and fun
ways to connect with those folks you
know because what we understood is that
this generation they're looking for
authenticity you know they're looking
for what feels real and natural so I
knew that my issues had to be real and
natural to me if I was going to be in
any way compelling to the audience's
that we were trying to reach so that's
been refreshing you know so people can
get to know me directly you know they
can see
I'm kind of silly sometimes that I care
they can feel the action they don't have
to have that filter through another
source and young people in particular
like that it's true and so much of what
Michelle does online she seems authentic
and natural it could be her donkey on
the Miami Heat with LeBron James or
hanging out with a few vine superstars
or rapping with Jay Pharoah in each of
these it feels like she's having fun but
behind the scenes a lot of work goes
into what she says and what platform she
is to say it the first lady has four
initiatives that she and her team
promote each of these requires a
different approach to find a right
audience on a right planet so something
as simple as turning up with a turn it
takes a lot of planning when you are
planning to do something online when
you're planning to do something on
Instagram how does that idea how to turn
up for what happened walking through it
the beauty is is I'm surrounded by a lot
of Millennials yeah
so I usually get ideas from my team well
and it's often about what is the
strategic priority know what is a
strategic goal that we want to achieve
each of the first lady's four
initiatives let's move
joining forces reach higher and the pros
learn each have a goal and they have a
different audience we wonder what's the
platform that will serve us fast
so return for what so that was actually
a product of the first lady's first vine
QA hey it's Michelle Obama I'm excited
to answer your question it's a bomb
what you gave it falls eggs my favorite
fall vegetable is a sweet potato my name
is Julie how'd you get kids to work out
when they don't want I remind kids that
working out is just like playing on
average how many calories you burn every
time you turn up turn up for what we
want to make healthy eating and active
kids part of the conversation and it was
all because we started out wanting to
have a conversation on platforms where
our audience slick says I feel good I do
was that your idea was it the
president's idea
yeah well you know know as one of our
team ya know and it it helps that you
know the president what helps with me
and the president as if is that we're
connected enough to pop culture that I
know who Little John is I know the song
my kids are singing it so when someone
somebody says you know why don't we do
turn up for what I get it immediately
and I was like okay that can be cute so
one thing that strikes me on all of this
which i think is fascinating is that the
tools that you use to create the media
and then distribute the media are the
same tools that the public is now using
to both consume when you create but then
also to create their own media they're
intimately familiar with how to use
snapchat they're intimately familiar
with how to use Instagram I think that's
really changed the nature of the
communication I think change that your
politics do you see that as it changed
how you approach being first time you
know um yeah definitely you know what we
learned is that we have to be nimble you
know you can't sort of be stuck in the
way things were done or in the way we
did things even in the first term you
know because the social media platforms
are ever-changing and you got to be
ready to move and shift with them my
whole goal the question that I asked
myself that our team we ask ourselves is
what's going to work what's going to
move the needle what's going to change
the conversation because what we talked
about even coming in was that
you know we don't want to be an
administration a presidency is just into
meaningless slogans we want to do things
that are actually going to change
people's lives and the only way to do
that is to constantly make those shifts
so that the message is getting directly
to the people that you're trying to
reach and if that means vine all right
let's bring some of the VI VIIRS in here
and let's do some fun stuff with them if
that's what young people are listening
to if we want to get more people into
the White House and have them access the
people's house well then let's use
virtual Rios to open up these tours so
that millions of people who know who can
never come and see these rooms have the
opportunity to do it that's the beauty
of this administration we have all of
these wonderful tools to just open
things up more and more and it's been so
much fun doing it one thing I would add
is you know it's a little-known fact the
first lady's office doesn't have any
congressional authority or any
independent funding we got enough it we
got nothing except a great principal and
a good open thing other than that when
we want to have you know when you want
to have impact we want to open the White
House and you want to move the needle on
all of the initiatives that you know
have become hallmarks of this office
social media is a great opportunity for
that and I think that you I hope you
would agree that you know the next you
know people who are here it's it expands
the office it expands the impact that
you can have without those other
resources but even though there's so
much good to be found online there's
also a lot of bad these new platforms
can be used for abuse and the past few
years have seen people particularly
women people of color and other
underrepresented groups suffer the kind
of harassment and silences then that's
something the verge takes very seriously
and it's why our parent company Vox
media has teamed up with Intel and
others to launch hack harassment a way
to work with social platforms to
safeguard users from online abuse what
do you think platforms like Instagram
Facebook Twitter can do to stop this
problem you know and as a mom you know
this is one of the things that I worry
about because you know we were talking
about this the other day in the office
it's just you know these platforms not
only do you bypass the middleman but
with young people you can bypass the
parent you know my my kids first
connection to social media happened
without me involved because they can get
their phones and they can tap into this
stuff and they're using it before you
even know when you're talking about
really young kids you know they don't
know what they're doing you know as I
said it's like given you know a 12 year
old the keys to the car and going just
see what happens you know get out there
on the road figure it out and you know
bad stuff can happen so one of the
things I hope that the the social media
platforms all you guys can get together
and and help teach these kids all the
many positive ways that they can use
these platforms because there are so
many make those positive uses trendier
they will do what school it's just you
guys have to make the right thing cool
well you've been helping out a lot and
doing cool stuff yeah well I'm doing it
so you got one year left what's what do
you want to accomplish this year and
what kind of legacy only particularly
with communicating with young people on
platforms well we want to you know we
this platform is so unique we will never
have it again the White House this
experience you know social media allows
the country to grow with the White House
we or the White House to grow with the
country you know they're constant
changes young people expect and want
something different from their
leadership and social media gives us the
tools to stay connected and to again be
flexible and to reach people where they
need to be reached so that they get the
message
said they understand the policies that
you know we are desperately desperately
trying to implement you can't do it now
without this kind of connection so we're
going to spend these 12 months on every
single issue making sure we're driving
to the very end
