surface tablets so you got surface 2 and
the surface pro 2 now they don't look
too different to last year's models so
apart from a sort of silver Edition on
the surface 2 but underneath they've
added a lots more battery life a lot
more power and much was really trying to
explain why you want to purchase one of
these this year so we sat down with
Panos Panay the creator of surface see
what's really changed this time and
what's really happening with the future
of surface 2 things to think about one
it's it's time for the next generation
yeah had to be they have to be faster
they have to be longer battery life
we had to innovate innovate innovate and
the thing I didn't Hammer really hard
but to get it in a better package we
have a whole team that looks at this and
says ok hey we need to make this product
laughable I don't even know what that
word means we just made it up and we're
like soul app ability and we just keep
making up more words around this and at
the end of the day we need to solve the
problem for using it on your lap to get
to the second angle of the kickstand
there's a ton of research on what's the
best angle and you know whether we used
I use the joke but it was true whether
you're 5/8 or 65 now this product is
going to work for you and the other
thing was stability in the lap so that
angle with the stability and that gap to
create the stability where the two
things we studied with users over and
over the beauty of this product is we're
able to go out and talk about it when we
created the original surface RT we did
that truly in like a vault lap ability
wasn't just about the angle here take
this for just a minute and so these are
the type cover twos these products are
brand new now they're thinner they
literally are a millimeter thinner than
the original type cover they're mostly
you feel it right so super rigid they
don't bend at all they actually only
Bend enough to make them a comfortable
personal device and not more than that
if I make them too rigid you're like
dude these things are like steel what
did you put in here they're weapons but
now it's at that point of rigidity where
it feels great so when you do put it in
your lap you have no bending and you can
get the full typing experience so put it
in the other angle first and see the
difference so now you get a little bit
scared and uncomfortable
because of that wobble that's a that's
the problem now you go here and that's
gone and it's definitely good that's all
we solved for we didn't go and put 22
different angles in there and try and
create something that was going to be
fake because it takes away from it being
a great tablet but we were able to go
out and solve you'll feel the key switch
a little bit being a lot shorter from
the throw perspective just type on it
for a day and you'll find yourself
typing faster the mouse ISM is a little
bit different check it out you're using
a modern trackpad so when you swipe from
the left here now getting the charms I
was wondering what up on them yeah so
you know this is just exactly what you'd
expect from that generational
improvement we're working on a lot of
stuff the one thing I'm clear on from a
brand perspective what we're going to
accomplish is we're going to continue to
make products that help people be more
productive I mean they will continue to
be various shapes sizes everything you
can possibly just come just open your
mind up and I'll open it with you are
the work we're doing is how we're going
to continue to integrate all of
Microsoft into these products bring them
to life for people and then we'll look
at all the different sizes and
opportunities and forms that come with
that and that's what that team is doing
right now so obviously a lot of your
competitors have got 7-inch products and
8-inch products yeah if you were looking
at that from a Productivity aspect how
would you make that sort of device but
now if I told you how I would do that
I'd be giving one or two many things
away that's but it's a great question
and it's the right way to think about it
yeah this is you think could barely be
here here's what I'd say there are so
many amazing productivity opportunities
out there that people can love and then
learn to love their devices and have fun
with them on top of it and size is a big
part of that a massive part of that
there's lots of smooth changes to the
surface too and the surface pro 2 this
time around but will they be enough for
consumers to buy a mic source is clearly
invested in this surface project and it
has a future and it's something that
we're clearly going to see in the coming
months ahead
