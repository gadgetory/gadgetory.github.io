here hanging out with Spiros newest
product the spark plus this little ball
is aimed at the education market it's
meant to teach kids about robotics and
coding and just to make all kinds of
lessons more fun we went through a bunch
of stuff today I got to drive a chariot
that was built I had a boat and this
little thing swam around
I made some art and program my way
through a maze it comes with an app
lightning lab that lets you do
drag-and-drop coding and you can also
sort of peek inside with those little
modules and see what the actual code
looks like behind it and it's also kind
of like a social network you can upload
your ideas for lessons you can like
people stuff and leave comments and you
can share lesson plans with people
around the world so right now the
original spark is in about a thousand
schools across the US and Canada and
this one that's coming out is the same
price $129 it's got a tougher skin so it
won't scratch it's got smarter Bluetooth
so it's easier to connect but other than
that it's pretty much the same thing
spiros had a lot of success over the
last year with this there's a whole
bunch of different sphero's there's the
normal one the rough-and-tumble one for
outdoor is the one that's tied in with
Star Wars merchandising the one that's
most interesting to me as a parent is
the educational one it's meant to teach
your kids about computer science and
help them get the kind of jobs that are
going to be available before the robots
take them all from us
much better mic sorry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
