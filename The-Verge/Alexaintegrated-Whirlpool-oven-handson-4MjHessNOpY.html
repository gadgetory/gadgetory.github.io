ahead of CES Amazon announced a new
Alexis scale they'll let you control
your oven now at CES we're at the
whirlpool kitchen where a new line of
appliances will work with both Alexa and
thrust peas a plug yum ways and you can
figure out the ingredients in your
fridge to figure out what to make for
the night so there's a new whirlpool
fridge it's got a little screen on it
it'll tell you the time you can actually
also use it to add digital Amazon -
buttons for when your stuff runs out now
we're going to go through with a yummy
app you can use the image recognition
portion of this app to either scan your
entire fridge or just ingrediens you
want to cook tonight so let's see what
we got so we've got asparagus so you
want a protein and that salmon and round
it out with potato and based on that
alone we have a handful of recipes that
we can make so let's go with that one
and you have the instructions here but
you also have an ingredient list of what
else you need such as lemon and salt
that's pretty basic standard stuff
there's also nutritional values which is
pretty useful if you care about that
stuff once you hit make and start
cooking the oven is now integrated with
the app to communicate with one another
so that it's preheating the oven as you
start cooking so at this point you're
putting the potatoes in it's got a timer
on how long you need to put them in it's
also giving you instructions on how to
best cook these things based on how long
they need the potatoes need to go first
the fish and go later so that's pretty
helpful so once you press the maked you
do have to press it twice to make sure
that you want the oven turned on so
that's a pretty good confirmation that
you want the oven on and once you go
through all these steps when you're done
the app does give you a push
notification to come back and retrieve
your Cook's food and if you don't come
back soon enough the app also does know
to communicate with the oven to
automatic
cool down to warm your food so that you
don't burn it and if you don't come back
soon enough
they'll just shut off so that you don't
accidentally overflow your house with
gas if you don't have your phone on hand
there's also a screen on the oven itself
that tells you how far along the preheat
is it also gives you instructions on
when you're ready to pull out your baked
potatoes or if you need to leave them
for longer or if you decided to leave it
in the oven to warm for those five
minutes it gives you a timer for that as
well
and if you're not near your phone you
can also use the screen on the oven here
to press Start so that you can start
with cooking your salmon and there's a
digital timer here that lets you know
when it's going to be done when it is
done either you can come back and check
the oven or you'll also get a push
notification to your Apple watch or
phone the microwave works the same way
it's also got a little digital screen
that gives you instructions in case your
recipe with yummly requires using a
microwave so the new range comes in
three different colors stainless steel
black stainless and bronze I think this
color is pretty nice and I've touched it
a couple of times now it's actually
pretty good at not retaining any
fingerprints which is great for when
you're cooking it is a little expensive
the microwave starts at around eight
hundred dollars the rain just starts at
nineteen fifty and the fridge starts at
forty 2.99 now I might feel kind of
weird to set up Wi-Fi on your stove and
microwave but that's sort of the
direction that smart foam is moving
towards which means of your Wi-Fi goes
down all this just becomes a regular
dumb appliance which means that if you
are using these apps together to learn
how to cook that's great and it's great
for convenience but definitely don't
rely on it to not burn your house down
oh wow assisted cooking there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
