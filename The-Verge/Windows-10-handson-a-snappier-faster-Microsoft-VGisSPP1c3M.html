verge and we're getting a quick look
here at Windows 10 like the most recent
build that Marshalls gonna throw out in
a couple of weeks and so obviously we
saw the Start menu back in September and
there's a few additions and changes here
and we've got like a expand Start menu
mode which will literally bring it sort
of fullscreen and you pop that back and
kind of helpful on a device has got
mouse and keyboard and again you've got
all the normal controls you get in
Windows apps fullscreen we'll go to that
sort of size what you'd expect and what
makes us really doing here he's trying
to pull in this sort of form factor so a
tune one like a surface pro free and
trying to make it a little bit a little
bit less jarring when it's full screen
and the sort of the problems that were
associated for in as a tracer so you got
like a new full-screen mode that will
take you back to Sochi what the app
would look like in Windows 8 and he'd
get back to their evil so you've also
got a new Settings panel here which
essentially replaces the charms menu
now you get your notifications quick
access to easy settings down here so
turning off the rotation law etc and you
can also enable continuum here which is
essentially a new mode that will
basically change the apps into full
screen app so you can take away the
keyboard and use this as as a tablet
everything goes full screen including
like the traditional police the
traditional desktop apps and everything
is really you know just what you'd
expect with with the touch mode and then
you can quickly switch back to the sort
of shall we say desktop mode I guess
where you can easily resize windows and
then back to a keyboard and mouse so the
kind of interesting thing about this
continuum sort touch mode is you've got
new ways to interact with app so you can
put you can basically tile switch
between apps here you can drag and snap
getting new apps from the toss which
again pull down any key off apps very
similar to Windows 8 but just feels a
little bit more polished so we're bring
in ma on that folder - you still have
that kind of view and you can resize the
windows just as you would in Windows 8
so they're not really getting rid of all
this stuff they're just making it a
little bit easier to use and some of
them new additions in this build we've
got the Cortana search down the bottom
here so you can literally type in the
weather and you will see launched the
application also much done a lot of work
on the desktop icons here which have
traditionally been kind of really weird
mixing that Windows 8 you can see just
in the basic File Explorer here they've
upgraded a lot of the icons you can see
that even in the sort of folder icons
and various places and again like the UI
on the taskbar has been tweaked here
from C got the purple theming here and
we saw in some of the demos on stage it
was a transparency of course does that
mean that doesn't seem to be here just
yet that's obviously a work in progress
and there's clearly some some some flux
going on with the UI that we're gonna
gonna see some some interesting changes
I think a lot more modern changes on the
desktop there so yeah I mean this is
essentially the the latest version of
Windows 10 and running on a two-in-one
tablet which is pretty much the most
interesting way you're gonna see Windows
10 on these sort devices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
