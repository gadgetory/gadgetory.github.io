verge and we're getting a quick look
here at Windows 10 like the most recent
bill that much was going to throw out in
a couple of weeks and so obviously we
saw the Start menu back in September and
there's a few additions and changes here
and got like a expand start menu mode
which will literally bring it full
screen and you put that back and kind of
helpful on a device has got mouse and
keyboard and again you've got all the
normal controls are you getting windows
apps full screen will go to that sort of
size what you'd expect and what makes us
really doing here is trying to pull in
this sort of form factor so a tune one
like a surface pro free and trying to
make it a little bit a little bit less
jarring when it's full screen and the
sort of the problems that were
associated for in as a true sir so
you've got like a new full screen mode
that will take you back to say she what
the app would look like in Windows 8 and
he get back to their evil so you've also
got a new settings panel here which
essentially replaces the charms menu now
you get your notifications quick access
to easy settings down here so turning
off rotation law etc and you can also
enable continuum here which is
essentially a new mode that will
basically change the apps into full
screen apps you can take away the
keyboard and use this as as a tablet
everything goes full screen including
like the traditional release of
traditional desktop apps and everything
is really you know just what you'd
expect with with the touch mode and then
you can quickly switch back to the sort
of shall we say desktop mode i guess and
where you can easily resize windows and
in back to a keyboard and mouse so the
kind of interesting thing about this
continuum sort touch mode is you've got
new ways to interact with that so you
can put you can basically tile switch
between apps here you can drag and snap
get a new absent from the task switcher
again pull down and kill off apps I'm
very similar to windows 8 but just feels
a little bit more polish so we're
bringing em a lap over to here then the
music app actually go and then you can
tap on that one look at you go side by
side so you still have that kind of view
you can resize the windows just as you
would in windows 8 say they're not
really getting rid of all this stuff
they're just making it a little bit
easier to use and some of them new
additions in this build we've got the
Cortana search down the bottom here so
you can literally type in weather and
you will see launch the application also
much done a lot of work on the desktop
icons here which have traditionally been
kind of a really weird mixing that
Windows 8 you can see just in the basic
file explorer here they've upgraded a
lot of the icons you can see that even
in the sort of folder icons various
places and again like the UI on the
taskbar has been tweaked here from see
got the purple feeling here and we saw
in some of the demos on stage as a
transparency courses that mean that
doesn't seem to be here just yet that's
obviously a work in progress and there's
clearly some some some flux going on
with the UI that we're going to going to
see some some interesting changes I
finger a lot more modern changes on the
desktop there and so yeah I mean this is
essentially the the latest version of
Windows 10 and running on a two-in-one
tablet which is pretty much the most
interesting way you're going to see
Windows 10 on these sort of Isis</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
