combine a fitness tracker and a
SmartWatch if your Samsung it looks like
this 199 dollar gear fit is Samsung's
first attempt at a wrist worn fitness
tracker and it borrows a lot of elements
from the company's line of gear
smartwatches
it's by far the most handsome of
Samsung's wearables with an attractive
design and slim enough profile it's made
of rubber and plastic so it's definitely
not premium but it's not a bad looking
device at all the real star of the show
here though is the fits gorgeous curved
touchscreen display it's bright vibrant
and has incredible viewing angles it's
also easy to read outdoors which is
really important for a fitness device
the fit is the first device I've seen
where a curved display actually makes
sense and fits in with what the product
is supposed to do the fits rubbery band
is comfortable to wear and the clasp is
easy to close which I can't really say
for competitors like the Fitbit force or
flex but for all the nice things I can
say about the fits hardware
unfortunately that beauty is only
skin-deep the main problem with the fit
is that it's just not a very good
fitness tracker and not a very good
SmartWatch the fits horizontal layout
proves to be pretty hard to use by
default the display is oriented
horizontally which makes it awkward to
read when you're wearing it there's an
option to switch that orientation to
vertical and that's what I ended up
using most of the time but then text is
condensed and reading anything on the
display requires a lot of swiping the
touchscreen isn't always responsive
either requiring me to tap at it
repeatedly at times the fit does do the
things that you'd expect from a fitness
tracker it can count your steps track
your sleep and even has a built-in heart
rate monitor but the step counter proved
to be wildly inaccurate awarding me far
more steps and it should have for many
activities likewise the heartrate
tracker is painfully slow and gives me
readings that don't always line up with
my state of activity or lack thereof
using the fit to track your activity is
also a chore unlike the Fitbit flex or
basis band you have to actually tell the
fit to track your steps if you forget to
turn the pedometer on it just won't
record your activity likewise the sleep
tracking requires you to remember to
tell the fit that you're going to sleep
and that well you've woken up in the
morning with every other fitness tracker
offering these functions automatically
it just seems like a real oversight by
Samsung with the fit the fit pairs with
Samsung's s health app on your
smartphone to organize all of your
Fitness data but s health proves also be
lacking in many areas there's also a
built-in fitness coach that's designed
to give you challenges to meet your
goals throughout the day
but there's no way to view my sleep
activity and Samsung just doesn't do a
great job of tying all of this data
together into something I can actually
use on the SmartWatch side of things the
fit can show you basic notifications
from your phone including those from
third-party apps but there's little you
can do with those notifications other
than just clear them you can set up
message templates for quick replies to
text messages or to reject incoming
calls but aside from that the SmartWatch
functions are quite limited and the fact
that the screen isn't always on makes it
a poor replacement for an actual watch
finally the fits battery is also just
disappointing requiring a charge every
two days or so it charges through this
awkward USB adapter that will most
surely get lost and even though the fit
has a small battery it takes a lot
longer to fully charge than I expected
or really wanted to wait for there's
going to be a lot of smart watches on
the market this year in addition to a
lot of fitness trackers the gear fits
limitations price and the fact that it
only works with Samsung devices put it
at a disadvantage right from the start
and I have a feeling that those who are
patient will have much better options in
the near future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
