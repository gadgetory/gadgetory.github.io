and this is the qualcomm toq you know
tuck as in tick tock this is a
SmartWatch we're looking at it's also
the first consumer product that qualcomm
a company better known for its
smartphone ships has made in a long time
actually calling it a consumer product
is a bit of a stretch at $350 its price
outstrips comparable devices like the
pebble by two hundred dollars and even
the more functional Galaxy gear by 50
instead the talk is more of a technology
demonstrator for mirasol the unique
display technology that qualcomm has
been trying to figure out how to sell
for a number of years mirasol selling
point is that it sips power and is
extremely daylight readable like II Inc
without needing a backlight but it
refreshes much faster closer to the
performance of an LCD it's about as
close to a no-compromise display
technologies exist right now while the
display is great the rest of the talk
feels very much like a first generation
product cual comes not really a consumer
electronics maker much less a watchmaker
and it shows an odd interface paradigm
employees both a capacitive touchscreen
to swipe through menus and make
selections and also a touch-sensitive
watchband touch below the face to go
home DoubleTap above the face to enable
the backlight the idea appears to have
been to eliminate traditional buttons
from the side of the watch entirely but
there are serious trade-offs I found
myself inadvertently activating both the
backlight in the home button on numerous
occasions either from handling or simply
by folding my arms and making skin
contact with the band there aren't any
markers or depressions on the band to
indicate where to press either so it's
not uncommon to fumble with it with a
few misplaced taps before finding the
sweet spot when you need to see the
screen in a dark room for instance but
the biggest downside to the talk might
be that you can't swap in an
off-the-shelf band of your choosing the
watches black plastic band makes no real
effort to look good and it uses a
cumbersome clasp that is difficult to
open unless you've got some strong
fingernails it also needs to be resized
by physically cutting it with scissors
you better get it right the first time
and good luck lending it to a friend
with a bigger wrist beyond a selection
of attractive watch faces some of which
include other information like your
upcoming calendar entries or the current
weather the talk ships within a
selection of apps that will likely
expand over time you can set stocks you
want to track control your phones music
player see a call log or pull up your
phone's notification list feels like an
appropriate scope of functionality for
glanceable gadget on your wrist
it's not trying to do too much like the
Galaxy gear and it isn't selling itself
short like the citizen proximity pairing
is easy to Qualcomm includes perhaps the
best looking best feeling easiest to use
companion app for your smartphone of any
SmartWatch I've tried where you download
new firmware and select watch faces
choose which calendars you want to show
and so on there's no iOS app yet though
it's Android only at the moment so there
will be an instant deal breaker for a
good percentage of the population
ultimately the talk isn't a SmartWatch
I'd recommend someone by but it is a
device that makes me rave about what I
want to SmartWatch to really be I can
tell you I know I wanted to have one of
these great marisol displays and really
I think that's exactly what Qualcomm is
going for</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
