this is the qualcomm talk you know tuck
as in tick-tock this is a SmartWatch
we're looking at it's also the first
consumer product that Qualcomm a company
better known for its smartphone chips
has made in a long time actually calling
it a consumer product is a bit of a
stretch at $350 its price outstrips
comparable devices like the pebble buy
$200 and even the more functional galaxy
gear by 50 instead the talk is more of a
technology demonstrator for Mirasol the
unique display technology that Qualcomm
has been trying to figure out how to
sell for a number of years Mirasol
selling point is that it sips power and
is extremely daylight readable like ink
without needing a backlight but it
refreshes much faster closer to the
performance of an LCD it's about as
close to no compromised display
technology as exists right now while the
display is great the rest of the talk
feels very much like a first generation
product Paul comes not really a consumer
electronics maker much less a watch
maker and it shows an odd interface
paradigm employs both a capacitive touch
screen to swipe through menus and make
selections and also a touch sensitive
watchband touch below the face to go
home DoubleTap above the face to enable
the backlight the idea appears to have
been to eliminate traditional buttons
from the side of the watch entirely but
there are serious trade-offs
I found myself inadvertently activating
both the backlight and the home button
on numerous occasions either from
handling or simply by folding my arms
and making skin contact with the band
there aren't any markers or depressions
on the band to indicate where to press
either so it's not uncommon to fumble
with it with a few misplaced taps before
finding the sweet spot when you need to
see the screen in a dark room for
instance but the biggest downside to the
talk might be that you can't swap in an
off-the-shelf band of your choosing the
watch's black plastic band makes no real
effort to look good and it uses a
cumbersome clasp that is difficult to
open unless you've got some strong
fingernails it also needs to be resized
by physically cutting it with scissors
you better get it right the first time
and good luck lending it to a friend
with a bigger wrist beyond a selection
of attractive watch faces some of which
include other information like your
upcoming calendar entries or the current
weather the talk ships within a
selection of apps that will likely
expand over time you can set stocks you
want to track control your phone's music
player see a call log or pull up your
phone's notification lists feels like an
appropriate scope of functionality for a
glanceable gadget on your wrist
it's not trying to do too much like the
Galaxy gear and it isn't selling itself
short like the citizen proximity pairing
is easy too
Qualcomm includes perhaps the
best-looking best feeling easiest to use
companion app for your smartphone of any
SmartWatch I've tried where you download
new firmware and select watch faces
choose which calendars you want to show
and so on
there's no iOS app yet though its
Android only at the moment so that'll be
an instant deal-breaker for a good
percentage of the population ultimately
the talk isn't a SmartWatch I'd
recommend someone buy but it is a device
that makes me rave about what I want to
SmartWatch to really be I can tell you I
know I wanted to have one of these great
Mirasol displays and really I think
that's exactly what Qualcomm is going
