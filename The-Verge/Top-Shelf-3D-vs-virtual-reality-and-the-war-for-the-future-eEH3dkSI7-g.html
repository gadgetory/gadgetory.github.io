have nothing to do with each other but
they followed surprisingly similar paths
both have been mostly confined to
novelty users like the snake that jumps
out of the screen at you at Honey I
Shrunk the Kids it does in the world and
virtual reality has basically just been
for video games and sex scenes and
sci-fi movies more recently though both
made a move toward the mainstream and
they've been tapped to do roughly the
same thing even make our movies games
and the whole digital world much more
immersive both aren't even designed to
replicate how it is we see the world
take 3d for instance when you look at
the world through your actual eyes they
see two slightly different pictures
because your eyes are set apart your
brain meshes them into one which is how
you perceive depth accurate that's also
why catching a ball with only one eye
open is really hard 3d cameras do the
same thing they shoot with two lenses
and essentially capture two images that
they then project into your separate
eyes you use either anaglyph glasses
where one eye sees a red image in the
other sees blue or polarized glasses
which pick up light being projected in
two different directions and piped them
into each eye there's also active
shutter three beam auto stereoscopic 3d
which is just a fancy way for saying the
screen does all the work and you don't
need glasses and plenty of other options
they all rely on your brain to take two
distinct images and turn them into one
3d hasn't really caught on though at
least not among consumers and everyday
people it's difficult and expensive to
do right it still requires that you sit
with your head very still and at a very
particular angle and there are a huge
number of people for whom it either
doesn't work at all or actually makes
them sick the technology is still
changing and it's going to continue to
improve but here's the thing virtual
reality might eat 3ds lunch before it
ever gets a chance virtual reality's
also been around forever
it's also been gimmicky for most of that
time and is only recently threatening to
become something we use in our day to
day lives on one hand it has a lot of
the same limitations as 3d you have to
wear a thing connected to another thing
and it can be really disorienting for
some people but when done right Virtual
Reality brings the immersion to an
entirely new level it's all about
exploration good Virtual Reality creates
a three-dimensional world that doesn't
just appear to have death it has dead an
object will look different depending on
how you look at it and you can even see
it from the back you can't do that with
a 3d camera basically virtual reality
works by tricking what are called placed
cells in our brain these cells are what
orient us in a new and
there how we figure out where we parked
or even get around our house and
surprisingly once we're in a new
environment these cells make it really
easy to figure out where we are even if
we found our just a short time but
virtual reality has its own
complications and challenges for this
reality to feel real there has to be
zero latency when you turn your head you
need to be looking to the side exactly
as fast as you expect any lag takes you
out of the experience and the effect as
it catches up can be so disorienting
that you can actually get sick and these
place cells you need information like
smells and temperature to really give
you a full sense of where you are both
3d and virtual reality are still
maturing but they're both moving towards
the same goal we want our movies to feel
like video games and our video games to
feel like real life
convertible reality bring the change 3d
promise and just how far into the matrix
can we really go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
