theorem it's out on video on demand and
it's in some theaters but it's not
everywhere maybe because it's not that
good of a movie at the end you sort of
just feel like what did I watch here and
I should tell you right now it could be
a lot of spoilers here there's this guy
he's a programmer in the future he's
trying to solve the zero theorem
basically it's this attempt to prove
that the universe is going to shrink
back on itself and turn into nothing
although it's a little bit like paint by
the numbers Gilliam you're expecting
your standard Kafka ask Brasil but then
the second half of the movie you're
basically locked in a church with the
main character who in leather the
thematics of this guy who like believes
in God and is sitting in a church it's
just a little bit heavy-handed so
basically every single character in zero
theorem acts kind of like an archetype
they're there to forward this larger
philosophical argument that's happening
more so than you actually get you
connect to them as people
except for bainsley the love interest
she actually feels like she has real
human feelings and motivations so when
you see a Terry Gilliam film you expect
a certain amount of visual flourish
there's Batman the Redeemer billboards
there's crazy ads there's people wearing
hilarious outfits made out of plastic
lots of great set design - it feels like
this surreal place that's designed to
sort of make this larger philosophical
parable kind of argument so let's talk
about the end at the
and Cohen has put on the virtual reality
suit that's designed to help him find
his soul and everything goes wrong and
he ends up getting sucked into the
computer and he sees all of these faces
and people the people that he's
connected to Sam the internet swirling
into the black hole of nothingness
he's like a screw it and he jumps in and
he ends up on the beautiful sunny beach
rather than be like oh this sucks or
what's going on here and he starts
playing with the Sun that's setting the
zero theorem is true everything is
meaningless you might as well play
around on the universe and have fun but
if you look at it as a metaphor for the
Internet rather than freak out about our
attention deficit and we can't connect
to each other as humans just sort of
accept that this is a reality that we've
created for ourselves it's this like
standard do you believe in meaning or do
you believe in this nihilistic future
philosophically I didn't get a whole lot
out of the movie it's definitely not
Gilliam's best work and you're not going
to leave the theater feeling super
awesome
