introducing the third industry milestone
product Macintosh handle and it's as
easy to use as this Macintosh the
computer for the rest of us
it's an idea so intelligent it can
transform itself if you thought a really
powerful business computer was way out
of your reach we have news for you
introducing the affordable Macintosh
classic - some people think the Pentium
2 is the fastest processor
the chip inside every new power
Macintosh g3 is up to twice as fast well
today incredibly pleased to introduce
iMac the excitement of the Internet
with the simplicity of Macintosh the
1999 new power Macintosh g3 it's built
out of polycarbonate which is the same
stuff they use to make bulletproof vests
out of what they wanted with an iMac to
go let me tell you what the deep boy
look like that's a lot for one day
there's one more thing possibly the most
beautiful product we've ever designed
the computer is in an 8 inch cube and
it's suspended in a stunning crystal
clear enclosure we want both the power
and the sex so today we're introducing a
totally new power book this is the new
on one point three inches thick there it
is
I don't think it could be more black and
white today we're gonna say goodbye to
that iMac because today we're announcing
a new iMac John Rubinstein is Hardware
team have outdone themselves this time
it is the thinnest power book ever the
new 17-inch
a new 12-inch PowerBook
we are delivering today the world's
fastest personal computer and we're
calling it the g5 what were the creators
of the iPod do for the next computer I
like to be the first to show you the all
new iMac
and so today we think we know what they
have in mind and we're introducing it
it's called the Mac Mini and this is
what it looks like it's very very tiny
we announced that we were going to shift
to using Intel processors Steve on at
the report that Intel's ready be set
free and get to live life inside a Mac
we're going to put an Intel processor
inside a new iMac we are introducing a
new notebook computer that we are
calling the MacBook Pro I am so excited
I get to be the very first one to
introduce all of you to the brand new
Mac Pro there is one other product that
you don't really think of as a math but
it's a really important product or a
product line and that's XAR what would
an iMac look like if we upgraded it and
made it out of aluminum and glass well
it looks like this this is the new iMac
design and it's just stunning we're
introducing a third kind of notebook
it's called the MacBook Air
yeah there it is
I'm trying to design some new unibody
enclosures for some new notebooks some
of you are familiar with our current
MacBook Pro and today we're gonna
replace it with this what would happen
if a MacBook and an iPad hooked up this
is the result it is our new MacBook Air
and we think it's the future of
notebooks what would make a next
generation MacBook Pro you want a next
generation MacBook Pro to have a killer
new display yes it is a Retina display
the Mac Mini is our smallest most
affordable Mac and if you haven't looked
at one lately it's packed with a lot of
great features it's so great today for
you to be the first to see the next
generation of iMac so I am really
pleased to give you our closest friends
the first glimpse of the next generation
of Mac Pro can't innovate anymore my ass
I'm glad you had a chance to see
McIntosh McIntosh is the neatest product
I've ever seen in my life and it's going
to be able to make a qualitative
difference in the way that we
communicate with each other and coupled
with this radical ease of use which Lysa
technology provides I think we're going
to be able to bring these products to
not just hundreds of thousands or a few
million people but tens of millions of
people and that's really what the
personal computer revolution is all
about</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
