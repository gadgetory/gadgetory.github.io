ball dropping in confetti crowds in
Times Square
Miami has an all-night dance party
lagron their aha drop and of course
pitbull pitbull loves Miami and so
should you but now's the time to enjoy
it because the city probably won't exist
in the next 100 years Miami is one of
the first US cities already experiencing
the effects of climate change and it's
only going to get worse
60% of miami-dade county is less than 2
meters above sea level an unabated
climate change until 2100 could result
in a 4.3 29.9 meter sea-level rise as if
that weren't enough Miami's geology
renders it uniquely vulnerable the city
and its beaches are built on porous
limestone which soaks up seawater the
seawater force's sewage up from its
pipes were complete freshwater South
Florida is mostly at sea level about 2.4
million people live less than 1.2 meters
above the sea that's like if all the
residents of Wyoming Vermont and New
Hampshire were at risk
Miami isn't the only city facing in
Atlantis like future here in the u.s.
New Orleans is also under serious threat
and half of Mumbai India home to more
than 20 million people will be submerged
at the earth's temperature raises four
degrees Celsius above pre-industrial
levels in Egypt just a one meter
increase in sea level could force 10
percent of Egyptians mostly in the Nile
River Delta from their homes Bangladesh
will be 17% underwater by 2050
displacing about 18 million residents
2014 was the hottest year on
instrumental record since 1880 ten of
the last hottest years with the
exception of 1998 have occurred since
2000 and 2015 is on track to surpass
2014 by a significant margin in India
2015 had an extreme summer heat wave
causing 2,200 deaths up north
Greenland's ice sheets experienced
historically low ice cover unfortunately
current projections say 2016 isn't going
to be much better long-term we're
looking at a US which could look more
like this and a world that looks like
this
so as you're celebrating the New Year
ask who's gonna last longer Miami or
pitbull
my money's on mr. 305</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
