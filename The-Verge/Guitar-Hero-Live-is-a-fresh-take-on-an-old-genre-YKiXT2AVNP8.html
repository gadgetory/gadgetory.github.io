this is the future of guitar hero the
acclaimed plastic instrument franchise
of last generation is back with Guitar
Hero live from the developer behind the
more experimental DJ Hero we had a
chance to spend some time with an early
preview bill of the game set to launch
this October and while it's still a
Guitar Hero game through and through
there are some pretty interesting
changes we're talking about let's start
with the guitar itself which is probably
the most obvious change it feels
familiar enough this guitars are want to
do there's a neck a body way knee bar
and a clicky thing to pluck and rhythm
where Guitar Hero live changes things
it's what's on the neck instead of the
traditional five large buttons in a row
Guitar Hero live lays it out in a three
by two grid to put in a guitar parlance
it's like playing with two strings and
three frets if you're used to the older
guitar hero or rock band games there's
gonna be a bit of a learning curve here
sure there's less traveling for your
hand you don't have to use your pinky as
much and it takes a few songs to adjust
to the new style but it quickly become
familiar the chords so to speak do feel
more like chords but it took us several
songs to learn just how to read the new
on-screen highways there's now just
three such highways instead of five but
you now need to kind of keep an eye out
for three icons representing the top row
buttons the bottom row of buttons or
sometimes both eventually it just feels
like the same old Guitar Hero you listen
to music you see the notes and you
finger the controller accordingly Guitar
Hero live has two modes there's the more
traditional mode now play from a
first-person live action onstage point
of view thing and then there's Guitar
Hero TV which is probably the biggest
change here Guitar Hero TV is so
important to the game if there's even a
dedicated button on the controller
itself Guitar Hero TV is a series of
24-hour music video channels yep kinda
like the old M TV and you can kind of
jump into whichever one whenever you
want to play it's not something play
local you're actually jumping into a
live channel and playing along with
other people in real time around the
world scores and rankings are shown to
the left of the highway over the music
video and you can you can kind of jump
in and out any time if you stop playing
entirely all the kind of on-screen
graphics go away and you're basically
just left with a music video network
while Qatari RTV will offer free
channels there will be so-called premium
channels that you can unlock either
through beating challenges or paying
real cash Taher lives reps tell us
you'll be able to play most if not all
content without having to pay but if you
want to expedite your in-game collection
there'll be an option to buy that all
being said the business model Guitar
Hero live like the rest of the game
itself is still deep in development not
for much longer though Guitar Hero live
is coming out October 20th to most major
consoles and even select mobile devices</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
