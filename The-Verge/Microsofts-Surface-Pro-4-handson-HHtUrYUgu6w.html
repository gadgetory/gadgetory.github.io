verbs and we're here at microsoft's big
event today looking at the surface pro 4
it's got a bigger screen than last year
now twelve point three inches as opposed
to 12 inches but it's the same frame
that's now actually a thinner then
surface pro 3 was it's got faster
internals the pen is a lot more
sensitive it's also improved this year
is the keyboard keys are spaced out much
better it's much more like a standard
laptop and also the touchpad is glass
and it feels pretty great very sensitive
very responsive so the accessories are
better and the pen now attaches
Microsoft has done away with the prime
loop so now that then we'll attach
directly to the surface itself so it's a
lot easier to carry around I didn't have
to worry about storing any place else
but right on the tablet so the surface
pro 4 you can pre-order it today
starting at eight ninety-nine and it'll
be available on october 26</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
