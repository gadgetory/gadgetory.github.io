the new international docking adaptor to
the outside of the International Space
Station and that means that private
spacecraft now have a place to hook up
to the orbiting lab the International
docking adaptor or ITA
is a key piece of hardware for NASA's
Commercial Crew program that's where
private companies build and operate
spacecraft that can take astronauts to
and from the ISS currently NASA
astronauts have to fly on Russian
vehicles to get to the station
but with Commercial Crew American
astronauts will be flying to space on
american-made vehicles again SpaceX and
Boeing are the two companies working on
those vehicles for NASA at the moment
SpaceX is developing this a modified
version of its dragon cargo capsule
called crew dragon and Boeing is
creating this the cst-100 Starliner when
those vehicles finally launch to the
space station they'll be able to hook up
to the docking adaptor this is huge for
Commercial Crew because without the
International docking adaptor there's no
way for these Commercial Crew vehicles
to actually come to the space station
and dock and do the crew transfer a
critical aspect of the ITA is that it
allows vehicles to automatically dock
with the space station right now
incoming cargo spacecraft from SpaceX or
orbital ATK don't actually dock the
berth astronauts use the station's
robotic arm to grab the spacecraft and
pull it close to one of the ports on the
ISS it's something that takes up a lot
of the astronauts time with the new ID a
the station's crew doesn't have to be
involved with the docking process at all
the adaptor has a suite of onboard
sensors that help an incoming spacecraft
guide itself into the port the ITA then
has a set of 12 hooks that latch onto
the vehicle and dock it to the ISS
theoretically if they're when they're
coming in it's a hands off we let this
thing come in and dock on its own that's
the plan of course they'll still be a
kick going to do a manual docking or
something were to go wrong but the plan
is for both of our providers well if our
partners is using international docking
adaptor and just hands-off that come on
in and
the installation of this idea was extra
important since it was actually meant to
be the second adapter installed on the
station the first one was slated to go
up in June of 2015 but that didn't
really work out the adapter was
destroyed when the SpaceX Falcon 9 that
was carrying it disintegrated during
launch
SpaceX made up for that incident by
successfully launching this idea in July
of 2016 but NASA's plans were still
thrown off slightly our plan had been to
have both international docking adapters
on the ISS before the first commercial
crew launch however wasn't required that
we have both of them there was just a
desire to make sure the space station
was properly configured for them the
first commercial crew launches are
slated for 2017 but it's possible that
only one idea will be available on the
station when that happens NASA said it
is hoping to send up another idea before
the first launches get underway that may
not be the case depending on how
schedules line up but eventually two
ideas will be needed when commercial
crew gets into full swing in the future
NASA wants to be able to do something
called a direct crew handover that's
where two commercial vehicles are docked
with the ISS at the same time allowing
an incoming crew to hang out briefly
with an outgoing crew and NASA's going
to need two adapters for that plus if
there's only one idea installed incoming
spacecraft won't have an alternative
docking option that adapter fails once
we get to a point where we've got
multiple commercial crew providers
flying then we need both international
docking adapters but once those two
adapters are fully installed that will
be a big step toward NASA's plans of
opening up the ISS to more private
companies the ideas have been built to
the International docking system
standard it's an international standard
for how to build spacecraft docking
systems anyone that wants to build a
spacecraft to dock with the ISS can
download the specs for the standard
online that means that more private
companies beyond just SpaceX and Boeing
could potentially hook up to these ideas
someday
up to this point it's really been a very
small club of spaceflight participants
to date there's only been three entities
that have ever docked human vehicles in
space B China US and Russia by doing
this and putting the standard hoped
we're now opening up to commercial
entities and other non-traditional
countries to participate in this and
build a docking system design a docking
system want to know how this
international docking adapter got to the
ISS check out our video and what it's
like to watch a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket
launch and then land or if you're
curious to know how space will affect
future commercial crew members check out
