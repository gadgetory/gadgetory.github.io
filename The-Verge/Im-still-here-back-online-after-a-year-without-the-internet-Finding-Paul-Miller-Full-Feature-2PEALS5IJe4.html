two one all is leaving the internet for
a you've been on the internet for a
super long time here most of your adult
life right and you want to write you
want to write about like what is life is
life without you it's something that I
want to do for the personal exploration
of how it will help me deal with my
productivity my creativity and figuring
out how the Internet's impacting me just
stop the smell of flowers I mean really
just use the opportunity of this year
take hold of the basic and enjoys of
what I just feel overwhelmed because I
you know I don't seem to be in sync with
human race you know like I it's a it's
there's deeper deeper reasons for most
of my problems that really didn't have a
lot to do with the internet they just
manifest differently on and offline
when I was a freshman in the high school
he was a senior in high school we were
both did football so we don't really see
each other much but then he would he and
his buddy would drive me home after
practice I got to ride in the back of
his buddy's truck it's my phone
that's so cool knowing two seniors Zach
was just like the perfect person at all
times and he got in the Air Force
Academy then he flew 852 s and it has
been at the academy running the jump
team and now he's going to Qatar my
brother and I don't talk on the phone
very well it was always nice to be able
to Skype with his kids and I couldn't do
that this year so being with them in
person I got to connect with him in a
way that was just impossible this year
without the internet when I got the
color of Springs and my flight was
delayed and it seemed like a big hassle
and he's got one day left for this
family and I felt like I was crashing
the party you know this is like a really
emotional difficult goodbye for all of
them and like what was I doing there but
once I was there I felt like I really
belong there
so you've got a computer right so this
is your iMac the internet connects your
computer to other computers I
disconnected I don't have the internet
for a whole year spit without the
internets well I can't Skype with you
because I can't connect you didn't want
to do it yeah I wanted to take a break
cuz you don't like it I didn't like it
sometimes I think the Internet's really
good but sometimes I get a little tired
of it I used too much internet I see I
didn't spend time with real people but
now at the end of this month I'm gonna
be back on the internet and then I can
Skype with you
the true and it's a family
I felt this year I kind of missed a lot
of opportunities to leave the house and
leave New York I want to do something
really tangible before I came back to
the internet and you write novels about
road trips you make Road Trip movies but
sitting in your apartment all day is not
really that exciting to see yeah so the
general plan is not to have too much of
a plan like I don't want to be swept
along by an interstate and told to you
by Google Maps that I want to see if I
can see the beautiful midsection of
America so I left the internet this year
and I do think it was an indictment or
or Lisa a chance to judge how valuable
the Internet is to me I was pretty
surprised to see that in a lot of ways
it's non-vital at least the way I was
using it I thought when I first left the
internet that he'd be a lot of like
getting used to using the library in the
post office and like really practical
stuff but I just didn't really do much
of that I'm pretty good at getting
around New York if I need to get around
somewhere else I'd you know like buy
paper math I just did less you know I
didn't stress about the things I kind of
couldn't do I don't miss the internet I
don't dream about it I don't yearn for
it you know every once a while
somebody's like oh there's this really
funny thing a lot happening on Twitter
but I can't tell you you know but I
don't I don't care it you know my
biggest fear though is that at the end
of the year I don't want to really go
back to the internet for Laura even
though it's so awesome it's such a cool
thing I just I like myself a lot better
not on the internet so I feel like doing
a year of this is going to be
like a piece of cake this is just this
is basically really easy right now
they're like there's tiny minor
inconveniences in exchange for having a
blast a total complete blast for
beautiful Holly Colorado second 945 tour
real slow to start but it's alright and
we're really close to Kansas you're
gonna try to get all the way through
Kansas today we're kind of along the
Santa Fe Trail which you way it's kind
of like the Oregon Trail of the Santa Fe
I feel like we haven't really scratched
the surface with who is Paul Miller but
that's what Kansas is for cuz Kansas can
be really boring
yep down with the Internet
lean our goat home got nothing to do got
no internet to call me or something
where's Frigg field Missouri at Grace
Chapel this is where my parents went
when I was born I never planned to
reconnect with my childhood or anything
but I did want to know what what I would
look like without the internet because
the last time I knew myself without the
internet was when I was about 12 I hope
I can capture a little bit of that
stupid imagination that kid had you know
before I had the internet I used my
computer to write a allegorical fiction
where me and my siblings rooms were
different kingdoms and then I was also
making stop-motion animation short films
after I got the internet I used aim and
did message boards and then eventually
built at Lindsay Lohan fancy there are
two eras you know and so I'm kind of
getting a look at the old air before I
go back to you know the new Eric
the idea really sprung up just from a
concept I wanted to I never went to
school and so I wanted to like study
like you know great books so I can be
more educated and being a better writer
I was like well I spend all my time
using the internet so if I didn't use
the internet I would have unlimited free
time I told Josh told Josh I was gonna
quit that was that's how I phrase I
didn't say like hey I'm gonna do this
crazy experiment like I was quitting the
birds I think I was really burned out
i-i've been doing tech writing for seven
years at that point in about seven years
I felt like a big treadmill effect
because you know my email just never
ends the work chatroom I'm always busy
there's always something to do there's
always new more and more and more news
to cover you know I was trying to like
transition over a future writing and
like fit up bigger features but I was
kind of bad at it I think a lot of that
exhaustion made it feel like it was
imperative instead of it just being a
cool fun idea
it felt like my only hope at sanity and
kind of get off the treadmill can I get
four of those the light green enjoys
I really do kind of addicted their
addicting I'm addicted
I left the internet because it seemed
like the only choice at the time
did it work
it didn't really know it didn't really
work there's been some awesome things
from this year there's been some
negative things from this year but as
far as like my thesis sitting out it's
like you know well I've got a year you
could do all these awesome stuff I
didn't do you know half of it
I didn't play a lot of video games and
just a cat I didn't quite chunky looks
like I expected myself to and I and I
still feel overwhelmed and it is a
different kind of overwhelmed it's just
more existential and it has less
concrete factors
this is where I spent most of the last
year of my life I typically have my feet
up right here
I suppose I have an Xbox controller on
my lap and and then there's like an
e-cigarette like so where the fold of
clothing I I still haven't finished the
first draft of my novel that I've been
working out for five years and I you
know I don't I haven't written this book
about leaving the internet yet and I
don't know if I don't know how I don't
know if I can I think I hope I can't but
I just you know I've got no evidence yet
that I will be able to write a whole
book
and this might sound like a downer but
I'm kind of a depressive and for me that
means just sometimes it kind of hurts to
be a lot like I just just you know it
sucks that that you got to kind of do
each day and keep doing the next day and
it just moments hurts sequentially and
when I'm embarking on stimulation and I
can always you know feel fill that need
every time you know I feel like I feel
like I'm getting bored and I'm not happy
and so I can go and do something really
quickly to kind of fill that need I
think I can confuse the issue and
confuse the subject and kind of not
quite understand the way I was feeling
was which was deeper than just I'm bored
right now it had something to do this I
like I'm deeply distressed that life
goes on I don't know no I said
and and so some of the for the
loneliness and boredom that came from
leaving the internet was really
instructional because it just let me
know that you know my problems were much
more deep internal than external
oh man justin map boy is a writer at
polygon which is the video game sister
site of the verge I'm just kind of a
total fanboy of just a macro I find him
incredibly incredibly hilarious and he
also just seems how the life kind of
figured out I want to know his secret
are you worried that when you get back
on the internet that you like do you
think you made like a lasting change in
your consumption like W change your
relationship with it or is it are you
worried that it'll be like oh I miss all
of it right now I'm like I might just
have zero defenses if I can alien
invades planet Earth and they're
destroying everything but they don't
have any immune right right so to
respond to our diseases so you're saying
you're telling me that like I know this
Nigerian prince seems super legit
because I sent him seven thousand
dollars that I could be really super
rich so I don't know I'm gonna give it a
shot see now I wanted to ask I just feel
like you've kind of got it you've got it
together okay I've gotta go it out I'm
walking on life advice and married
mmm-hmm I would love to be married you
know I cannot help you you live in a
beautiful neighborhood and I can't
really expect to ever do this well um as
far as your your wife giving you advice
I think I started having more success
when I stopped feeling like there was a
narrative to my life I think once you
let go that idea then first of you stop
seeing yourself as like the most
important thing in your narrative you
know you see yourself as more of a
component I don't have there's no arc to
my story there's no like climax or
anticlimax ordaining wah so you trying
to find where things connected or like
what made sense in my arc
you didn't really make a lot of sense
and once I let go of that because that
was a big thing for me in high school in
college I like once I let go that I
think I I started having
or success or became happier I've always
felt a lot of pressure to have done
something like 27 but like once I'm
through 27 like I'm almost 30 and then
like I'm totally single and still can't
write longer than a thousand words at
this point the only thing that's left
for me is being novels because you can
you can start relatively late it's
terrible but I think of Dylan the beals
like what I'm thinking about muse and
that it's too late to really do
something great and special on music
because I couldn't be dealing the Beatle
I tried to deprogram myself from
thinking about the art and made more
decisions not like in the moment just
but juice but what I really want to be
doing right now what what should I
really be doing right now and do that
thing instead of thinking about the art
I want this next year to be about other
people than then just Paul Miller
there's only so much navel-gazing that
one guy can do and and you know there's
people in the world with real problems
other than that they use reddit too much
so I'm going to go back to real life and
stop
you know fooling around so much I've no
regrets what a good year this is a
really cool thing that I got to do I'm
really lucky to work for a site like
this that wanted to find out what would
happen if I left the Internet I think
now I know about as much as I'll ever
know about offline Paul what what what
about me
because I used the Internet what about
me because I'm Paul Miller and I was
born in Springfield Missouri to Dennis
and Christine Miller and then I grew up
being a cowboy and playing a roller
hockey and now I'm a tech writer
I'm Paul Miller and I just spent the
year without the internet can you tell
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
