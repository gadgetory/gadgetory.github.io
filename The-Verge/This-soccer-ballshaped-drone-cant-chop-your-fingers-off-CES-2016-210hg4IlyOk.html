and we're here in drone city there are
drones everywhere and they all basically
look the same there are little quad
copters but we found a place here that
has a different kind of drone it's
called the fly and there it is there
that turns it off alright so this is on
Kickstarter it's a $6.99 when it ships
in September it'll be $9.99 and the idea
here is that they've surrounded it with
this styrofoam it's the same styrofoam
and like a bike helmet so that it's way
safer than other drones it has a 5
megapixel HD camera on the top and the
way it works is inside it it just has a
single rotor on the top and then on the
bottom there's four little flaps that
they can turn left and right to keep it
stable so it can fly around through the
air fly tells me that it is good for
about 10 minutes of flying time when it
shifts in September and it's pretty neat
it's just a cute little ball and you're
way less likely to lose a finger if
you're flying it around inside and it
weighs pretty pretty light too it's
about the size of a soccer ball right
well hey thanks for watching this little
soccer ball drone is neat if you want to
stay even neater stuff you should
