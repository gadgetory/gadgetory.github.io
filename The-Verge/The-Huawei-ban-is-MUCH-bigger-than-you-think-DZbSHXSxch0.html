in the world is getting
blacklisted by the United States.
On May 16th, Huawei was added
to the Commerce Department's Entity List,
which restricts it from doing business
with any US company without
explicit government approval.
There's a small carve-out
for maintaining phones
that have already shipped,
but basically, it means a de facto ban
on US companies selling to Huawei.
Google has already revoked
the company's Android license,
and Intel and Qualcomm are
considering similar moves.
It's part of a much bigger fight
between the US and China,
and it goes a lot deeper than
what you've probably read.
Your cellphone, your laptop,
your air conditioner, your light bulbs,
all of it was probably made in China.
And if you're in the US,
it came by the same trade
route that's now breaking down.
But to realize why all that's happening,
you have to look at the big picture.
(bright music)
If you wanted to put a
date on the beginning
of the modern electronics industry,
1980 would be a pretty good choice.
It was the year of Apple's IPO,
the year that the
personal computer evolved
from a nice hobby into a
mass-market consumer product.
But, more importantly, it
was the year China created
the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone,
a space where Chinese
companies could trade
in a free market backed up
by the power of communist central planning.
If the government wanted
experts to be cheaper,
it could forcibly lower the exchange rate.
If a bunch of houses were getting
in the way of factory construction,
they could just tear the houses down.
Over the next 40 years,
that system built Shenzhen
into the greatest manufacturing
hub the world's ever seen
at the same time that the tech
industry was coming into its own.
Those 40 years gave us
the personal computer,
the smartphone, and the quadcopter drone,
with each generation of tech
relying a little bit more
on the Trans-Pacific trade.
It's not that we wouldn't have smartphones
without China's factory push,
but they might look completely different
and cost a lot more.
Now, that system's starting to break down,
and it's not just because of Huawei.
We're in the middle of
a really ugly trade war.
In May, Trump announced a
plan to raise import taxes
as high as 25 percent on laptops
and smartphones from China.
Each new tariff from the US is met
with more tariffs from China,
which then triggers more
retaliation from the US.
So far, the most damaging move
from China has been a new
tax on soybean imports,
which has left the prices plummeting
and costs US farmers billions of dollars.
We're seeing executives arrested
and jailed on both sides,
risking an unprecedented
collapse in trade.
At first, Huawei's problems were more
about security than economics.
Given how much Chinese
spying happens in the US,
a lot of people in the
intelligence community are nervous
about a Chinese company
operating American cell towers.
But this latest move goes further,
putting Huawei's entire
cellphone business in jeopardy.
Even the CEO admits it's really hard
to build a phone without US microchips.
The big picture problem is that
building US goods in China
just doesn't seem like that
great of a deal anymore.
In the '80s and '90s,
leaders in both countries
saw outsourcing as a win-win.
American consumers got cheaper goods,
and Chinese workers got
lifted out of poverty
and exposed to democratic
ideas at the same time.
In the US, it was great
for microchip designers
and tech shareholders
but bad for factory jobs,
and it contributed a lot
to the cratering of the middle class.
On the Chinese side,
those same factory jobs have
made the country a lot richer.
More imports are coming in,
so China has unwound a lot
of the currency manipulation
that made exports so cheap to begin with.
As a result, manufacturers
have started looking
to India and Vietnam
for cheap factory labor.
And Chinese tech companies
want to design phones
instead of just assembling them.
And they're less reliant on
the US market than ever.
So what does all that mean for Huawei?
If the commerce order holds up
and the US doesn't grant any licenses,
it means the company
may have to make a phone
without any US components.
That means no Gorilla Glass
and no Micron flash
memory, among other parts.
But all those parts have
foreign competitors,
even if they're more expensive
and not quite as good.
Huawei doesn't want to build
a phone without US parts,
but they probably can if they have to.
You can't say the same
thing for US companies.
If Apple had to build
an iPhone without China
or even just stop selling
iPhones in the Chinese market,
it would be a disaster for the company.
Moving factories takes years,
and it would plunge the
entire industry into chaos.
There's still time to avoid that,
but there's no sign of
either side backing down.
And if we keep going,
the US may have a lot
more to lose than China.
Thanks for watching.

about how this is affecting
gadget makers in the US,
Ashley Carman has a great video
about sort of what all
the tariff stuff means.
