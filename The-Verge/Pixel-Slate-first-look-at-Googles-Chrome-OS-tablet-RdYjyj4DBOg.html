Google's headquarters and the reason
we're here is to get a look at the
all-new pixel slate
that's right Google is finally getting
back into making tablets again but
here's a question why now this is a
pixel slate it is a tablet running
Chrome OS made of course by Google so
let's get into some of the hardware
specs before we get really into what's
going on with this thing so it is about
seven millimeters thick it weighs about
1.6 pounds and just looking at the
dimensions of this thing the nicest part
about it is it's very well balanced like
right in the center there so when you
hold it it doesn't feel as big as these
large 12 inch tablets usually feel there
are two front facing speakers and they
get very loud and they sound very good
and there's a fingerprint sensor on the
power button but the thing you really
care about when you're looking at a
tablet is the screen and this screen
it's beautiful it is three K by 2 K
which is 3000 pixels by 2,000 pixels
I like this aspect ratio I think it
really works and there's a lot of very
advanced things about the way that this
screen works that I'm not going to try
and repeat here we're using a new
technology that we built a custom design
for that uses low temperature
polycrystalline silicon to deliver much
brighter much more rapid technically
you're moving the electrons 100 times
faster which is is to light up the
screen much more efficiently other
things note there are two USB C ports
one on either side which is convenient
if you want to plug in a power cord on
either side or if you want to plug in
you know two things into your tablet
crazytown but you'll notice as I spin it
around I see those two ports we see a
keyboard connector on the bottom you
know we don't see we don't see a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack one of the
trends that we're really seeing is the
advent of many more Bluetooth
accessories particularly for audio with
the phones leading the charge in terms
of that transition and more people own
those types of devices today and as a
result they wanted-- a single product
that they can use on both their devices
I see so you figure everybody already
went out and bought Bluetooth headphones
because they had to offer their phone
and so why not just make them use it
with the tablet also and for
compatibility we're including the
adapter in the box pricing on this thing
starts at $5.99 and that is for a
version of this thing which has a
Celeron processor four gigs of ram and
32 gigs of storage but you can price
this thing all the way up to 1600 bucks
which gets you a eighth-generation core
i7 y series Intel processor 16 gigs of
ram and 250 gigs of storage of course if
you're gonna use this thing as your main
work computer and you probably could
you're gonna want a keyboard so Google
has this thing which has been sitting
down underneath it it is the pixel slate
keyboard you open it up like this and
then the back slides down into this
little mode here and they put magnets on
the back and there's a couple of strong
ones on the top and on the bottom to
lock it into those positions but you can
also have it work at any of the angles
in between which is pretty convenient
but it's not great for a lap of ility so
if you put it on your lap it can be a
little bit wobbly because the keyboard
doesn't lock up to the front of the
tablet it's kind of a little bit wobbly
here the other thing you might notice
about the keyboard is hey it's backlit
backlit keyboards on Chromebooks are
disturbingly rare but this one's got it
and also the keys are round which is an
interesting design decision when we
first saw the round keys we were a
little skeptical but yeah and right now
I like the way they look okay but we
started doing user testing we did
extensive user testing on between round
keys and square keys and found that
after a short learning curve users
accuracy increased so the actual number
of times that your finger can miss type
by pressing multiple keys at the same
time it's smaller because there's fewer
places where there's overlap okay as for
the rest of the hardware things it's got
a couple of far-field microphones on the
top it's got eight megapixel camera on
the back and the front and the one on
the front is wide-angle and apparently
works really well in low light so you
can do your video conferences in the
dark now Google's made some interesting
choices with the software on this so
when you take it off of the keyboard it
automatically jumps into a tablet mode
so your stuff can go fullscreen but you
can still you know
around you can make and go halfsies
screens here in this moat here but when
you put it back into the keyboard and
the magnet connects there it just jumps
right back into the mode where you
really control everything with the mouse
and the touchpad so I haven't had its
own time with the pixel sight obviously
but I am impressed I am not feeling
really limited by this thing at all as a
tablet especially when there's a
keyboard attached I am sure that I can
be just as effective using this as I
would be with a medium to high end pixel
book which is kind of an achievement for
a tablet and again as a tablet it is big
it's a big tablet but there's something
about it that doesn't feel quite as
large as other tablets in this range
it's a little bit lighter it's nowhere
near as light as an iPad of course but
it also runs a full desktop browser
which the iPad doesn't so taking Chrome
OS and making a tablet out of it was a
really obvious thing for Google to do
and so Google did the obvious thing and
I haven't had a chance to really use it
yet but I think they did a pretty good
job of it I really can't wait to review
it now if you've been watching my videos
for any length of time you know that I
just keep talking about the future of
computing and I really don't feel like
anybody's gotten the balance exactly
right so the surface pro feels a little
bit too PC like and the iPad feels a
little bit too tablet like but this
pixel slate it feels like it does a
better job of striking that balance
almost exactly 50/50 and I don't know if
that's exactly what you want but it's
fascinating that they've done such a
good job making this thing feel so much
like a tablet but also be able to do PC
stuff we sink yeah we do need a slave
yeah actually okay so you're making a
tablet doing it you're making a slave
why you making a slave you know over the
years you know we started with
clamshells but as we sort of saw where
users are going you know touch became
more important that's where we add a
touch then we vote convertibles because
people wanted the flexibility of having
something they hold in their hand and be
closer to them
and then obviously slate is the next
logical step there and it really is
about flexibility for the end-user also
just in general it is an important
market so is Google done making Android
tablets it's been a while and now you're
making a robust tablet that happens run
Android apps to be clear but is this is
this the future of what you think big
screen computing from Google should look
like this is where we're investing from
from a full-stop Productivity
perspective we believe having a desktop
full desktop browser is actually much
better for the use cases you have on the
web right eight years now we've been
saying Android apps not so good on
tablets yeah what do you think the state
of that is how quickly like where do you
think it's going yeah when we run
Android apps on this thing but we've
been working very closely with all the
top app vendors and they have been doing
a lot of optimizations right now whether
it's Adobe for example has been
optimizing a lot of their apps I think
they're still again plenty of room for
improvement but we're also doing things
at the platform level to make it easier
for app developer so that they don't
have to even think about some of this
stuff
so that's everything we know so far
about the pixel slave but I want to go
back to that original question which is
why did Google make this thing now well
there's three points the first is that I
think consumers are finally ready to
accept this idea of a hybrid device
we've been watching the iPad become more
like a PC over the year and we've been
watching the surface and you know go and
the surface pro become more consumer
friendly the second point is that Google
had to do a lot of work to make Chrome
OS is better on a tablet and it is way
more usable in tablet mode now than it
was the last time that we looked at it
third and maybe most importantly Google
had to get better at making Hardware
they had to make those pixel phones they
had to make the pixel book and a lot of
the stuff that they've learned is built
into the pixel slate and just it feels
like a really nice kind of premium
device so the answer to that question
why now is really really simple
Google was just ready do I wish that
they had done it sooner yeah sure of
course I do but you know what better
slate than ever
thanks so much for watching that was
