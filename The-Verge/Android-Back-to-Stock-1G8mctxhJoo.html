thing is we're not entirely sold on the
sense interface and the same is true for
Samsung's TouchWiz or any other skin
that a phone manufacturer might lay on
top of Android there's something so
clean and consistent about Google stock
Android experience something you can
really only get out of the box from a
nexus phone but thankfully Android is
highly customizable you can make it look
like Google originally attended with
only a few minutes and a handful of apps
from Google's Play Store no hacking a
routing required to get the HTC One a
little more in line with my tastes I
focus on three areas the launcher the
lock screen and the keyboard within the
launcher the home screen and app drawer
is where you'll spend most of your time
I chose Nova because it looks almost
exactly like Google's default launcher
Nova also includes a number of
interesting improvements like support
for custom icons and lots of screen
transitions simply download it and set
it as your default launcher it prompts
you to do so the first time you press
the home button and you're set to go as
for the lock screen we've seen a lot of
variety of form and function here
personally I prefer the simplicity of
holo Locker the HTC one's lock screen is
kind of busy for my tastes what holo
Locker does yet again is make your
lockscreen look very similar to stock
Android 4.1 jelly bean now the keyboard
there are a lot of insane third-party
options out there but my favorite is
Swift key word prediction is great and
you can easily change the keyboards
appearance with a few taps this app is
the only paid app on our list but a
quality keyboard could be one of the
best app purchases you ever make and
honestly it's what you'll be using the
most these tweaks only take a minute or
two to install and they bring back some
of the best and most beautiful features
of Android that many manufacturers cut
out it's a better cleaner experience on
almost any phone
