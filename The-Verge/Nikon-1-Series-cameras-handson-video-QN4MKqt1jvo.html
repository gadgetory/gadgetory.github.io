we're at nikons booth at CES and we're
taking a look at a couple of their new
1-series cameras this is the j-3 it's
the new top-end j camera and it takes
the guts of the v2 so the fourteen point
2 megapixel sensor and the xp3 a
processor and puts it in a lower-priced
body this is going for 599 with the kit
lens it's 50 bucks more than the den DJ
to which is the previous top end of the
jail I'm yeah 14.2 megapixels it shoots
15 frames per second with continuous
autofocus which nikon says is the
fastest frame rate with continuous
autofocus on the market right now
because it has the same xp3 a processor
as the v2 it's also able to do slow view
which was a feature that previously
wasn't available on the j cameras so
basically what we can do is press the
shutter halfway and it's going to take a
like a 30 second loop and yeah it's just
going to keep playing back well this is
playing back I can choose my favorite
frame so I like this one right here I
press the shutter and then it's taken so
yeah 599 with the kit lens we also have
the s-1 this is a new line for for Nikon
so this is the third the third line in
the in the 1-series lined up uses the
same mount same lenses and it's very
similar to the j-3 it's also capable of
15 frames per second it can also do slow
view but it shoots at 10 megapixels or
10.1 mega pixels rather than 14.2 and
yeah it's missing the the manual mode
selector dial on the top so you need to
rely on the menus a little bit more so
yeah two new 1-series cameras from Nikon
they're both coming out next month
februari 7 4 99 and 599</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
