we're taking another look at the Samsung
family hub which if you haven't guessed
is a refrigerator with a giant
touchscreen we saw this announced at CES
this year in Las Vegas and now we
actually get to use the thing it's not
just a demo mode let me tell you about
it it's running on Tizen it's got this
big 1080p touchscreen and it does a
bunch of stuff that you would expect a
family gadget to do so we open this
thing up and it's like your family
calendar and you can put photos on it
whatever hit this crazy home button on
this insane Android like button row but
it's actually running Tizen go back home
the coolest thing is MasterCard has made
an app that can shop from Fresh Direct
or shop right or a few other grocery
stores so you can order groceries
directly from the fridge so you can add
stuff to the cart there's also a
smartphone app that goes along with it
so you can look at your cart from your
smartphone and you can just go shopping
we'll go back home again it's got
Pandora so there's speakers somewhere
inside this thing there's another button
here view inside if I hit that I'm
looking at a picture of the stuff inside
the fridge what they do is they have
cameras that are hidden
right here in the door and every time
you close the fridge the cameras take a
picture so you can from your smartphone
or from the insane touch screen on the
door look at what happened in your
fridge so we'll close that give it a
tick and this image will refresh with
the stuff I just moved around inside the
fridge but we're not going to wait for
it so in terms of like raw power you
don't buy a giant touchscreen fridge
because it's got awesome specs but maybe
you buy it because you want to draw on
and other things I can show you on this
fridge it does have voice control so you
can turn that on and off but that's not
working on this unit right now you can
also slide over to get a bunch of other
stuff you can't add your own apps to it
but it's got these apps built in you can
mirror your television so whatever's
playing on your samsung TV will play on
this thing you just go to the Internet
it gives us the phone layout on a giant
screen you can of course do fridge
things so we open up the fridge manager
app you can change the temperature
settings for each section you can turn
off the door alarm you can turn on the
icemaker and you can look at recipes
there you go it's the samsung family Hub
smart fridge if you like ridiculous
things I don't see how you don't love
this thing if you want to see more
videos of ridiculous things you should
check out circuit breaker at the verge
and of course the verge on YouTube you
should subscribe to us or at youtube.com
