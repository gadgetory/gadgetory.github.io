hand chosen by yours truly
we've got Andrew Seibel Skye is that
right yeah you from Staten Island boy
and it says here you're addicted to
gumballs is that right I got some right
now
interesting next up is a pan Alexander
from Brooklyn it says you're physically
incapable of driving 55 is that true
really I thought you Sammy Hagar
reference no that's very fine
and finally Ryan Vinick Holmby is that
right Vinick ohm Vinick I'm gonna call
it you Vinick Holmby is that all right
good
from from pomfrit Connecticut and we
kissed that we did that is forever
Andrew I believe during a serious game
of D&amp;amp;D backstage you took control of the
board to start with yeah choose your
category and your dollar amount and
we'll get going well I'll see bubblegum
on there so I guess I'll just go for
food for 534 500 and the answer is it
would just rot away
is your airhorn broke good thanks
I saw smoke come out of it alright Ryan
what is your answer for it would just
rot alright and remember it has to be
posed as a question what is pumpkins in
November that's close that is really
close but the actual question was what
would happen if you planted an entire
strawberry and you've got control of the
board you've got control of the board
where do you want to take us next pop
culture for 500 pop culture for 500 and
the answer is shift key yes Andrew how
do you yell very loudly that is
interesting how do you make one word on
MySpace all caps was the correct
question Ryan a you have control of the
board now all right uh I'll take potent
potable z' for 500 great choice potent
potable z' for 500 and the answer is go
for it you'll never know unless you try
a life with no regrets is a life unlived
yes yes yes Ryan Yolo that's that's very
close that's but I'm afraid the the
correct question was could I get drunk
if I bought a pack of alcohol swabs in
Stockton Andrew back to you for control
where do you want to go let me go the
human body for 200 the human body for
200 and the answer is it's all
completely random Andrew what is sex
like
well I mean it's a little related but
I'm afraid that's wrong the question was
what causes the difference between an
innie or outie belly moving on Hannah
you've got the board the human mic 500
oh really the human body for 500 and the
answer is no have you ever cried snot
that's the answer and you need to tell
me what the question is you know like a
normal game of Jeopardy really no one's
gonna buzz in Riyad what is having swine
flu like mmm I'm afraid the question was
actually if you drink milk through your
nose will it come out of your eye and
how yes you were so close oh it looks
like we're out of time we've got to go
right into Final Jeopardy so here is the
final Jeopardy answer the song
little-known fact
is about Dumbledore from Harry Potter if
you look at the lyrics further there are
more context clues that the song is
about the headmaster of Hogwarts
hands down pens down I'm afraid time is
up I'm gonna have to see your answers
now starting with Andrew can we see what
you put down what is Nine Inch Nails is
song closer about well that is actually
shockingly close but I'm afraid you're
incorrect yeah
what is dum dee dum dum dum that is also
incorrect
Ryan what is call me maybe about help
Wow Wow very close but wrong ultimately
I'm afraid that the question was why
does cash just say I like your beard and
your love is my drug and that's all
right that's that's yep ready for that I
give these guys a round of applause
I know I know that none of them got a
single thing right but they're not
leaving empty-handed they're all gonna
go home with these professional signed
yepper t-shirts which certainly were not
ironed on a few hours ago and will be
fine in the wash so you guys all get one
of these and thank you so much for
playing let's have another round of
applause for our guests</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
