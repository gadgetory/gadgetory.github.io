in a line of Android phones that have
steadily gotten better year-over-year
now before we get into this we see you
guys have been commenting you know
you've been asking for it for a long
time so we're shooting this in 4k so if
you want the best video quality maybe
bump your resolution up to 4k cool okay
so if you're familiar with oneplus then
most of what comes with one plus six is
probably a known quantity but if you're
not here's what that quantity is a
oneplus phone has high-end specs a big
screen a clean Android software
experience and it comes with a price
that's considerably less than other
high-end Android phones with similar
specs and features now nothing about
that changes with the oneplus X but it
also means on the other side of the coin
that nothing changes about the other
things that are known quantities with a
oneplus either it still isn't gonna work
with Verizon or Sprint it still doesn't
have the best camera you can get and
it's still not completely water
resistant overall the one plus six is a
lot like the last few oneplus phones it
offers a great experience for a price
that's hundreds of dollars less than a
similar size Samsung or pixel here's the
headline info you're looking for for
starting price of five hundred twenty
nine dollars you get a six point three
inch edge to edge screen a snapdragon
845 processor a glass and metal design
extremely fast fast charging six
gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigs of storage
Android 8.1 with some thoughtful not
annoying additions
anin dual camera system that's capable
of all the latest portrait effects and
slow-motion video trends you can also
spend more to upgrade the RAM and
storage but you'll still be spending
substantially less than you would on say
a pixel to excel and the most noticeable
change from older oneplus phones is to
switch to a design with glass on the
front and the back which makes the
oneplus 6 look like basically every
other phone to come out this year now I
think it looks great
until I touch it and then it becomes a
fingerprint magnet especially on the
glossy version there's a matte finish
model that means much nicer looking and
helps hide those fingerprints but at the
same time it's much more slippery to
hold than the already pretty slippery
glossy phone which might lead to a
shattered glass phone sooner rather than
later then the other big change is the
screen is even larger than the six inch
display on
plus his last phone now that's mostly
because the screen now reaches the very
top of the phones frame except for a
cutout in the middle that houses the
earpiece front camera proximity sensor
and notification light so yeah it has a
notch but frankly I don't really care
and I don't have a problem with it the
notch means that I have more vertical
space to read something on my phone
whether that's email or messages or
tweets or use split-screen multitasking
or whatever else I want to do with the
phone and oneplus is able to make this
bigger screen fit in here without making
the phone any bigger than it was last
year which means that I get more screen
in the same size phone that's a
trade-off I'm willing to make any day
the week now there are a couple of
things to be aware with the 1 + 6 is not
I have yet to encounter an app that
didn't work as I expect it because of it
being there but it doesn't mean that the
battery percentage is hidden until you
swipe down to see your notifications it
also means that if you have a lot of
icons for Wi-Fi Bluetooth do not disturb
NFC or whatever you can get pretty
crowded pretty quickly up there but
oneplus does let you toggle a lot of
these off if you don't want them to
display and if you really hate that full
bleed look you can have to black out the
background in the notch so all of your
apps just fill out just below it
honestly I think this mode looks worse
and I've never really felt the need to
obscure the notches existence now other
than its larger size this year's panel
isn't much different than before it's
1080p pixels wide it's OLED it's got
deep colors and vibrant blacks it
doesn't get as bright and it doesn't
have as many pixels as a Samsung screen
but it's still easy to read outdoors and
I haven't seen any major color shifting
problems or issues now handling the 1 +
6 is a lot like holding other similar
size mostly glass phones and most of the
time it feels like it's too big
especially if I'm trying to do something
with one hand now most of the premium
phones give you a choice of sizes
whether that's the s9 or the iPhone A or
the pixel - you can choose between a
small or a large version which lets you
decide between having a big screen or
having a phone that fits more
comfortably in your hand but with the 1
plus 6 it's only available one size and
that size is big now performance wise 1
plus 6 is really fast which isn't a huge
surprise considering it's got a
top-of-the-line processor and lots of
RAM but oneplus has done a number of
things under the hood to make it feel
even faster than other phones whether
that's optimizing background processes
or just kind of speeding up animations
so everything happens a millisecond or
two faster the result is that the phone
feels like it's really fast and it just
powers through everything without really
feeling like it's ever running out of
steam for stamina the big 3300 milliamp
hour battery in the oneplus 6 means it's
able to keep going for a full day of use
for me without much of an issue now it
doesn't have wireless charging even
though it has that glass back now but
oneplus is - charger is basically the
fastest wired charging option you can
get so topping up the battery is never
really a chore or a hassle so let's talk
about this camera because traditionally
that's where oneplus phones can't quite
match up to the bigger players now on
paper the oneplus 6 has an upgraded
camera it's got bigger pixels and it has
optical image stabilization there's a 16
megapixel main sensor that handles most
of the heavy lifting and then there's a
20 megapixel secondary sensor that adds
more detail and enables portrait style
effects now if you compare the oneplus 6
versus the 1 + 5 or 5t from last year
it's definitely an improvement there's
more detail and less noise and images
are brighter especially in low light the
portrait mode is just as gimmicky as
before and even though it's nice to have
slow motion in the video recording now I
don't really see myself ever using it
but if you stack the oneplus 6 camera
against a newer phone like the Samsung
s9 or the pixel to excel or even the
Huawei P 20 Pro unfortunately it doesn't
hold up and none of this is to say that
camera is bad it's actually pretty good
especially for the price you pay but
it's definitely the thing where you see
the biggest difference between the 1 + 6
and more expensive phones
now for software the one plus six is
running oxygen OS which is one plus is
take on Android and it's running 8.1
Oreo in this case mostly it looks really
similar to what you find on a Google
pixel phone it's clean and it's easy to
use without a bunch of gimmicky things
getting in the way but there's a couple
of neat things that I want to point out
first is a gesture control system that
you can use in place of the standard
Android on-screen buttons I really like
this idea because it lets my content
make full use of the display and stretch
all the way to the bottom
but unfortunately the gestures are not
as smooth or as fluid as on an iPhone 10
and they could use a good amount of work
I really hope oneplus keeps working on
this the second is a reading mode which
shifts the display to a monochrome
appearance and it mimics an e-reader or
Kindle it makes reading long articles or
ebooks much nicer and you can even have
it turn on and off automatically
depending on what app you're using there
are some other hardware features worth
mentioning to the oneplus 6 has
something that you won't find on any
other Android phone it has a physical
switch to move between ring library and
fully silent modes it's something I wish
more phone makers would adopt and
there's two easy ways to unlock the
oneplus 6 use your finger or your face
the face unlock is not as secure but
it's super convenient and fast and for
some reason oneplus remove the swipe
gestures on the fingerprint scanner that
reveal the notification shade which
seems like a minor thing but honestly
it's annoyed me the entire time I've
used the phone one plus six also still
has a headphone jack which is great if
you don't want to deal with wireless
headphones or Bluetooth in your car and
four speakers it has a loud and clear
single speaker at the bottom but it
doesn't have the even better dual
speaker setups that many other phones
offer at this point and when oneplus
claims that the six is splash resistant
it doesn't have any proper water
resistant ratings so it can't be fully
submerged or truly get wet it's okay if
you're out in the rain but don't go
dropping it in a pool
so that's the one plus six it's
everything we've come to expect from a
oneplus phone but it doesn't really
change the conversation now it's still a
great value and it still has most all
the features you'd want on a high-end
20:18 Android phone and doesn't have any
annoying things like AI everywhere or
dedicated buttons for a virtual
assistant you don't want to use or weird
squeezing interfaces that just are kind
of gimmicky and get in the way but at
the same time if you're on Verizon or
Sprint or you want maybe you want the
best camera you can get or maybe you
want a phone that you don't have to
worry about if you drop it in the sink
or maybe you just want something that
isn't enormous then the oneplus six
probably isn't for you but for everyone
else one plus six is pretty great hey
