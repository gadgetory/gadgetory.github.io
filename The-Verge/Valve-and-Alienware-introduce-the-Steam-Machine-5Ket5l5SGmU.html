councils are here but they won't be
alone this is a steam machine a new
category of game system designed for the
living room three years ago
valve the company behind the half-life
and portal games devised an ambitious
plan to cram the essence of PC gaming
into a box that could fit under your TV
with steamos valve built the platform
but had left hardware design up to
others their alien wares leading the
charge for over a year the Dell
subsidiary has been working to build the
computer valve originally dreamt PC OEMs
really for a long time haven't been
producing machines that were suitable
for the living room suitable to sit
underneath the television and really
good for entertainment and gaming and
when we began working on steamos and
bringing the steam experience to the
living room it seemed like there were
three components to that work to us they
were all pretty tall orders solving
input solving an operating system and
really providing hardware to be the
vehicle for the for the whole experience
technically a steam machine is just a PC
running valve steam OS operating system
which is itself a standalone version of
its steam app currently available for
Windows and Mac this year multiple
hardware partners will introduce
dedicated steam machines I'm here on
behalf of Alienware to introduce to to
the world our first steam machine as you
can see it's a very small device we have
been working with valve for over a year
on the steam machine product and we
think that it really encapsulates
everything that a steam machine should
be and just eight inches on the side and
three inches tall alien wears steam
machine is roughly the size of a
Nintendo Wii and its price will be
competitive with the latest game
consoles - we think the price
performance balance that they have
struck is really the sweet spot for what
steam gamers want in the living room and
under the TV but though Alienware has
built a box the size and price of a game
console and is able to produce it
on a global scale it's not ready to take
on the game councils quite yet
we don't really see this product as
competing against a PlayStation 4
competing against an Xbox one first and
foremost what we're trying to do is
we're focusing on the existing 65
million Steam customers who are out
there these are existing PC gamers these
are customers who have been telling
valve for a very long time that they
want access to steam in other rooms in
their home mainly the living room but
the hard part of translating PC games to
the living room isn't building a small
enough box it's figuring out how to
replace a mouse and keyboard Valve's
answer is the steam controller a
wireless gamepad that places twin-track
beds under your thumbs instead of a pair
of joysticks it's downright confusing at
first but even for challenging
first-person games the gamepad seems up
to the task the track pads are
surprisingly accurate for pointing and
aiming and you can quickly swipe across
the pad with your thumb to build up
inertia if you need to spin on your heel
how valve hopes to make up with the
keyboard is just as clever every user
can share and vote up controller
profiles for each and every steam game
divvying up the game functions two
buttons on the gamepad instead if 15
buttons aren't enough the steam
controller is customizable touchscreen
can be used for extras we think it's a
critical component because without the
steam controller we wouldn't be able to
say to customers of steam machines like
alien wares that they can play the
entire steam catalog from the sofa
without lugging in a mouse and keyboard
into that room if they don't they don't
want to the experience that you get
without steam OS the experience that you
get with a windows-based PC and running
that type of system is subpar and in
fact most most customers out there
they're looking for an experience that's
more of a console less experience and
really the control is a big pivoting
point in that that's what Valve's own
steam OS is designed to deliver when you
turn on a steam machine it boots into an
interface you can comfortably control
from the couch with only a wireless game
and you don't need to pop discs into the
drive because you'll download everything
from the cloud but steam OS is a bit of
a double-edged sword steam machines can
only play games built for Linux not the
Windows games the PC gamers are used to
valve has been quietly amassing hundreds
of Linux games over the past year
brokering deals to produce more and
porting games itself by the time steam
machines launch at retail the company
says it will have 400 games that run
natively on the platform including a
number of exciting new big-budget titles
but there's a reason that the steam
machine isn't ready to take on Microsoft
Sony and Nintendo it's not clear whether
it can convince enough game developers
to adopt Linux to make steam OS a viable
platform over the long haul we think
it's the start of something and we think
PC gaming is as valuable as it is to so
many gamers because it's the place where
innovation happens in software and
hardware faster than it does anywhere
else
valve wants to make steam the Nexus of
an innovation now we wait and see
whether others agree whether there will
be enough room for Alienware on the same
shelf as Nintendo Microsoft and Sony
