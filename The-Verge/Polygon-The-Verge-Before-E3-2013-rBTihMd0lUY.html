and the verge live pre three pre pre III
pre / III breathe / III before e3 show
up but i have just mad boy i'm the
managing editor of polygons calm i'm
brian bishop I'm reporter with the
version we are here in lovely smoggy
traffic laid in Los Angeles weather's
been beautiful though it has been really
nice really nice like 65 we just keep
that going keep that streak alive of not
overwhelming heat and Sun that would be
fantastic because I'm gonna wait in
lines to go into this one please I have
people who will wait in line
subordinates that I care about I don't
want them to get overburden from the Sun
have a fainting spell that will be sad
will you bring the mortar right and I
people to bring up I mainly stay here in
my bubble in my my hover dam here in a
beautiful Los Angeles but we are here at
e3 at least adjacent to where that's
gonna be go at work that's gonna be
going on what are you what are you
looking forward to Brian uh you know I'm
really curious to see obviously big
names like you know playstation 4
hardware things we've been waiting to
see that we know it ever happen in terms
of actual specifics I'm really curious
to see what Sony is going to do about
its living room play you know Microsoft
has made a lot of noise about the xbox
one I was gonna be this big living room
device even you know laying the
groundwork for that with the 360 for
years now and it's a space that Sony
kind of had a lot of strengthened in
years past you know people bought the
PlayStation 2 because of the DVD player
but the playstation 3 because the
blu-ray player and thus far it seems
that sony's just saying we're games
games games games and seating that
ground completely which could be a
problem for them what about you it's
interesting they they've built their
strategy so much on that you know being
that living room box and never really i
think getting to the critical mass that
would need but definitely helped a lot
by the DVD in the blu-ray player be
interesting to see how they responded
not having that sort of
crutch for lack of a better word booga
rhythm and I guess asset yeah it seemed
like uniquely suited you know given the
whole Sony media empire right they seems
like they would be positioned to do
something great but nothing yet we'll
see uh we've got a lot that's that's
just PlayStation this one thing
happening tomorrow also tomorrow we've
got uh the xbox one sort of I guess
positioning keynote I for lack of a
better term we don't know exactly what's
going to be going on there obviously
we'll see a lot of xbox one games you
know one of the things I'm actually
interested to see come out of that is
how the xbox 360 is going to be
positioned going into the the next
generation what where will it fit in in
the ecosystem I think the PlayStation 2
is shown that you can have a successful
console that really has a definite niche
for itself into the next generation I'm
plus there's so many games that are
being announced for the next gen
consoles that are also coming out on the
360 in like that sits it's interesting
and without backwards compatibility on
the one there's always gonna be a huge
neat girl that still want to play those
old games mm-hmm I personally my
personal most anticipated thing is I
really want to see more about quantum
break that is the new that's the new
game from remedy who was the original
developer of max payne and they made
Alan Wake and this this new thing
quantum break we don't know that much
about I saw FMV which is my one of my
favorites so if they're going to blend
FMV with video is it going to be an xbox
Studios co project we don't really know
some I'm looking forward to seeing
exactly what comes out of that what we
saw at the keynote look great a big ship
running into a bridge mm-hmm a lot of
infrastructure damage a lot a lot of
time you recover from that but uh it
looks fantastic so I'm excited to see
what those cats are up to yeah it's an
interesting space combining you know
narrative storytelling with gaming you
know we saw defiance which has been
somewhat not so successful no one's done
it right yet there's great opportunity
there but it's also cool about III as
they know other than the big consoles
there's also this lingering refusing to
die narrative of Android consoles mad
catz introduced project mojo earlier in
the week right you know so that's still
there as well and so not fun question
how that's going to work and there's
also the Ouya which polygon
editor-in-chief Chris Grant got
put his hands on at a GDC and he shot a
lovely video which we'd like to show for
you at home right now and then after
this please bring Chris gran out cuz we
have that kind of power we can get any
better we want looks like that like that
pulling the strings puppet masters
that's us last July Leah launched a
Kickstarter that broke Kickstarter
records it was a game console there been
a mobile hardware using the Android
operating system they're shipping the
device to early Kickstarter backers
later this month and they brought the
harbor with them to GDC we're heading
there now to get our first hands-on on
the device we've taken to market in a
very different way we started with we
have this idea we put it out to the
market nine months ago and said do you
want this and we heard a lot of positive
responses and therefore we started
building ooh you and throughout the
process we've worked with our early
supporters to refine our hardware to
perfect our controller and we're going
to do the same on software or hardware
is fake but the software like any
software business will continue to
evolve over time and get better as we
add additional features and
functionality that our supporters want
the device itself the actual box looks
and feels really nice it's very small
has a lot of ports on the back of it the
control the other hand was a little less
impressive the buttons felt spongy the
d-pad didn't feel very sharp the latency
on the controller felt high and while
the hardware won't change what will be
changing is the software we built you to
be a great game console to bring
innovative creative exclusive contents
of the television to bring new types of
developers to the television for the
first time by being open anybody can
develop for oh yeah we hope they'll want
to build games to be part of the Ouya
experience and optimize for the
television in the controller and provide
a great experience for gamers and if
it's a great app our discovery process
will have it bubble to the top and
everybody will find it so it won't be
about a one to one
relationship he'll be able to speak to
all of our gamers what we saw today was
still an early version of the interface
it has four main sections play discover
make and manage manages your system
settings play is where all of your games
are but discover and make are the more
interesting ones discover is the
storefront and oh yeah is a lot of ideas
on how to help discoverability the big
focus is on engagement and on fun not on
metrics like most most popular highest
grossing in revenue it's under that make
channel where you'll be able to sideload
apps also a part of their open promise
is that they're not going to really be
policing apps the same way as long as
apps follow the community user
guidelines that's enough for them for
example under the play section they had
an emulator that featured a little
Nintendo controller when we asked if
they were going to allow emulators on
the service they said as long as they
support the content guidelines meaning
they can release an emulator but they
can't release the roms for the emulator
so right now well yeah sticking to its
guns they're saying that they're going
to allow emulators on the service which
could be popular for a lot of people
it's not popular with major content
owners like Nintendo we have over 8,000
developers that have downloaded the odk
and as you mentioned a lot of the
content that's on the box today is
really TV exclusive new Y exclusives
most of our developers are experienced
game developers that have never built an
Android game before we're not seeing a
lot of ports as it relates to games that
exist on other platforms they're taking
the time to optimize it for the
television or control and it really
depends on what you know game their
starting with so how does the first
video game console backed on Kickstarter
field
it feels just like it felt when they
first announced it feels like it has a
lot of potential energy it's exciting
it's new it's interesting its innovative
in a lot of ways but when you're
actually play it in your hand it feels
rough it feels like they have a lot of
work to do to make this something that
people are really gonna feel like they
meet they still need big major
exclusives they still need a system that
feels as sharp and responsive as the
competition and for the iterative
platform that's built to evolve there's
no saying that they won't get there but
when we saw today still feels like an
early alpha product so maybe by the end
of the year once they've had a lot of
software updates once they have more
games once they've worked on some of the
issues like controller latency they
might have a hit product but for right
now still needs work ooh yah presented
by chris grant that i got mine about a
week ago and it i played a game on it
cool uh mine came in literally the day I
got here you see how long windows hi I'm
Chris yeah I am how you do it you do it
oh I'll do it your friend hi I'm Chris
Grant editor-in-chief of polygons accom
perfect now that did it um so yeah I
haven't gotten mining in there where I
haven't played it came in while I was
out here but I have a chance to play it
at GDC and it is rough you know it still
needs a lot of work I think what excited
people about the idea of that kind of
open android-powered console was um was
a platform that a lot of developers the
same way we've seen on iOS could make
games without having publishing
contracts without having you know the
sort of financial oversight of a
publisher and what you end up getting
with that just like we see on iOS a lot
of bad games but you also get a lot of
really innovative creative games that
would have never made it through the
traditional publishing process and what
a lot of people don't like about android
games and iOS games is that you're
playing them on your phone with the
touchscreen and so what do ya gets you
or gamestick or fill in the blank with
you know Apple TV of Apple ever gets
around to turning that into something it
gets you a controller it gets you like
something in your hand it's much more
traditional gaming environment paired
with the sort of creativity of these
indie developers that are out there
doing
these games you know we actually have it
at our party tonight we have a bunch of
multiplayer indie games and a lot of
them are going to be available on Ouya
like you're going to see some of them
start to go towards that and platform
Sony's all to work but what's exciting
to me is just that promise like the idea
that we could accomplish that and um get
there and I think we saw a lot of that
start on the current generation of
consoles with Xbox Live Indie games and
X plus i have arcade and playstation
network but as those arenas have gotten
more competitive you know was it five
years ago now we got shadow complex
right like unreal engine 3 powered game
that took 15 hours was a huge
Metroidvania like the production bogging
those has gone so far up the space
there's so much more valuable and you
know Xbox Live Indie games was it this
other place that they've sort of phased
out they got rid of XNA so what I'm
really curious about hearing this year's
e3 is that it's like what happens to
those developers that aren't big enough
to get a publishing contract that don't
want to make that kind of game who you
know the sort of hobbyist developer is
there a place for them at all on these
platforms what do you think needs to
happen for the yarn that their consoles
like it too I mean we're here at e3 and
it's obviously very focused on Triple A
and consoles and PCs to a certain extent
what what needs to happen for these
systems to really become part of the
conversation are they gonna have to
muscle their way to the table or
everything I need widespread acceptance
work I think some of it is going to be
really simple for the value that they
need to get their their product in order
like it's something suppose you I like
they need to make that a really polished
consumer experience you're gonna be
against Microsoft and Sony you got work
to do then you hit get some hits like
hit sell consoles everyone knows that
the ninety nine dollar price point might
also need to come down I mean the xbox
360 could conceivably drop the ninety
nine dollars the playstation 2 did so if
you can xbox 360 which has a netflix on
it which the Ouya doesn't has who live
on it has YouTube on it and plays all
these other great games and plays
downloadable games why would you get new
yeah
you know like do you think those like
you know who yet gamestick they have
their own stores you can sideload stuff
you can get to benefit or negative for
them trying to go and get for a certain
niche audience right side load and
emulator and play bunch of roms like
sure for a big enough audience to make
that a really meaningful product I don't
think it's too small you know I think
that there's a big what's exciting about
what the opportunity that Microsoft and
Sony have with these new consoles is
they have an opportunity to take the
living room and do TV and entertainment
and do triple-a but also to do this
small stuff into doing like a kind of
really compelling way and sony has some
of that available with PlayStation
mobile which has a strategy which is
really clever in execution has been
something more of a disaster it's just
not very well supported I'm pretty sure
there's no PlayStation mobile phones out
they showed a bunch here last year that
didn't come out so I don't know the
PlayStation about what those games work
on your playstation 4 they wouldnt say
if they work on your Playstation 3 and
yet but so you know there are some kind
of movements by both those companies in
that space for Microsoft you know maybe
there's a difference between an xbox
game and then the sort of windows side
of that ecosystem these sort of two
parallel operating systems there's a
screenshot on the dashboard that showed
words with friends being played snapped
into the side of the screen so maybe
there's an opportunity for app like
games that are cheaper and smaller that
you can self-publish through some kind
of store and Microsoft takes their
thirty percent and but maybe they're
limited and how you can play them and
you know what you can do with them I
feel like it's it's the it's one of the
areas that gaming has been going to for
a long time and we've been looking for
somebody on the television to really
take ownership of it and Microsoft sort
of you know made a half-hearted attempt
with indie games on xbox 360 and I'd
really like to see them or Sony take
that next step and create a real open
platform for developers to get on I
think we're going to be talking about
this a lot of the next few days but I
want to get your take on it now so if
you're right you can seem really smart
really super super visionary what is
wrong with compass yeah just edit this
out get this in post um what is the name
next generation of gaming about and and
sub question do you think we will know
that by the end of the year I mean did
by the end of the week do you think that
what this generation is why it is
necessary and needed and vital will be
clear by the end of the week or is it
clear to you now my guess we haven't you
know it's kind of the kind about
opposite rollouts Microsoft and really
entertainment heavy they're going to
move over two games here sony much like
game heavy I have a real feeling they're
gonna move over to entertainment here
sony sells a lot of TVs like this is a
big part of their strategy as well in
some ways it makes more sense in sony
strategy than microsoft's they both want
a Trojan horse in your living room they
both have done a great job of getting
big wooden horses in there but not
filling on the soldiers and like they
need to like open up those floodgates
and I think that means not just being a
gaming box it means doing everything the
software is getting there Microsoft's a
software company to do it and we clearly
see Microsoft sort of play that hand I
think the next step is creating boxes
that are and I think a lot of the
generation means and this is not going
to sit well with a lot of gamers as it
means making platforms that are really
Universal the same way your iphone is
that's not a platform for core gamers or
for techies it's just a platform for
everybody I think that's really what
Sony and Microsoft will want my
girlfriend uses the xbox far more we
actually don't even have TV anymore it's
just xbox Netflix Hulu YouTube crackle
crap old we watch a lot of twitch
together we don't sorry but they I mean
that's what they want they want that
broad consumer and you know both
playstation 4 xbox one or two be instant
on right they don't really sit down so
you just turn it on they both have
suspend systems you need to suspend your
game and move right over so right now if
we're going to watch netflix and i'm
playing a game it's like I gotta find a
safe spot give me about six now I need
like 10 minutes i'm going to boot up
netflix it takes about five minutes if
you can just literally pause something
swipe right over to a different
application you know making that TV a
much more important and flexible part of
people's homes is i think absolutely
this
oh gee and gaming is just another part
it's one of the soldiers inside that
Trojan horse Chris real quick we hate to
see you go before you go number one game
you're most excited to see this week
what is it okay you are nice at it which
one quantum break guys remedy I love
remedy to get really good I'm like
unhooked I'm already sold yeah I'm in
pre order already you Bri or yeah well I
wasn't sure how much new xbox one games
cos i just gave 100 bucks in cash and
said bullet for me God I have this
enough just but if you need more money
please call me so nice of them to take
it yeah they just suck it very good
remember if I got a receipt Chris thank
you for joining us up next we have seen
reviews editor for The Verge David
Pierce pretty much all waiting to see
what Microsoft and Sony would do this
year Sony didn't actually have that much
to say when they announced the
PlayStation 4 in March but this week at
an event at its headquarters here in
redmond washington Microsoft had a much
bigger story to tell they announced new
product called the xbox one coming later
this year and there's kind of a lot
going on with in gadget terms eight
years is basically an eternity but since
it's launched in 2005 Microsoft has done
an impressive job keeping the xbox 360
up to date with new games new apps a
completely overhauled user interface and
more the 360 was originally a pure
gaming machine but it became something
more it's microsoft's Trojan horse into
your living room the company's attempt
to create the one set-top box to rule
them all but eight years is still a long
time and Microsoft needed more than just
new software to compete in 2013 not to
mention in 2021 from a hardware
perspective there are three parts to the
one there's the big blocky black console
which looks like a VCR but comes with
massively upgraded specs the one is an
eight core AMD processor eight gigabytes
of RAM that's 16 times as much as the
360 if you're counting plus a 500 gig
hard drive and USB 3.0 it also has a
blu-ray drive finally then there's the
new Kinect a smaller also blocky
rectangle that sits above or below your
TV and watches your every move although
now it tracks much more than your every
move it can track your eyes your facial
expression your muscles your fingers and
toes and even your heart rate it can
also do it in the dark and do it in high
definition it collects a lot more data
than the last version and does it much
faster and much more
currently we were pretty blown away by
it in the short time we have at the new
device Microsoft didn't leave the
controller out of the upgrade cycle
either it has 40 improvements we're told
and a few are obvious it's smaller with
a better integrated battery and its
analog sticks or a little more textured
but the most obvious thing is the new
impulse triggers which is just a fancy
name for making the controls triggers
vibrate when you fire a gun in a game
you'll feel the recoil when you read the
engine you'll jitter along with the car
it's cool from what we've seen but it's
a little much sometimes and it's not
exactly earth-shattering anyway all that
new hardware is used to power and
control a lot of new Xbox software
there's a new UI based on Windows 8 plus
an involved Xbox Live that gives you
more ways to find games and ways to
upload videos of you playing there's a
new snap mode which lets you pin skype
or other apps to the edge of the screen
while you play a game and watch TV oh
and there's skype for xbox now too but
here's the thing about the xbox one it's
really only partly a gaming machine the
one can connect to all your home theater
devices and even control your cable
through its interface you can say watch
ESPN to switch right to the channel or
ask what's on HBO to see the guide for
the channel you're looking for we
haven't seen much of the interface or
spent much time with it and frankly
we're worried about the whole HDMI
pass-through set up that really doomed
Google TV but hey anything's better than
your cable box last and weirdly kind of
least for now for the games Microsoft
showed us a half dozen or so new games
from FIFA and Madden to quantum break
and call of duty ghosts the graphics
look great but they still look like
video games quantum break a mix of game
and TV show might be the only really
innovative one of the bunch there are
many more games coming at e3 so hoping
to see more then but for now it seems
like gaming hasn't been upgraded quite
as much as the rest of the xbox
experience the Xbox one is coming out
later this year and we're certainly
going to hear more about it as time goes
on like a price for instance but even
now it's clear that Microsoft is making
big changes and betting big on the Xbox
taking over your living room can it
we'll see welcome back we are here with
a man the myth the legend mr. Davis at
me oh that's me yeah that's love well I
just like to say I only own that shirt
just the one that I'm wearing now and in
that video is the only short I own ever
in the world that's just I just want to
get that out there for everybody that
works for you just go that's what I
think belong to it and also can I just
say I was just standing and watching
Chris and his whole Trojan horse thing
they like need to fill it with soldiers
crazy changed my life so I'm good that's
all that's all I said you have the
things you're gonna say what before you
came out here now it's all over I just I
just want to talk about Trojan horses
and soldiers and Chris Grant that's all
that's all I have now I mean outside of
soldiers and Chris Grant and Trojan
horses what are you excited about for
this so I don't know if excited is the
right word as much as curious uh but i'm
really curious about nintendo and what
they do here cuz they're in the sort of
this weird place for like it's really
obvious they're losing money the wii u's
not selling well and they're not having
a big event here which is sort of like a
tacit admission that like we're in third
place and we're okay with being in third
place and that's our life now but then
they come out and say things like we
don't need an event we have twitter and
facebook and youtube and that's plenty
for us and and all that stuff so they're
like what I can't decide is if Nintendo
like thinks they have something great
and that's all they need or if they're
willing to be in third place and just
sort of move on or like I don't know how
they continue to compete I don't know
what they do here and I'm really curious
so like maybe they come out with all
these great games that make really cool
use of the gamepad and it's really fun
and unique and they come out with all
this stuff but everything we're hearing
makes it seem like that's not gonna
happen I don't know if you guys have
heard things that I have but it seems
like they're just the craziest thing
about this to me is that this outcome is
was evident to anybody paying attention
like literally the day the wii u was
announced yeah you know it's like well
we make you guys you're so you're coming
out with an underpowered system again a
year before you know you know not a full
year but a good amount of time before
this next generation of consoles comes
out and blows you out of the water and
again you won't be part of the actual
you know you won't be able to get titles
easily ported over your system right Ken
right well then like Ken you're
excluding yourself from the conversation
right into a point like it worked last
time right they had this big explosion
of sales at the beginning it did really
well people got super into it and then
it kind of petered off as the others
really didn't and this time they didn't
have an explosion of sales it went way
worse than they thought it was going to
and now they don't seem to be willing to
like try and do something to get this
bump back up to where they are and again
this could all change if they have
something spectacular if they're like
just kidding guys Destiny's only on the
wii u like that might be really cool
but that's definitely not gonna happen
and I don't I don't know what I don't
know what Nintendo has left like though
they'll come out with a super smash
brothers game and that'll be me but like
I don't know what what do they do here
is there anything they can do we thought
we brought you on to tell us I know
about you knew well no I mean I guess my
my only theory is that they're gonna
it's not even theory this is just what's
gonna happen they're gonna go back to
all the same stuff they've always done
which is you know smash brothers and
they'll probably come out with another
weird mario kart game because there
aren't enough of those left in the world
but one thing they are doing that I
think is interesting is or one thing
that's been reported that they're doing
is porting smartphone apps over to the
wii u which actually sort of makes sense
because they have the gamepad which is
portable and it has a screen that kind
of makes sense and on the one hand it's
like well i have my phone to do all that
already and I don't need this big thing
to do it but they have you know you guys
were just talking about these android
consoles and they've sort of if they can
build a port that makes sense they kind
of have that little console in just the
gamepad by itself with some of the
controls and it has a touch screen and
that could be really interesting I think
if they could pull that off and that's
one thing I hope they talk about doing
here is what they're going to do with
these mobile games and how they kind of
wrap it into their ecosystems that fits
really well with like what Nintendo is
about right as these not their graphics
aren't incredible the games don't look
amazing there aren't any weird motion
tracking things to the level of what
Sony and Microsoft are offering but
they're fun and it's like words with
friends or whatever or angry birds fits
way better in my head at least on the
wii u than it does on the xbox one or
the ps4 it'll be interesting to see if
they're willing to price to compete with
the the mobile landscape too because
it's been the you know the problem for
for Nintendo I i think you know you look
at the game by Nintendo land that very
much seems like a collection of iOS or
mobile games are mobile game experiences
bunch of like 99-cent you right yeah
it'll be interesting to see if they can
you know they're willing to price at
that point that makes that almost you
know some an impulse buy yeah you know
more than investment yeah which would be
cool but like here's my question to you
would that make you care about the wii u
I've like completely forgotten about the
Wii U as a thing which if I'm Nintendo
is a huge problem and like I don't know
what brings me back at this point even
that I'm like it's a smart idea it'll
probably help them
sells more but I don't know if it brings
them back into like real competition for
the crown here yeah the one thing else
about the wii u is came out i'm like
this is ridiculous i don't care then
actually played it and it is fun it is
it wasn't fun for me to go out and
actually buy one or you spend money on
it or do that but it is fun they're
doing that thing with best buy where
they're going to be announcing some
games on their stream it we go out and
play them in the stores there are
obviously banking on those to be really
exciting exciting enough to get people
to go out and shop for the console yeah
they're in the store and even their
commercials are so like unabashedly
saying like trust us it's fun just buy
one and try it and you'll love it and
it's like you see this course right they
have like the family that comes in and
it's the little kid who's like oh my
gosh the wii u was my favorite thing
I've ever played anything and I feel
like the whole tagline is just like just
trust us it's great and like yeah I just
please we beg you I'm shocked honestly
that they did not make did not kind of
lies more on the year that they had gym
I mean they have a year where their
games were gonna look as good if not a
little bit better than the games on the
360 and ps3 yeah like that was the time
to make your money if you're going to
capitalize on what you do really well as
an internet which is game design I mean
among other things but I think primarily
game design and these franchises why not
capitalize on it in that year like yeah
in a year when the other two systems are
sort of production starting to slow
shift in focus why not let that be the
window that 12-month window where you're
just going to destroy it you know with
with with all the the games and instead
they're gonna gonna get to November and
all of a sudden it's gonna be real hard
to go back to the wii u um you know
after you been playing the ps4 and xbox
one yeah i mean that's weird thing is
like we're all talking about you know
next-gen games this week and like what
does a next-gen game look like and it
seems to me that all of the things it
looks like are not on the Wii U it's
like it has lots to do with you know
motion and voice control and it has
great graphics and it has different
physics and it has all kinds of online
stuff than like the wii u either has
like really sort of rudimentary versions
of all these things-- or just doesn't
have it at all and they're also not
doing a really good job with like the
set-top box stuff so i don't know why
you'd buy it for that
and I don't know the 3ds to me is the
one place where they still uh I don't
know if they're winning so much is to
say like losing the least among handheld
consoles that like it seems to be its
this is just sort of anecdotal but it's
the only one I see people like on the
subway in New York City using yeah I
never see vide as ever but I see I see
people playing 3d Isis and like the
sales figures are decent and they're out
there and so I wonder if Nintendo can do
cool stuff with the wii u and the 3d s
they might have a place to play there
and it's not like the graphics are so
great you couldn't use them in either
place anyway um but I just yeah I don't
I don't I don't see any movement towards
that and again they've had a year to do
this and like where if they'd been this
whole time and then EA comes out as like
well we're not building games and then
you know somebody at Nintendo like
clearly made an angry phone call and
they're like actually we are building
game we're not going to tell you which
ones are when they're coming out uh what
do you see them yeah they're gonna be I
didn't know about him yesterday but
they're really good I bet right there
called angry birds and they're gonna
cost 99 cents it's gonna be really great
yeah but then there's like there's all
these games i'm really excited to see
here what's the number one number one
game can't say I can't say quantum break
no uh okay is FIFA I know see I knew I
almost didn't say because you were gonna
look at me like that and now I'm upset
and I don't talk about anything no so I
mean there's like oh I gave you a whole
world David I gave you a hot tell you
why canvas and you picked up the FIFA
brush and painted a big fee fall in the
camera it you're welcome you're welcome
all my soccer playing watchers are just
high-fiving their screens right now
everywhere no but i think uh partly
because i think fifa is like a really
good example of what of what a lot of
games are gonna look like here which is
that artificial intelligence has gotten
so much better so much faster like the
one of these i talked about I've been
reading a lot about fifa 14 me to me
look like a lot of stuff i know right
the kicks the stop just the head butts
exactly and so what they're saying is
that like it used to be in fifa that
people would they would make decisions
based on like one frame and now so they
would like go the wrong door
all the time and now they have it based
on like a much bigger set of data to the
point where people playing it make the
decisions you would think they would
make which like to anyone who's ever
played a sports game that has never
happened ever guys just do random things
when they feel like it and everything
breaks all the time and now if it's like
actually feels like a real soccer game
that would be the first time ever and
would be really exciting and FIFA's huge
and has always missed that piece of it
and there's going to be stuff like that
across all these games and sports in
some ways are kind of the hardest to do
it for because it's like in a football
game you have 22 different people doing
22 different things at every point and
every time and you have to sort of be
aware of all of them and you're just
you're done with me right now it's
totally fine it's an open on coma no but
I think like and then I'm like I think
haley anna yes okay yeah it's it's a new
scale a holy pail adventure right i
would be into that exactly no but I mean
and then even even in a game like watch
dogs which I'm also really excited about
it's like part of what I'm so excited
about is that all of these different
parts of the game are able to work
better and more independently in a way
that'll make a lot more sense and make
these worlds feel much more real as
opposed to you're just sort of going
through and everything kind of happens
and you don't totally get it like
there's these worlds and you just live
in it now I think that's really cool but
just to clarify there's no soccer or
football in watch dogs now I know of
that we know of we know if that's true
that would be crazy David thank you so
much for joining us coming out later in
just a second we're gonna have Alexa ray
Korea from polygon calm but first this
video I don't know what it is it'll be
good
people are dying down here
that can't be known
you're a very good soldier best but
there's something you lack can't see
where the line is
we're killer to them
it's what we're best I'm here to see dr.
cardosa how do you know my name mutual
friend sent me access granted
stand by grey coming to you I shall a
canister eyes the target please wake up
you do not kill me this name is more
true you cannot judge you I won't kill
you until coming with me and you're
gonna tell me everything
do you know what you were doing
mercenary
chicle mcmaster you surf
the clock is ticking ban
no they're out there working for us
the only way to stop them is to wipe
them out
what I tell you just compelling you're
rich great stuff about square enix that
was of course deus ex on ipad is that
the fall the fall and we have Alexa ray
career from polygon hi hi I should let
you introduce yourself Louie try again
we have this person I'm Alexa ray I'm
gonna plug on you probably know me from
speedrun natural very nice good yeah so
did you actually play deus ex oh I do
not but I talked to a few people that
have played it and it's a little it's a
little interesting it's a they haven't
come out and said that it's episodic yet
but its supposedly a the one that game
that's coming out the summer is the
first in a mobile series mm-hmm so I
guess what it is is it's a the story
line runs parallel to human Revolution
and you're digging into that all
augmented stuff again but I'm a little
curious to see how they're going to
bring the experience of that really deep
day of sex story into mobile you play
deus ex right I did yeah I played the
you mean the first the I put the
original on PC cousin old-school bleep
okay and then I played the the new
console one yeah human revolution I like
to thought was kind of boring I didn't
like how I couldn't use my powers all
the time I'd like if i remember
correctly i had to eat chips to get my
powers back and i would just like to be
able to use my superpowers all the time
it seemed kinda lame and i know right
now i sound like Tom Hanks in Big
complaining about the robots that turn
into buildings because it's not fun but
that's why I thought I just want to use
my superpowers all the time it'll be a
it'll be interesting to see how they
sort of translate that because you know
Square Enix isn't doing so hot right now
they had the financials and the layoffs
and wada left and they announced in
their last financial report that they
were going to sort of renew their focus
on mobile so I know we were probably
thinking like oh like we're gonna
Portmore final fantasy games so you know
I phone or whatever but I honestly Dave
sex and mobile was a surprise and
they've been teasing the fall for a
couple weeks now and they've been
talking about a movie so yeah I was just
sort of interesting to see that sort of
go mobile like if they're going mobile
like why are you bringing this franchise
that's done so well is sort of a I don't
want to see Blockbuster but sort of a
big cinematic sort of a
Shin RPG experience if you're gonna if
you're going to demonstrate a renewed
focus on mobile isn't isn't it kind of
weird to lead off with a first-person
shooter which is not a genre that most
people think of is you know why not even
if it is still a deus ex game you know
why not take into a genre or something
that works well on that space right um
well worries me about that is sort of is
it's going to be a continuation if this
is the first one and there's more and
like you pay you know so you pay I think
the first one is seven dollars you pay
seven dollars for the first one are you
going to want to invest more time and
money into sort of paying for these
episodes if it is in fact an episodic
series well squares always had problems
with valuation on mobile I think some of
the final fantasy games have been
outlandish if memory serves they have I
think when is it dimensions was like
fifteen dollars that's crazy that's
crazy nothing has ever cost $15 on a
mobile platform that's a fact I think
tactics just came out in taxes tactics
was like 12 13 and that's like a like
like a hundred thousand year old game
yeah so there's that and then they have
their presentation on tuesday and
they're supposedly announcing their next
final fantasy game for next-gen which
I'm assuming is ps4 and Xbox one is it
gonna be Sam sit in it some took boom
hopefully tell any hopefully Joe
secondly in it I don't know I was and I
don't want to break I don't Rick you're
in da if you know if you have pretty
inside information on this stuff I don't
actually I know absolutely nothing going
into this not a MMO though probably
another MMO are not one they tried that
that Dylan again and again and again
yeah they hadn't did not pan out so
great now Romo borns coming out again
this summer guys get the net he's over
that ship done sailed nobody wants it
well they could go they could do one of
three things at this point they have
versus 13 which they announced in 2006
really it's 2013 yeah last time I
checked was it called versus 2060 yeah
thanks rose good morning yeah vs their
team they had they had 13 14 verses 6
through 12 coming out before them but
sneak sneak peek
oh yeah it was that and then there
wasn't there was a third game that
turned into a knot 13 game in Japan we
haven't gotten it so this is a game
that's been in development for seven
years and we've seen one gameplay video
we know almost nothing about it and we
haven't heard anything from it so they
can either announce that it was actually
announced as a ps3 launch title wow
that's fancy yeah so um that's gonna I
it's going to make people I guess
probably make people angry if they
announce it as a ps4 launch title
especially with the dedicated exercise
you can keep the tradition going yeah
people like that sort of thing actually
ps5 sorry guys um so there's that and
then there's the it could be they could
have rebranded it as 15 which is a lot
of people are speculating is the case a
14 came out 14 final 5014 came out twice
this is it's the MMO the second em ago
not a second second was the first MMO
and then 14 was the other MMO and then
they literally said they released 14 and
then they literally said that wasn't it
didn't good do good now they're a bad
job on that so we're just trying to get
let's do it do over I believe they
literally I didn't play it but they
actually ended the world like they ended
the war home and then like started it
over again I gotta see I like it doesn't
keep track of the Fast and Furious
movies man is very very convoluted so
here yeah he plays the drobo in many of
them next final fantasy starting Vin
Diesel led by that I buying a heartbeat
i pray for Walker no Paul Walker
important question Oh ludicrous yes no
no I go we're gonna say yes son Paul
what you don't want to say it on camera
that's not right can you drift a chocobo
I've never cried uh I wouldn't bet you
can what is the number one thing you're
looking forward to seeing at e3 2013
Fantasia oh really I am I was told to
not do not put all my stock in the
trailer that they showed which showed
sort of the teenagers with the lake to
like whatever musics and dump stuff that
they were playing but from what I've
seen and what I've what I've heard him
what I've watched I'm a big Disney fan I
was raised on Disney I'm a Disney kid
and the Sorcerer's Apprentice is such
such like an iconic
classic movie like everyone knows what
that is you see Mickey in that hat and
you think like like everyone knows what
that is and now they sort of taken this
game that's not only going to use a
kinect so you're moving but it appeals
to children and that it's sort of a you
know whimsical disney motion game but i
think it appeals to me as the older
generation that grew up with this is
sort of like a nostalgic kick so i am
going to run straight for the harmonics
booth as soon as I can very excited
thank you so much for joining us Alexis
ain't forget it thank you coming up next
we have a senior editor for The Verge
sean hollister hey guys it's not with
the verge i'm here at sony's playstation
4 reveal it's not quite a launch event
or announcement because there's a lot we
didn't see including the playstation 4
what we did see were a lot of games and
a playstation score controller the
DualShock 4 which is pretty interesting
it has an integrated touchpad and has a
headphone jack it has a light bar in the
front that camera accessory can look at
and track motion and it has a share
button that lets you immediately record
your game footage and share it straight
to social networks so that's pretty
interesting we also saw a lot of game
demos mostly engine demos and some
upcoming ports we stop watch dogs from
Ubisoft wish was it III which looks very
impressive we saw a very realistic model
of a human head to show us from the
graphical prowess of the ps4 looks
really great it's terrifying but it's
very impressive and we saw basically
just a lot of quick clips of games
showing off some of the graphical
horsepower the ps4 but not a lot of
actual gameplay I think only twice did
anybody actually use the controller on
stage and we really didn't see a lot of
the ps4 Sui we didn't see what's going
to make it special beyond just gameplay
and the other thing we didn't see which
is kind of important we didn't see any
of the media stuff there was no mention
of blu-ray there's no mention of 4k
nothing about how video might be
transferred the service nothing about
other content partnerships nothing about
TV so Sonia is very gaming focused very
developer focus today a lot of talk
about how the ps4 is really a
supercharged PC the developers will find
easy to develop for and make game sport
but very little about what the
experience of actually purchasing this
thing putting in your living room and
using it will be like
welcome back we're here with my
colleague who is not wearing a single
glove i'm sean hollister senior editor
with the verge and i'm here to talk
about playstation 4 let's do it alright
so playstation 4 sony says you can
download any game you see in the
PlayStation Store they say you can play
games while you're downloading them they
say you can instantly experience
anything at the playstation store and
they say you can stream that to your
Vita so you put this all together and
I'm thinking LLS you mean I won that of
course the one more thing one more thing
that you can do is you can watch your
friends playing a game because they're
sharing you know the live video footage
of them playing and you can just dive
right in there and grab their controls
if they let you so I put this all
together in my head and I say you're
just going to watch television you're
going to channel surf through your Flint
friends playing games grab jump into the
game you say you like the game you're
instantly playing it it's downloading to
your console in the background while
you're playing it you have this this
immediate experience and then two days
after they announced all this they say
it's an aspirational dream we'd love to
have this we're not sure what's going to
be available at lodge so what I want to
know is is any of that dream coming true
here at e3 I just put my wife all the
time I say the house is gonna be clean
I'm gonna put that way everything I want
a hot put at least three of the consoles
that I have underneath our TV hidden
away somewhere but it is an aspirational
boys hanging out everywhere Yeah right
or white yeah right now um gosh I don't
know I feel like I feel like Sony's
message has to be shaped by what
Microsoft has done in the lat in the
last week you know what I mean like that
I think that's going to be filling in
those gaps and trying to avoid the very
obvious landmines that Microsoft has hit
the past few days well it seems like
Microsoft they want to be you know the
box in your living room sony they want
to let you take it with you anywhere
they say today you can stream anything
on your Playstation 4 davita hopefully
hopefully hopefully I think they said
they'll do it for ever again baby I
think that yes what was for most games
it will be a mandatory
but imagine if that's your sony phone if
that's your sony tablet is that going to
happen that's what I want to know that's
what I want to know most here at e3 is
if any of that stuff they promise is
actually coming and when if they walk if
you walk away from this week and they
haven't said and it's still an
aspirational dream what do you think
that does to the ps4 is chances of
success later this year because they cut
out you can't sell puppy dogs you know
and now I think if they will either say
we've done it here it is it's amazing or
they will say something entirely
different and tried to distract us from
the fact that they said that like when
they said the PlayStation through would
be a computer right like when they said
the PlayStation 3 would have backwards
compatibility forever because that's
supposed to be a great feature like when
they said you know yeah and they
distract from that and they show it's
amazing games we forget that they
promised does the cloud and all the
power of the cloud today mm-hmm it's
actually really interesting I mean
matchup right now that because we've
never had we assume at least that these
launches are going to be fairly close
together and Sony and Microsoft have
never had to square off like that you
know you might have had a huge lead in
Sony and Nintendo were matched against
each other but that was it's a very
different pairing I mean they're there I
think those audiences are very different
here you have two people vying for the
same crowd and it'll be really
interesting to see how they because that
short-term momentum is going to be huge
and and how they can parlay that into
you know more momentum in it and I think
it's going to be interesting to watch
them play the short game you know
success in November how do we do that I
almost wonder even if they don't have
success in November though if with this
you know this rivalry this generation of
consoles if there's a chance for them to
jump ahead a year or two down the road
if Microsoft comes out with the luma
room they come out with I don't know if
we know what a limber I'm here is in
this room but it's this it's this
projection mapping experience where your
entire room around your television
becomes part of a larger screen where
you can interact with it and you know if
you know when Microsoft came out to
connect that changed things for them
years down the road after the xbox 360
right they were able to add that and get
another audience maybe there'll be
something like that maybe maybe Sony can
not have it at launch but still
that'd be the winning strategy I don't
know in the short term though it's going
to be interesting especially how it
impacts pricing that's what I'm really
curious how that works as we big
signifier of who feels that they really
have a lot to lose if Sony comes in the
other cuts four hundred dollars it's
great for consumers but it's also
something there I think they think
they're in real trouble too I think well
it's gonna be really hard to get out
from underneath a story a narrative of
we sold more this year I mean if they if
they have to cut the price down a little
bit they take a loss I think both these
companies are willing to do that if the
if the story becomes well one outsold
the other one is winning the console I
mean the console wars have never been
this easy to compare I mean either you
saw what if it's not about the price of
the box though what if it's all about
having a subscription service I mean
xbox live is the cash cow for Microsoft
right what if Sony's thing you know
streaming to your Vita is dreaming to
your phone and tablet maybe you pay them
for the service they have their
PlayStation Network their PlayStation
Plus become an Xbox Live that integrates
cloud gaming and instead of you know you
pay instead of paying your five hundred
dollars your box maybe you'll get the
four hundred or three hundred dollar box
today but tomorrow you'll be paying
sixty dollars a month it was a really
great trick that I don't know if I gers
off can pull off twice you know I don't
know that they can go back to that well
in in this day and age especially not
with you know things like but trying to
put things like Netflix behind a paywall
I don't think that trick works twice but
didn't work i mean yeah worked really
well for a while they loved every those
great money forget they really there's
good money and I don't think they're
gonna be Sony wants that money oh man
they wish they've got that money as soon
as microsoft said they were charging for
us is that ah damn it we shoulda thought
he's gonna charge people to play online
that's great we're gonna make a lot of
money we do sort of that do-over do-over
let's do a fun guys 14 31 what have you
got Vin Diesel to promote yeah there's
emphasis then you're good so sean is
there a number one game but you're
looking forward to seeing this year i
have heard that we're about to see the
unveiling of the next smash brothers oh
yeah and I stood I I stood in line for
my my Nintendo way on the day smash
