verge and today rim is announcing a new
version of its SDK for blackberry 10
this is beta 3 and it's also announcing
a new device that's just for developers
they're calling it the dev alpha B now
what's interesting about the dev alpha B
is that room says I needed to create it
because they simply ran out of the
original dev alpha that they gave out to
developers but if you look closely at it
you'll see that it's got this really
strange boxy design with a very large
bezel around the screen and we're pretty
sure where that underneath this strange
box is the first blackberry 10 device
the l-series it matches the you know
screen resolution that we're expecting
1280 by 768 it's got 16 gigs of storage
and a gig of ram and it's a pretty safe
bet that underneath is Boxxy exterior
what you're actually looking at is
something very close to what the first
shipping blackberry 10 device will be
just replace the ugly box with a Morse
felt and pretty casing so the other big
story today is the third beta of
blackberry 10 of the SDK for developers
and this gives us our first really good
look at what the user her action models
will be for blackberry 10 to start it up
you just do swipe up from the bottom of
the screen and this will actually unlock
the device you don't have to hit a sleep
wake button and as you swipe up the
black sort of fades away and you can see
what's going on underneath and you can
also launch the camera for a launch
screen to the default home screen are
these four tiles you actually can have
up to eight if you scroll and rim calls
them active frames they're not widgets
they're not live tiles their little
miniature versions of the apps that
you've run most recently they either
show just a small version of the app or
they can show a slightly different view
when they're shrunken down at this size
and so from anywhere in the OS you swipe
up from the bottom and you can very
quickly jump to your most recently used
apps and if you're not using a ton of
apps if you just use you know 6 or 8
apps for the most part you can move
between them very very quickly to the
right on the home screen is your
standard list of icons and these are
organized manually just like the iphone
and just like the iphone you can take
them drag them on top of each other to
create folders another neat thing with
the icons is you swipe down in a blank
space it's a little bit weird
once you do you'll be able to switch
between personal mode and work mode and
if you launch an app in work mode that
lets you have apps that are secured by
your company running alongside your own
personal apps this is a feature that rim
calls blackberry balance back to the
home screen on the left is the biggest
feature I think of blackberry 10 it's
called the blackberry hub and this is a
unified messaging app that you can get
to from anywhere in the OS you simply
swipe up and drag to the right and it
sort of pulls out the messaging app and
you can even peek a little bit to see
your new messages once you're in there
you've got a unified inbox for
everything you've got all your email
accounts and rim is also baking and
support for bbm of course Twitter
Facebook and LinkedIn and third-party
developers will be able to put
notifications in this area as well so
this also serves as Notification Center
but full integration for messaging apps
from third-party developers will have to
wait until later on overall blackberry
dev 3 the beta here is really fluid
really fast we're actually relatively
impressed although we'll have to see
what it's actually like to use full time
and if both consumers and business users
will take to it but so far the small
bits that rim is shown us do have some
promise but we'll have to see what
happens when it ships hopefully in
January or sometime in the first quarter
of 2013</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
