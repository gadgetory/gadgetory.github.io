what would it include it'd probably have
a great display great keyboard great
trackpad and be small and portable have
plenty of power and of course reliable
battery life and then it has all the
ports you need to connect all of your
peripherals
this is Huawei's new mate book x pro and
it is not the perfect laptop there's
definitely a couple of things here that
will be deal-breakers for some of you
out there but if you're looking for a
small laptop that can go anywhere and
handle almost any productivity your
entertainment need this is the best
laptop you'll find it starts with the
design materials which to be perfectly
frank are a complete ripoff of Apple's
MacBook Pro now even the color is called
Space Gray which is like come on but I
really don't have any problem with that
because the mate book X Pro is well
built it's got a smooth metal finish all
around it's compact and portable and
does basically everything right when it
comes to design even things like opening
the screen with a single finger work
just like they should on top of that
will always manage to put not only two
USB seaports one of which would supports
full Thunderbolt 3 but it also has a
standard USB port so I don't need a
bunch of dongles or adapters for most
accessories and if you do need to plug
into something else like a video cable
Huawei throws in a dongle in the box it
gives you an HDMI port a VGA port and
another USB a port
then when closed the mate book is under
15 millimeters thick and it weighs less
than three pounds which makes it just as
portable as any other laptop in this
class that makes it super easy to carry
around everywhere whether you're on a
really long commute to work like I've
got or maybe you're just moving from
class to class at school but it's
obviously way more interesting when you
open it because then you see that it has
a 13-point nine inch touchscreen display
and the trim estores you can get now
while we say so the screen to body ratio
is 91% here which is more than any other
laptop and more than even most
smartphones with edge to edge screens
like more than the iPhone 10 it's pretty
stunning to look at and not only that
the screen is bright it's vibrant and
its high resolution it's also a 3 by 2
ratio which makes productivity tasks
like working with documents or browsing
the web or multitasking way easier than
on widescreen displays that many other
Windows laptops have now this isn't a
convertible laptop or a tablet it's
basically a straightforward clamshell
design the mate book also hits other
basics out of the park there's a great
backlit keyboard that's low-profile but
not as shallow as Apple's it's got a
giant smooth trackpad that supports all
of Windows 10 gestures and its power
button has an integrated fingerprint
scanner even the four speakers are
louder and clearer than virtually any
other laptop in the size range the hits
don't stop under the hood either because
the mate book X Pro is loaded with specs
there's two versions you can buy the one
has a core i5 chip eight gigs of ram and
256 gigs of storage but the model that
I've been testing has a quad core i7
processor 16 gigs of ram and 512
gigabytes of storage it also has an
NVIDIA MX 150 graphics card which can
handle some light gaming and graphics
work basically the mate book X Pro is
powerful enough to handle any sort of
productivity or office tasks I can throw
it
now here are the two things that might
be deal-breakers for some of you but
probably aren't that big of a deal for
most people now as you can see there's
no webcam in the frame around the
display because basically there's no
room for it so while we built the webcam
into this trick pop out button in the
middle of the keyboard it's a wild feat
of Engineering it's a really clever
solution because when it's closed it
disables the camera so you don't need to
put some gross tape over your webcam but
even as clever as this is it kind of
sucks to use because the viewing angle
is so low and the quality of the actual
camera inside isn't great it's the same
problem Dell has with its XPS laptops
it's all up the nose and fingers in the
way when you're on a video call which
means that if you have to make a lot of
video calls for work like I do all the
time it's gonna be a bit of a problem
now the other thing that might be a
deal-breaker for some is a mate books
battery life I wouldn't say it's bad I'm
averaging between seven and eight hours
of my typical workflow again lots of web
browsing slack Twitter Email video
watching etc and it's actually better
than Dells comparable XPS 13 or the
touch bar equipped MacBook Pro so aside
from those two points there really isn't
anything else to complain about with a
mate book X Pro even the version of
Windows 10 that's running on this is
Microsoft Signature Edition so there's
no added bloatware or annoying
trial software like McAfee to it and
here's a kicker I haven't even gotten to
the price yet in Europe its price of
1499 euros to start which converts to
roughly 1800 us but if you're here in
the US the base model starts at 1200
bucks
and the fully kitted out rig that I've
been testing is just 1,500 there's no
other laptop on the market that offers
this much bang for that little buck
which means that if you're looking for a
new laptop the mate book X Pro is the
best one to buy hey thanks for watching
