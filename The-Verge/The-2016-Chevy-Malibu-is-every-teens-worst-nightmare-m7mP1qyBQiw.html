next year Chevy's rolling out something
called teen driver on the 2016 Malibu I
think of it as a monitoring system for
parents to keep track of their teen
drivers now it doesn't tell you where
they went who they went there with but
it does give you a pretty good sense of
how they're doing is drivers it's kind
of like a report card
in fact the car calls it a report card
so as soon as teen drivers engage
there's a few systems that kick in
automatically that the teen can't
actually turn off those include ABS
stability control and avoidance braking
and the teen has no control over those
but the parent can set them up ahead of
time and make sure they're in place so
there's a couple of things that it does
the most notable is that it cuts the
audio as soon as you release the
seatbelt so let's say we have some music
going
I take the seatbelt off and the music
automatically cuts and it does the same
in the passenger seat put the seatbelt
back in and we're jamming but the brains
of the system are right here so let's go
into settings teen driver enter our top
secret pin the teen doesn't know about
so there's a couple of things you can
manage here the first is audio volume
limit so let's say you're tired of your
teen driving around the neighborhood
blasting Fetty WAP well you can turn on
audio volume limit and a limit how loud
the system can go go back here and you
have teen driver speed warning so this
lets you set up a number so let's say
you want to be alerted every time your
teen goes 65 miles an hour well you can
do that and every time the car hits 65
miles an hour it will register on the
report card and the system goes all the
way up to 75 but if you're going that
fast well you're in trouble mister
this is the readout so this is probably
the most important part this is the
report card as if teens didn't have
enough report cards so it tells you how
far the drivers gone this is maximum
speed this is over speed warning this
tells you how many times the teen went
over the speed warning that you set
forward collision alert Ford collision
braking alert stability control and abs
active one of the things you might be
wondering is this sounds very dystopian
having all this information flying
around but in fact all this information
stays in the car and if the parent wants
this readout they have to cut actually
physically come into the car and read it
there's a couple reasons for this it's
mostly security and privacy but there's
a more fundamental reason and that is if
you need a constant alert to how your
teen is driving in real time maybe you
don't trust your team to drive at all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
