colonizing Mars for a really long time
like ideally there will be this whole
city up there that we can take vacations
to where everyone wears high fashioned
spacesuits and has a pet rover named
curiosity but now that we know that
there's frozen water in the soil on Mars
this fantasy seems actually possible so
if we were to colonize Mars how would we
actually do it one company called Mars
one is hoping to start a human colony in
2025 first Mars one will send a rover to
scout the best location somewhere with
flat ground near the equator to maximize
solar power but also close to a big
chunk of that frozen water the next step
is building the habitat right now
they're thinking they'll want two rooms
four living quarters two rooms for
supplies
and two rooms for life support the
life-support system takes Martian soil
puts it in an oven and evaporates the
ice particles extracting water and
oxygen next humans arrive a small crew
of four sets up the rest of the habitat
the ultimate goal is to create an
environment hospitable enough that
people can make babies that's what a
colony is Mars one wants to grow food
indoors but a lot of people think that
any real Mars colony will need years of
delivered earth food before it can feed
itself one sort of weird science
possibility is bioengineering new
organisms that can survive the Martian
climate I'm thinking giant nutritionally
enhanced cockroaches that we could grind
down into a space nutria bar or maybe
not there is another option terraforming
this is really out of science fiction
but basically we pump all these gases
into the Martian atmosphere until it
heats up to something more livable like
a deliberate global warming other
proposed methods include spreading dark
dust from Mars's moons on the ground
crashing asteroids into the planet for
installing giant space mirrors to
provide extra warmth and solar power
besides the obvious stuff there are some
really weird problems with Mars like
there could be dangerous bacteria we
don't know about that gets the colonize
are sick Mars is also subject to a lot
of radiation and we don't know what the
long-term effects of that on humans will
be like they could end up with some sort
of horrible Mars cancer also Earth
websites will take between six and 45
minutes to load there's just a lot to
worry about
but despite the drawbacks Mars is still
our best shot at colonizing another
planet it has water it gets enough Sun
for solar power and it's day and night
cycle is very similar to that of Earth's
so why should we let a little thing like
the lack of an ozone layer stop us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
