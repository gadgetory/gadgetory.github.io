today we're looking at Windows Phone 8
the latest generation of Microsoft's
mobile platform now Windows Phone 8
isn't necessarily about any one big
major user facing change it's about a
bunch of little things plus one big
change under the hood Windows Phone 8
uses the NT kernel which is the same
version of the Windows kernel used by
Windows 8 in other words there's a lot
more horsepower under the hood but let's
take a look at some of the things that
the user is going to see the first thing
you notice when you turn on the screen
is that you've got a new home screen
experience gone is the black bar on the
right side you now have a full width
experience and you can also resize these
live tiles to three different sizes the
lock screen also has some key
improvements you can set the background
to come from any number of apps
installed on the phone for example Bing
which is famous for having a daily image
you can use that image for the
background of your lockscreen you can
also show music controls which you could
do in Windows Phone 7 and 7.5 rooms is
one of the big features that Microsoft
is touting for Windows Phone 8 besides
texting you can also share locations you
can share a group calendar you can share
photos and then there's Kids Korner
which is the feature designed to make
Windows Phone 8 very kids safe if a
parent or older sibling has a Windows
Phone they can enable Kids Korner and
then when the phone is locked the child
can swipe from the left of the screen
which enables what's called Kids Korner
this is basically a limited function
version of the phone only has access to
certain games certain other apps that
the the parent or owner of the phone
decides mobile Internet Explorer has
been revamped as well in Windows Phone 8
Internet Explorer is based on IE 10 it's
using the same engine that you find on
the desktop it's faster smoother and
overall the experience seems to be
pretty good and then there's wallet
Windows Phone 8 finally includes proper
support for NFC you can think of wallet
a little bit like iOS as passbook
different applications can plug into it
not for payment methods that can be
exposed through the NFC payments if the
phone has that capability just tap to
pay and there's a bunch of miscellaneous
stuff in Windows Phone 8 as well Maps is
now powered by Nokia's NAVTEQ which
should make the
the Maps experience a little bit better
than it was before in the Bing world
speaking of Bing the local Scout service
which was introduced in 7.5 now had
something called a for you mode which
pulls in your preferences your history
and that of your friends on Facebook to
build a more personalized view of things
in the neighborhood that you might like
to do for music and video Zune has been
replaced by X Box you have Xbox music
and music paths which replace their
equivalent Zune services
you also have smart glass which is the
very very cool controller for your Xbox
console that's also compatible with
Android and surface and alike but it
works very well on Windows Phone 8 as
well and the camera in Windows Phone 8
has been enhanced as well you have these
things called lenses which sound like
they're just Instagram filters but
really they're a lot more than that
there are entire apps that plug into the
camera and do different things CNN I
report is an example of a lens that
allows you to export your photos
directly to CNN's I report service all
told Windows Phone 8 isn't about any one
big feature it's about a bunch of little
ones plus the new kernel that allows
this platform to run hardware that's
competitive with the latest that Apple
and Google have to offer but we'll
capture big holiday sales this year
we'll find out</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
