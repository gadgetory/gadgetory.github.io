I make tech videos and reviews
and this is what's in my bag.
The first couple years that I didn't go
I watched a lot of videos from CES.
I was part interested in
the tech and part interested
in all the other YouTubers going to CES,
I was looking forward to seeing all the
tech that they saw but also seeing how
they made the videos
about seeing the tech.
I don't know, I feel
like my first one or two
CES's were the most difficult 'cause
you get lost, I feel like
I've learned over those years
how to better navigate things
like the convention center
and Las Vegas with an
extra 10,000 people in it.
Like it's not a normal thing to do,
but over the years it's evolved.
I typically have one
backpack, my everyday carry.
I don't bring video
gear with me everywhere
but when I do go to a
show something like CES
or a new product announcement,
something like that,
I also bring my camera
gear to make a video.
So that's why there's two bags here.
This bag, I'm pretty sure it's called
the airport security something, something
because it is the exact dimensions that
are supposed to fit in
a domestic overhead bin.
I'll just start with the meat of it,
this is the camera, with the monitor
already attached and it's
really hard to travel
with the whole camera already assembled.
So I don't, so the only
things that are on it
are the SSD reader, the camera mount,
the Manfrotto plate, the battery module,
the top handle and the side handle.
And it travels like this.
Every once in a while the TSA guy
like recognizes me and he's like
am I about to find this Red camera,
and I'm like yep that's what's in there.
I feel like I almost owe a little bit of
my style to how good the
camera is at certain things
so the Red camera, the
Monstro sensor, is amazing.
Next thing would be to talk about
lenses of choice, I have three lenses now,
the 24 to 35, it's a full frame lens
for the full frame sensor,
it's wide, it's F2,
it's fast, so I do find
myself bringing other glass
but this is easily one
of my all time favorites.
So a slightly tighter
focal length that gets
a different look, this is a Zeiss Otus 55,
super sharp lens, it's
tighter obviously than 35
so this is sort of mid range shots
that are of things I'm
not holding, maybe someone
in front of me is demonstrating something,
but I just love the look
that comes from this lens.
And then last but not least
is the Canon 100 mil, F/2.8L
Macro, I think this is
the mark 2, this is another awesome lens.
So this has a minimum focus
distance of very close
and it's 100 mil, so this is getting
like super tight macro shots,
you can see super fine
detail in small things
like buttons, and switches, and knobs,
worth having if you're shooting a video
with anything small at all.
Rounding out the top half of
this bag is sound devices.
633, it's a mixer, it's a recorder,
it's a Swiss army knife
of all things audio.
Now I don't do audio on the show floor,
it's loud, it's crowded, it's
another thing to think about.
I'm focused on what
I'm going to say later,
but when I get back to the
hotel room or a quieter room,
pop the SD card in here,
the mic plugs directly in,
and this is all things audio.
The batteries on the back are Sony,
they recharge, they last
months, so these are great.
And then last but not least,
down here at the bottom,
red and black XLR cable,
can't go wrong there.
And the mic, this is the Sennheiser MKH416
and I just put it in this to travel with,
'cause it's just slightly
fragile, very expensive mic.
So that rounds out the video gear.
Which takes us here to
the rest of the tech
that I usually carry on
the daily and other things.
So you may have noticed a
sort of color theme here
with all these devices.
This is a Herschel backpack,
it's red and black.
Canon, all their L series
glass has red rings,
Red is the name of a company
that makes red and black cameras,
I didn't make that happen,
but the fact that it's
all red and black here now
is pretty great so I don't mind it.
The Herschel bag, this is what's with me
on the plane, this is
my more every day carry
that sort of connects to the video gear.
So first thing's first, is the laptop.
13 inch MacBook Pro, I don't
edit on laptops anymore.
So this is literally just
a laptop to have a laptop
to do computer stuff, this is
the one year old MacBook Pro.
It gets the job done, I'm just
emailing and doing all sorts
of laptop things as you'd expect on this.
Then next up is, maybe
my favorite piece of tech
that came out this entire year.
This is the 12.9 inch iPad Pro.
Anytime there's a lot of
typing involved I break
out the laptop, all other
instances that I possibly can,
I'm using the iPad pro,
which is like 85 percent
of the things I do, so that's great.
I do not fly without my Bose QC35's.
Then I found these, these
are the Surface headphones.
These are better looking,
these are more comfortable,
these are lighter weight,
the noise cancellation
is almost as good which is fine for me,
and the sound quality is great.
Can pair to multiple devices
so my iPad, my MacBook Pro,
and my phone at the same time.
They have a dial on the side
for volume, they're USB-C,
there's just so many
better things about these
headphones than the Bose.
And then actually up here
in the little top corner
of my bag there's a
little microfiber pouch,
it's one of my favorite
features of this backpack,
but I have my Airpods, they're matte black
and I have if it's still
in here, yes it is,
I have a SIM card ejector
tool everywhere I go.
It's probably not a normal
thing to have, but as a guy
that's moving between phones
often, kinda have to one.
Razer included this one.
Only non-tech item I think I have,
is like I said it's all necessities,
would be my extra contact lenses,
without contacts I'm almost blind.
It only took me missing flight
to go back and get contact lenses
for me to just now put
them in every conceivable
place that I travel,
so it's in my backpack.
There are more in my suitcase,
there are more in my duffle bag,
they're just around, so I will
never not have my contacts.
This little Swiss army knife,
this is a USB-C and full
size USB card reader.
So on one side it's full size USB,
pop that down micro USB,
open that up, USB-C.
If you ever need to read
a media card on something
that doesn't have a card reader,
which is most things now,
this is made by I don't
know how to say that Vanja.
Vanja
Vanja
And that's it, that is
what's in my gear bag
and my every day bag when I'm traveling,
when I'm doing tech
things, when I'm at CES,
this is what comes with me.
Hey thanks for watching, hope
you enjoyed what's in my bag,
