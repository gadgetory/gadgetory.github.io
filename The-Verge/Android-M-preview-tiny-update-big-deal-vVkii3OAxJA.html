right now but Google wants a billion
more their plan to get them includes
Android M a new version of the operating
system it tries to make everything
simpler to use without making the
operating system itself stupider
what's like if you were to put a sum it
up in one sentence the one thing that
you want people to remember about what
you're doing next with Android yeah it's
a great question work you know what
we're focused on with em is really the
core user experience and improving that
and so with em what we wanted to do was
really focus on product excellence and
look at the areas as a user of Android
what are the things that you run into
that annoy you or that could be improved
areas that we feel are important like
permissions clearly very important area
we want our customers to be able to
understand what's going on on their
phones and we thought that was
imperative when you click install and
play it'll install right away but when
the app wants to use something that we
deem is permission worthy like taking
pictures that's when we'll prompt to you
as a user
hey this app you know this Tetris app
wants to take a picture you okay with
that and you get to decide that makes
sense to me I'll do it maybe because it
wants to take a picture of you for the
high scores or something okay that makes
sense to you you say yes or if it
doesn't feel right you say no and then
the app doesn't get to do that at that
point so it's much more contextual and
we think it's much more understandable
for users now mobile payments in Google
was first with Google Wallet but that
also meant it was first to fail because
Google Wallet really didn't do that well
but now with Android M there's Android
pay which Google promises is gonna be
different Google has been trying to do
mobile payments in one form or another
for quite a while
why is Android pay different why is it
gonna work this time
yeah I think there's a lot that's
different we've created Android pay
which is meant to be across Android and
that's why it's called Android pay by
the way it's because it's all for all
OMS it's not really meant to be a Google
service in that sense like Gmail is to
be really for the Android ecosystem to
adopt as a payment mechanism and it's it
enables developers also to build apps on
top of also so it's kind of a platform
to and the nice thing about Android pay
because of the groundwork that we've
been laying over the years it will work
across seven hundred thousand merchants
right away in the US so there's a theme
here which is reducing the number of
steps it takes to accomplish a really
complex task the biggest way that
happens is with Google now which now can
work inside any app Google gets to
search inside apps now what what on a
high level
talking about her the way we think about
this is how do you get you know these
smartphones are smart but they can be
smarter they should help you stay
informed get things done
and but one of the things we've started
thinking about is how do you get
assistance in the moment when you're
looking at something and you know you
need quick answers to quick questions
so you've done a feature called now on
tap when you're doing something how do
you not get distracted and leave context
and get quick answers two quick
questions
so if I said something like okay Google
who is the lead singer what's nice here
is that just continued playing I got the
answer just like any new playing by
tapping and holding or by saying okay go
go you've basically said there's
something interesting here help me with
this right I'm referring to this this is
my context how do we get from I'm doing
a thing in my phone to Google knows what
I'm doing at my phone and knows what to
tell me about what I'm doing at my phone
once you enable this feature you're
basically saying hey at this moment by
tapping and holding him saying like
there's something useful here here's the
context do something with it right
what's exciting for developers is that
this is yet another way that they can
reach their users in fact at the time
that they need it right take this
example of the restaurant and like if I
tap and hold and like you talked about
you know a via and OpenTable would be a
great next step for me to look at or
Yelp is a great next step for me to look
at all the app has to do is just
existing dexterous right done how much
of Android should I think of as being
like a search product that is sending
information to Google and how much of it
should I think of it as like a flower
eases the way we think about it is more
what can we build that's actually really
useful for people and then what make
people want to use it that's really sort
of a high order bit for us you know we
could come up with all these amazing
plans on how it's can be so Google
focused but if users don't want it
there's really no point so the first
principle is really helping users in
their daily lives whatever it is that
they need to be doing and that's really
what it's about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
