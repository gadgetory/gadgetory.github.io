am looking at HTC's new vive Pro VR
headset now this is an upgrade from the
original headset that came out nearly
two years ago
they've essentially refresh the entire
headset and so you can see very clearly
at the front now they've got dual
front-facing cameras these are gonna be
used for developers to do pass through
VR but they obviously gives it the
effect of like a couple of eyes at the
front so it's kind of a unique design
compared to the original and you'll also
notice that there's a lot of slight blue
tint to this new vive pro i'm it's like
a navy blue i'd say and it's not very
noticeable from a distance but when you
get a place that's really obvious now
inside they've actually changed the
resolution of the lenses so you've
actually got a twenty eight eighty by
sixteen hundred now resolutions that's
up 70 percent from the original vibe and
now in real terms outside those specs
what that actually means is when you're
playing games you're reading text or
anything like that in VR it's gonna be a
lot clearer and I just tried it on for
about five minutes and I was trying to
really text and it seems a lot better
than the original and it's still not
they're going to be perfect but I
definitely noticed the difference in
terms of the actual design it's changed
quite a fair bit from the original so
you still got the strap at the top of
the head so you can adjust from there
and there's actually a sizing dial at
the back right here so you can go count
flock wise or clockwise and that will
lock more closely to your head and it
makes it feel a lot more comfortable so
one of the problems I had with the
original HTC vive and it felt a little
bit front heavy so you tilt your head
and it felt like it was going to push
you forward it's a lot bit of balance
and it feels a little bit lighter as
well so that's going to help with that
balance too
the other thing you notice is it's got
built-in headphones and just like the
oculus rift so ice looks better so you
don't have to plug in and another pair
of headphones and worried about another
cable when you trying to play VR and
they sound pretty good it's really loud
here so is there's no noise and it
cancelling on them so it's really hard
to find out exactly how good they are
and they've got special audio so that's
gonna be pretty good for VR games and
it's just pretty great to see them
having headphones built in other than
that it still kind of looks like the
original HTC vive so the other hardware
accessory that HTC announced today is a
wife's adapter for the vibe and the new
vive pro
so it's gonna snap on the back of the
headset it's just basically you don't
have to have this ugly cable run into
your PC it works on Intel's Y gig
technology so it's gonna be running at
low latency so hopefully the games
weren't likes
or anything like that when you're in the
middle VR and we'll test out fully when
we're outside and we've actually got a
unit but it looks promising right now
it's an interesting sort of competition
to Facebook and oculus is Santa Cruz
headsets that aren't out to and
they're just prototypes an aside from
hardware and I hate to see yet announced
some very minor sort of vive port
changes today so you're now bear to
trial titles envious your bid to
actually look at them on your headset
and see what they look like before you
actually buy them it's pretty cool for
trying out VR but I guess most people
probably buy their games from steamvr
anyway and hope to see is planning to
release this in the first quarter just
the vive Pro headset stand alone they're
gonna have bundles later in the year for
like enterprise customers and stuff like
that and I think this is really
interesting upgrade from the original I
think it solves some of the design
problems and some of the weight issues
especially in the UK we have like a
theme park VR riot and it uses the vibe
and it's not very comfortable and you
don't put the headphones on it so I feel
like something like this is going to be
probably more widely used in stuff like
theme parks museums and those sort of
businesses okay so that's a real quick
look at the new HTC vive pro and for
more of this and everything else at CES
