2015 in Barcelona and this is a new HC
grip this is a first wearable device
from HTC is done in partnership with
under AMA and in plugs into the Under
Armor record system which already has a
130 million users but this is the first
device that natively plugs into it the
big deal with this is it has GPS and it
tracks you runs it tracks your workouts
and yes city wants all the time I've
tried on here in Barcelona the first
time I tried it actually on both wrists
in my knee the class managed to snag my
wrist and do a little bit of damage but
hey she says that they still okay on the
final design of this I'm not an issue
that I found immediately was that
there's no vertical orientation and so
landscape inside interfaces in landscape
and that pretty much caused you to wear
it on the inside of your wrist which
might be just fine for most people so
even though it's a stiff device it's
also rugged one it's waterproof so you
can go with you wherever you go
uses a passive OLED display it's a touch
screen it's really fast and responsive
HTC says that it gets up to 5 hours of
battery life with GPS enabled and
two-and-a-half days without GPS if you
see also makes a big point of this being
a standalone device so it tracks your
data tracks things like steps these are
my steps somebody did them for me it
tracks the distance traveled calories
consumed I don't know how it does it but
it calculates it for you and also sleep
the other wraps are things like music
controls which plugs into your phone
once you get connected there's a
calendar again you need to have a
connection to your phone and you can
actually read notifications from your
phone and even respond to them with pre
canned responses once those things get
hooked up you can take a look at the
weather again with the help of a phone
and you can set it along without the
help of the phone I really like the
touchscreen it's really responsive it's
really easy to use however this being a
fitness device if you go out running in
the rain and snow or any other
moist conditions wet hands are going to
be an issue with the touchscreen but in
terms of tracking the big deal is it has
GPS and there are two too many GPS
devices like this
it's priced at 199 dollars it will be
released only in the United States and
available in the spring they say they'll
have a most pootie products by the end
of the year this one has been designed
entirely by HTC
Under Armour it's only wear is providing
the software and the tracking but in the
future the designs are going to be
collaborative between the two companies
so that's our first look at HTC grip
here at MWC 2015 in Barcelona yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
