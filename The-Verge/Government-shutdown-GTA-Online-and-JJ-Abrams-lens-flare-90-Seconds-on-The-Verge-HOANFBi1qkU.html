katie drummond and an apple a day keeps
the doctor away unless you're diabetic
who's been eating a lot of apples this
is 90 seconds on the verge well it
finally happened after many threats and
warnings the government has shut down
starting today nearly forty percent of
the US government civilian workforce are
being required not to work government
agencies like NASA and the Environmental
Protection Agency will see over ninety
percent of their employees for start of
work it's unclear how long the
government shutdown will last but the
last time this happened it was 1995 and
the government was closed for a
record-breaking 21 days the government
may be closing its doors but rockstar is
just opening the doors to grand theft
auto online the highly anticipated
multiplayer feature to GTA 5 launched
today the online mode did unfortunately
experience some expected server issues
including the inability to access grand
theft auto online at all for some
players so it won't be long before my
gang the moloch hills are up and running
at full speed and finally JJ Abrams
knows about his lens flare and he's
sorry for it in an interview with crave
online the Star Trek director apologized
for the overuse of his signature effect
in his films Abrams even admitted to
hiring post-production house IOM to take
out some of the flare in an early cut of
star trek into darkness I don't know is
it really bad oh my god my eyes and
that's it for today's top stories coming
up tomorrow I review the modernized
remake of the Graduate mrs. Robinson
