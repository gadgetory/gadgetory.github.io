shift in the creation and distribution
of visual media digitally shot films now
regularly win Oscars HD is the baseline
standard at home and 4k content isn't is
saving theaters it's shaping up through
the latest front in the battle for the
living room the industry is changing
through in place that's most evident is
right here in Las Vegas Nevada this is
where the National Association of
Broadcasters holds its annual trade show
it's a place where the people making
tomorrow's tools coming up with a
creative individual that will end up
using them this is nab 2013
here on the show floor there's big name
companies like red canon and sony as
well as a lot of smaller vendors every
type of film making equipment imaginable
is here there's one constant theme 4k
it's here and in a big way sony which
has been pushing the industry towards 4k
capture and distribution showed off to
new prototype cameras for video and
taking stills one look like a futuristic
DSLR but the other borrowed a lot of
design cues from Reds line products the
company also priced its home 4k media
player which will be priced at six
hundred ninety nine dollars later this
year and what if you're hungry for even
more resolution red had a clean room on
the show floor where was upgrading
owners of the red epic to its new 6k
dragon sensor have you know the name
phantom you know it's all about slow
motion and this is the phantom flex 4k
camera can shoot a thousand frames per
second of 4k footage this here is a
prototype it's not working about four
weeks ago with a 64 gig capacity there's
a number of different capacities you can
get you to about 5 seconds of footage
what's that like in playback and a
thousand frames per second that's three
and a half minutes of footage now price
on this the bare body itself is going to
be about a hundred thousand dollars but
a full kit we got 140 so obviously this
professional level gear so you're not
going to be basically buying for
yourself and now we know it's
interesting you know this right here is
the original phantom flex that has 2,500
frames per second at HD resolution that
technology has been evolving so quickly
they can make it even smaller which
brings us to the mirror now this one
basically shoot 1500 frames per second
in HD resolution at a much smaller form
factor this runs around fifty thousand
dollars all these cameras capture
fantastic high frame rate photography
and I want one I want Oliver
as technology has advanced it's enabled
professional level hardware to get both
smaller and more portable cameras can go
places they've never been able to go
before but making that footage looks
smooth and steady presents its own set
of challenges we're going to free flies
we're looking at the movie this has
taken the internet by storm the last few
weeks the camera stabilization system
users digitally controlled gyroscopes
with electronics you can basically
figure your digital SLR in here or the
lightweight cameras and get some really
really smooth shots you wouldn't be able
to get otherwise it's a pretty exciting
example how you can go and get some
really creative shots without a huge
bunch of the equipment that you don't
have to use
we are a creative technology company
that makes creative tools for creative
minds so I mean like NAB couldn't be the
more perfect show for us because there's
a bunch of geeks that are super creative
that's us you know I mean we are we are
the nav crowd so we took our
professional grade zenmuse camera
stabilization platform and have built an
end to the Phantom this crazy have
responsibilities it's very responsive
that goes exactly where you tell to go
just like that just like that let it
touch the ground and then just drop it
down nice flying man thanks to
people are taking things to another
extreme this is the steadicam curve it's
a motion stabilization device for your
GoPro camera the city came as a company
behind the original big full body rig
who uses stabilized cameras for motion
tracking shots you see them in
goodfellas you see them in the shining
this is a small version of it first
thing lots of smaller cameras like this
go out he'll be find a way to make these
shots you know a little bit less shaky
this looks like it's pretty stable so so
now I'm going to take this out and go
different book nights
it's not this consumer cameras changing
the game we're also seeing traditional
consumer electronics tripling up the
food chain and opening up some exciting
possibilities this is the bond to from
Terre des hooked up to your camera it
can bridge your footage into h.264 video
and then put to that over the Internet
there are six USB port so you can just
plug in stock sticks from Verizon
t-mobile AT&amp;amp;T and they say they sense it
too teradek servers and it reconstitutes
it and from there equal footage wherever
you want you know on the air on the
internet directly and what's really cool
about this thing is it takes it used to
be you know you need a satellite truck
to do these things before and I can do
it in this little box right here that
cost about four thousand dollars you had
the six obviously but basically you can
take a camera on the field shoot
something and have it on the internet or
anywhere else you want right away with
just this little box
in a lot of ways we're at the dawn of
the golden era technology and creativity
are opening up possibilities that were
only dreamt up just a few years ago
while the gear itself is exciting that's
really only one part of the story the
real payoff is what directors
cinematographers and other creative
professionals are doing with this new
generation of tools and to reap those
benefits you don't need to travel to Las
Vegas just open your eyes
