things this morning that we're really
proud of we think that all iOS devices
are made even better if they have these
apps we're making all five free now I'd
like to talk about iPhone we're going to
replace the iPhone 5 with not one but
two new designs and the first one is
called iPhone 5c iPhone 5c is
beautifully unapologetically plastic a
few of you might have seen some shots in
the web we have seen it 4 inch Retina
display a 6 chip 8 megapixel iSight
camera brand-new FaceTime HD camera at a
price of just $99 the team has created a
really cool line of custom cases
specifically for the iPhone 5c the
second is called iPhone 5s it comes in
three metal finishes silver gold and a
new space of grain it starts with a
brand new
system-on-a-chip from Apple called a 7 a
7 is 64-bit up to twice as fast as a
previous generation we can even now add
lens flares that would make JJ Abrams
proud there's a motion coprocessor
you're gonna get a whole new level of
health and fitness solutions what about
battery life 10 hours 3G talktime give a
new five element Apple designed lens
that has a larger F 2.2 aperture we have
a new sensor as well that has a 50%
larger active area when you launch the
camera app before you even take a
picture that's automatically setting
white balance it's automatically setting
the exposure level for the first time
it's creating a dynamic local tone map
showing auto focus make the 2 meter with
15 focus zones unbeknownst to you it
actually takes multiple photos it
instantly analyzes them in real time for
which is the sharpest and that's what
you see on your screen it has a new
flash as well we call it the true tone
flash actually has two LEDs one
a cooler white one and another a warmer
amber one for the first time the iPhone
auto image stabilization a fun new burst
mode slo-mo is select that one and then
you can create scenes with slow motion
like this the team has worked so hard in
the brand-new technology touch ID it
reads your fingerprint at an incredibly
detailed level touch the home button to
unlock your phone make iTunes purchases
all with just a touch of your finger it
starts with a 16 gigabyte configuration
at just 199 32 gigabytes of $2.99 the
massive 64 gigabytes at 399 they're
leather cases just 39 dollars each we're
also going to keep a model of the iPhone
4s an 8 gigabyte configuration in the
line starting on Friday September 13
that's this Friday you'll be able to
order the iPhone 5c then a week later
September 20th they'll start there to
purchase both the iPhone 5c and the
iPhone 5s I am a salvage iPhone 5c
iPhone 5s before we close this morning
I'd like to return to music for a moment
