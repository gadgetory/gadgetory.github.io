we're here with the voz flip this is one
of my oohs first u.s. laptops after
leaving the market two years ago it's
really trying to enter in the high-end
laptop market and take on Apple on
design and build quality and it
definitely seems like vaio gets there
this is a really nice and sturdy laptop
with some high-end specs it has either
an i5 or an i7 processor 8 or 16
gigabytes of RAM 256 or 512 gigabytes of
storage and there are two webcams on it
a 1 megapixel camera on the front and an
8 megapixel camera on the back which is
mostly just committees for taking
pictures air crotch the other thing is
that it's there in case you want to use
this laptop like a tablet because reason
it's called the flip is that it flips
around it's actually pretty neat design
I think it's a little weird to use it
first but there's this cool strip over
here and that's the hinge around which
the tablet flips the Z flip is also
being sold with a stylus to help you use
the touchscreen computer it's not
necessarily meant for art since this is
really meant for business users but
there is a screenshot tool built-in when
you press one of the buttons you'll
actually be able to make a snippet
around different parts of the screen and
then export that to OneNote to save it
it's not only something that I come at
myself using but via sort of thinks the
hyper-organized business executives will
love it even those for professionals is
not necessarily a ton of expandability
there are two USB 3 ports and one HDMI
port which is not great for business
users but I think the point is that by I
want to get this down to a pretty slim
size it's just over half an inch thick
and just under three pounds in weight
both of which are really great it feels
very nice overall it actually has
aluminum on the front and the inside and
there's carbon fibre on the bottom to
make it a little bit lighter the keys on
this thing feel great this must be
silent but they make a nice tapi sound
instead which I definitely don't mind
the trackpad is very clicky and very
accurate for Windows machine to the
speakers there definitely get very loud
that you can sound a little bit muffled
overall the BIOS e flip is available for
$1,800 today with prices going up to
2400 like I said it's a very expensive
laptop but isn't aiming for the average
consumer it's looking for the high end
of the market
actually sorta wants the business
professionals we look for the perfect
travel laptop and with this hardware in
these specs I just be able to justify
that price
inside the z5z five and I do love the z5
man do you know why z5 so bad yeah I do
I super want a Sony phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
