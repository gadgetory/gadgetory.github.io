I am looking at android pay google just
announced this inside we were taking a
quick look at by what else but caffeine
and filled soda pop so here's how it
works i'm basically just going to press
this up against the sin FC reader it's
going to pop up with my credit cards and
then we get to pick the delicious trick
we want a lot of people already used to
this with Apple pay and existing NFC
payments google wallet the difference is
that this is going to be a lot more
places so here's how it works popped up
with my credit card tells me I'm charged
this machine is authorizing the payment
I hit a button here and now I get to
take my drink which is going to be
caffeinated very caffeinated voila no
money was change hands but I'm still
filled with sadness from drinking this
at 10am besides soda you can also buy
things inside of applications so here we
are using android pay inside wishes at
these are two things that were actually
here at Google i/o t-shirts and
toys so say I like this I want to buy it
there's just a button here called
Android pay so I'm just going to buy it
