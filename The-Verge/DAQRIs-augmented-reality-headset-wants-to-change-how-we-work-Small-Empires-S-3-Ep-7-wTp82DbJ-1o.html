virtual reality the technology that for
decades has been on the cusp of arriving
is finally finally just around the
corner
you've probably heard less about
augmented reality but that field where
you mix virtual images with the real is
poised to be just as big and just as
interesting daiquiri a Los Angeles
startup has created an augmented reality
headset and the software that which
powers it it's aiming to revolutionize
the way people work by layering
additional data and intelligent
computing tools on top of their normal
vision daiquiri is an augmented reality
company that makes hardware and software
products for the future of work their
flagship hardware product is this really
cool kind of digital hard hat that you
wear and it has flip-down lenses and it
projects things on the environment
you're working within so if you're at a
factory it can project you know images
on gauges and can read those and track
those and feed them back so it's kind of
like a way to modernize would have been
legacy industries in a very very cool
way early in my career I got a chance to
work in the simulation industry and then
ultimately did a lot of work with
robotics and computer vision and I saw
all these pieces come together for
decades in very expensive government
facilities I got a glimpse in the late
90s and early 2000s of what would be
possible but it costs literally hundreds
of millions of dollars to do that the
aha moment was seeing the iPhone 4 get
released in 2010 now all of a sudden I
had a multi-core processor in my pocket
and I knew that those technologies would
now be possible in a mobile form and
that's when I dropped everything and
started decorating when the company
began it focused on creating software
the hope was that other players would
quickly create hardware that Thackery
could piggyback on and that those
devices helped to keep customers
curiosity and so demanded a market which
didn't yet exist when daiquiri started
there was no market for augmented
reality and definitely no market for
augmented reality at work the biggest
challenge for company like this is you
know always going to be convincing
people why they need it in the first
place
especially you don't have a working
prototype that's already being used by
somebody out there marketing pure
augmented reality is very difficult
because you're marketing the idea of
being able to communicate but just that
idea isn't enough you have to explain
how's it going to deliver
you we had to work pretty hard to just
get people to understand the fundamental
mechanics of the technology every
meeting we went into at that time we had
to explain to them what it was we were
doing what the industry was what the
potential was they'd never heard of it
before never seen it before and that was
an uphill battle every time we had to
build the tools we had to build the
awareness and we had to build the market
all at the same time originally they
were mostly a software company but that
brings issues right the software is only
good if there's actually devices out
there that can run it and when we
started a curry we were really
optimistic and one of the big companies
would come along and they'd make the
device that we needed and we could just
write our software for it we realized
along the way that that's not going to
happen for us to have the device we
needed we we had to get into the
hardware business and the things that we
had learned about making augmented
reality for phones and tablets could
wrap up into a pretty sick product
Google glass is far and away the most
well known attempt to create an
augmented reality product and also the
most public flop daiquiri is helping to
sidestep the concerns of a privacy and
fashion that ultimately torpedoed glass
by focusing on industrial applications
instead I think a lot of the problems
with you know companies that want to do
augmented reality is what's the right
application right a lot of times people
immediately say it's got to be gaming or
you know Home Entertainment or that kind
of thing and those are actually harder
sells in a lot of cases because you have
to worry about fashion you have to worry
about pricing there are all these
obstacles that get in the way and that's
assuming your product even works in the
first place what they've done by
focusing on the industrial application
is it takes a lot of those barriers away
the product can cost more everybody
looks you know goofy in a hard hat so
fashion goes out the window
and it comes more about you know making
the case can this make your work life
better can this make your company more
productive we realized the first place
that augmented reality is really going
to get to scale is in the enterprises in
the industrial space because this is
delivering on-site in context knowledge
transfer step-by-step work instructions
data visualization right where the
decision-making is happening a field
force engineer goes to service a gas
turbine on a jet they have to know maybe
600 different work instructions this is
a way to do knowledge transfer visually
so you can look at that gas turbine
engine and the computer vision can
understand what you're looking at
understand what needs to be
and give you visual cues without
language of what you need to do next
when we met our first industrial
customer it was you know hey I have
these fundamental challenges and I
desperately need a solution to make
things better and this fits into that
oftentimes technologies come around that
replace workers they take jobs away what
this is is expanding our senses
expanding our capabilities it's
enhancing our vision and transferring us
a knowledge that we want in real time
and that can make a huge impact on
someone's life Zachary has managed to
convince a handful of big customers that
its product is worth exploring the
question now is whether or not it can
build that into a profitable business
and if it can continue to lead the field
when massive players like Google
Microsoft and Sony are all making
aggressive bets on the augmented reality
market we started five years ago my
living room couch it took us two years
to get to the massive facility that held
ten employees and we thought we really
made it and really come a long way five
years later we've got 250 employees in
five offices around the world
and are just starting now to know how
much we don't know and how much we
didn't know along the way I'm going to
reality is still in its nascent phase
and we're at the very tip of the iceberg
it's gotten so much bigger since we've
started I mean we're at the point now
where we don't have to explain to
everyone that we meet what is it what
does the technology do okay let me
physically show you because people have
heard of it people have seen it
what kind of passed that point now but
you don't wake up in the morning and
look around you and there's all going to
reality everywhere there is that
critical path to getting there and we're
going to get there
now that daiquiri has kind of put that
product out there people can get their
head around what it is they've come
across a major threshold but what's next
is how are they going to iterate upon
that how they're going to respond to the
challenges and the things they learn
when the product gets out there in the
marketplace they're going to learn a ton
of things they could not have even
grasped before and so whether they can
be able to pull it off ultimately we'll
have to wait and find out
thank God</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
