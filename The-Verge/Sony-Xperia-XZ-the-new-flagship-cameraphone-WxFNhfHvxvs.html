2016 and I have Sony's new flagship for
this year the Xperia XZ now all the
action with this phone is around here at
the back because Sony is doubling down
tripling down on its camera technology
you still have the 23 megapixel sensor
from the Xperia Z series but this time
it also has laser detect autofocus so as
a second sensor and a new RGB IR sensor
dedicated to white balance and getting
just the right colors so these are
really the standout features apart from
that you have the metal back design
which Sony introduced at MWC and it's
its feature for the Xperia X series /
besides them this is really quite a
regular Android flagship smartphone
Sony's of differentiation here is design
and the camera in terms of the specs of
Sony's new flagship you would have heard
them quite a few times already this year
it's a snapdragon 820 processor 3
gigabytes of RAM 32 gigabytes of
expandable storage both of which are
actually quite limited we've seen some
other flagships coming out with 6
gigabytes of RAM and plenty more storage
but you also get the usual fingerprint
sensor integrated into the power button
you get USB C naturally for 2016 also
something that's quite unique Sony
nowadays is having a dedicated shutter
button which again goes through the
whole point about this being a camera
phone first and foremost them says that
there's also an expiry ex compact which
shares the same strengths of camera and
design so you have a choice of sizes the
5.2 inch xperia x ii or the 4.6 inch
xperia x compact the xperia x compact
actually downgrades quite a few of the
specs it doesn't have the metal back it
doesn't have two snapdragon 820
so what you make do is we're Plastic
back with a ceramic style coating and a
Snapdragon 650 I think that might be
sufficient to get most people the
performance that I need but again isn't
the top-tier level there are just a
couple of specs that might disappoint
people one of them is a resolution the
Xperia XE still sticks with 1080p
resolution the xperia x compact still
has a 720p resolution on it neither of
them is bad per se and both displays
have very nice viewing angles looking at
them now but it isn't the latest it
isn't pushing any boundaries and for
Sony that's what we usually expect
besides that both of these phones seem
to be running Android 6.0 one at the
moment
no promises from Sony with respect to
Android new get the latest version which
would be really nice to see other
companies like LG are just about to
launch android new get phones so before
seeing these new Sony phones in person I
was actually ready to criticize them for
not having any breakthrough specs aside
from those new camera systems but
getting in my hands
what I'm finding is that I really like
them
this is typical with Sony they do design
really really well they have this new
loop design as they describe it there's
a whole bunch of symmetry going on
around each phone and it's tangible you
see failure in your hands particularly
the xperia x compact I've always had a
soft spot for so many smaller phones
it's just a joy and a pleasure to hold
in terms of so many living up to his
strengths and extending them these
phones are just classic sell me so Sony
hasn't yet to announce the pricing for
these new phones but the X compact can
respects to be a little bit cheaper and
it will be on the market sooner next
week in fact the Xperia XE will be out
there in October thanks for watching our
first look at Sony's new exterior range
here at eco 2016 for more of the fun and
whimsy of covering the show here in
Berlin stay tuned to youtube.com slash
