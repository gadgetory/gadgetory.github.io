Glasses the expectations clearly exceed
the reality the first thing people want
to do is take a picture and have their
picture taken but after a few awkward
voice commands 30 to take it off and
admit that it's pretty cool but there's
just not that much you can do with it
right now but we're starting to see
developers stretch their legs in terms
of what you can do in addition to what's
available right out of the box you can
now get hourly updates from the new york
times app send and receive tweets and
upload videos directly to youtube with a
new fullscreen vmail there's also plenty
of apps coming soon like Evernote and
others but some developers aren't
waiting around if you have successfully
rooted glass allowing them to run apps
that Google otherwise wouldn't approve
one app Winky enables you to take a
picture discreetly just by winking
another less you run the full android
desktop right from the eyepiece the
explorer edition of Google glass was
designs the developers could try new
things but the speed at which it was
rooted has caused some to speculate
about the downsides of an ever-present
microphone and camera someone could in
theory tap into your glass without you
ever knowing but for right now hacking
glass requires physical access and
hopefully it'll stay that way right now
glass is a concept physically manifested
it's an expensive accessory that has far
more potential than it has functionality
but that's okay as units arrive when the
stoops of developers will undoubtedly
see the number of apps expand pretty
quickly glass will be a playground for
the imaginative and though will
experience some growing pains people are
excited and ultimately that's what
matters
