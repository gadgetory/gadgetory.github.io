i'm here with peter good all the product
manager for a boon to TV thanks for
coming either nice to be here so what is
a bunch of TV so a bunch of TV is part
of this strategy that we announced back
in november at the ubuntu developer
summit and it's effectively adapting
ubuntu too many different form factors
and a bunch of TV is the first thing to
come out from that strategy it's
actually a technology preview so it's
something it's a very early stage
product for us what we're demonstrating
here at CES is effectively taking the ax
bunch of user experience which
classically has always been a very PC
centric experience and showing that that
adapts well to a TV experience is that
the concept behind unity because I've
played with unity on the desktop is that
what you guys were hoping to set up with
all these different screens though yeah
but but it's important to note that what
we don't want to do is take a pc
interface and just put it on a bunch of
different devices what we want to do is
set up a common set of a set of common
elements rather that will work well in
different form factors so if you if you
combine you see the the unity demo I
think you guys have a video up online
yeah you notice that there are some
common elements there in sense of like
you know you have your lenses on the
left launchers for applications you can
switch your views and things like that
and it all looks familiar but it's not
exactly the same as the PC because that
just wouldn't work and we recognize that
with a TV you're pretty much navigating
with remote you need up down left right
and that's it you don't have a mouse you
don't have a keyboard shouldn't have to
type excessively right so yeah we just
want to make sure that that experience
worked well in a TV and it's more than
just the user experience so that's kind
of where we started but then from there
we want to actually create a product
that people want on the TV there are a
lot of TV products out there there's a
lot you speak to that sure um so we
realized you know when we looked at a
lot of the products out there nobody's
really gotten it right and many of the
experiences that are out there today a
lot of the devices are very separate
right there a box that you hook into
your TV
and if you think about it there are a
lot of boxes you get into your TV today
just to do certain things right so you
have a cable box that you hook into your
TV and that allows you to watch just
regular TV cable satellite terrestrial
whatever then you have you may have some
kind of online box that gets you to
connect it content or and that's a
completely separate thing then you have
a blu-ray player and that may also have
some internet media and then what if you
take pictures on your phone you want to
show those pictures to your family right
in order to do that you have to copy it
off your phone onto a USB key stick the
USB key and some other device and it all
becomes very very complicated so what we
wanted to do really was combine all
these different boxes into the same
thing so bone to TV is effectively the
OS for your TV that does many different
things but it's not it's all kind of in
front of you and presented in a simple
manner so that it's not navigating
through lots of menus we don't have
hidden functionality it's all very you
know on the surface right there for you
you can still browse your channels just
the way you did watch TV just that we
did but now you can actually go and find
anything you've recorded well you can
buy and rent movies you can you know go
through anything that's available for
for purchase or stuff you've already
purchased it actually seems a lot like
Windows Media Center yeah I suppose in
in some sense Windows Media Center still
is very much well so it can run the
set-top box it can run on the PC it is
still a very separate experience now I
think Microsoft's coming out with some
new stuff I think they have some deals
with cable and satellite things like
that but the other thing about going
with a solution with a bunch of TV is
the canonical the parent company for
Ubuntu is a very flexible partner and
that's another thing we think we bring
to this this table there are a lot of
really large companies putting out
products that have a similar experience
not quite the same at the same time
because they're large companies they
tend to dominate certain aspects of the
relationship and canonical can be that
neutral party neutral partner that you
can build products based on a bun to not
just TVs but you know other devices
and we'll see those throughout 2012 and
at the same time we allow you to
effectively have a bit more freedom and
flexibility in the product for instance
if a partner already has their own
services that they want antegrade into
that things like how do you make money
after you actually sell the device
manufactures these days don't make a lot
on the hardware so they need to be able
to make money post sale and we want to
enable that as well so you guys when you
say you you're talking about these
manufacturers that you're working with
presumably correct our customer is the
manufacturer and we build products to
help both them and their customers the
end users we want to make sure that you
know once they sell that product people
like that product and it's something
that they're going to keep and they'll
wanna buy more products is that a
different strategy than say the boon to
desktop no not in a sense once your
desktop we've actually working with PC
manufacturers and and server
manufactured for a long time and putting
a bungie desktop on that TV is is just
basically a different space right with
the the pc market is just very different
right it's classically people are using
this for work they're using it for you
know writing documents may be browsing
the web things like that when you move
to a TV it's just a very different very
focused experience what you want to do
is you want to watch TV you want to
watch movies right relatively simple
there the other thing is that it's
becoming much more common these days
that people when people buy a TV right
they want to do more with it they may
want to watch movies but then they
always get the idea of you know I
mentioned before watching a slide show
or a movie they recently took they don't
want to have to go out to the video
store to rent the video they don't want
to wait in the mail for something to
show up for a DVD and so it's kind of
about taking all these things this very
focused experience and putting these
things all together in a package so you
guys are doing your own store I saw in
the preview or whatever you have sort of
sample videos but it looks like you can
purchase or rent video yeah so the the
demo that we have today is is very
offline we're not we're not hooked up
but what we have is canonical has
an online service called up into one and
if once you want as a number of things I
mean it started off with just simple
file sync but it's also effectively
services identity and billing right and
so that means that we have media
partners like for instance today we have
the above one music store right where
you can purchase music and what we're
working on is deals so that you can
actually purchase other stuff like video
right so you can purchase or rent those
videos and then stream them to any above
to one device so while we're putting
this into a bunch you want sorry about
your TV and make sure it works there
you'll also be able to watch them from
any other of them to connected devices
okay so that's something you guys are
working on just in general yes all right
and it's it's kind of an overall
strategy it's a we realize that for
instance not everybody runs ubuntu and
people have many devices in their in
their own right they may have a tablet
they may have a phone those today aren't
necessary running ubuntu they may be
running iOS they may be running android
and a bunch of one already works on
those platforms and so we want to be
able to enable people to have the media
if they want to get access to on all
their devices yeah so what about you
know you guys are supporting things like
cable and satellite and cable card I
mean is that is that just being
realistic because a lot of the TV stuff
happening here is about getting away
from that industry distributing just
purely online yeah but that's not
necessarily reality I mean that today
there's there's a lot of different
providers cable and satellite providers
you know large ones like Comcast and sky
and they do provide a very valuable
service to people right and people are
already using these subscription
services there any I have access to
things like movies that are showing on
TV or TV shows to be able to want to be
able to watch and so well you can go to
that video lens and you can find maybe a
video you want to buy or rent at the
same time you can also search quickly or
filter quickly for a show you want to
watch and then set up a recording and
then it's also going to be in the same
place
again easy to find all your video
content in the same place and as you
guys work with you guys are kind of in
between pit the hardcore open source
completely you know linux linux guys and
then the you know manufacturers just in
it to make a buck you know evil you know
like how is this being received by those
people like but by your buyer i both
linux by your linux you know core
community i think so the longest
community at their heart really wants to
see linux proliferate right they want to
see it used in many different places and
the bunch of community in general is
very happy with this extravagant stick
about ubuntu they enjoy contributing to
it and they enjoy seeing their work
effectively out in the public people who
are not necessarily the same as as them
they're not hard core developers they're
just average people or and seeing them
using free software and using a blin to
on the device i think is something that
excited about so you guys are you guys
built this kind of in house now you
pushed it out and now your communities
helping you build it yeah yeah and it's
very much a collaboration with the
community we've we've at this point
we're we're setting a direction when we
first announced the strategy for
multi-screen and we talked about it 12
TV I think a buncha TV was the most
popular an active discussion community
we have internet chat rooms effectively
right that we use quite a lot those were
definitely vibrating discussions about
how it should look how it should work or
the technologies that we need to build
into it or what are the things we need
to consider we also have a mailing list
which is also quite active and so it's
been really good actually to see the
community get really excited about this
and we want to continue that so you know
we worked in-house to take a technology
we've built already unity which is the
actual user experience basis for the
user experience and then adapted that
and now from here we want to continue
building out like I was talking about
for the back end
it's more than just what people see is
how things work in the back end right
how do you share media across a network
without making people think what
protocol do I need or what access you
know credentials do I need and things
like that we want to make things much
more simple and seamless and some of
these things are things that have
already been solved an open source and
some of these things are things that if
they were solved on open source they'd
be helpful to all open source projects
yes certainly so there are a lot of
different products today that do a few
of these things and they'll do them very
well but at the same time they're often
the back end works great but the front
end is kind of it needs a bit of work
right you want to make sure that a like
I say you don't expose these are just so
much technical detail they don't want to
they don't want to worry about where
does this content live they just want to
see it right they don't want to know
that the movie is necessarily in the
cloud on amazon or on their machine they
just want to know I want to watch that
movie right or I want to see those
pictures and how do I get to this so
when should we expect this in the market
we can't necessarily announced a time
frame because right now we're actively
engaging with device manufacturers and
it all depends on when they're ready to
go to market okay but I will say that
this is a very early stage product right
we've worked out the user experience we
think we've got more to work on more
specifics about things like you know
recording videos and things like that
and then we've got work to actually
integrate it on a device and then you
know integrating partner services so
it'll be a little while before you see
it but this would be the first of many
technologies I think that you'll see
coming out of canonical over the next
year including and you guys are working
phones and tablets yeah i mean that's
that's part of our strategy right we
want to make sure we work accurately
toward that and hopefully you guys will
see more of that throughout this year no
no days no no no dates it's a it's
exciting I mean I think it'll be great i
I really i do want to see you know i
think that a lot of people are sad to
see me go go down and there hasn't been
really an open-source alternative so
yeah yeah I'm way we're excited to
bringing a bunch of these different
devices I think it's really important
actually for the platform itself yeah
we've done well in pcs and
we've done well in servers were actually
growing quite well there and cloud as
well but at the same time we need to be
able to go into these different devices
that are completely separate from what
we've done classically I think no all
right well thank you so much better
thank you let's go talking you too</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
