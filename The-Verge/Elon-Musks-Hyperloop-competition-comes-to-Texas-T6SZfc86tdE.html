idea popularized by billionaire Elon
Musk officially came to Texas in the
form of hundreds of eager bright-eyed
engineering students participating in
the first-ever Hyperloop pod design
competition representing 120 colleges
and three high schools they were all
gunning for the ultimate prize the
chance to build and test their designs
on Musk's personal Hyperloop track in
California this summer you know this is
the first major Hyperloop event so we're
here to be a part of it to be a part of
the community show off the work we've
done when we sold the announcement for
the SpaceX Hyperloop competition we
thought okay let's do that it's a new
idea and just introduced so it's doing
you need to know how far you can go with
what you have learned it so far to make
it applicable with something different
and something valuable to the community
what what inspired you guys to get
involved in this competition
honestly we thought it was really cool
what is a Hyperloop imagine an aluminum
pod filled with passengers levitating on
a cushion of air and traveling through
an elevated tube and transonic speeds
we're talking seven hundred eight
hundred miles per hour slightly faster
than a Boeing 747 it sounds fantastical
but it's closer than you think and these
students are at the forefront of that
movement
the Hyperloop to me means being able to
connect cities making it more efficient
in a plane but as convenient as a train
I want people to just very conveniently
be able to travel very high distances
while barely using any energy obviously
this is like a big idea it doesn't exist
yet in the world you guys think that it
has the chance to actually happen moti I
have never seen ten years from now hyper
loops connecting cities and towns oh
definitely the technologies here this
amazing competitions really an impetus
for technology to be built and for the
system to be built full scale so I'm
very excited for the future it's really
not about winning it's about it's about
really just developing this product as a
whole in developing the Hyperloop system
as a whole that's the point of the
competition as you can see you from xmas
treats a lot of energy a lot of work
people have worked it so hard so you
realize that ok you are part of
something big and you need to work more
on it they came from all over California
Wisconsin and Washington as well as
South Africa Pakistan in Egypt they
presented their designs for Hyperloop
pods and stations subsystems for
levitation propulsion pressurization and
braking so we're just hugging a full pod
it will be about 12 feet long and we
plan to enter this for the June
competition and our pod is more focused
on the passenger passenger experience so
a person steps inside your PI to travel
from LA to San Francisco for instance
what's what's that experience going to
be like what are they going to be seeing
hearing feeling feeling very very low
because the control systems on this had
to be very very precise even a few
millimeters moving here and there would
not be acceptable
so as in a plane you might feel
turbulence this thing will be the
smoothest ride you ever have I like that
idea yeah so the idea traveling at
speeds of 200 miles an hour
Elon Musk's design has it going maybe
700 miles per hour is that something
that's safe do you feel like that
something that people are going to be
willing to put themselves into if it's
if it comes down to it we're gonna have
to prove it to people to make to show
them that this is safe and in fact
that's why our design from the start and
actually that was one of my kind of
functions within the group was to say
this thing must not it can fail but it
has to fail gracefully or as we like to
call in systems engineering graceful
degradation it's great to see all the
different designs all the teams are
obviously very passionate about the
technology and about the Hyperloop idea
the concept so it's great just to be in
here they you know the vibe the
excitement for the future of Hyperloop
and transportation is it's palpable
right but the students weren't the only
ones in attendance several of the
high-profile companies that are actively
involved in building Hyperloop s-- were
there to stake out their positions in
this increasingly competitive field but
the biggest shocker was the surprise
appearance of musk himself who offered a
sneak peak at this summer's Padres that
he was hosting the crowd greeted him
like a rockstar and he left them feeling
like all their efforts were about to pay
