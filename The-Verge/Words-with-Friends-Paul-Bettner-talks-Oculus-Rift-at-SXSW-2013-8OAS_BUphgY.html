and we are at South by Southwest
checking out the oculus rift panel that
just ended we are here with Paul
buettner he is the CEO of verse in a
co-creator of workers friends with his
brother Paul how are you doing good how
you doing so we just got done with the
panel you're on it you're super
enthusiastic about it can I ask how did
you get involved uh well I backed the
project I think you know like i said the
panel i was actually i think one of
their first like leap level backers and
you know as i mentioned i really
believed in the dream of it with before
I even knew that it the dream was real I
was even in contact since you guys meet
you guys did the panel together what was
your first time meeting Palmer like it
was pretty awesome I mean you walk into
their offices and it's like it's palmer
and he's got no shoes on and it's a
bunch of soldering irons and like you
realized wow this is the real thing what
these guys are doing here you know i
didn't know what to expect i don't know
if i was can just walk into something
it's like oh it's all venture
capitalists and it's all whatever now
these guys are the real deal so it was
it like when you try for the first time
when you take it off Palmer likes to say
welcome back and that's the best way to
describe it I mean you just you really
do let you lose track of where you are
in just a few minutes after having it
having it on you forget that you're a
sitting in an office and that you're
like there's people standing around you
whatever you're just completely immersed
right so we talk about short bursts
games you talk about longer form
exploration games on there what do you
think is like the best kind of genres
for this and like even the best links of
using this I think the bed genres right
now just because I have figured out
anything better our games where you sit
in a chair because that's what you're
actually doing when you wear this thing
so racing games flying games chris
Roberts space game you know but also
that's so that's one category also i
think there's this up this whole other
category which is games that put you in
a situation that you just where it's
just all about the visceral experience
so like a falling game or a game where
you're flying or like you just you fall
non so i have this crazy idea for a
multiplayer game where you take you two
players in the Rift and you shrink one
of them down to the size of an inch and
you have the other one huge and you have
to be able to track hands to make this
work but you have one player pick up the
other player like how crazy you see this
huge hand come down and like pick you up
and fling you like you all yeah
exactly so Jack in the dry you just made
a great movie tie-in games yes yes all
right so how about this one let's say
what about Han base jesters maybe a
tile-based word game of
would that work in reversal space no not
really I mean it would but the thing is
you got to realize like to make a game
like that work you first have to build
the whole world then build a table in
this great living room and then you get
to make the game and put it on the table
with little pieces so it's like you have
to do a lot of work just to do a board
game because you can't it's not like
words with friends or somewhere you can
just put it right in somebody's face
it's it doesn't make any sense EBS ISA
go to action basic an action Ford moving
game schedule it has to be it has to be
where you're immersed in a world and you
don't really get him you're not immersed
in chess maybe of something like battle
chess where you're actually one of the
characters you know but but if it's if
it's just you know a board game of chess
like that could work but it's not it's
not the right fit for this kind of all
right last question what is the first
projects you guys are going to work on
as verse for the oculus rift we're now
ready to announce a it's okay right I
you know I mentioned on the panel like
right now we're just trying to figure
out the basic components of a VR game
and like you know like cliff was saying
it it's it's a new type of language the
things that make for compelling dr game
are completely different than what we've
experienced on TV so you know we're just
really trying to figure out what those
corn nuggets are so that we can then put
a game together around them but i mean
you know it's like I said figuring out
that falling is a really compelling
thing so maybe we make a game around
that you know like those are those
things we're just figuring out those
first little steps great well thank you
so much thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
