three years ago we got a lot of grief
about using that word drone these were
just remote control toys people would
say they couldn't fly themselves at CES
the last two years we finally saw drones
that could sense and avoid obstacles but
these were R&amp;amp;D projects and tech demos
so far not gadgets you could actually
buy well that all changes today with the
introduction of DG eyes newest drone the
Phantom 4 you know this is kind of the
drone that we've been waiting for there
were drones that could help you fly that
could take off and land or return home
then there were drones that could follow
you or orbit around you but they were
always blind to their surroundings if it
was following you down a ski slope and
there was a tree in the way like the
drone doesn't know about that it's just
going to go right into it so this is a
little different before when the Phantom
was following me it was using GPS so it
was following my phone which was
attached to the remote now it's using
computer vision identifying me as a
subject and then following based on that
that's the real difference is follow me
is not following me it's following the
signal whereas active track is actually
creating that image of the person
recognizing the 3d image that changes
because you don't look the same when you
turn your head to the side is when you
do looking forward or when you're
walking look different too but the
phantom 4 is smart enough to recognize
that it's still you and stay locked onto
you this is really the implementation
that we dreamt of which is a combination
of computer vision that's going to keep
the subject completely in frame and also
active obstacle avoidance so it senses
the error environment around it and will
make intelligent decisions to avoid
collision avoiding crashes is a great
new feature obviously but DJI is using
the computer vision technology to do
more than just that a new feature called
active track for example but you trace a
circle around a subject you want to keep
in frame the phantoms on-board computer
builds a 3d model of that subject and
then automatically follows it for you
the Phantom 4 accomplish this feat with
the help of three extra cameras two in
the front and one below and two
ultrasonic sensors it has also added a
second onboard computer for processing
and understanding the data it's
ingesting about the environment it's the
first consumer unit to come to market
that can actually see the world around
it
accordingly a big step towards a truly
autonomous aircraft the new phantom
isn't cheaper than previous versions in
fact at 13 99 it's more expensive than
the top-tier phantom 3 was at release
but the pitch from DJI to consumers
especially beginners is different this
time it normally when people ask me this
is my first drone what should I buy I
would say buy the cheap one learn how to
fly I'm getting to a point with this
craft despite what you know you were
talking about slightly above the Phantom
3 professional in price when it comes
out with those autonomous flight modes a
big beginner can fly this so the
learning curve used to be pretty high
you know even before the Phantom series
and with the Phantom 3 it became a lot
easier to get up in the air but there's
still a lot of confidence issues for
people getting up in the air for the
first time and learning how to get
excellent shots we're trying to decrease
that time from getting up in the air for
the very first time and getting exactly
the shot that you want and this is the
system to do that by and large if you
wanted to do any complex maneuvers you
had to learn how to use a two strik
controller and fly manually so the idea
is with tap to fly you don't have to do
that anymore you could just sort of use
the viewfinder like what you can see as
the way to set the shot yeah we're
trying to find an easier interface for
first-time pilots to be able to use and
there's really nothing more simple than
pointing in a direction that you want it
to fly it also makes it easier to get
smooth shots you know when you're
filming in one direction you're often
making little micro Corrections that
cause the footage to look a little
wobbly right this just creates one
smooth shot and if you try to change
directions
likewise it'll smooth out the direction
of the shot so that you get a really
beautiful image now we're heading
towards the building fingers crossed it
will make a decision about how to deal
with that so yeah as you can see it just
got a really beautiful shot going over
the top of that abandoned Factory and we
didn't decide to ascend it did that all
on its own it cleared it perfectly that
would that's a lot closer than I
probably would have felt today flying on
my own but you know you let the robot
decide what what's best so this is our
moment of truth the drone is going to
lock on to us as a human
Waal one of us anyway and then we're
going to tap to fly it's going to head
towards us and sense that we're an
obstacle hopefully and avoid us yep
so you just pick a point in front of it
hit go here comes the drone hopefully it
sees us and decides to fly over our head
wasn't even close
see benevolent robot overlords the fully
autonomous mode on the Phantom 4 are
amazing and they're starting to push up
against the edge of what the Federal
Aviation Administration considers safe
flying practices so I guess the hardball
question I asked now is if somebody buys
this and you know learns to take off
with the swipe of a button and just uses
you know tap to fly they never learn to
fly then what happens if something goes
wrong they've never really used a two
state controller right so there's
actually a number of things that we've
built on board one is there's some
things that you can only access if
you're doing using two sticks so using
sports mode for example that's an
advanced flying mode that we only allow
people to unlock if they agree that they
know how to fully operate using the
sticks then there's some more advanced
features like that rotation around
people that still requires using the to
stick interface while it's tracking so
it's these different things that we're
trying to provide options for people
going from the very entry level to more
advanced features down the line I think
the thing that is most exciting and
probably most terrifying about this is
that a lot of beginners are going to be
able to take this thrown out into the
field to do a lot of great flying and to
basically never learn to pilot it's kind
of like when Tesla pushed that update to
its car that was self-driving and then
told you to keep your hands on the wheel
you know that's the way people are if
you give it the ability to be completely
autonomous some people are going to get
reckless with it but definitely the most
exciting drone I've ever played with and
the one that is most aptly referred to
as an actual drone
