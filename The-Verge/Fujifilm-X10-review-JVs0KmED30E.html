and this is the Fujifilm x10 it's a
brand new $599 camera but it looks just
like a camera from 50 years ago the
Leica m3 that's really really
good-looking it's made out of magnesium
with synthetic leather all over it as
tons of manual controls it has dials and
buttons and switches for just about
everything you could possibly want to do
but they're kind of confusingly laid out
so sometimes you'll be looking for a
menu and it'll be just in a different
place than you'd think it would be so
there's there's a pretty big learning
curve just starting to use this camera
it does have a hot shoe so you can add a
better flash or an electronic viewfinder
or any of a number of other accessories
to the camera there's also an optical
viewfinder on the camera but it's a
little different than normal ones
it doesn't look through the lens and
instead has a window off to the side
it's a rangefinder style viewfinder what
you see isn't what you get from the
picture so sometimes you can frame a
picture and it'll end up looking totally
different than what you thought inside
there's Fujifilm zone EXR processor and
it's really good especially in low light
it compensates really well for bad
lighting and gives you nose free images
that you wouldn't normally be able to
get there's also a 12 megapixel sensor
and all that adds up to a pretty fast
shooting performance it can shoot up to
seven frames per second at full
resolution but it's actually kind of
slow otherwise the camera takes about
three seconds to turn on it does have a
cool mechanism that lets you actually
rotate the lens to turn the camera on
and off but once you do it there's about
a two to three second gap before the
camera actually powers on all that said
the x10 takes really really fantastic
photos I can shoot in JPEG or in RAW and
the photos I got were really clear and
the colors were really great up to ISO
1600 once I got 230 260 400 photos
weren't very good there was a lot of
noise and they started to be soft but
they were still usable at Facebook sizes
the one problem I had with the photos
was that the autofocus when you're
zoomed in didn't work particularly well
but thankfully there's this really great
super macro mode that lets you get a
centimeter away and still get clear
pictures of the subject it's a really
cool trick when you're shooting
something close up the x10 can shoot
video at 1080p at 30 frames per second
and the video like the photos looks
really great it's clear and accurate
it also has stereo mics which is a nice
bonus for the sound overall if you like
Fuji films design and can get over the
learning curve of getting used to the
x10 you'll really like the camera it
takes really great pictures and performs
really well but at this price and in
this form factor it's hard to recommend
it over cameras like the Sony nex-5n and
some of the Micro Four Thirds cameras on
the market which are a lot simpler to
use and thanks to interchangeable lenses
can be a little more versatile</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
