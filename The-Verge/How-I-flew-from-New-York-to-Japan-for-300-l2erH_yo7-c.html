to be a little extra when it comes to
travel planning and that's true but
that's because I like having control
over where I go and how I spend my money
I'm sure that's important to most of you
too so I'm going to show you all the
tools that you can use to plan your next
vacation as a professional travel
planner for eight months and an amateur
one for basically all of my adult life I
love travel planning the Israel I like
to follow for budgeting a vacation for
just yourself should cost roughly around
the same as what you make in one
paycheck that way you're neither making
or losing money to be away and you give
yourself the option of either going to a
really fancy resort for a weekend or a
backpacking trip on a budget for one
week but obviously everyone's situation
is a little different
especially you've got family members to
account for for that budgeting you can
use a tool on be frugal calm to figure
out whether you should drive or fly to a
place even factors in costs like tolls
and gas prices for driving and taxis to
and from the airport for flying but I've
gotta focus on flights because a good
flight deal can really feel like they're
hard to find
have you ever heard of people who have
scored crazy flight deals from New York
to Japan for $300 I've been one of those
people it was amazing but it probably
helps to first understand how flight
pricing works the majority of air fares
you see are targeted to two kinds of
travelers there are those who will pay
any price because they need to be
somewhere as specific time that's folks
traveling for business a family
emergency a wedding and then there are
the flexible travelers who are willing
to put up with midday flights or layover
to get a better deal so in that sample
flight from New York to Tokyo the prices
might fall into this range now of course
airlines are incentivized to make the
most money per seat so the majority of
the fares you'll see likely fall between
this middle range in prices but when
it's time for an airline to try to fill
its empty seats
it may just straight up drop prices
that's where these seasoned a lower
range become up for grabs keep in mind
that when an airline drops prices it
drops services - and this is notorious
for domestic flights or ones from
low-cost carriers chief flights often
come with restrictions such as not being
able to pick your seat bring overhead
luggage or having to fly to inconvenient
times these budget options are becoming
more popular so that airlines can get
their prices to the top of search so
read the fine print before you book but
back to my magical three her
that was actually a mistake fare which
happens when a human or
era causes a slight ticket to literally
be sold at the wrong price this is for
your rare and not all Airlines will
honor it but if you do find one wait
until you have a confirmed booking
before you start booking places to stay
currently I'm looking to book a flight
in early December and I'm pretty
flexible on where some of my favorite
places to find deals are like the flight
deal or Scott's chief flight or airfare
watchdog
these are newsletters that track price
drops I'm looking through here and there
are active deals like Copenhagen for 333
dollars these are pretty good but I'd
like something a little cheaper a little
closer to home now this one from the
flight deal is 178 dollars to Martinique
it's about a four-hour flight that seems
pretty good I might actually consider
that one one last place I also like to
look is Google flights so it looks like
Google flights and the flight deal are
both showing biz Martinique fly for 178
it's through a Norwegian airline and
that's probably coming up because
Norwegian just opened a flight route
between New York and a lot of different
places so they're probably incentivizing
people to buy tickets to fill their
planes that's why I so cheap right now
you can book a flight like this through
aggregators like Orbitz or Expedia and
earn points but booking directly at an
airline will give you more leverage if
there are travel disruptions or
cancellations check with your credit
card companies tube they offer travel
protection now you've got place to go
and now it's time to think about a place
to stay
sites like home away and Airbnb are
great options for people who want more
of a local vibe or places that are
unique to them if you prefer things like
housekeeping or in-room dining you might
choose a hotel in which case TripAdvisor
forums could be a good place to start to
look for places that might suit you and
if you're really on a budget sites like
hostel world or couchsurfing could be
good alternatives for finding places to
stay on the cheap
now let's find some things to do I like
to mix my resources so that's
TripAdvisor forums and Lonely Planet
guides but also look at some YouTube
bloggers to see what they've done or
even Instagram location tags of
different cities now I'm a huge nerd so
when it comes time to put together my
itinerary I like to make Excel sheets
and InDesign documents most people don't
have that kind of time
apps like Google trips can be a great
option for you to pull all your travel
info together such as maps hotel
bookings train tickets what-have-you tip
time here are some things you should do
before you go download all the apps you
need beforehand that's offline map so
you can navigate without internet
ride-hailing apps money exchange ubers
maybe a dictionary of you go into a
place where you don't speak the language
check with your mobile carriers to see
if they offer international data plans
some of them are free some of them are
cheap to look through that before you
decide whether you need to buy a SIM
card at the airport lastly set a travel
notice for your credit card the last
thing you want to happen is to get to a
foreign place with no money really saved
for a trip now but first to be some time
off book teeters can have some time off
Travel is so personal so I'm sure I
didn't get to all of your favorite tools
so share them with me in the comments
let me know also if you haven't already
