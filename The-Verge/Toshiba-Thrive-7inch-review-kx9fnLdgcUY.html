this is the toshiba thrive 7-inch which
is the baby brother to the original
10-inch thrive and obviously this one
has a 7-inch display making it a bit
thinner and lighter than the original
actually still really like the design of
this tablet I like the rubber back and
sort of the ribbed feel of it but
unfortunately this one feels a little
bit more cheaply made the back is very
plasticky and you can actually hear
creaking on it when you hold it tightly
in hand unlike the original thrive there
aren't full-sized ports surrounding the
tablet but there is a decent selection
on the left-hand side there is a port
flap hiding a mini USB a micro SD card
slot at a mini HDMI port on the top
there's also a 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack well I do have some issues with the
make of the tablet especially that back
that I mentioned before I do really like
the screen quality the display is really
bright and it also has a really good
resolution the 1280 x 800 resolution is
really crisp on the 7-inch display with
a high pixel density that's really good
for reading Toshiba's kept to the same
cam respect there's a 5 megapixel camera
on the back and a 2 megapixel camera on
the front but unfortunately the quality
of the pictures is pretty bad and on top
of that the shutter speed is really slow
it actually takes more like four seconds
for the camera to snap a photo and also
the placement of it on the back makes it
really hard to keep your fingers from
getting in the shot the camera isn't the
only place you can see the sluggishness
of this tablet while the internals are
pretty powerful the Android Honeycomb
operating system can be slow at times
especially when swiping through menus
and opening applications it is even
slower than some of the other honeycomb
tablets I've tested like the galaxy tab
7 plus for 379 dollars the toshiba
thrive 7 inches in a bad choice and you
get one of the best displays I've seen
on the 7-inch tablet but for a little
bit more you can get the samsung galaxy
tab 7 which has better performance and
better battery life and at half the
price if all you want to do is consume
content on a 7-inch tablet the Kindle
Fire is also a good alternative
