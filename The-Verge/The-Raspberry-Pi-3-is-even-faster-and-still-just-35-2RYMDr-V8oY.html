an entire computer it's the new
Raspberry Pi 3 the third in the line of
raspberry PI's extremely cheap pcs like
the others this one is just 35 dollars
and it's probably gonna be even easier
to use thanks to two of its new features
you now has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth onboard
that's gonna be a huge help for schools
because they want to wire up entire
rooms with Ethernet cables and they'll
just be able to hook up a classroom over
Wi-Fi they're also really great for
researchers but now be able to have
sensors send information over Bluetooth
and have them all recorded and captured
by the Raspberry Pi it looks like it
should be pretty complicated to use but
they're actually really easy to setup
hooking up a Raspberry Pi is basically
just plugging things into all the
different ports
you just put a micro SD card into its
storage slot hook up HDMI so there's a
monitor and then use micro USB for power
so even though this bluetooth on the new
Pi you'll still want to use USB just to
get started while you're setting
everything up but once you are in the PI
it's really easy to use it's a pretty
standard Linux computer and it comes
pre-loaded if you're using something
like raspbian with an office suite
programming tools they need some
advanced stuff like wolfram Wi-Fi
bluetooth may not seem like big upgrades
but they're big deal for the people who
use raspberry PI's and they should make
them much more capable as complete
computers plus the fact that they're
still just $35 means it's probably going
to be as popular as ever</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
