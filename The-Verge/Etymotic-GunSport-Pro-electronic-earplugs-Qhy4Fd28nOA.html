we're with the purge and we're here at
the gun store in Las Vegas today we'll
be testing the ED Emmonak gun sport pros
these are active noise-canceling
earplugs that allow you to talk to each
other normally but they muffled aloud I
am an awful sniper
I just killed a terrorist I'm an
American Hero the gun sport pros were
actually really effective in fact I
think they were even more effective than
the full-size earmuffs that the shooting

when I took the edit mode it out and I

actually painful every time the calorie

the isolation is really excellent
so other than those two things we
very effective</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
