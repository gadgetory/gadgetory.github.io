we challenged ourselves to create a
design that was not just for Android
phones and tablets at its annual IO
developer keynote google has released a
new design language for Android Chrome
OS and the web Google's calling it
material design the new look which was
first previewed in a Google+ update last
month includes splashes of color
refreshed iconography and a more
consistent interface hierarchy the
entire interface is based on what google
calls a quote unifying theory of a
rationalized space in a system of motion
he adds a mouthful a video released by
Google shows the new design language in
action with radically redesigned
versions of googles apps for Android and
the web including Gmail and calendar
google also trotted out a new look for
androids logo it's entirely lowercase
and replaces the one google has used for
the past five and a half years material
design represents the first real
departure from the company's so-called
holo UI first introduced with Android
4.0 and 2012 Paulo came with design
guideline for app makers which at the
time helped unify the disparate styles
that independent developers had used for
their apps that consistency has changed
the face of Android and although Google
has only demonstrated its own material
design apps so far it's releasing a
comprehensive set of guidelines and
tools for developers to create web and
Android apps in line with the new style</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
