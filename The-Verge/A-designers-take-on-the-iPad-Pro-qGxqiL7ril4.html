not something as big and expensive as
the iPad pro will fit into their lives
for designers and has a whole different
value proposition I'm a design director
that can't function without my MacBook
Pro and when I first heard Apple
announced the iPad pro I had high hopes
that this new device would take some of
the load off my laptop basically it
would transform into a rockstar designer
right I've had the chance to use the
iPad pro for my job over the past week
and while I couldn't do everything I
wanted to on the iPad pro it did a lot
more than I thought it would my day to
day usually revolves around various
Adobe programs so when I got the iPad
pro I immediately downloaded draw sketch
and comp I was really curious to see
whether I can integrate my current
projects into the various Adobe apps and
get as much done as I normally would on
my macbook pro I used draw to illustrate
Donald Trump for a news feature I use
sketch to create a quick sketch for one
of our designers to give direction on a
new infographic and I used comp to
create mood boards and wireframes for a
site design I really liked using Adobe
comp on the pro I could definitely work
this app into my daily workflow another
plus once you're logged into Adobe's
Creative Cloud you can send files to
your desktop that are fully editable but
I wasn't as impressed with the other
iPad pro versions of Adobe apps for
someone just trying to sketch or do a
wireframe these are great
anything more high fidelity I found too
heavy and complicated to do and I ended
up reverting back to my laptop programs
I also found that shortcuts I always
used in Adobe Illustrator
didn't work in Adobe sketch or draw
Apple's new stylus pencil is pretty
awesome I've tried a few different
brands of styluses in the past and never
have I have been wild like I am with
this one it's comfortable in the hand
and it's really precise there's
virtually no lag when taking notes it's
fast and keeps up with my messy writing
almost making it better I did notice
that writing in other third-party apps
like paper 53 and Adobe Sketch there's a
little bit more latency but it still
worked well usually I make a sketch for
one of my designers on paper take a
picture of it email it and then explain
what some tiny squiggle is now I just
sketch with a pencil and email it
iPad pro a lot of designers might wonder
how the iPad pro handles both
multi-touch and a stylus also because of
palm rejection software there's no issue
with your palm being on the screen as
you write and sketch overall I was
impressed with the iPad pro it's giant
screen and it's processing power along
with the accessories could have a huge
impact on my day-to-day workflow where I
think this falls short though are some
of the limitations around working with
mobile apps I'm hoping that the apps
will continue to improve and match the
fully powered desktop versions I'm used
to it's not quite there yet
but it wouldn't surprise me if one day I
swapped my macbook pro for the iPad pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
