we're looking at continuum which is a
brand new Windows 10 mobile feature
basically it puts one of these new
devices which lumia 950xl
and it turns it into a PC and
essentially does it by connecting via
the USB type-c connector here into a
dock here and you're gonna be able to do
it wirelessly as well but for the for
the demo here we've got dock with a
mouse a keyboard and it's just like a PC
so on the on the monitor what you'll see
is if I activate the Start menu it's
basically the same as my Start screen
layout here and so I can access Cortana
Outlook mail so if I open up Outlook
mail you have a full screen version of
it you can't resize them you can't snap
these apps side-by-side you can get into
a toss for your feature so it's
basically like Windows 10 where you're
sort switching between the different
apps and you can just multitask that way
and what's kind of interesting is say I
have Outlook mail open here and I want
to play with it on my phone I thought
sure my phone and what it does is it
sort of pops away from the screen and
back onto my french it doesn't like ruin
your phone that your phone is just
sitting there not be able to do anything
you can go text someone or do something
else with a different app and still use
this as say you were able to see a Word
document and so basically it's
essentially continuum it's turning your
phone into a full PC and it's shipping
with Windows 10 and mobile</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
