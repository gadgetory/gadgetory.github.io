and this is the windows 8 release
preview it's out now and it's available
for download or if you have the consumer
preview you can upgrade pretty easily
we've seen windows 8 on a tablet before
but this time we got to test it on a
samsung series 9 laptop without a touch
screen and see what the laptop
experience is like the first thing
you'll notice is that Windows 8 is just
more stable than ever before there
weren't really big problems in the last
version but things are faster and more
fluid now multiple monitor support has
been upgraded switching apps happens
faster and it's just a better experience
and feels much more like unreal
operating system that's ready for
release there's also some new stuff in
some of the core apps like in mail you
can now pin different inboxes to the
Start screen so you get individualized
notifications or it can jump straight to
a particular mail account but things
basically work and look the same and the
things are improved slightly in the
calendar and in mail but again it's
basically the same look as you're used
to by now there are few new Metro apps
to give you a sense of what they look
like when the store is open and
populated with Metro apps there's a
sports and news and finance apps and
they all kind of look like Flipboard
they have big pictures and text the
reflows to the size of your screen and
its really nice system and works really
well zoom past is also now integrated
into the music app on Windows 8 it's a
subscription music service just like
Rdio or Spotify and we've actually heard
that there's going to be an Xbox branded
music app on Windows 8 and this may well
be the first version of that the biggest
new addition though is flash support
there's a very limited version of flash
built just into the IE 10 browser and it
actually only lets you access flash
using certain sites Microsoft and Adobe
really wanted a version of flash that
doesn't kill the performance so you
can't use it on certain sites like Rdio
but it's there for YouTube and Microsoft
is keeping a list of sites that work
well with flash so hopefully that'll get
bigger over time on the hardware side
Microsoft's also working with trackpad
makers like synaptics to bring the same
gestures on touchscreen devices to non
touch devices like the series 9 we used
a really alpha version the software and
it's a little buggy and finicky but for
the most part works well and it's nice
to have the swipe from the right
gestures to bring up the charms or swipe
from the bottom to bring up menus in all
this is definitely a big improvement for
windows 8 just in terms of stability and
feeling like a finished operating system
there's going to be a lot of great
third-party apps coming out now that the
marketplace is open
and if you're not willing to wait for
windows 8 to come out it's definitely
something you should consider
downloading now</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
