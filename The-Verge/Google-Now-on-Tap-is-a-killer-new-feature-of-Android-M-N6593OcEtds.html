verge Android marshmallow Google's
newest operating system for mobile
devices starts rolling out today to
Nexus phones and tablets first and then
other Android devices in the coming
weeks and one of the most buzzed-about
features with android marshmallow is
something called now on tap we've seen
now on tap before in a couple demos one
was at Google i/o earlier this year and
some of our verge colleagues have also
gotten demos of now on tap but Google's
made some major strides with this since
it was first announced in May we're
going to take a look at what it can do
so the premise here with now on tap is
that basically you're going to access
much more information directly from
within an application and this is all
part of Google now so it's all part of
Google's attempts to make this
smartphone even smarter here's an
example I'm going to go into messenger
here where someone named Fred has asked
me if we should go and see the Martian
this weekend now this is what's really
cool about this the Martian is both a
book and a movie but given the context
clues that the word see is in here
Google now on tap knows this is
referring to the movie so when I hold
down this button here these results come
up you see there's an IMDB page if you
go to YouTube it takes you to the movie
trailer because what do people like to
do when they're considering going to a
movie they watch a movie trailer
but Google now on tap also works with
voice search so if I was curious more
curious about the book I could say
something like okay Google who wrote the
book and now I know who wrote the book
in addition to information about the
movie okay so that's just one example
let's take a look at Instagram Hillary
Clinton's page here what happens when I
hit Google now on tap Hillary Clinton of
course is a pretty well-known public
figure so there are a lot of results
here google twitter facebook instagram
new
images and more go to her Twitter there
you go
and go back and I stay within Twitter in
this instance and other instances other
apps you might be taken back to the app
you're in before another cool example go
to viber and Fred being very persistent
once again asking if I want to go see
Lane eight now I would hear that and I
would probably think is that a bowling
alley this is where Google now and tap
comes in handy it's actually a musician
and from here I can listen to Lane
eights tracks just as I would if I went
and googled him and googled Lane eight
songs something like that but I just get
it directly from the conversation that
we're having so that's supposed to be
the value of now on tap it doesn't
require any kind of updates from
third-party app developers in order for
it to work properly all the work is
being done by Google here it's also
completely voluntary you don't have to
opt into Google now and you don't have
to opt into now on tap within Google now
but if you're on a quest for a smarter
smartphone that's what Google's trying
to do here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
