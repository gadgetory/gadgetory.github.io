thing about Star Trek isn't actually the
spaceship so the phasers or even the
aliens it's the little communicator
badges everyone has you just tap it and
say a car to engineering and then
suddenly you're talking to engineering
there's no ringtones nothing to take out
of your pocket it's just instantaneous
connection of course that sounds great
when you're calling someone it's
probably less fun on the receiving end
down in the engine bay the car just pops
into whatever they're doing with no
warning and they have to instantly
respond they might actually prefer a few
rings before the phone picks up but
that's not how Starfleet wants it this
is part of why communication systems are
so weird it's not really about the tech
we could probably build a Starfleet
communicator right now with just
Bluetooth headsets and a strong wireless
network but getting people to use it
would make them uncomfortable it's
social technology and hardware just
fills in the gaps the real question is
how we want to talk to one another
something we figured out recently is
that most communication wants to be
private that's part of why texting is
more popular than talking out loud you
can have a private conversation even
when you're in a public place then
there's the question of how people why
whether to contact you at all a ringing
phone is one way of doing this you only
pick up if you're available to talk but
it's not very efficient some people talk
about a kind of universal status
indicator that would let people see
who's available to talk and how's best
to contact
it could even be broken down by social
settings six of your friends are around
to talk about weekend plans eight of
your coworkers are around to talk about
work you get into questions of digital
to the presence there's a workroom in a
weekend room maybe and if you like you
can be in both of them at the same time
you can be in dozens of rooms at once or
hundreds that could be virtual reality
or just different windows in a chat app
but the idea isn't going away what we
don't know is how those tools will
change us we'll all that digital space
make us more present or less present
well human beings become more
extroverted or just more talkative
there's no easy answer to that it's a
choice we still have to make but
whatever happens the future is gonna
have a lot more communication as someone
who believes in the value of talking I
have to think that's good news</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
