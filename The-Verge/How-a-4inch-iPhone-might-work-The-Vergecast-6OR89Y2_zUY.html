here actual callers yeah he's been
drinking Timothy how can we help you I
can help okay good and a lot of rumors
about like a larger screen iphone yeah
and 4.6 images i think is ridiculous but
but I think I have an idea about how
they could do this few times when it's
brought up bloggers they will it camp
dummies know what iOS to set for ab work
in one way well have you ever realize
that when you run an app and you're on
the phone call and there's that green
bar at the top it squishes the content
you're saying wearing six-inch green bar
is what you're saying in a way is the
study computer you can go the other way
so imagine a streamlet at six-forty but
instead of a nine 60th you like an old
1120 it would fit it would fit on the
same size device and all apps would
currently work with just black bars but
looks great so I think just so I
understand what you're saying you're
saying that the screen would be larger
but they would use the real estate
differently in the sense that there
would be a section maybe for
notification notifications or widgets or
some pledges are you and us dreaming now
that allowed and then that would just be
what hanging around when you're writing
an app now when you're reading app that
hasn't been redesigned to have black
bars it doesn't make sense to me I think
four point six inches is a whit whit
literally sweating out the ipad ipad
just got retina display and all those
other crappy eps was off oh the iOS
developers are a really good ecosystem
and they're really good is just updating
that well no no i don't think there's a
question about the app update i don't
think it's a i'm not one of these
peoples like look if they wanted to make
a four point six inch display they could
just change the resolution and say
here's the new resolution of our phone
but it would do it and everybody would
just do it like that's what you do like
because you're moving to the next you
know and you'd have
whatever a universal binary for the
older for would scale me nor would scale
right um I'm more concerned about the
idea that the size is four point six
inches which to me I feel like Apple has
been very careful to not to not like in
a way price out the people and I don't
mean actual price but like in terms of
the size price out people who really
don't want a huge phone and I think
that's actually a relatively large
segment of the market I think we have
some idea because of Android that like
people is dying for bigger phones but
you know I was raised on the millions
and millions and millions and millions
and millions and millions and millions
and millions of iphones that are so and
millions of iphones that are sold hey
women I I totally understand anything
I'm saying I think people to say a force
defense screen up missing the win I'm
seeing a foreign screen it's simply
taller but fit on the current size I
know it's great I agree with you in the
current like this thing you know the 4s
are you saying that you're saying he
wants to just extend the same bar you're
saying that it would be yeah you see
this that you're saying that this the
white pearl call it would become black
screen right right anyway the
home-buying would be a virtual home
button right a virtual woman or it would
just be elongated is the first the first
sight that rumor that the next iPad
would be vitally thicker in the span
postage of the same source that the new
iphone would be eight millimeters taller
that was given enough room for lightly
elongated right well yes I actually
think that that if if you I don't know
if you've ever read any of our reports
about the next iPhone the iPhone 5 which
was obviously not not with the four ass
that's that the Cinco via the Cinco um
you know it I think the screens gonna be
bigger I just think 4.6 is like a weird
place to be for them why not four why
not 4.2 why not you know I just that all
right I think they're gonna go around
for the 4.1 area and then I think I
don't think they're gonna make iPhone
any wider I agree i think they're gonna
do i believe they're gonna do like if
they go up it's gonna be very slight
they're gonna and it's
the kind of thing where they say we
increase the size of the display and so
it looks better than ever but we but we
either kept the size the phone the same
or actually made the physical size of
the phone smaller they could do that in
four inches yeah they could do din four
inches by by decreasing the bezel and I
think they saw the pixel density to call
the redness the pic we did the math on
this a pixel density would be totally
within Retina Display levels anyhow fact
thank you for the call it's a really
good point really interesting food for
thought</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
