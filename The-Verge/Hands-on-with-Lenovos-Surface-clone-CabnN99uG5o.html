this is the IdeaPad mix 700 although if
you're looking at it from a distance you
might think it was a surface so the deal
with the IdeaPad mix 700 is that it
comes with this removable keyboard which
is exactly like a surface keyboard down
to it locking on magnetically and even
folding up for a little bit of stability
compared to a surface keyboard it's a
lot more tactile it it's got a little
bit more bounce to it so that's nice
although the downside is it's a really
thick keyboard the other difference
between this and the surface 3 is
Lenovo's really proud of this watch
hinge it means that the kickstand on the
back can go to and hold pretty well
pretty much any angle you want it to
which is pretty it's not like as stable
as the surface 3 that locks in in some
cases when you press on it but it's
really solid and it's pretty good it
also works with the stylus and they even
can get this little thing that clicks
into a USB port so you don't lose it
which is fine I guess and it does have
two USB ports one on each side which is
helpful if you have a PC which of course
this is it's a Windows 10 machine it
should be launching in November of this
year for prices starting at around $6.99
although of course this model aspect is
way more expensive it's got a core i7
processor 8 gigs of RAM and 256 gig SSD
so kind of top of the line so overall it
looks like a surface the build quality
isn't quite up to par of what I've seen
on the surface pro 3 but it's pretty
close and it has a few nice things if
you really like this form factor that
maybe you want more</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
