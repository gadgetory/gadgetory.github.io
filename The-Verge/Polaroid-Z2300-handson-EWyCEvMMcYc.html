might expect from Polaroid it's a camera
that also prints so Polaroids been doing
these for a while now but this one is a
little bit nicer looking than their
previous stuff it's a little bit cheaper
it's about $150 and it's got some higher
resolution a little more powerful specs
than its previous efforts so the way
this works is that you load it with film
right here behind the screen and then
you pop it closed and turn it on it's
got a couple different settings it can
take 720p video that's just stored on a
card or on the internal memory or you
can take a still shot here so you can
take a picture here and then you'll
notice that it doesn't print
automatically instead you go to the menu
you can choose how many prints you want
and then you just make your selection it
takes
they say less than a minute to print
it's actually fairly fast but you do
have to wait for the whole thing to come
out it looks very similar to the
original Polaroid but it's in a
different form factor it's more
rectangular it doesn't have the white
border on it and you notice that the
screen colors go a little bit strange
that's because this is a pre-production
model and there's still a few bugs it's
not coming out until August 15th
although it's available for pre-order
so now you've got the whole picture and
it's got a sticky back and is using zinc
which is the company that partnered with
Polaroid for this so once again here's
the new Polaroids they're up for
pre-order right now and shipping August
15th</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
