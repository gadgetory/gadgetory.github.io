virgin mobile I'm David Pearson on this
show we bring you the best in consumer
electronics past present and future this
week we're taking a look at the new
wireless landscape you hate your phone
you hate your plan but what would it
really take for you to change for years
owning a cell phone has meant signing up
for a two-year contract huge hassles
every time you try to switch and
constant compromising the cheapest
carriers had the worst service and the
best phones only come with expensive
strings attached but timo we'll just
made a pretty aggressive play with a new
range of contract free smartphone plans
and a bunch of new phones to go with it
seventy dollars a month gets you
unlimited data talk and text and ninety
nine dollars plus twenty dollars a month
gets you an iphone 5 a galaxy s4 or an
HTC One the new plans would seem to
complete t-mobile's move away from
two-year contracts it's a bold strategy
in the other national carriers Sprint
AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have definitely taken
notice but continued levels newfound
swagger really changed the playing field
we sent me live to tell out into the
city to talk to people about their
carrier relationships and like all
relationships it gets complicated until
early 2011 the other way to get an
iphone the United States was to sign up
with AT&amp;amp;T in 2009 the only way to get
the motorola droid it's a sign of rising
back then you weren't shopping for a
carrier you're shopping for a phone but
now things would even nap all four major
US carriers have the iphone then they
all have the galaxy s3 and soon they'll
all have the galaxy s4 and the HTC One
so the question is what are you really
getting out of here
and why do we all seem to be in such
incredibly long relationships look Harry
idea sprint t-mobile I'm sumon t-mobile
18 teen virgin virgin my might I've
sprint right 18 I've tried them all they
all suck but sprint sucks the least to
my experience services all right um but
I mean I'm personally thinking about
switching over not sure not sure where
yet done why do you start with Timo
four-decade um I'm not kind of lazy how
long have you guys uh for about four
years now have you ever been in my
carrel a shin ship with a person for
four years yes has I done turned out in
tragedy how long have you had a teensy
um since like freshman year in high
school so okay yeah you don't know that
so I guess yeah yes right now like eight
years for five years it's been maybe
five years now t-mobile wants you to
switch the newly renegade carrier is
banking on an aggressive marketing
campaign and what it says are far
simpler plans for a flat fee and no
contract you get unlimited minutes
messaging and however much data you want
to pay for this t-mobile says there's no
two-year commitment required you can
leave whenever you want but even cheaper
prices don't seem to encourage people to
switch especially because when you do
the math t-mobile's prices aren't that
much cheaper but it's not the devices
and it's not the prices that keep you
committed to your carrier and no one
seems to be happy with that relationship
would you switch if the price and other
carrier is twenty percent over no not
really I don't want to go through the
hassle of like changing over 50 for
summer maybe how much cheaper twenty
percent to be honest I pay about ten
dollars a month for unlimited data and
limited texts and I've got three hours
of cops hey you you know I want you to
know I'm moving goodbye that's fine %
jeepers you leave no there a 50-percent
cheaper I consider it your wireless
carrier has become the longest
relationship in your life and all of us
seem to be settling when those two year
contract send the easiest thing to do is
just sign back up t-mobile seems to be
banking on people being fed up with AT&amp;amp;T
and the other more traditional carrier
plans and yes its plans are indeed more
transparent but at the end of the day
t-mobile's biggest competitor is
it's just apathy joining me now to talk
about all of this insanity is Nilay
Patel welcome back from bryant park we
survived I'm glad you made it it was
cold and sascha segan lead analyst to
PCMag Sasha thank you for being here
great to see so I want start with you so
t-mobile kind of went out on a limb this
week they did all kinds of crazy things
uh is it is it gonna work is this like
what t-mobile needed to be the biggest
and greatest carrier in the world is
this the right move for t-mobile I think
timo was making a lot of the right moves
but we shouldn't spend too much time or
spend all of our time thinking about the
pricing of the service plans because
t-mobile's always been cheaper than the
three other major carriers and um
t-mobile has been pushing towards this
prepaid angle for a while now but I
think one of the biggest deals was that
crazy guy in the magenta t-shirt and the
alexander mcqueen sneaker crazy is like
the biggest understatement ever by the
way he's he's trying to he's trying to
reposition he's trying to rebrand
t-mobile as the carrier that actually
gets your pain that understands how
frustrated you are with the wireless
companies and can relate to you and if
he can charge up t-mobile staff he can
make every experience a consumer has of
interacting with t-mobile and experience
where they really get how you feel as a
consumer that's when t-mobile wins well
so but I guess that's the big question
right is is like is customer service
then it are people gonna love their
carrier are people gonna love not having
a contract like is this something people
were clamoring for I feel like we the
three of us have been sitting here
saying wouldn't it be great if we didn't
have to be on contract but like do
people care it seems like you found a
little bit that they don't but maybe is
there a world in which people care i
think that switching costs are just too
high even for tmobile to say we're gonna
separate out the cost the device and the
cost of the service which they've sort
of done they've released made them
different line items which is
interesting right now you're on the
contract for the foot the dream i think
is to be able to buy any phone and then
open a window and have it say ATT has
the best service in this area and it'll
cost ten dollars r and verizon has
slightly crappier service I'll cost
eight dollars and you can just push the
button and then when you go somewhere
else and you're like man verizon service
here is better and you
push the button you're holding the phone
and you're switching costs goes to zero
then that's the dream that's that's I'm
actually buying whatever service is best
for me wherever and whatever some extent
we've had that right with these these
prepaid carriers like is this there
there are all these other options out
there but really talk about except the
prepaid carriers also don't make it very
easy to switch and we're not going to
see this ease of switching between
carriers for at least several more years
because of the technical blocks the
carriers are put in place to switch it
so so who are these carriers I guess is
is the big question like we have you
know we have the big four and then
there's all these other companies that
give you cell service and they've been
offering you know cheaper phones and
cheaper service that you pay ahead of
time so like why haven't they caught on
yet what what what makes it important
the t-mobile is doing this is that if
you look at a lot of the little guy's
virgin boost h2o wireless simple mobile
black wireless whatever those are just
like the least crazy names yeah there's
a Tenace crazy major yeah except for
except for metropcs cricket and US
cellular most of the other ones don't
actually run their own networks they are
using one of the big carriers networks
and that was always sprint right no
simple Mobile's t-mobile straight talk
is tmobile and ATT net 10 is ATT etc etc
but in a case they've all signed
contracts with the bigger carriers which
basically say which basically prevent
them from endangering the larger
carriers businesses okay okay these
little guys are structured to not be a
threat so what does that mean like you
get to you know too many customers and
then Sprint's like whoa whoa whoa they
just can't alter pricing okay so that
it's basically a shell game so that if
you have bad credit you don't become an
ATT customer right you go to go to one
of these prepaid carriers and they can
deal with the risk of having customers
with bad credit t-mobile saying they
don't care uh and I actually think the
device story for them is getting more
interesting because they you know they
have the s3 they're gonna have the s4
they have the one and the iphone and the
iphone in particular you can unplug it
from 18t and go put it on t-bones
network right and we had two million
people who have been there already
bought it and switched and before they
even but it's like gonna work now like
it's gonna work the newer versions of
the five will work on there faster 42
megabit 4G network it'll work on the LTE
network how much is that the devices
part of the other thing t-mobile
announced was like this big
ang of new devices that the devices are
just aunty okay the devices are just
what you need to be able to play at the
table with the big boys okay if you
don't have an iphone and a galaxy s4 and
an HTC One you're not one of the big
boys and you're not going to be one of
the big boys and you're relegated to the
second division right ok so the devices
are important but they don't give
t-mobile any advantage they just let
t-mobile play at the table mm-hmm so
then it is two mobiles advantage then
like is this a still don't know if this
is a compelling case to customers like
you don't have a contract I don't I
don't know that people are like leaping
out of their seats to go not have a
contract I guess cheaper is great and
but I said she was always brought in
their seats for and I think this is
where the pricing the phone's really
comes into play what people want is they
want a new phone faster right the
service is like whatever it's just it's
in the air it's like literally invisible
waves right it's like I pick up the
phone it gets some data that's great
what they want is a new phone every year
they can't get it and shot but John
Legere at the after the event made a
hint to wander reporters I forget who it
was I forget who wrote about this but he
hinted that they were thinking of maybe
some sort of subscription club right
that could accelerate your upgrades and
now that's a thought that's a thought
that gets a lot of power users on my
word I mean I think that's like that's
like overthinking it in a way they mean
that's great it's a cool idea but if you
look at the market for everything else
in the world it's like if you really do
separate the cost of the phone and the
cost of the service and enable a market
for devices to emerge then you'll get
cheaper things and to write in it they
have legitimately done that at this PM
right it's yeah it's fair to say they
you know they're still charging you
twenty dollars a month to continue to
use your phone please you guys right but
that's as hell the phone at any moment
and then the phone is paid off it's just
an installment plan you're just paying
for your furniture on layaway right yeah
right but that's right but like if you
look at the laptops for exam right right
laptops have just gotten cheaper over
time it's not because dell is when i
check out our subscription plans or
laptops it's just they're competing in
the market directly against each other
and cheaper things sell really well
unlocked phones seem to be the real
dream for people right we're in its kind
of what you were describing before like
i buy any phone put it on internet west
but we're not there at all yes neely
says that's the dream the dream
is this this fantasy we all have of the
European market which is not actually
the case in many European markets of you
buy a phone and then you can connect it
to a different carrier every month if
you want it okay but we can't do that
because of because of the various LTE
bands and CDMA vs gsm and all of this i
can use the word right yes cuz
John Legere use John majority yeah it's
alone all of this that the
carrier is bacon to the phones beyond
the plans right and I think that's
actually going away so I think what's
interesting is that as a teen T and
Verizon are getting pressure to increase
their like revenue per user they're
realizing that building custom phones
like they did in the past as bad idea
and that's why you're ending up with a
one on every carrier that's why you end
up with a note and that s for the iphone
and every carrier because demanding that
samsung value disarranged no no no
device I don't agree one hundred percent
I don't entirely agree there because
what Verizon wants to do is they want a
one and an s4 okay and they want a one
in an s4 with AT&amp;amp;T LTE frequency band
locked out oh no okay that 80's he wants
a one in an s4 with verizon's frequency
band locked out and these are very cheap
easy modifications for the manufacturer
to make and it maintains this lack of an
open i agree with you there i'm saying
the days of the galaxy fascinate and the
captivate the cap and gown today well
you're building these like you're
spending money to build custom variants
of phones free it's the markets gone
away from that because it's the carriers
know that the phone manufacturers are
doing a fine enough job competing and
building high-end devices so they don't
have to demand high end devices they
just say we'll take whatever you have
and as that happens the next logical
step is for these device manufacturers
to say look we want a real market now
and we're gonna start selling all my
phones in a real way so we'll so i think
that's a dis is HTC's next step right
they're never gonna compete in this game
against apple and samsung their next
step has to be to say to consumers screw
them like buy our phone it'll be cheaper
up front no contract go to 18 and
there's some proof that that works right
like google kind of proved it with the
nexus 4 in not on like a huge scale but
in enough of a sense that like they sell
out it would mediate leagues you think
people is subsidizing the next
for that's the thing Google can use its
other businesses the profit on its other
businesses to subsidize this phone which
loses money on hardware it's it's what
Amazon is doing with the kindle fire
unfortunately HTC does not have that
model open to them right these phones
right now still I mean they still
actually cost five hundred and fifty
dollars they cost 500 550 dollars and if
you see a good high end smartphone for
less it's being subsidized by something
that made you just not be the case so
that's what i think is we have a couple
of we have like this is t mobile's line
up + this little company called blue
here and I blue is you know just one in
a number of companies that are basically
selling unlocked you know straight off
the assembly line in China phones for a
lot less than they would are these just
are they cheaper like this phone is 299
dollars and has like a reasonable spec
sheet is it just cheaper because it's
worse like went how do we get to the
previous whether one is 299 not terrible
you know the thing but it doesn't cost
any more to make bad software than it
does good software right we thought of
Mormons court records matter it does it
does cost more to make the top or it
costs more to do the people or to hire
good do grammars to hire more testers to
get it better tested and better studied
yeah that cost more so I mean so then
how do we go through where our stock
well right well honest I mean that's
that's a fair question like how did we
get to the point where the HTC one is
two hundred ninety nine dollars unlock
we ever get there because just like why
don't they run stock because just like
the carriers are afraid of becoming dumb
pipes the manufacturers are afraid of
becoming commoditized yeah but how is it
I mean I was just come back to windows
yes a that phone is just unless
something so weird nice on it it's great
sorry I don't I like the clock bad
judgment I want you to know that's fine
I understand I'm not getting uh
well how does the windows pc market have
all those OEMs just shook windows the
way the phone market works is more
advantageous to the manufacturers then
the way the pc market works you can see
and you can see for instance Apple is
trying to drag it species into working
more like phones because that's more
advantageous to them iOS is more
advantageous to them than mac OS and
they're an apple is thinking oh we want
things to work more like iOS because
that's better for us so this phone
market is one where the manufacturers
and the carriers both have more strength
than the consume
right they don't want it to be more like
the pics are real market minutes and
that's well that's all the way back to
the start this is t-mobile's move is the
first baby step towards some kind of
real market where the price of the phone
doesn't affect the price of the service
it's not baked into the price of the
service now I don't know if the price
the service is compellingly cheaper
enough compared to AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon it
doesn't appear to be we actually we
actually did a big study we did we did a
huge survey called Readers Choice which
we do every year and we found out that
the issue with t-mobile and why people
are not switching to t-mobile is not
price they get great ratings for price
they've always had lower prices they
have lower prices then they have lower
prices now the reason people are not
switching to t-mobile is number one
customer service and number two network
quality and so all of this focus around
price you know t-mobile already had the
price if you want to change t-mobile's
fortunes can you change their customer
service in the perception of their
network quality so what I mean I guess
where does all this go in a year like
t-mobile is rolling out LTE and they
claim they're modernizing and changing a
lot of this stuff and then the service
is gonna be there so in a year is
t-mobile the number one carrier or they
still where they are have verizon and
AT&amp;amp;T move towards what t-mobile is doing
like what what changes now execs from
all the other carriers have said that
they are watching this very closely
because they don't want to be paying
subsidies actually okay because that's
that's money that goes automatically to
the manufacturers right so if this
really succeeds and t-mobile starts
gaining customers from sprint and AT&amp;amp;T
probably not from verizon because
Verizon customers are very network
centric then you could see the other
carriers trying to move more towards a
you pay for your phone we're not going
to subsidize this for you model but they
are still going to try as hard as they
can to prevent you from switching
carriers with your thumb and my phone is
still gonna be six hundred dollars it's
gonna be six hundred dollars it's gonna
be locked and it's gonna lock out
everyone else's Bam's but they're gonna
try and get rid of subsidies so things
are still super depressing just slightly
less depressing blending that's
depressing especially apparently if you
switch to t-mobile if their coverage is
good enough yeah fair enough I'll take
that thank you guys both so much for
being here really appreciate it and
we'll we'll talking on in a year when
everything is still at worst it's always
somewhat of a pleasure
I'll take it so in completely unrelated
news this week I got to spend the week
playing with the razor edge razors new
gaming tablet that they've introduced
like four different times but it's
finally coming out it's a real product
and it's a tablet for gamers who really
want to spend a whole lot of money to
play games on the subway there are three
parts to the razor edge really the first
is the tablet itself it's a fairly
normal looking Windows 8 tablet the
biggest difference the thing that sets
the edge apart is that it's huge it's
eight tenths of an inch thick making it
not only thicker than most tablets but
most recent laptops as well there's a
10.1 inch 1366 x 768 screen surrounded
by a pretty gigantic black bezel the
screen itself is okay it's a little low
res for device that's expensive but it's
bright and has good viewing angles the
only part that's rough is the
touchscreen it's just kind of
unresponsive often scrolling awkwardly
or taking three taps to do something
which really makes no sense on a device
that's powerful this is razor says the
only tablet with a discrete GPU inside a
separate graphics chip that is basically
required for any kind of serious gaming
along with the tablet itself there are
two accessories that are more or less
required to get the most out of the edge
one is the hundred-dollar docking
station which adds three USB ports and
an hdmi port to the edge the other
necessary accessories the two hundred
and fifty dollar gamepad controller it
adds a lot of weight to the edge but it
also adds all the controls you'd need to
play almost any game you get two analog
sticks and a d-pad plus all the buttons
and triggers you'd get on an xbox or
playstation controller as well it also
adds another battery into the edge which
it turns out you kind of need as a PC
the edge is more or less what you'd
expect it's powerful enough to do
anything you throw at it it's specs like
a high-end laptop and it performs like
one but let's be honest this isn't a
tablet that also happens to play games
it's a gaming tablet and I'm sort of
surprised to say this but it's a really
good one I played all sorts of games on
the edge and everything I tried was
playable not perfect when I cranked up
detail in Crysis 3 the framerate
definitely dipped enough that I could
tell it was stuttering but that's an
incredibly intense game and it was still
playable slightly less intense games
like borderlands 2 works really well and
relatively simple ones like NBA 2k13
were perfect here's the thing I don't
quite know how to feel about the razor
edge it's much more powerful than any
tablet on the market and if you're in
the market for a gaming tablet it's
really the only option but if you're
just a person who wants a
the edge cost a thousand dollars for the
lowest spec model and by the time you've
purchased the accessories and may be
upgraded to the more powerful Edge Pro
you're looking at $1,500 for a gaming
machine the edges performance is great
without being remarkable and if you're
spending this much money on a gaming
laptop you can probably do better for
your money but if you want a two-pound
gaming PC with a pretty cool controller
and you can afford it you really won't
be sorry you bought the edge that's it
for our show thank you so much for
watching thanks to my guess Sascha Segan
for being here thanks to nilay patel for
being all right as always head to the
verge calm for more on t-mobile and for
our full razor edge review spoiler alert
it plays games thanks so much for
watching we'll see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
