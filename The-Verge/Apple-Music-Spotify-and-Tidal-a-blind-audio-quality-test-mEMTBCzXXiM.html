with it all new questions about audio
quality
now all these major streaming services
stream at different rates
you have Apple music at 256 kilobits per
second AAC encoded then you have Spotify
at 320 kilobits per second mp3 encoded
and then you have title which streams
lossless at one point four megabits per
second so all of these services have
different streaming rates what does it
mean in the real world when we wanted to
find out so we invited a few of our
colleagues to come in here and do a
blind test let's see which one is really
best to run this test we play three
different songs across three different
genres hip-hop pop and classical we also
had a full range of audio snobbery in
the hot seat ranging from the casual
listener nearly indistinguishable to may
to the hardcore audiophile I can't tell
if like its sound profile these
headphones that I'm not used to -
digital audio converter yo no digital
they no matter what kind of music we
like one thing brings us together our
endless desire to describe music with
colorful adjectives crisp I guess I like
crunchy look crunchy the second one was
less gloomy in the bass there was like a
different ramp up funny on each of them
like less wishy-washy
like higher a little tinny ER but could
people actually tell what's better I
think I liked three best the first one
side of the worst the highs actually
clipped really high really aggressively
this is data never mind this is the data
this is the rail data the first one was
definitely the weakest three was the
best with maybe three sounding the best
cuz were the highs little better I would
assume that the third one we
the widest bandwidth this one's like
fine but it's like kind of like whatever
dude it says I'm thinking this is Apple
ah the one in the middle has my choice
for the top quality I felt like a second
mom with the best on the base was like
really pronounced and this last one is
sounded the best cool three was best
essence absolute trash so the first one
of the worst it sounds a little more
like complex than the person in the
horns anyway too crunchy I know she
likes country horns but I feel like
they're crunchy anyway she didn't want
it sounds good I think this one
definitely sounds the best more
definition across the rage no I think
third one was the best more more texture
more sound third one was definitely the
best of those three sounds me like the
second one would have been Flagg I had
the most definition in the base and then
highs if I had to say like I'd say the
last one was the best but I don't know
like it had thus complex range of things
going on the two sounded the lowest of
those second one was the worst
so what are we learned from this
experiment oh not very much it wasn't
that title with its lossless 1.4 megabit
streaming was winning every time in fact
it wasn't winning a majority of the time
now part of this might be that we're
using very average headphones connect to
a phone and if you have this on say a
home audio system with very expensive
components very expensive headphones
very expensive loudspeakers you would be
able to tell the difference but if
you're just using this as a mobile audio
service a mobile streaming service it
doesn't seem to matter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
