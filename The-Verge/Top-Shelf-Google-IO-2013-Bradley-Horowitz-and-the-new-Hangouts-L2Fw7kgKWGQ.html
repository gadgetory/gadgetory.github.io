Pierce and we're here in sunny windy San
Francisco for google i/o it's Google's
annual developer conference where people
who work for Google people who make
Google Apps and people who love Google
get together and hang out it's Google's
biggest event every year and it's where
they announce all sorts of new products
this year it started Wednesday morning
with what was kind of an insane keynote
it was more than 6,000 people and it
took more than three and a half hours
Google i/o keynote covered seemingly
everything the company is even slightly
involved in from big splashy products to
the midea stand grittiest in his api's
it started with a lot of developer love
google offered new ways to build
optimize and sell your apps there's
multiplayer gaming notification sync
cloud messaging and a whole lot more
there's even a Play Store specifically
for education those got big cheers from
developers but they're not really part
of Google's products yet then came the
new products from every corner of Google
there was no new version of Android or
new Android hardware other than a
surprise showing of a samsung galaxy s4
with stock Android but we did get a new
Google Music app along with the new
google music all access it's like
Spotify plus your own music collection
in the cloud and we really like it so
far there's also hangouts Google's
attempt to unify messaging across all
your devices through google plus there's
an app for iOS and Android plus desktop
messaging that lets you chat and video
call from any device we're liking that a
lot too hangouts is part of a bigger
change for Google Plus which reorients
the service really around your photos
you upload your photos to Google+ a huge
resolutions and Google servers analyze
them to organize them and even make them
better betters may be a debatable term
here though Google's best demo of the
day may have just been searched you can
now talk to your computer about where
you should eat dinner or how old Patrick
Stewart is your computer will even guess
what you mean by what time is my flight
and it'll show it all to on Google's
redesign maps which adds some predictive
functionality while stripping away all
of the chrome and interface the map as
they said is the UI it was a lot even
for three and a half hours and even
excluding the time Larry Page told us
all to go to Burning Man
that's not all there was a tie oh and so
we sent Casey Newton to find out the
rest of it when most people think of
Google i/o they think of the keynote
presentation and all the big
announcements that get made there
there's also a whole show floor it's
full of Googlers who are showing off
google stuff and third-party developers
who are using google products and
services to make cool things of their
own one of the things that's cool about
IO is that Google brings out some of the
gear that they generally keep under
wraps here on the show floor we've seen
the street view trike the street view
trolley and even the street view
snowmobile all things that Google uses
to make maps
this is the leap motion controller
paired with the new google map I'm
feeling very much like a supervillain
right now the scrolling is really smooth
it's very responsive you have to move
much less than you might think in order
to zoom in and zoom out so I'm actually
I've been zooming maybe a little bit
more than i would want but i imagine
that with practice you get much better
at kind of controlling the environment
one of my favorite things here google
employees hacked together for blimps
using raspberry pi socket i/o servo a
logitech webcam and now the blimp is
going all over the show floor it's
taking pictures and it's live streaming
video Google even built a special web
app so that they can go in take pictures
live in real time one of the big
takeaways from yesterday's keynote is
that Google is trying to build the
computer from Star Trek that can answer
any question so we're in here playing
with a special preview build up some new
search features that they're working on
the Wi-Fi is really crowded in here but
we're gonna see what it can do ok Google
how old is Patrick Stewart Patrick
Stewart is 72 years old ok Google show
me things to do in San Jose
you are popular attractions in San Jose
ok Google will you marry me marriage is
a huge decision these results from the
web might help I'm playing map diving
this is a chrome experiment built by the
nice folks over at instruments they've
created a chain of seven computers at
each one attached to a different display
and they're rendering a game using live
tiles from google maps and I'm
controlling it terribly with my arms
right now this whole thing is running in
the browser using a 3d depth sensor to
control the movement it looks gorgeous
and I wish I were better at it alright
three out of 51 stars not bad so
obviously there's a lot going on here
but the big question Google hasn't
really answered is how it all works
together so heat dies down with the guy
who knows it's Bradley Horowitz the vp
of product for google plus we have
questions so what I want to know that is
really the the two big pillars of what
happened with Google+ this week were
messaging and photos why why those two
things well I think there's an
opportunity to do something really
significant and special in both those
categories for messaging is you heard
Vic say there's been lots of point
solutions over 50 years right and the
landscape is there such that we all have
devices we carry around whether that's
phones in our pocket or maybe glass
eventually but there's an opportunity
now that you could literally reach
another human on the planet with very
little impediment but we've gotten in
our own way protocols operating systems
you know media types photos video it
just doesn't work right there's little
pockets of success and you've seen some
of these that have just nailed a single
use case have taken off dramatically it
recently apps like exact yeah like
there's incredible viral potential for
things that actually
execute on this and do well but there's
no product that works across media types
that's good for everything from text to
photos to video to emoji people love
emoji people of emoji we've got 850 in
hangouts I mean anything you can think
of and then some we have an opportunity
to distribute this widely between you
know things like android and chrome and
gmail we can actually put this in the
pocket or in the hand of every user on
the planet and so we saw an opportunity
with messaging to really get this right
we've seen tremendous uptake and love
for hangouts it's sort of the breakout
success of Google+ we we saw that we
could take what was special about that
really connecting people and make it
ubiquitous to give it to everybody and
give it for free that's another
important part of this if you're really
going to be successful you literally
have to give it to people so it is the
advantage there just the scale that you
have these said you're able to bring it
to everyone on the planet is that just
because you just by nature of being
Google you have this reach that none of
these other apps I think that that's not
necessarily new like we've always had an
opportunity to help users get our
products but what we haven't had was the
product that delivered on this promise
of across media types one-to-one
one-to-many cross operating systems now
we have that product we've got something
worth sharing with the world and that's
really exciting and so all of these
features are designed to in some way
keep me in Plus which is you know
obvious that's sort of your goal um but
so how does Google Plus is also it seems
like it's two different things it's the
spine as you've called it of all of the
other Google products and it's also its
own thing so where does with all this
new stuff how does Google Plus sort of
continue to influence the rest of
Google's products well one of the things
I loved about the epic three and a half
plus our keynote was sitting at there's
a good word for it and sort of counting
the number of times that the other non
google plus parts of the the keynote
mentioned Google+ and Google Plus
identity if you look at how tightly it's
woven into the Android story you know
that's one example music you know
everywhere you can see Google+ as the
foundational layer that the company is
betting on to understand people their
relationships their interests and serve
them better so what about things like on
one of the things we like about services
like spotify and rdio is is that they
have this social layer where i can say
you know here's what my friends are
listening to and here's playlist my
friends may that i might want to listen
to do you imagine google+ being the
backbone of something like that as well
even for you know music and there's lots
of other opportunities for what Google
is trying to do with offense and all
yeah sorts of stuff like my friends
gonna be a bigger part of my experience
absolutely absolutely and that is our
stated intention with Google+ is that
every product that Google can be better
by by dint of you using your own data in
your own service and so whether it's
ride-sharing for maps you're the ability
to see your friends on a map and you
know there's been lots of again lots of
point solutions that have sort of taken
off in as various domains but we really
feel we have an opportunity to get this
right and return a tremendous amount of
value to users and music is a great
example media in general is something
that is very social in nature and
there's huge value to be had there and
so I have to ask we've had one sort of
issue as we've used hangouts and I'm
curious about this so we have everyone
at the verge has you at least two gmail
accounts and often many and we know
that's a fairly common problem among
people so there's now this sort of odd
identity issue within Google+ where it's
like how do you find me and you know if
I search for Billy's on the camera over
here I got i get like six different
answers so how do you how do you sort of
manage people's identity on google glum
we're not doing this well and we feel it
acutely at Google all of us has to at
least two accounts right we have our
personal gmail we have our Google
corporate account and we need to do a
better job I mean that's the short
answer is it's not you it's us and we're
working on it actively we feel your pain
turns out to be a relatively complicated
and subtle problem anytime you're
dealing with issues of identity and
authentication and accounts and account
ownership in some cases a organizing
entity
the account and it gets very complicated
not as simple as just meshing to the
simplest gnashing things together we'd
have done it you know a long time ago if
it were that simple it actually turns
out to be pretty subtle and nuanced but
rest assured we're working on it and
again I think it is a pain point we feel
acutely and we're working on it as hard
and fast as we can and so I guess what
about Google+ as opposed to something
like Twitter or Facebook where people
use these they have huge numbers of
users and you offer all on hand
something different but on the other
hand something sort of competitive with
both of those how do you do see those as
playing together or are you competing
tangentially in a way that they can all
work together like how do you are you
competing with that's google i think the
real opportunities are not about
competitors Larry had a great line
yesterday I think paraphrasing he said
something like we need to build products
that don't yet exist I think that's what
we're doing with something like hangouts
there is no product that does all that
hangouts does there's point solutions
that do this or that something like
photos the opportunity to take advantage
of the Google scale infrastructure to do
something great for people is something
that does not exist and is a relatively
valuable feature that's hard to
replicate so we're focused on bringing
these things that are not me to features
that clone existing products or other
networks those networks may be great and
they may have use cases that carry on
but that's not where our focus is and
it's not the kinds of things we shipped
yesterday and will continue you're
looking at the the bigger picture and
sort of how everything plays together we
really are you listen to Larry talk and
I really recommend if you've only got
you know 20 minutes to digest the
keynote spend them all on Larry's
comments at the end our products you'll
see in the market and you'll get to know
them that way but it's worth you know
listening to Larry he's got a vision for
what we can do with Google that will
change the world change people's lives
improve people's lives
and it's a powerful vision it's a
long-term vision you know it's not about
a quick fix it's about what can we do
that's really providing lasting durable
value to people that really gives them
and improve quality of life and so
that's the way he thinks about it that's
the way we think about it it's really
much less about competition it's about
these products that don't yet exist and
haven't even been imagined that's where
the real opportunity is Bradley thank
you so much my pleasure appreciate thank
you that's it for our show thanks so
much for watching thanks to Casey Newton
and Bradley Horowitz for being here
we'll be back next week from Seattle
