before the European Parliament to
testify about Facebook's impact on
society from data privacy to elections
but the format was different from what
most American viewers are probably used
to instead of a back and forth between
Zuckerberg and the politicians all the
members of the Parliament asked their
questions first
Zuckerberg took notes and at the end of
the meeting he picked out the questions
he wanted to respond to then he promised
he'd get back to the group with the rest
the entire thing was a little
frustrating even to the legislators and
eventually dissolved into a mess I asked
you six yes and no questions I got not a
single answer so thank you again for was
one question raised by a giver who said
and we did that's linked to my question
the problem is the timing okay I'll make
sure we follow up and get you answers to
those
despite that the European legislators
asked some pretty good questions and
weren't afraid to be a little aggressive
you have to ask yourself well how you
will be remembered as one of the three
big internet giants together with Steve
Jobs I should say and Bill Gates who
have enriched or world and all societies
or at the other hand in fact the genius
will create a digital monster that is
destroying all democracies and of
societies Solomon and I'm asking you
today very very clearly that would you
accept that today Facebook is not a
platform for all ideas that is operated
in partially the most pressing questions
are Coburg faced was whether Facebook
was a monopoly during last month's
congressional hearings Senator Lindsey
Graham asked whether Zuckerberg could
name a competitor to Facebook and a
couple of European legislators brought
that issue up again but with a more
pointed thread attached would you
consider your company as a monopoly I
think it is time to discuss breaking
Facebook's monopoly because it's already
too much power in only one hand can you
convince me not to do something you
cannot convince him because it's
nonsense naturally you have to give the
example of Twitter you have given the
example I think also Google as some of
your competitors
but it's like somebody who has a
monopoly in making cars is saying look I
have a monopoly making cars but there is
no problem you can take a plane you can
take a train when it came time to answer
Zuckerberg said that he didn't think
that was true at all and generally
dismissed the concern we exist in a very
competitive space where people use a lot
of different tools for communication or
the average person uses about eight
different tools for communication
ranging from all sorts of private
messaging up to more broadcast mediums
to things where they're communicating
with groups of people and and all their
friends at once so from where I sit it
feels like there are new competitors
coming up every day there are
competitors that reach tens and hundreds
of millions of people and we're
constantly needing to evolve our service
in order to stay relevant and serve
people well so that feels like it's a
competitive environment where there are
many choices that people have a number
of politicians suggested that even if it
isn't time to break up a monopoly
Facebook needs to be aggressively
regulated are you ready to completely
comply with the new regulation in Europe
in the next three days when you said
that the regulation will be implemented
in spirit what does that mean exactly
in response Zuckerberg offered what's
become a canned reply I don't think the
question here is whether or not there
should be regulation I think the
question is what is the right regulation
but so far these bright regulations
remain elusive and as one legislator
pointed out early in the hearing
self-regulation has not worked well in
the past it's a little bit like with the
banks in the 2006 2007 2008 they said
also in are we gonna do self-regulation
don't bother no no we're gonna do it
ourselves the reality is that they
didn't do them themselves and it was
needed to have tough regulation then
there was the question of how Facebook
stores data especially of people who
aren't even on Facebook otherwise known
as their shadow profiles
how can non users stop Facebook
collecting their data and what do you do
they're not done on Facebook's data do
you commercialize it and given you do
that is it morally acceptable
you think in your opinion to collect nan
Yunnan Facebook users data without them
know what you do with it and Zuckerberg
nearly concluded without even mentioning
these is there anything else separate
profiles
shadow profiles didn't seem to want to
talk about shadow profiles at all and
changed the subject pretty quickly if
you're not a Facebook user how do you
stop that day to be transferred on a
security side we think it's important to
keep it to protect people in our
community were there any other themes
that we want to get through and there's
what some these hearings are happening
largely because people are worried about
election meddling on Facebook whether
through fake news propaganda or through
Cambridge analytical data siphoning this
was lost on legislators with Facebook
commit to one eradicate all remaining
fake accounts by the end of the quarter
and be systematically prevent the
creation of new ones moving forward
Zuckerberg continued to say there's no
quick fix to this problem will never be
perfect on this you know our adversaries
especially on the election side people
are trying to interfere will have access
to some of the same AI tools that we
will but that's a pretty obvious
statement the details are what matter
and Facebook is still just talking up as
two favorite weapons moderators and AI
the game plan is a combination of
building more AI tools to identify fake
accounts that are trying to interfere
and take them down like we did in the
French presidential election our vision
for how we should manage the system is
going to move from one of reactive
management as people in our community
flag things to one where we're poor
proactively having systems look at the
content flag things for tens of
thousands of people to review and we're
already making significant progress in
doing that and there were a lot of other
questions which were never answered
these included broad questions about
whether Facebook can really keep
people's data safe after Cambridge
analytic oh he's Cambridge analytic an
isolated case of would you say it's a
top of the iceberg but also extremely
specific ones about how quickly
Facebook's scrubs data that a user asks
to be deleted if people want to come off
Facebook
how quickly and under what conditions
will the data be fully removed or
whether Facebook would work with
antitrust regulators to prove it's not a
monopoly would you or would you
cooperate with the European antitrust
authorities to examine it and to open
your books so that we can see if yes or
no there is a monopole Zuckerberg
promised to give written answers to all
these questions but that's the same line
he used during the u.s. congressional
hearings we don't know when the answers
will come how thorough they'll be or if
Zuckerberg will give a straight answer
to the toughest demands can you
guarantee the disease Europeans that
another scandal will not happen in three
six or nine months time is the only way
of preventing Facebook affecting my data
to avoid the internet altogether and
after watching legislators ask good
difficult questions about Facebook that
feels like a huge wasted opportunity is
Facebook really taking its
responsibilities more seriously will
lawmakers start trying to regulate it or
will we just keep hearing this same
speech over and over so the fact that
maybe you have less control or no
control about your own company for the
moment because you have to apologize now
I think in turtle you apologize now
fifteen or sixteen times the last decade
in 2003 you've started every year you
have one or other wrongdoing or problem
with Facebook and and you have to face
the reality and to say sorry and to say
that you're gonna fix it are you capable
to fix it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
