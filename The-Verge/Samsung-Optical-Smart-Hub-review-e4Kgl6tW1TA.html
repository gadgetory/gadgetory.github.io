is the Samsung optical Smart Hub it's an
external optical disc drive that also
streams content you can burn cds and
dvds or just play things back and it
works pretty seamlessly just like an
internal drive would but on the other
hand it can actually stream most of its
contents so you can plug in any hard
drive to the back of the device and
stream its contents off of here through
DLNA technology or you can use Wi-Fi and
it connects directly to ios and android
apps so you can easily find any files
that you have saved to a USB drive and
then you can stream it or actually
download it to your device you can also
send files in the other direction which
is pretty cool you can back things up
straight from the Samsung app on your
phone or your tablet right to a USB
Drive or you can actually burn them to a
disc wirelessly it'll first back things
up to a USB Drive and then burn a disc
for you of whatever files you want but
the really cool feature that it has is
actually the ability to stream a DVD so
you put the disc into the drive here in
this case I have usual suspects and then
you hit DVD player and it actually just
starts streaming the DVD like it
normally would and you get all of the
options you get subtitles you get
chapter select you get some of the extra
features and it just works really really
seamlessly the app itself is buggy it's
a really early version but for the most
part it gets the job done overall the
optical Smart Hub does a number of cool
things and the DVD streaming in
particular is pretty awesome but the the
interface and the setup are both so
complicated and so difficult that it
becomes really hard to use and
especially at the price 129 99 you can
just get a device like a pogoplug for
the streaming that you want to do and
get an external optical drive if that's
what you need both of those will be a
little simpler to use and probably
perform better than this which tries to
do everything and doesn't really succeed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
