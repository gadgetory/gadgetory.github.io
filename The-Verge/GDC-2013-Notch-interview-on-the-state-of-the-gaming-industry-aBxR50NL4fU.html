at GDC 2013 I'm sitting on a white couch
somewhere in the future the future of
gaming I'm joined by markus persson but
you might know better as not the creator
of Minecraft thanks for joining us
oh that was so GDC is a lot about the
future of gaming you know you had EA
introduced battlefield 4 here this week
which was unusual but the story has
really been a lot about indie games free
games casual games what do you think
that says about the industry in 2013
that's such a focus I think it's it's a
it's to me it gives me hope for the
future because kind of gaming goes in
trends and for a bit worth - long
stretch there was a focus on the huge
productions of kind of play ones games
that they only played one time and they
had huge budgets and now that the games
are getting a little bit smaller young I
think there we can get some more
experimental games going you you're you
got minecraft on the Xbox 360 which was
kind of a feat do you think minecraft
would have existed at all if you had
tried to go directly to console from the
beginning
no definitely not it's the game was kind
of - out there - to be kind of friend
want to ever like bet on like that um
you know obviously Xbox Playstation
Nintendo aren't the only platforms
coming out Booya for example which
you're gonna have your name etched on
when it comes out it's gonna be is
getting a lot of momentum why did you
back that project basically because I
think they're more consoles - better
because if there's more competition then
it might get more open
seems like coals are getting more open
which is really cool and yeah you've
been kind of a big presence on
Kickstarter you know funding great
projects what do you think about
Kickstarter in terms of the future of
game development do you think it's the
industry is going to shift towards that
kind of model being the primary way that
games get funded and developed I cannot
hope not because it's very frontloader
the consumers take all the risk which is
not really nice to consumers I think the
main benefits is that smaller studios
who want to do something slightly larger
can get some initial funding and that we
can have larger studios develop
Gamze internally without having get
publisher money so they can focus more
on actual quality of the game so it's
more directed to the fans of the genre
you are minecraft obviously started on
the PC and you've made some disparaging
comments about where Windows is headed
Windows 8 in particular and infamously
you refused to certify minecraft for
Windows 8 so what do you think about
valve steam box and kind of the push
towards Linux as a as a gaming operating
system I have like this yearly ritual
cannabidiol try to install Linux to try
to use it it never really takes and it
never really works for me some reason I
think if lame excuse to the point where
it's actually like more
consumer-friendly than Windows and that
would be really really good are you
gonna continue to develop for Windows
then and the meantime and not focus on
Linux at all or are you gonna try to do
things in parallel I think we're gonna
try to make sure that what we do is kind
of cross-platform so that they get a
kind of desktop version it's like Linux
Windows and Mac there's also a lot of
excitement you know beyond consoles
about new ways of interacting with with
games you know new peripherals we have
leap motion coming out we have new
virtual reality stuff Gabe Newell has
talked a lot about biometric feedback
and what are you as a developer most
excited about what you want to get your
hands on for me right now it's the
oculus rift definitely it's I kind of
was one of those kids growing up to hope
that VR would become a thing and then
you have to try that we're shooting
dinosaurs gamed was up it was really
horrible dental nightmare yes but what
oculist actually kind of passed the
threshold of being not good to actually
being good we're kind of the more use
the MOR versus immersive gets and you
you were one of the first to receive an
early kid right now so you've been
playing around with it a lot yeah I mean
minecraft is coming to the rip sooner
that's that's a up to jam so try to
leave those decision saying but I have
been trying to play around with make
adding oculus rift support to the Java
native libraries but I've kind of been
too lazy to actually do there actually
have a lifting of it but it's kind of a
pet project in office at the moment
Mojang is big now minecraft is huge do
you still feel like an indie developer
no not in the service
it depends on what you mean by in the
developer I mean we are independent they
own that we tried to make the games we
want to make for the sake of making fun
games and not necessarily just to make a
profit but where for me in the game
developer more meals like the garage
developer someone sitting at home just
making games that are pure passion and
in that sense of no we're not really in
there
so garage developers that are working
now I mean knowing what you know what
would you tell them if they're starting
out today they're making the next
Minecraft from their from their bedroom
I think it's just make games for
yourself and try to have a critical eye
to what you do so don't just make
something and kind of pat yourself on
the back but actually try to look at
what it is and how it works and why it
doesn't work and what works and iterate
on that but if you yourself genuinely
liked the game that there's gonna be
other people who liked it as well thank
you so much Marcus Becky</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
