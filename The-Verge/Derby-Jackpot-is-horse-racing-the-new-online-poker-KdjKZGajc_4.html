or illegal but there's one form of
online gambling that's actually
completely sanctioned horse racing is
kind of been associated with older
aristocratic type people it's not that
hip in industry but there's a start-up
in new york city that's hoping to apply
the zynga model to make horse racing
cool
Jerry jackpot it is a social game that
makes it easy to bet watch and win real
money on live horse racing the only
legal way to gamble online the United
States a lot of people are surprised you
can gamble with real money on the
internet they think of poker and they
think of the other things that were that
have gone up and down and where it made
a lot of news in the past five years but
horse racing's been the only legal way
to gamble online the US for at least 10
years it's not a magic formula because
the ability to do this is existed for a
long time no horse racing has been
recognized in many states as a legal
form of gambling and actually back in
the 70s and the 80s they started to
accept telephone wagering and then as
the internet came along the permissible
telephone we drink expanded into
internet wagering prayer mutual horse
wagering means you're not betting
against the house all the players are
actually betting against each other so
all the funds go into one pool and the
players who are betting set the odds
it's not a company built around a
loophole because it's never been a
loophole there's the interstate horse
racing Act which is a federal statute
which recognizes the position that horse
racing has had in the most states in the
United States as a legal form of
wagering and it allows it to happen
across state lines and that's been going
on since the 1970s we're like a gas
station that sells lottery tickets we're
not the house we get a small percentage
of every bet place through our site and
we want all of our players to win
because it's a more fun experience
Derby jackpot first went into beta a
couple of months ago so right now it's
in the closed beta tonight's kind of
reprieve you letting more people in to
play and test it out for it it goes it
goes public at the beginning of next
year so anyone will be able to join
inside the industry has been looking for
a way to attract younger betters but the
problem has always been it's been a
bunch of old guys like me trying to sit
around and figure out a way we can
interest younger people and utilize the
Internet in doing so and so when they
first contacted me as someone who is
knowledgeable from a legal perspective
as well as knowledgeable from an
industry perspective my reaction was
this is the panacea this is what the
industry has been looking for and you
guys are doing it the right way there's
some people who are betting in the other
system and they're handicapping and they
they're trying to get an edge to win or
they think they have an edge because
they have a system to win but then you
have the other people who go to the
track for one day year they go to the
Derby or the Preakness or the belmont
stakes and they go and they pick their
favorite name or they pick a horse that
looks really good and they just do it
for the fun of the game and that's our
player the real test is probably going
to be next month because there's a big
industry conference in December that
they're going to be demonstrating that
and everybody from the industry will be
there and that's when you'll get a true
reaction but everybody that we presented
to to this point in time in the industry
they're very excited about it they debut
once again recognize it could be the
savior to the industry they probably
don't understand how it works because
they're all guys like me but they
recognize it as being the prospective
savior for the industry
