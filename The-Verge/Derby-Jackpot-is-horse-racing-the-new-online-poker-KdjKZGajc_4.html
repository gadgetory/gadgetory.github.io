gambling are illegal but there's one
form of online gambling that's actually
completely sanctioned horse-racing has
kind of been associated with older
aristocratic type people it's not that
hip in industry but there's a start-up
in New York City that's hoping to apply
the Zynga model to make horse-racing
pool
very jackpot it is a social game that
makes it easy to bet watch and win real
money on live horse-racing
the only leave away to gamble online the
United States a lot of people are
surprised you can gamble with real money
on the internet they think of poker and
they think of the other things that were
that have gone up and down and where it
made a lot of news in the past five
years but horse racing's been the only
legal way to gamble online the US for at
least ten years it's not a magic formula
because the ability to do this as
existed for a long time no horse racing
has been recognized in many states as a
legal form of gambling and actually back
in the 70s and the 80s they started to
accept telephone wagering and then as
the internet came along the permissible
telephone wagering expanded into into
this wager fair mutual horse wagering
means you're not betting against the
house all the players are actually
betting against each other so all the
funds go into one pool and the players
who are betting set the odds it's not a
company built around a loophole because
it's never been a loophole there's the
interstate horse-racing Act which is a
federal statute which recognizes the
position that horse-racing has had in
the most states in the United States as
a legal form of wagering and it allows
it to happen across state lines and
that's been going on since the 1970s
we're like a gas station that sells
lottery tickets
we're not the house we get a small
percentage of every bet place through
our site and we want all of our players
to win because it's a more fun
experience
Jovie jackpot first went into beta a
couple of months ago so right now it's
in a closed beta tonight's kind of
reprieve you letting more people in to
play and test it out for it it goes it
goes public at the beginning of next
year so anyone will be able to join
inside the industry has been looking for
a way to attract younger betters but the
problem has always been there's been a
bunch of old guys like me trying to sit
around and figure out a way we can
interest younger people and utilize the
Internet in doing so and so when they
first contacted me as someone who is
knowledgeable from a legal perspective
as well as knowledgeable from an
industry perspective my reaction was
this is the panacea this is what the
industry has been looking for and you
guys are doing it the right way there's
some people who are betting and they
have their system and they're
handicapping and they they're trying to
get an edge to win or they think they
have an edge because they have a system
to win but then you have the other
people who go to the track for one day
year they go to the Derby or the preach
minutes or the Belmont Stakes then they
go and they pick their favorite name or
they pick a horse that looks really good
and they just do it for the fun of the
game and that's our player the real test
is probably going to be next month
because there's a big industry
conference in December that they're
going to be demonstrating that and
everybody from the industry will be
there and that's when you'll get a true
reaction but everybody that we presented
to to this point in time in the industry
they're very excited about it they they
once again we recognize it could be the
savior to the industry they probably
don't understand how it works because
they're all guys like me but they
recognize it as being the prospective
Savior for the industry
