with augmented reality on their
smartphones in fact if you play Pokemon
go you already kind of know how this
works but there's a new advanced AR out
there and while it only exists on one
phone right now it has the potential to
dramatically change the way we interact
with the world through our smartphones
it's called tango formerly known as
project tango and it's made by Google so
right now tango is only available on one
smartphone this Lenovo fab 2 pro a
500-dollar 6.4 inch smartphone which
also happens to be Lenovo's first
smartphone in the US but this isn't
about the phone this is about how Google
and Lenovo have taken this advanced 3d
sensing technology and crammed it into
something that is still technically a
device you can fit in your hands or your
pocket the result is something that
feels a little bit experimental a little
bit half-baked but at the same time kind
of mind-blowing there's a lot of
hardware that goes into making tango
work and a lot of that has to do with
cameras in the phone normally when you
think of cameras in a smartphone you
think okay I snap a photo and then I
forget about it but in this case three
of the four cameras on the fab 2 Pro are
advanced sensors they'll allow the phone
to see and map and remember the world
around you there's a 16 megapixel RGB
camera a wide-angle fisheye camera and
an infrared emitter not to mention the
accelerometer a gyroscope a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 650 to processor that was
customized to support tango a big
battery and everything else that goes
into the phone so if regular AR creates
a relatively flat or static layer of
digital information on the world in
front of you then tango creates a much
more immersive environment it's fisheye
camera allows the phone to understand
your positioning in a room and it's IR
emitter this little red blinking light
on the back sends infrared beams to an
object around you and then lets the
phone interpret distances so when you're
playing a game or let's say you're
measuring the wall in a room the phone
is actually seeing and measuring and
remembering the information in the
I'm kind of in the same way that you are
here's an example you can actually run
apps like home improvement app or a home
decorating app on the fab 2 Pro with
tango and you can play something like a
lamp or a couch or a picture frame in a
room and see how it would actually look
in real life there are also some apps
that seem pretty silly but are kind of
fun like a our pets or bubbles there's a
game called world that lets you plant
digital flowers and water them with
digital clouds and do all kinds of cool
stuff and you can easily see the
educational opportunities with tango -
the dinosaur is among us app which was
created by the American Museum of
Natural History lets you put dinosaurs
in your real-life environment and even
lets you hang little framed
illustrations on your walls but it's
also worth noting the phone gets really
warm after even just 20 minutes of using
tango apps right now there are only
around 35 tango apps in the Google Play
Store which isn't many and based on my
experience the ones that would have been
the most useful like the Wayfarer
furniture app or the Lowe's home
improvement app for the ones that felt
the least intuitive and the most buggy I
can't tell you how many virtual swipes
and taps and gestures it took to just
try to place virtual furniture no room
to see what it would look like which is
really what the promise of these apps
are so tango is a mixed bag but I will
say this
most people who has showed these apps to
kind of have their minds blown and it's
only the first tango phone so there's
room for improvement I personally would
not run out and buy this phone just for
this but this technology if and when it
makes its way into other phones has the
potential to be a real game-changer plus
no air headset required
hi kitties and crammed it into something
that's still there's a cat hair on my
phone cute a that actually have the
potential to be most useful sorry
I like how I apologize for the door
sorry about the door it's kind of a game
changer I mean it really has the
potential to interact to just up</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
