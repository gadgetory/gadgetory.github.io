own company it's unlikely but not
impossible
I'm Jake Castro naka and this is 90
seconds on the verge which is so we are
going to have an overall gaming strategy
so it's not as obvious as you might
think
would you support him if he wanted to
spend on absolutely okay
that's news that's Microsoft co-founder
Bill Gates responding to a question of
whether the company would consider
spinning off Xbox and Bing in two
separate companies Gates was quick to
call being a quote fundamental
technology and core business but he was
more ambiguous about Xbox deferring to
new CEO Satya Nadella to be clear that
no way means that Microsoft is thinking
about spinning off Xbox or even that
Gates himself thinks it's a good idea
but according to Washington Post earlier
this year investors have been asking for
Microsoft to spin off non-essential
properties including Xbox CEO contender
Stephen Elop was reportedly considering
breaking apart Xbox and Bing - if he got
the top job Elop is now the head of
Microsoft's Hardware division since
becoming CEO Nadella has in multiple
times that Microsoft must thrive in a
quote mobile-first cloud-first world
one of the four things that we've got to
realize is that this business does not
really respect tradition the Xbox is
first introduced in 2001 and while sales
of the new console lag behind Sony's
PlayStation 4 it remains a very
important brand for Microsoft even so
Gates's comments are still likely to end
up as fuel for the investors fire for
more on Microsoft check out the verge
coming up we take a look back at 2001 a
rock Odyssey finally Bill Gates hooked
up with the rock smelled Rajskub
