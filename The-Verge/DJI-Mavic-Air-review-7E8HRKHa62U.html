packed with features
and modes like the ones you just saw.
And you might have
already seen some of them
on the smaller DJI Spark
and its predecessors,
the Mavic Pro and the Pro Platinum.
In fact, the $800 Mavic Air
shares a lot of similarities
with both of these drones,
but this video is not really
a side-by-side comparison.
It's more about whether
the Mavic Air is suitable
for more serious photo and video work.
Before we start flying,
we'll have to spend some time
talking about the size of this thing.
Portability is what the Air is all about.
It is considerably smaller
than the Mavic Pro,
but it's also smaller than the Spark,
at least in its folded state.
The fact that Spark
couldn't fold made it a lot
harder to carry around unless
you used the provided case.
Unlike the Pro and the Spark,
the Air actually feels a lot sturdier.
It feels like something
I can fold, put it in
my backpack, and not
have to worry about it,
especially when the camera and the gimbal
are way more protected than
they were on the Mavic Pro.
Granted, when you include
all the accessories
and the batteries, the Spark
is still a more portable
setup as a whole, but you'll
be sacrificing in image
quality, flight time,
and smoother footage.
Speaking of the camera, it
has a three-axis gimbal,
compared to two axes you
can find in the Spark,
making the Air a lot better for videos.
It also shoots 4K videos
up to 30 frames per second
and has a 12 megapixel still camera.
You can also do slow motion
up to 120 frames per second,
and of course that one is 1080p.
The biggest difference between
the Mavic Pro and the Air
is the fact that the Air shoots
at 100 megabytes per second
and the Pro shoots at 60
megabytes per second bit rate.
Now without getting into
explaining what bit rate is,
it results in a lot crisper
footage with a lot more
data packed into it, so
most people won't really
notice a difference between the two,
but it's good knowing that
there is an image quality bump.
One thing to consider, though,
especially if you're into
more serious commercial
work, is that the sensor size
on all these three drones
is exactly the same.
It's also smaller than
the one that you get
on the Phantom 4 so if you're into that
you might want to skip
the Mavic line entirely.
Also, the Mavic Air has
something that's called
an APAS, or the Advanced
Pilot Assistance System
but we'll get into that later.
Alright, enough about drone specs,
let's see how this thing actually flies
and what kind of footage
you get out of it.
You can fly the Air in
three different modes.
There's the wired connection,
which is a big misnomer
because there are no actual wires,
it just means using the bundles remote.
There's the wireless connection,
meaning using only with your phone,
and the third one is gestures.
Now we won't focus on the last
two because I think flying
with your phone is a little weird
and I will say the gestures,
they work just as well
as they did with the previous models.
So the controller basically looks similar
to the one that you would get
with the Mavic Pro,
but without the screen.
Also, there are no thumb
sticks attached to it.
The thumb sticks are
actually hidden in this tiny
rubberized storage
compartment within the remote,
just under the arms that grab your phone.
It's a great little design
tweak, which makes it a lot
easier to stow the RC in your bag.
So the first time setting it up,
I will say I had some issues,
my phone was connecting to my home Wi-Fi,
the link wasn't really working
that well, and it just kinda
made the initial pairing process a hassle.
Once it was paired, each time
I had to use the drone again,
I would have to unpair it
and pair it back again.
It sorta started to get
annoying but after I talked
to DJI they just told me
to wait for the green light
on the remote and the
green light on the drone
and it'll just connect,
and that did the trick
for the most part.
In some locations I will still get
some errors regarding
the compass but usually
a quick reset will just fix the issue.
Another major distinction
between the Mavic Air
and the Mavic Pro is that the Air
uses Wi-Fi or enhanced Wi-Fi,
and the Mavic Pro here
uses radio frequency.
Now that's a change that not
a lot of people will welcome,
but in my testing so far, it
hasn't really been an issue
except for the initial pairing.
I will say you would lose the video link
every now and then which can get a little
nerve-racking even for a skilled pilot.
The footage looks fine,
it's a minor step up in
quality from the Mavic
Pro so if you recently
got that one, don't feel bad.
I have always found that the
dynamic range can be an issue
with smaller sensors, and
the trend continues here.
When you're shooting during
the daylight, with lowest ISO,
everything looks sharp and rich.
But once you introduce a
scene with high contrast
such as sunrise, things
kinda start falling apart.
In the footage you're looking
at now, the ISO was set
higher than what I would
normally do and you can
definitely see it affecting the shadows.
They look a little too
noisy and the dark areas
start to crush or lose all their detail,
which can be kinda painful
to edit, even when you're
shooting in the CineLight color profile,
which gives you more flexibility in post.
I got similar results with the photos
but with RAW files you
still have more flexibility,
and if you shoot bracketed
you can always just do
the exposure blending after the fact.
I said that I won't talk a
whole lot about different modes
that you can shoot, but there is one mode
that I'm completely obsessed
about and you saw it
at the beginning of the video.
It's called Asteroid.
The drone focuses on you,
gives you a countdown,
flies backwards and up into
the air where it hovers
for about a minute, and takes
a spherical pan out shot.
The app automatically stitches
everything into one video.
My only issues are the
black bars you get towards
the end of the clip, but
they seem kinda unavoidable.
There is one more standout
feature in the Air
that we haven't talked about yet
and it's called the
APAS, which is short for
Advanced Pilot Assistance System.
It basically enables the
Air to 3D map the area
around it and decide
whether it should go around
objects or fly over objects.
Still that's not something
that you should rely on.
Although, it worked pretty
well in our testings,
you just have to make sure
the feature is enabled
and you're getting a good reading,
which isn't always the case.
Now since the Air is so small,
a lot of people are concerned about
how it's gonna perform in the wind.
Unfortunately we haven't had a windy day
in San Francisco so we weren't
able to test that feature
but I did get wind alert a couple of times
when I really wasn't expecting it.
Finally, that brings me to battery life.
DJI markets this as a total
of 21 minutes of flight time
and sure, on a full
charge you'll get that.
But realistically, you're
never on a full charge,
by the time you set up the drone,
take off, by the time you have to land it,
you're looking at about 15 minutes.
I do wish this was a little
bit longer than that.
Regardless, the Mavic
Air really is the best
of both worlds, those worlds
being the Pro and the Spark.
You get a slightly improved
camera compared to the Pro,
and a smaller body than
the Pro and the Spark.
Still, as I mentioned
before, if you're looking
into more commercial work,
I'd strongly recommend
you looking into the Phantom lineup.
But if you're just a
hobbyist or a freelancer
looking to add another
skill to your resume,
the Air is the right drone for you.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
