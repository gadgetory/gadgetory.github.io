ship's holodeck where images of reality
can be created by our computer highly
useful in crew training highly enjoyable
when used for games and recreation Star
Trek's holodeck is the ultimate
unreachable gold standard for a virtual
environment right now we're still just
working on getting little pieces of it
right and a lot of the time these
attempts are either boring or just plain
bad and most projects vastly over
promised whatever somebody says oh it's
like the holodeck your first instinct
should be to run away so why are we here
at Virginia Tech's Institute of
creativity Arts and Technology looking
at one of the closest adaptations yet
because it's a big weird ambitious step
into the future of VR research okay
turn to your right 90 degrees and you
see the red column running up and down
the middle yep okay that's the actual
tornado funnel that is extending down to
the ground I'm gonna point but I can't
help myself
that's where the actual funnel is coming
out we're a Research Institute that
brings together researchers from science
and engineering and art and design
together to collaborate in projects and
the cube is one of our seven studios
that really allow these researchers to
collaborate in different kinds of
environments
nobody would ever be where we're
standing in a real storm you'd be dead
if you were here even where you are
right now you're actually inside they're
about to penetrate into the funnel if
you look up through the funnel you'll
see it's clear sky so these 24 motion
capture cameras follow you as you move
through the virtual world that data is
sent up to some computers that are up
above and then sent down the model is
calculated as to where you are and then
that image is then sent to you and
rendered by your local computer onto
your oculus so now you look up around we
have a rigid bottom body model of you
and you can
through that environment so these balls
on the top of my head make me look like
an idiot but they create a pattern of
dots that tells the room where I'm
standing they work off the same
principle as motion capture suits which
you'll find in both film and VR but one
of the interesting things about the cube
is that it contract 24 different markers
across the whole room which could mean
24 people or 12 people and 12 objects
and so on if you still want to track a
tablet for example it turns into a
window onto a virtual house if your
friend has a tablet too you can see each
other as you walk around the rooms one
of the beauties of the environment is
that I can explore this area in this
space and the model within this space
with you in there and with everybody
else in that environment as well looking
at different aspects of the model so
sort of like what we have in gaming
where you can move through a game and
there are other people in the game and
they see what they see and you see them
you see how much of an improvement is
this over being able to render it on a
screen in 3d and sort of scroll through
it the way you would a video game yeah
the screen the screen is what I call 3d
and 2d it looks 3d but it is really 2d
and so you can't go inside of it you
have to stay outside the perimeter but
it is our opinion that what we're seeing
right now could never be seen on a 2d
screen stepping into a virtual reality
tornado is certainly a lot cooler than
looking at a 3d model on a 2d screen but
is it really conveying information I
couldn't get otherwise
I've never gotten a great answer and it
doesn't necessarily feel like making the
information bigger makes me understand
it better what the cube can do though is
make collaboration more natural we each
get to interact with this big detailed
canvas on our own terms but we exist in
it together and all he has to do to show
me something is point it's like the
difference between showing someone the
Empire State Building on your laptop and
building an architectural model neither
is real but one of them feels more
accessible and some things you just have
to experience the key to the cube is the
addition of the oral environment that
surrounds you you're surrounded by one
level of 64 speakers those 64 speakers
can place the sounds within this space
here and using different techniques one
of the new tech
makes is something called wave field
synthesis what we can do is now begin to
synthesize exact sound locations in
space that surround the cube if you're
not using headphones right now you might
want to put them on
if you close your eyes you can almost
forget that you're standing in black box
and imagine the wind swirling around you
or a house being ripped apart above your
head you might have to be in a specific
place to hear something or a designer
can make the noise follow you around the
sound lives up to the holodecks promise
it sounds real because on some level in
Israel the crazy distant you know what's
physically possible future is yet to
shine laser light into the ice itself
just like the oral environment doesn't
touch you you don't have to wear
anything to get the oral environment
wouldn't be neat if you didn't have to
do that with a visual environment so
right now we've moved between screen
onto commercially available devices like
the oculus but the eventual goal is to
move all of that off body we're not even
close to that goal obviously a lot of
parts don't live up to the holodeck you
can't even walk around on your own in VR
without someone to carry a computer
behind you what's exciting about the
cube is that it's a blank canvas for
architects musicians scientists
designers companies and pretty much
anyone else to work with
Virginia Tech isn't trying to bring
virtual reality to your living room but
it's creating a space for people to
build the most ambitious virtual worlds
possible with as much freedom as 24
cameras dozens of speakers and 1,600
square feet will allow</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
