were these magical band-aids for the
eyesore that is your Smart TV interface
by plugging one of these into an HDMI
port in the side of your TV you suddenly
have very easy access to things like
Netflix YouTube HBO Go social media apps
streaming spores I mean literally
thousands of options now this category
of devices is even more accessible
they're cheaper and smaller and some of
them are in doing boxes their sticks
that you just stick into the side of
your TV and they make great stocking
stuffers so our guess is that you might
be considering one this holiday season
now really all of these streaming sticks
and tiny boxes do this same basic stuff
but there is one sub $50 streaming stick
that that's our top recommendation and
that is Amazons fire TV stick this is
actually Amazon second-generation fire
TV stick but it has one thing that sets
it apart from Roku and chromecast and
Alexa enabled fire TV remote previously
you could use an Alexa remote with fire
TV sticks and boxes
but you had to buy it separately or it
was more expensive now it's all bundled
in for 40 dollars in case you haven't
used it before alexa is amazon's voice
controlled virtual assistant when you're
talking about Alexa and the TV you're
talking about something that's meant to
help you find stuff to watch or listen
to so you press the button on the remote
and you say Alexa find hateful eight or
Alexa pull up the night manager and
she'll help you pull up the content that
you want to watch or open the app that
you need to watch it but that's not the
only reason why the Amazon fire TV stick
is the best deal it's a fast little
stick and Amazon fire TV has pretty much
every app or channel you could want to
watch with the exception of iTunes which
is only on Apple TV also Amazon's fire
TV interface has gotten better but it's
still not my favorite my runner-up to
the Amazon fire TV stick is the $50 Roku
streaming stick now I should note that
I've also been testing the Roku Express
box which is this tiny little set-top
box that also closed into the side of
your TV but I didn't like it as much as
the Roku stick that's because it's so
light that it was actually hard to keep
in place and I had to use adhesive to
keep it on my entertainment console but
also it felt really slow compared to the
Roku streaming stick which has a
quad-core processor Roku's biggest claim
to fame is that it has an absurd number
of streaming channels for you to watch
more than 3,500 to be exact now that's a
lot of channels and I hardly expect that
anybody's going to use all of them but
if you're looking for niche stuff than
Roku is a good bet a lot of the TV and
movie recommendations will be available
through Fandango but you can also see
where you can watch on Amazon Prime
video HBO sling and others the stick
does come with a remote but unlike the
higher-end Roku is it doesn't have a
find my remote feature and it does not
have a voice-controlled assistant you
can download the free Roku app on iOS
and Android and there's voice search in
there but in my experience it's just not
a computed as using Alexa on fire TV and
when it comes to streaming devices in
this price category there actually
aren't that many options so I've been
looking at the Amazon fire TV stick the
Roku stick the Roku Express box and
Google's second-generation chromecast
which came out last year and costs $35
what can I say about the chromecast
and some people really like it because
of how cheap it is and also they just
like having the ability to just throw
the stuff they're already watching on
their phone onto their TV and it's great
if you're looking for YouTube content
especially but overall I still can't get
super excited about chromecast most of
the time it works ok sometimes the video
stutters also I like having a dedicated
remote and not necessarily haven't used
my phone as the remote and finally
chromecast doesn't officially support
Amazon Prime video which means you have
to go to Chrome browser on your laptop
pull a prime video and cast it that way
rather than doing it through the app so
you can't go wrong with any of these but
if you want a dedicated remote and you
want a remote with good voice search
rather than having to punch it a bunch
of characters with tiny arrow keys and
you're a prime subscriber who watches a
lot of Amazon Prime video then you can't
go wrong with the Amazon fire TV stick
but did I mention these are all pretty
cheap so you have no excuse get
streaming and they make great stocking
stock stuffs just yes
hahaha hey right in the stocking since
it's working okay that's a answer I'll
start from the top</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
