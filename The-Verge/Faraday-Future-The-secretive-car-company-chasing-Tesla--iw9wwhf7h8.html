in the electric car world but here's a
mysterious California company that keeps
making big hires from BMW and even Tesla
itself and has quietly built a staff of
over 400 people I had a chance to tour
Faraday futures Southern California
headquarters before they come out of
stealth mode and to talk to the
company's top engineer and designer Nick
Sampson is the senior vice president of
Faraday future and is one of the
company's founders leading engineering
so the first discussion started eighteen
months ago
eighteen months ago we've gotta have car
that perhaps can just turn up when you
need it you could don't have to own it
you can just pull it up on your phone or
you can free book it or it will just
know that you need it because you're
scheduled to go somewhere we wanted to
not just be an automotive company so we
reached out into the aerospace
industries into medical device
industries into the Internet technology
industry to pull together a group of
people with a diverse range of skills
Nick's or woody what do you bring to the
equation as far as your background
you're an engineer by training uh
engineer by training but also bring more
than engineering I also studied
economics and business so I understand
both sides of things and Tesla for
instance we did a completely different
sales model rather than the traditional
dealership model we used a model where
we sold via the internet sold via stores
sold in places that people had more
access to rather than the sort of rather
remote so is Faraday going to have a
similar spirit of Tesla or how is it
going to be different it's going to be
different in that we're creating an
environment that's even more creative
many people look at Tesla and think of
that they've done it differently to a
traditional auto industry which they
have but there's there's other other
ways even more different imagine the
future and the environment you want to
be in and the products and the world
that you want to create and then work
out how would I get to that place if I
go on a road trip now the weekend that I
have to plan that in in indoors on a
computer and then I have to go to the
car and we put that in I have to sort of
mess about
I can't it's not seamless it's not a
world where the car knows me knows my
needs now if I could if I planned
something on one device why shouldn't
that be available another device if I
plan my journey I should get in the car
the car should know my journey or should
know some of the places I want to visit
on the way because it knows my
preferences or even suggest places it
might say well we're going on this
journey to here would you like to stop
at this restaurant rather than we have
to do even bother to go on and say can
you find me a restaurant the car should
begin to let me learn my desires have
learned what I what I like where I want
to go or even not of me the owner or the
user of the car it should the other
people that are with me and I can see a
time through envisioning your car that's
much smarter than anything we've got
today so if we went on a journey
together it should know mymusictaste
because it knows who I am and it's read
my playlists and it should know who you
are and the car sure to say I'm gonna
start playing these tracks because I
found a commonality there you both
should like this John and music you
should also know other things about
everybody that's connected with the car
well there'd be a car with a single
owner or do you see it as no very much
we see that yes there will be cars that
still have single owners but in the
future with their beer we have vast
number of people who don't want to own a
car anymore we might instead of sort of
having own owning a car it might be a
subscription does that make you want to
make something that could race that
could be have a performance I guess I'm
always gonna have that desire that's
right but when you start a company you
can do that right like you can say why
don't we try this yeah there there's
there's the opportunity to instead of it
being a great thing to get a lot of
people around in an efficient manner we
just had that just for one person to go
and have fun so from an engineering
point does that mean you start with one
car and you build out from that or do
you introduce ten different shapes and
that people choose which one they want
or how does that work our longer-term
vision is that we're gonna have to
develop a completely different range of
vehicles for the future and where's your
company in that
we're moving remarkably quickly we've
already got a test vehicle out running
testing electrical system here in
California and we're already well
through the design process for
production we already are releasing data
and information to start having parts
made for real vehicles in the future so
it is an American car company you know
you're trying to live yet the company is
was founded here in California and we're
going to be manufacturing in the USA
thinking about you know really being in
the West Coast now this is we have Apple
that might be coming into the car where
the Google new companies that are really
no longer traditional automotive
companies so do you see those companies
as like-minded competitors not
like-minded competitors I just find them
considering as like-minded allies to me
it's a great thing that some of those
other companies are coming into the
industry it's not a threat more that
people that join the more consumers will
realize the opportunities that are
available and that the swing will
accelerate them Richard Kim best known
for leading the design and the BMW i3
and i8 is now the head of design for
Faraday it's about it's not really about
designing a car it's more about
designing a brand designing from the
ground up clean sheet of paper sheet of
paper but is that that's an old way of
doing things right well it literally and
figuratively a clean sheet of paper I
mean and you come from personally
working on you know such kind of design
crazed cars like I 8x3 do you draw from
some of that knowledge or do you just
start completely new yeah we're trying
to kind of hit the reset button we're
designing the car from the inside out
and that's unique we do a lot moon
oculus and augmented reality so it's a
very unique org structure yes so maybe
you can talk about where you are in the
design process is this an actual car
here that yes so this is one of the few
prototypes we're working on we're
working on multiple things at the same
time and this is a model of something we
did in this very new and unique process
it's very very digital oriented a lot of
VR a lot of AR so this is the results
that's right when you mention this this
car it's a process that starts you said
from the interior going out so it's not
just a shell eventually it's a guy's a
lot of your hard wiring in there yeah
what's the advantage to using to using
AI into using these sort of intuitive
ways of designing does that allow you
different materials to work with so that
process is giving us time we're doing
things super fast third of the time that
I'm used to and we're still doing it at
high quality whereas the old older ways
first to do maybe a clay model and then
you do a hard model and then you paint
it and then you do an interior same
process and then you kind of put them
together and you're like oh wait I
missed something with our process
everything is checked immediately it's
not clear when Faraday will unveil its
first product I expect to hear more from
Faraday future in 2016 so by 2020 will
we see your cars on the road absolutely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
