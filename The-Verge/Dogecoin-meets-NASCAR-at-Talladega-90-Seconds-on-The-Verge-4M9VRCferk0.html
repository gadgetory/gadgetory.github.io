sponsor for the race that funding
included plans to wrap the stock car

first random act of dough jury in
January the community also helped the
Jamaican bobsled team finance its trip
to Sochi to compete in this year's
Winter Olympic Games there's also the
nonprofit dogecoin foundation which so
far has raised tens of thousands of
dollars for initiatives like service

named Cabo su whose owner is a
kindergarten teacher in Japan that
