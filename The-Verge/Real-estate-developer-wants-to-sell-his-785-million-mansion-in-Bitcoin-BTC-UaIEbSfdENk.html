currency that mysteriously appeared in
2009 when a programmer operating under a
pseudonym introduced it on a
cryptography mailing list since then
bitcoin has gotten more and more popular
the price of a single Bitcoin has peaked
at over $1000 and there are about 10
million bitcoins in circulation
Jackanory summer are selling your lavish
home in Las Vegas for 7.85 million
dollars and they're accepting Bitcoin if
a bitcoin buyer comes forward this would
be the single largest transaction in the
currency ever hi we're jack and laura
summer I'm Laurie he's drea the house
grosses out at about 25,000 square feet
including a separate guest villa which
is about 3,000 square feet and we are on
about well it's over an acre but these
are golf course lots and we're it's
listed for 7.8 five million u.s. dollars
we've added the dynamic of accepting in
addition to other currencies I suppose
but Bitcoin has an acceptable currency
for this transaction one of my son said
you know dad you should expect wouldn't
you accept Bitcoin I said sure he said
why don't you want you to tell the world
because you'll get more exposure for
your property and it's accordingly
exciting it's pretty exciting thing to
do so about a minute later I went to the
video that I had produced I'm an uplink
to YouTube and I put on the tag you know
for 25 billion we're getting a lot of
attention we're getting a lot of
attention obviously I monitor the the
amount of views on the on the video
penny Jo
that's very interesting tell me about it
what's Bitcoin typically has stimulated
questions about the space and I think
that's I think that's positive it's
positive for the real estate it's
obviously positive for for Bitcoin but I
think Bitcoin the Bitcoin universe is
far larger than just somebody would
suggest interest in the house I assume
they could come and take a look at it
and say oh my god I love this place or
this is cool it's good for me and they
would give us an offer in u.s. dollar
and probably make reference to an
equivalent amount in Bitcoin and it
would just be perfect after that as you
get closer to the closing date we will
have already chosen a conversion entity
and it'll complicated really I mean if
somebody as I said it comes in euros are
yet again I mean they're Swain's they're
you know with the little dollar it's the
same thing yeah it could be a blend part
cash part bit using Bitcoin is tricky
especially for large transactions
because the price jumps around so much a
Bitcoin was worth $20 in February of
2013 but by the end of the year it had
jumped to over $1,200 the contract for
the summer's house will have to account
for any price swings during the 30 days
it takes to close on the sale of a house
and they'll have to cash out most of the
currency relatively quickly in order to
avoid taking on too much risk there are
plenty of things that could go wrong the
US government could outlaw the currency
or a technical flaw could be found but
with more people like the summers using
Bitcoin the dream of universal internet
currencies seems like it could maybe
work how much do you think you would
keep in Bitcoin well then I would be
telling you what my speculation would be
not much I don't know maybe 100 grand or
something like that I think more the big
coins are at that point yeah when they
went down I'd be grabbing everyone I
could get left undisturbed by government
will say I think bitcoin is viable
indefinitely the volatility will
probably slow down and we'll probably
stabilize at levels where both owners
and buyers of Bitcoin and more
importantly vendors and other commercial
enterprises will feel more comfortable
accepting Bitcoin as tender that will
stabilize the currency the value of
Bitcoin is not going to be changed by
announcements of unemployment data or
war or anything like that so that's kind
of one of the pluses of this concept
huge as as our economy is and as all the
dollars that are out there you can see
pretty significant fluctuations with a
good jobs report or something like that
or a good GDP number but I don't look at
it as a stunt or a very short term you
know y'all do it I forget it I can do it
as long as Bitcoin maintains the
viability that it seems to be
maintaining we're there it's a currency
it is a currency for our purposes at
this time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
