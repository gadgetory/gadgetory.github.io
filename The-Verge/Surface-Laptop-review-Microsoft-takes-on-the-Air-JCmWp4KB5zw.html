Microsoft finally just went ahead and
made the laptop everybody wanted them to
make a thin and light computer with so
few compromises and so much going for it
that it's easy to recommend anybody
actually it's easy to recommend
everybody everybody that's looking for a
Windows laptop at least and if you've
been using a MacBook Air for the past
few years this might be the first
Windows laptop in a very long time that
could convince you to switch because the
surface laptop totally lives up to
expectations I mean look at this thing
it's burgundy it also comes with a
couple other colors gold and blue and
platinum you may have also heard that
the deck the bit around the keyboard is
fabric it's Alcantara and we will get to
that in a minute the rest of it is
aluminum and it's really sleek it has
this matte finish in this wedge-like
design it's all angles it's not very
curved which I really like it's more of
a Lamborghini than it is a Porsche and
it feels totally model the surface
laptop starts at the very important
price point of a thousand bucks but you
really should spend the extra three
hundred bucks to bump up the processor
the storage and the ramp that's the
model that I'm using here you can also
go crazy and spend up to twenty two
hundred dollars on a radical expect out
model but I don't think most people
should need to get anywhere close to
that they're also just a ton of nice
touches and a few annoying things with
the hardware the speakers are underneath
the keyboard and they sound great even
manage you to get decent stereo
separation and speaking of those keys
they're also great there's a solid
amount of key travel and click eNOS and
everything is just the right size and in
the right place they're surrounded by
that Alcantara fabric we've probably
heard about so yeah fabric on your
laptop what well I'll tell you what I
think it's going to be fine
maybe after months or years of sweaty
palms this fabric will go to hell but I
think it's going to be durable enough
honestly I'm more annoyed by the fact
that the way the fabric is glued to the
body means that there's a seam between
the screen and the laptop deck when the
thing is closed but more importantly I
kind of don't get the point of it it
just feels nice and looks good and maybe
that's enough of
but at the end of the day I would have
been just as happy with plain ol
aluminum yeah whatever
it's unique I'll take it and since this
is a Windows laptop I have to point out
that the trackpad actually works it's
fast and accurate although I do like the
max force touch trackpad a little bit
better because on that one you can click
down to the top of it my only complaint
is that I wish it were just a little bit
bigger okay before we go on about the
hardware on the surface laptop you know
we got to talk about this other laptop
the MacBook Air because this thing it
basically looks like a red version of
this thing now we've been living with
this design of the MacBook Air since
2010 and in that time a lot of other
laptops have tried to topple it even
Apple hasn't been able to topple this
laptop as everybody's favorite laptop
and for good reason it's basically the
king of laptops so yes surface laptop
looks a lot like the MacBook Air they
have practically the same dimensions the
surface laptop is just a little bit
smaller but it's good at the same things
that the MacBook Air is good at it's
thin it's light it's got this wedge
shape it's powerful enough for most
things and most people want to do and it
just it's just good at hating the basics
of what a laptop should be but because
the surface laptop was designed in 2017
it has features that you can't get out
of MacBook Air like you can open it up
and unlock it with your face and of
course it has this big beautiful
touchscreen I've used a lot of MacBook
Airs and a lot of laptops and tablets
since the air and all of them inevitably
kind of cramp your style in some weird
way taking two steps into the future and
one step back the surface laptop though
it's not trying to force you to do
anything it's just trying to be the
laptop that everybody really wants as
far as performance goes I really have
zero complaints the model I'm using is
using the latest Intel Core i5 with
eight gigs of RAM it's the $1,300 spec
that I think most people should get
running eight or so apps isn't a problem
at all and really the only thing to say
is that this will handle basically
everything you want it to accept serious
video editing and hardcore games under
heavy duress this thing conked out at
just over seven hours and under more
normal use I was getting between eight
or nine I could probably extend that if
I were more careful with my apps my
brightness but the whole point of this
lot
is that you don't have to think about it
then there's the screen which is just
bonkers big and beautiful
it's a 13.5 inch touch panel under
Gorilla Glass 3 that Microsoft claims is
the thinnest surround it's also a 3 by 2
aspect ratio which I really love because
I don't have to do so much scrolling to
see everything it's also super high
resolution it's 20 256 by 1504 pixels so
everything not only looks sharp you can
also fit more on the screen and also I
should say it's super super reflective
in sunlight so be ready for that now
let's talk ports Microsoft decided to
play it super conservative here there's
no USB C or Thunderbolt 3 I think that's
a mistake but Microsoft thinks USB C
isn't ready for mass adoption yet I
think we both make excellent points
anyway what you do get here is one
single classic USB a port and there's
another one on the power adapter when
you plug it in a mini DisplayPort and a
surface connector for power that's all
fine but I do wish they'd found a way to
put an SD card reader on this thing even
with classic ports you can never escape
hashtagged on the life i've gone this
far without talking about windows or
more specifically the version that ships
on the surface laptop Windows 10s that's
because I'm going to tell you right now
that the vast majority of regular people
who won't and buy this thing are going
to take the free upgrade to Windows 10
Pro and never look back it's a simple
button click it just takes a couple of
minutes to switch and I'm telling you
you're going to do it you're going to do
it because the Windows Store is an app
desert Microsoft is shipping 10s by
default to try and juice developers into
putting their apps into the store but
that hasn't happened yet other windows
star apps are just really subpar the
official Twitter app for example is a
joke and many others aren't as good as
their full Windows versions all of which
honestly I think is a huge shame because
the core of Windows 10 is here in
Windows 10 s window snapping is great
the system for notifications excellent
and Microsoft has really figured out how
a touchscreen should work on a laptop
most of the time you just reach up to
the taskbar which isn't very far but you
can go full touch on some apps if you
really want to I dearly hope that
Microsoft can go developers and getting
more
and better apps into the Windows Store
because I do like the idea of a managed
version of Windows that's better about
handling battery life and updates and
security
other than being limited only using the
edge browser which honestly still needs
a little bit of work this really doesn't
feel like a half-baked version of
Windows 10 it feels like Windows 10 if
only the apps would catch up so I set up
top the surface laptop totally lives up
to expectations and that is true it does
I think it's the new de facto Windows
laptop that most people should get even
if it is a little more expensive for the
recommended $1,300 build but the other
expectation that we had is that Windows
Store apps still aren't good enough and
there aren't enough of them either and
that is also true which is too bad but
the upgrade to Windows 10 Pro is free
for now and I suspect that's going to
continue for a while so if you want a
Windows laptop and you can afford it you
should get the surface laptop upgrade to
pro and don't look back just make sure
you wipe down the fabric every now and
then
you notice when people do guns they like
like a gun is they they go like that
like well that's wrong a hammer goes
down so hell yeah
you're cold not cool like that's done</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
