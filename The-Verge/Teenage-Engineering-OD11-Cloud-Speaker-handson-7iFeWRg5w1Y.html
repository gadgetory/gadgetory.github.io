and I'm at the stratosphere in Las Vegas
we're here to check out the latest
innovations from teenage engineering
today they're showing off the OD 11a
quadrophonic speaker setup that can
wirelessly pull down music from the
cloud we're not sure exactly how it's
going to work but we're going inside to
get a demo and see for ourselves
one of the missions is to always make
timeless design high quality high
attention to detail front part with the
speaker though is that we did not have
to design that ourselves it was designed
in 74 by Steve Carlson of course the
main reason for picking that was the
acoustic quality but also the timeless
design if it was designed in 74 and
still is up to date I think we can call
that timeless and you can compare with
refrigerators connected to the Internet
but nothing of that really succeeded
because they all got it wrong so so we
dare to say that this is one of the
first examples of Internet of Things
that really will work in in a way that
the consumer feels this is much better
than what I had before this is the ortho
remote this is how you control the OD 11
speakers it's an analog remote with no
display which means the battery lasts
for about two years and if you give it a
tap that'll start the music once the
music is playing you can physically turn
the knob to turn the volume up and you
can just move it back to turn it down
and the the system is intelligent enough
to know what volume the speaker's can
handle so you can never really turn it
up too high and if you want to pause you
just give it one more tab and this is
the OD 11 speaker you can hook up to
four views together they communicate by
Wi-Fi and there's a lot of hardware
packed inside this box there is a
tweeter in a woofer a Wi-Fi module
Bluetooth a communications device for
you know controlling the software the
cloud music that comes in we try to make
everything as simplistic as possible so
you basically enjoy sound with your ears
rather than with the ice and everything
in this project goes into that to enjoy
music in a much better way
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
