looking at the HTC Rezound for verizon
now makes this phone so special is that
it's using a 720p display 4.3 inch
high-definition one of the very first in
the world to have a 720p display and the
first in the u.s. period it's not
although this phone is also the result
of a collaboration with Beats Audio and
as such you have the Beats Audio logo
squarely placed on the back of the phone
and you also get a pair of pretty sweet
pack in Beats Audio earbuds that are
better than your normal inbox earbuds
phone is fast it's using a 1.5 gigahertz
Snapdragon dual-core processor just one
of the fastest available on the market
today a lot of HTC's recent phones have
had one point two gigahertz dual-core
processors this is a little bit faster
and the UI is smooth at runs sense as
most of HTC's phones do and apart from
the occasional slowdown in the browser
the whole thing is smooth as silk now
physically the phone is not the thinnest
on the market keep in mind that Verizon
just released the droid razr this is not
a droid razr in fact it's nearly twice
as thick at thirteen point seven
millimeters but it feels good in the
hand and it's got a nice soft touch back
that you're definitely not going to drop
even if you have greased up hands for
some reason you are not going to let
this thing slip other features include a
secondary microphone which a lot of
phones use for noise cancelling which
works very effectively on the rezound
I'm happy to report you also get an
eight megapixel camera with dual-led
flash 1080p video capture and when you
want to play those images back you have
an MHL port which doubles as your micro
USB charging port and plug that thing
into your TV but this really is all
about the beats you get a pretty cool
branded pouch to go along with your
earbuds with those crazy red wires
instantly recognisable as being beats
and of course that 720p display you
can't go wrong that's the resound for
verizon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
