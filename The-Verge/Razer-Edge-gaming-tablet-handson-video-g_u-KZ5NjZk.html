CES 2013 and we'll take it and look at
the brand new Razer edge as you can see
from these big gamepad controllers on
the side this is a gaming centric device
but underneath it you're just looking at
a Windows 8 PC this is a 10.1 inch
Windows 8 tablet it runs into a core i5
core i7
Ivy Bridge processor but it comes with
all of these crazy attachments so
actually just looking at the tablet
itself it's quite a chunky device but
you know it is running a full-sized
intership x86 chip in here it's running
Windows 8 as you can see this particular
tablet is running civilization we've got
this honored over here and you just get
into it it's also quite hefty and quite
heavy this particular gamepad attachment
includes a battery extra battery so
there it is there's a battery in here
there are vents up up at the top and you
got all the input ports line up edits up
again the controller itself it has Geo
analog sticks got a digital pad got the
usual action controls and then select
and start buttons it does feel quite a
hefty quite heavy engine in the hand it
also feels reassuring it all feels quite
solidly built so you can get this
gamepad controller for 249 the entry
level for the Razer edge itself is $9.99
with a core i5 processor 6 4 gigabytes
of storage and it goes up to $14.99 when
you decide to include a core i7 and more
storage 128 gigabytes or 256 gigabytes
of storage you can get it with 4
gigabytes on the edge or the CH pro
version which is top price with 8
gigabytes of RAM so we'll try and
they're a little bit of civilization
here so the framerate is extremely
smooth there's an NVIDIA GPU in here
mobile GPU and I'm getting a bunch of
tips here in Civilization but the game
is looking good the displays looking
good it's a 1366 by 768 resolution 10.1
inches and responsiveness seems to be
extremely smooth as I say this runs the
full version of Windows 8 I would need
to exit the windows just to demonstrate
that so here's steam I can switch it
over to the modern UI look and back to
the desktop as well and what you're
going to take a look at the two other
Hardware accessories that razor is
debiting here there's this keyboard dock
over here which opens up and closes like
so this is a prototype so we don't know
that this extra band is going to do with
it but if it is it wraps around like so
to keep the tablet together with the
keyboard again it makes for something
quite chunky seems like a retro 90s
laptop but you do once again get an
extra battery inside it and you do get
fully fleshed-out keyboard that you can
use with the Razer edge and there's also
this docking station it will cost $99
and it should be available in the first
quarter of 2013 which is when we can
expect the whole razor-edge land to come
out apart from the keyboard which is
expected in the quarter 3 for 2013</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
