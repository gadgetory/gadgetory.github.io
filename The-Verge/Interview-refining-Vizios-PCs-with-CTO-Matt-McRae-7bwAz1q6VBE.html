McCray the CTO visio we're here at CES
2014 you're still making laptops you're
still eating desktops yeah you've kind
of pared down the model Rangers there
what's that what's going on there we
noticed ninety percent of our sales for
instance just as an example our
all-in-one PC ninety percent of our
sales was 24 inch so we pared down our
27 we're just concentrating on the 24 so
we took our 24 inch and we updated the
touchscreen technology so it's much
faster we bumped a fourth-generation
intel processor we have iris pro
graphics all I sevens by the way we
bumped at the 802 11 AC so the fastest
wireless standard so what we did is we
we pared down what people were actually
passionate about buying and got rid of
the stuff that people weren't buying and
you got rid of your 13-inch laptop
tonight we got right we got rid we had a
14 so we had a force for 14 inch we got
rid of that we have a 15-6 so you suck
with the keyboard on a lot of times good
time that's gone on you know you don't I
never said I liked it I just the first
time I ever saw it two years ago I said
this is going to be controversial and
it's been two years three years yeah
what I mean we have a solid so totally
open we have about ten fifteen percent
of people don't like the keyboard and
the rest like it so we've stuck with a
keyboard we've updated the trackpad so
we're continuously refining but we've
had it we've had more people say don't
change the keyboard so we've left the
keyboard the way it is and most people
most people enjoy it so when you launch
the pcs right there was going to be the
big the next big wave for vizia right
you were it was a big launch you were
everywhere and I've kind of pulled it
back a little bit yeah is there a reason
is it just the TV stuff is more
important and there's a bigger market
there the pc market is kind of falling
apart yeah that helps yeah pc market is
i would say a best stagnant yeah i think
our area where we're going for is a
healthy market meaning that kind of
high-end people it's not the largest
part of the market i think a lot of the
market has gone to like five hundred
dollars and less we don't have a lot of
interest in playing in that you're not
gonna make rumba no we have no plans to
make a Chromebook so we're still on the
premium side and we still view it as a
product that complements the rest of our
products so again it's another screen
that you can watch content on so if
you're a netflix subscriber and your way
into netflix you can start a stream on
your laptop close the screen we you know
play it back on your TV and in fact you
could actually play it on our smart idea
product cuz
we have a full android on there and so
you can jump between screens and we
thought that was very very important so
that's still important to us so why do
you actually it's weird you have all
these platforms and you were telling me
that the apps are what connects
platforms but you have android on the
smart audio products you've got
proprietary i'm assuming linux the html5
on the tvs and then you've got windows
and your computer's why not just pick
one why not have Android run on the TV
yeah I don't so here's here's my current
view is that there isn't one platform
that's perfect for all meaning the there
is not an operating system that is the
best PC operating system in the world
and also the best mobile operating
system for a smaller device and there's
definitely not an OS on a PC or a mobile
device that's the best operating system
for a TV so still today on the
underlying platforms we're still in a
mode of Best of Breed meaning we're
picking the best platform for that
specific device with the idea though
that the platform doesn't really matter
what matters is like I said before that
somebody can jump between Netflix
versions and all of them and have a
totally seamless experience or Spotify
or Pandora or whatever that's where
people are making their connections
especially on TV when they're looking
for content and so as long as we can
make that a completely consistent
interface the underlying platform to us
at least becomes less important and we
would still tip towards using the best
platform our operating system on that
given device and then concentrating on
the user experience above it i don't
know in the future you know a single OS
may become the best mobile the best TV
and the best computing and have one but
i don't think we're there you it seems
like html5 is going to that sweats go
away well you know yeah what I would say
it's html5 is kind of layer in between
in that you can write an html5 app that
runs on Android and it also runs on a
web browser Chrome or html5 kit and in
fact a lot of the apps and Windows 8
you're actually written in html5 and CSS
right so there's already a little bit of
this unifying development layer and
efflux is Oliver and Netflix is all over
that
multiple apps and we've had html5 on our
TVs for you know over a year now and
I'll tell you all the new apps that are
being written for a smart TV platform
for a Chanel 5 yeah that's I mean that's
it's I only asked you to ask you about
the one competitor I'm going to ask you
at which is LG is going to come out with
webos to you and that seems like there
it's called webos they're betting big on
this HTML future but it seems like they
needed to race into you know they're not
software developers their version of
Android is kind of like whatever do you
see that is like the future for all
these TV products is web apps kind of
being rescaled and reported to the
television yeah because there's no
there's no unified interface like it's
like no you know Netflix looks like
those who looks like this Amazon looks
like that yeah so what I think what's
happening is on the best Internet
platforms for TVs there's a unification
happening at the app level yeah so for
instance we you know there's two
versions of Netflix out there there's
the kind of very minimalist that ended
up on blu-ray players and some of the
less capable smart TVs and then there's
the full fledge version that we have and
it's very much the same as Android or
iOS and some of the others so there's a
little bit of a bifurcation but I would
say there's there's becoming a pretty
seamless user experience at the apt
level I think html5 is helping with that
right so a developer can develop once
and with little modification move
between them I think LG's choice of
webos is interesting I mean I think you
know it may be unnecessary I think you
know where all the developments being
done is above the OS level you know they
bought it so they decided to use it haha
that's good yeah glad to catch up
waiting for us it's unnecessary I think
for us it's less about especially on a
TV it's less about the OS it's more
about the user interface I do think that
a fully unified user experience across
these platforms is important and it's
something we're working on in the labs
obviously we had to finish the reference
series first I've got a picture quality
audit quality yeah we think it or
next-gen the entire lab that we work on
and our R&amp;amp;D center will be moving
towards smart TV platforms of the future
and I already have been I think the next
step is that unification and I can't
tell you exactly what that is but what's
interesting I think webos is going to be
tough because well s is
any of the other platforms so it's
interesting as they pick something that
has already been taken off mobile phones
and taken off everything else so that's
going to be more difficult yeah when
there's operating systems that are out
there that are already kind of pushing
across devices and some of them are
actually operating systems but some of
them may just be a development platform
like html5 that ends up everywhere so I
think that's the next step is where the
interface on your TV is completely the
same as the interface on your tablet and
I don't when I say the same obviously
it's scaled and optimizing there's some
elements that are tweaked but there's no
reason to learn a completely new
interface every single device you pick
up yeah I think we're kind of past that
and it just requires some extra work to
get that done and you know the smart
audio devices is our first step at
actually doing that right where you can
pick up an android phone or an Android
tablet and then launch one of our smart
devices and you're not going to see a
difference that is completely unskilled
android kitkat on a quad core processor
you know again like I said before an
Android users going to walk up and be
immediately comfortable to them
immediately without having to go through
a user you know training session and
trying to figure out how to download
apps and sign up for a new account all
it's done come out of the box and just
works that's the first test and we'll
see some others and some other is a big
challenge of scaling that to 120 inches
yeah I mean yeah you're not going to
walk up there and start swiping no and I
don't think people want to do this
either no I so I agree yeah I think the
challenge for TV is not just user
interface I think the challenge with TV
is it's the only device that you sit at
a distance yeah right so your
interaction with it it's not direct or
in a you know keyboard and trackpad or
on a touchscreen you are 10 to 15 to 20
feet away and trying to solve for a
really simple intuitive user model is
what needs to be solved and I agree i
think the gesture stuff is a gimmick I
think it's great for some games you know
if you want to play kinect that's great
but as a way to navigate a full
operating system I think it just doesn't
work yeah otherwise stuff is Cepheus
employ stuff if it's not stellar it's
frustrating and so again when you come
to video we when I said talking before
about a curated experience I don't
believe voices is good
on a TV and I think gestures is a
gimmick I don't think it works some of
the camera based gesture stuffs even
worse and so we don't bother putting it
in because nobody uses it and frankly
you know you don't want your users to be
beta testers so until it's perfect don't
put it in so what we did is we spent the
last few years going back and trying to
build the best picture quality audio
file in the world and we're still
working on some of those more deeper
questions around a complete unified UI
and what is the proper interaction mode
there's something that you're 10 feet
away from and we've got some really good
ideas and that's next year and maybe ha
all right man what's always resented
good thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
