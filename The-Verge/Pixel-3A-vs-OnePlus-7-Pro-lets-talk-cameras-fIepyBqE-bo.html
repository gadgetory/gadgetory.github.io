to give you a high spec experience
without those high price tags
of other flagship phones.
But they always kind of fell
short with their cameras.
Pixel, on the other hand,
started off expensive,
but they always maintained
amazing photo quality.
But now they're trickling that technology
down to less expensive phones,
while OnePlus is getting
a little more expensive
and souping up their camera technology.
So who does it better?
The souped-up OnePlus 7 Pro,
or the pared down Pixel 3A?
Let's put them to the test.
Before we get into quality,
you can't take a photo
without opening the app.
So who does it faster?
To test this, I made a little rig.
And I asked my friend Carrie to join me.
We're gonna be closing
the camera out, entirely,
then opening the app and taking a photo
as quickly as it allows us to.
All right Carrie, let's do this.
One, go.
- [Together] Oooooh.
- [Becca] Two, one, go.
- Okay, there's something going on.
- [Becca] Two, one, go.
- Oooh!
- Damn, okay.
- [Becca] Go.
- Fun.
- That's it.
OnePlus wins, thank you Carrie.
- Good game.
- Good game.
And now we're gonna see
whose shutter reacts faster
when the app is already open.
(clicks)
Oh!
One point Pixel.
Two point Pixel.
Three point Pixel.
Okay, well that was fun.
So the Pixel takes the photos faster
when the app is already open,
but from starting at nothing,
the OnePlus will the open the app
and take the photo just a bit faster.
Now, I wanna look at the apps themselves
just their interface,
because although they look
really the same much
like all photo apps do,
they act in different ways that makes one
just a little bit better for me.
The Pixel: my biggest qualm with this app
is that every time you close it,
whether you close out of it entirely
or you just go to check a notification,
it's gonna default back to the rear camera
every time you reopen it.
So, say I am taking a selfie.
And I have it on the front facing camera.
If I close the app, and
say, check a notification,
then open the app again,
it's gonna go back to
that rear camera, which is
more annoying than you think,
especially when it comes to
shooting entirely in night mode.
When it's night time and I wanna
just be shooting in night mode,
I have to navigate to the more tab,
and then hit night sight every single time
I wanna take a photo at night.
It seems small but it's really annoying.
So OnePlus's app looks pretty standard
and what I really appreciate is that,
say, I'm taking a selfie,
every time I open the app,
it's gonna reopen the selfie camera.
Now the only exception to this is
that when you are in photo
mode using the rear camera,
it's always gonna default
back to the standard lens
as opposed to the wide
angle or the telephoto
every time you reopen the app.
I also appreciate that you can swipe up
on any of the options on the bottom column
and it'll bring you to
all of your photo modes.
But what about hardware?
What are we working with
just base level here?
Well, on the OnePlus, you have
three cameras on the back:
an eight megapixel F2.4 telephoto lens,
a 16 megapixel F2.2 wide angle lens,
and a standard 48 megapixel lens
that scales down to 12 megapixels
when you're not using pro mode.
And that's an F1.6.
And then on the front, or located atop,
you have that really cool
pop-up 16 megapixel F2 camera.
And then on the Pixel 3A, you have
a 12.2 megapixel F1.8 lens on the back,
and an eight megapixel F2
selfie camera on the front.
Whoo, it's a hell of a lot of numbers.
Anyway, for the last three days,
I have taken these phones
everywhere with me,
and every photo I would
have taken with one camera,
I've taken with two, and
yes, it is just as much
of a pain in the ass as
you think it would be.
I still have friends that print photos,
so for this review, I wanna
go and I wanna print photos
and then also compare them on my laptop.
So we have a little bit of both worlds.
I mean, when we're only
taking photos with our phones,
inevitably they will get printed
or put on calendars, or if
you're lucky, even a mug.
So let's go to Walgreens.
All right, let's do it.
Took a really long time.
Quick focus and audio test, here we go.
Number one, how do you hear me?
Is the sound better over here,
or does it sound better over here?
Now I'm back over here,
is it better over here?
Or is it better over here, you tell me?
Now I'm gonna go away.
You guys focus?
Still focus?
One more?
How's the focus?
All right.
Oh yeah.
Here we go.
Alix, how did you beat me back here?
Holy cow.
Wow, okay, let's first talk about selfies.
These are some things you might print,
say it's you and a friend.
So, right off the bat, I can notice
the color difference
between the two photos.
On this side is OnePlus
and this side is Pixel.
OnePlus is definitely warmer, whereas
Pixel as we know, is much cooler
and there's more blue and
green tones to the photos.
I found that the OnePlus fills in shadows,
brightens the photo,
and smooths absolutely
everything more than the Pixel,
even with the beauty mode turned off.
Anyways, both cameras have
front-facing portrait mode,
and although I like the
Pixel's selfie camera
for general use, I find
that selfie portraits
put way too much blur on the background.
All right, enough fooling around.
Let's talk about the main camera.
Oh gosh, this portrait mode.
The OnePlus takes smoothing
a whole nother level.
I mean, I absolutely have no idea
what happened to Alex's
freckles, they're even gone.
Now, sure, the cutout is passable.
OnePlus is cutting the contrast
in detail level way too much.
I took photos of Maria and printed them.
The Pixel's just way over
blurring the background.
I do enjoy that it keeps details,
especially in her forehead and her shirt,
but in general, I just
think that this blur
is too much, and I think that on OnePlus,
it's a little more natural.
Where the OnePlus really surpasses
the Pixel is its versatility.
I mean, it simply has more
cameras than the Pixel.
And it's something that
I ended up using a lot.
I mean, in New York City,
everything is so cramped
and profound, so having a wide angle lens
where you could be close to something
yet show all of it, is really valuable.
The wide angle lens is amazing.
The details and the edges of the frame,
they fall apart and they warp just a bit,
but I didn't find it to be a deal breaker
and it's better than no wide angle at all.
The telephoto is really sharp too.
There's certainly way more detail
than digital zooming on a Pixel.
Those extra lenses, they allow OnePlus
to really shine when shooting landscapes.
And without faces to smooth,
the OnePlus does really well
at keeping the whites white,
as opposed to the blue-leaning Pixel.
But when it comes to shooting at night,
there's no denying that
Pixel's night sight
is a lot better than OnePlus's nightscape.
The Pixel does a really nice job
of keeping the details in,
say, the bricks in this photo
while smoothing the pixels in the sky,
which overall produces a higher, brighter,
more balanced photo.
It does take a few seconds
longer to take the photo,
but for the clarity it
provides, I think it's worth it.
If we look at the main camera alone,
putting aside the wide angle
and the telephoto lenses on the OnePlus,
I think the Pixel has the OnePlus beat
in almost any lighting condition.
It just comes down to the detail level.
But if we're talking about life
in the grand scheme of
things, the versatility
that the OnePlus provides is unmatched.
I mean, having all those
lenses in your pocket
at any time is really helpful.
So as it is with all cameras,
it's gonna come down
to what you value more.
What I will say, though, is last night,
I bought way too many plants at Home Depot
and I wanted to send a picture to my mom.
I had both phones on me,
and I chose the Pixel to take the picture.
Okay, so, the age-old question.
Sound off: Pixel or OnePlus?
What are you guys shooting with?
Do you care about lenses?
Do you care about image quality?
What are you doing with your photos?
Does anyone still print pictures?
That's all I have to say.
We'll see you next time.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
