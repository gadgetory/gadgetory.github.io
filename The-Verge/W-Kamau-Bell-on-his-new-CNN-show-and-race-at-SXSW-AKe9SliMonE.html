and I'm at South by Southwest with the
comedian w kamau Bell and we're gonna
talk about a couple things
a couple things the new show with Kwame
open oh yeah so you actually have a new
show it's on CNN that was just announced
yes I don't yet unless somebody has done
something without telling laughs yeah oh
it's on and it's gonna hit you guys all
know it's on the cover of every magazine
yeah yeah it's it's the United States of
America yeah yeah it's a racing culture
travel show I mean that's a not any
topic for you at all no no no those
three I'm familiar with all those things
race culture and traveling so I do I do
those things regularly it's just now I'm
bringing a camera crew with me
everywhere I go so like you're gonna be
visiting cities and talking people about
like the issues of the day the issues of
all the issues of their of their day
basically the issues that are going on
in their place and and also just
experiencing different cultures that I
wouldn't experience without CNN's travel
budget no you know it's uh it's an
opportunity to sort of you know one of
the one of the things that people most
enjoyed from totally biased that I hear
about is the man of the street
interviews and so this just takes that
concept and blows it out into a whole
show where I'm talking to people about
their thing you know this is a much
smaller crew than totally biased like
you needed a lot of all hands on deck to
do a daily show but this is a much
smaller like film crew and it's also not
it's a funny show but it's not based in
mostly the writing it's based in the
interactions with people so it's not a
thing words it's not written like that
it's just talking to people and because
I'm a comedian and I can get people to
open up about stuff we find things that
are funny and I just do things every
time that I have fun doing and sometimes
those things look ridiculous and people
laugh at them is it like it's coming out
of the process of you being in totally
biased and then a connection of cop talk
which we talked about before it's it's
yes it's whirls around people who know
me and like me will like this show it's
just a more it's probably it's this is
the show like totally biased was the
thing that sort of I got an opportunity
to do that and I was happy to do it and
happy to pursue it and drive it to the
wheels fell off which and they fell off
and but this show if I'm honest is
actually like a show I had an idea first
like this before Tori
we came around because I'm a big fan of
Anthony Bourdain and I'm a big fan of
sort of that it's half journalism but
most but also half the personality of
the person so it's like it still you
learn something when you watch it but
then it's also about you get to hang out
Danny Bourdain or micro or at least a
ling or these these shows where it's
like follow me go through this thing and
it's not the news but you do get to
learn something to experience something
so I've always been a fan of those types
of shows and always felt like I could do
well at one of those shows and then
luckily the training I got from totally
biased from doing the man on the street
interviews sort of set me up for that
because I don't think I don't think I
would have been as good as I feel like
I'm being at this show if I hadn't had
that time until he buys to do all those
man on the street interviews which
initially I was pretty scared of just
walking a few on the street and say hey
can I talk to you about racism so I feel
comfortable sort of talking to people
and very quickly sort of figure out a
rapport so yeah it certainly feels like
I got trained to do this from totally
biased and I'm taking the thing that
everybody over one when people said
people advice that they really dug and
turning it into a whole show and still
beginning to do it I'm not competing the
thing about having a late-night talk
show is suddenly you're competing
against other late-night talk shows and
there's just sort of sense of like what
come out why can't you call Justin
Timberlake and have him lip-sync songs
with you on your show
because I wasn't on sorry I live for 10
years I don't have a Rolodex of all the
most famous people in Hollywood and also
it's not my thing right so but now this
show is not really I mean it's you have
to get ratings on stuff but it's not
competing directly against anybody's
thing right it's its own thing and all
the shows that it would sort of be
naturally competing against are on the
same network okay it's Morgan Spurlock
and Leigh Bourdain Lisa Ling micro all
those people are on the same network as
me so I'm not gonna be going up against
them it's all part of the same team so
that point it's freeing yeah it's for
it's a lot we can we've shot four
episodes so far and everyone has
dramatic differences like there's just
things about that because we sort of are
adapting to wherever we go so if you're
in East LA
talking about undocumented people and
immigration and the Chicano identity
that just automatically becomes a
different show than going to Barrow
Alaska the northernmost tip in North
America and hanging out with the new
black people who are the natives and
talking about you know
what's it like to have 365 days of snow
or whatever or 360 I don't know exactly
and and what's it like to live a place
where you can only get to by plane that
you can't drive into town and there's no
movie theater and there's not people
don't go to there's no Starbucks there's
no you know so those are automatically
shows you have to approach differently
so it's it's freeing it feels more
authentic to me
so you're South Park and are you finding
like any of those interactions and any
fodder for comedy here I mean you'll
have to be along no I got I guess I mean
this is my third year in a row here and
I was hoping to take this year off boy
it's a lot of just you know to me South
by Southwest it feels like a high school
reunion with people I didn't go to high
school with like I can't believe we made
it and I'm like we did I mean maybe you
did but everybody sort of silently
high-fiving each other like just sort of
look at each other guy like high-five as
far as like people color black people
walk I don't see it's a very white show
from so far what is the thing fellow
black man the South by is a lot about
money whenever you make things a lot
about money like when it costs I don't
know what the badges cost cuz luckily I
don't have to I wouldn't come if I had
to pay for it like I I get brought by
other people but yeah whenever you think
make things expensive it tends to whiten
things up you know you know people make
fun of Blackpool for eating chitlins and
sort of the worst parts of the pork but
we did that because it was cheaper right
you know if Germans were like $1000 an
ounce they would be a white people
delicacy you like caviar I can only
imagine
yes poor white goofy in there either but
there just happens to be a higher
percentage of for black people
yeah I'm not breaking it down I mean
I've been around to the couple panels
and I feel like there's like more
attention paid to diversity at least
these days well I think you know we
there in the in the year 2015 if you
want to be regarded as a open and
accepting and liberal and progressive
you have to sort of at least nod to
diversity so yeah I've certainly seen
people of color with badges on but not
in the same percentage that people of
color exist in the country
right what do you look for when you're
around here like what catches your eye
most often I like going to cities and
going to the places where people in the
city go to you like we just ate and
apparently there's the taco trucks that
are set up for this festival and there's
taco trucks that are like the locals eat
at so we went to the locals taco truck
at least what they told us it was
there's probably a deeper level of
localism that we didn't get to but you
know so that's the thing with my TV show
like I'm trying to do the things that
people in that place do not the things
they've set up for outsiders to do okay
thanks so much Kwame</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
