invested in them and met amazing people
using the internet to change the world
our generation has an opportunity unlike
any other we can create small empires
without anyone's permission welcome to
our crib it wasn't even kind of being
stressed in my day job it was just
realizing that I wasn't making things
anymore starting article was about
building stuff again it was scary
because like the site would go down I
wouldn't know what to do and everything
like okay Tom well you know what you're
doing right literally at the beginning
it was me with the PowerPoint deck we
didn't even have a website live maybe
you were sure you were pitching it
before the site was even built yeah or a
lot yes that's great it sounds cheesy
but it was a great feeling it's a good
like honest thing I made this thing give
it to you spend a little bit of money
and you're winning - it's cool I'm
considering this as my application video
for Tom this is exciting and allene
terrifying I can tell you this is
actually really hot
so for somebody's watching the show and
he's thinking I want this job I want to
do this what do you tell them what do
you tell her to end up like you
well I think one of the most important
traits is that you you don't listen to
the word know if you hear no go
