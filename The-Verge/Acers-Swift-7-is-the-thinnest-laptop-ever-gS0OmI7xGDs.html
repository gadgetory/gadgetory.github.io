for 2016 and this thing in front of me
is the note point nine nine eight
centimeters thick Acer Swift seven this
is the first sub 1 centimeter laptop to
be announced until T's dis with this new
cable ache processors and ASA has
immediately delivered on that T's this
is the Core i5 y series from Intel
inside has a 13.3 inch full HD display
has one of the widest touch pads we've
yet seen on a laptop and it's also
streaming light 1.1 kilograms and if all
that wasn't enough ASA promises 9 hours
of battery life now another thing to
take note of is the ports on this thing
I mean you might not think there could
be any ports but actually has three of
them two USB 3.1 Jack's take note Apple
and headphone jack take new Apple one of
the questions that our readers raised
when they heard in toasties of a sub 1
centimeter laptop was whether it would
Bend I have actually tried that with
aces new laptop and I can confirm that
it doesn't actually Bend hum believe
we're doing the Ben test on laptop but
there you go this is the age we're
living in one thing I will say though is
that the keyboard does have quite a bit
of flex to it so when you press in a key
even though it doesn't have much travel
at all at least the keyboard itself
gives you more travel by flexing aside
from that the touchpad is just enormous
it's like a white screen touchpad and we
do such patsak traditionally being a bit
of an issue
so maybe the exercise in the extra room
of this one will be kind of benefit kind
of an upgrade the one thing that
actually comes to mind with this is
because it's so light you kind of want
it to be convertible you kind of want to
be able to flip it around like a tablet
and for that purpose ASA is actually
coming out with an asus pin 7 which is
the sibling to the square 7 but it can
do the transformable thing where you can
flip out open out fully and function as
a tablet and a touchscreen one hour
difference between the two is that the
spin 7 because a little bit larger and a
little bit thicker is one point one
centimeters can accommodate an Intel
Core i7 processor a bit more powerful
but otherwise you get a gigabytes of RAM
256 gigabytes of SSD storage on the
Swift 7 and
right 5y series poster this is a 14 inch
display on the Asus pin seven thirty
point three on the Swift seven and both
of them are priced at $12.99 euros
they'll be available in September around
October over here in Europe and they're
going to be part of whole family of new
devices coming out from Acer Asus and
all the other windows OEMs with the new
cable a process from Intel
thanks for watching our first look at
Asus ultra-thin new laptops for more
from here at E for 2016 including Asus
gigantic gaming laptop which is the
opposite of these stay tuned to the
Versa calm and youtube.com slash the
verge this is why many competing actors
don't do that don't don't copy yourself
alright don't copy yourself lad you're
plagiarizing get better than that
mmm are you really better than yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
