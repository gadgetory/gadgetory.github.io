the most ambitious promises sony is
maybe the playstation flores cloud
streaming essentially it's playing video
games over the internet just by watching
a movie on Netflix so no need for a disk
or download sony make that a reality
today at CES 2014 with the announcement
of playstation now which allows ps3
games to be played on hurting from a ps4
to a PS vita to even TVs and smartphones
the goal of PlayStation now is pretty
much game streaming on any screen
without a set-top box or console well
that's great in theory has it actually
going to work PlayStation now is Sony
solution to the fact that you can't run
PlayStation 3 games on the PlayStation 4
because the two systems have mercy
different hardware it's too difficult to
the newer console to emulate its
predecessor Sony's constructing massive
data centers filled with ps3 hardware
and actually render your games before
their beam straight to your screen
across the internet this sounds like the
stuff of science fiction or at least the
country with a more robust broadband
infrastructure in the US the Sony's
putting PlayStation now and to be to
this month and plans to launch a service
and pull this summer the company
certainly puts on a good demo at CES the
games I played on PlayStation now had
good image quality and only a slight
amount of latency but I don't think
would bother most people but there are
still a lot of questions Sony's not
prepared to answer it's only wouldn't
tell me how close we were to the server
know how many it plans to deploy when
PlayStation now launches for now it's an
impressive proof of concept and Sony
still has a look proof</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
