this is the Microsoft Surface 2 it's a
tablet but it's also kind of a laptop
it's for watching movies and reading
books but it's also kind of for getting
real work done it's four hundred and
forty nine dollars it runs Windows 8.1
and more than ever it's competing
head-on with the iPad Microsoft learned
a lot of hard lessons about the surface
last year and the surface to tries to
address them point by point a low-res
screen like the surfaces doesn't work on
a tablet so the surface too has a
beautiful 10.6 inch 1920 by 1080 display
with gorgeous colors incredible viewing
angles and awesome multi-touch
capabilities last year's model is heavy
and cumbersome to hold and use so
Microsoft slimmed it down it's a little
thinner and a little lighter though it's
still so wide that it's kind of awkward
to hold in either orientation it's a
beautiful device in a new silver color
really well made and cleanly designed
but it's still best used in landscape
and on a desk whether you use it on your
desk or on your lap though the surface 2
is much easier to operate the kickstand
on the back once prompted an awkwardly
upright angle now tilts to a second
angle and that second angle is just
about where I'd put it anyway it makes
the surface 2 much sturdier on your lap
and a little easier to use on a desk
since you don't have to crouch down so
much to see it head-on there are tweaks
like this everywhere there's now a USB
3.0 port the speaker's seem a little
better and everything's just a little
trimmer except for one really awkward
seam on the back where the plastic strip
connects to the otherwise unibody design
it's a much better media machine than
ever a great way to watch Netflix movies
but frankly the iPads still better for
that and that's not what the surface 2
is for anyway the surface 2 is designed
to be for everything that's why it comes
with Windows 8.1 even though it's not
the full pro version that's compatible
with your legacy desktop apps that's
also why it comes with office and now
outlook pre-installed and really the key
to the whole productivity idea is the
touch and type covers which have been
updated slightly this year as well the
type cover is easily the best accessory
it has a tiny fabric II trackpad but a
really great clicky keyboard and this
year the keys are even backlit in a lot
of ways the surface 2 is most productive
when you plug in a mouse and keyboard
and that does kind of defeat the whole
point but when you're using the desktop
optimized office apps or trying to
navigate all the windows elements that
come in tiny on such a high res screen
you'll want a mouse and keyboard the
type cover is by far the best available
option and it comes in a bunch of
great-looking colors too the smaller
black touch cover is easier to use as
well though without any clicky keys it's
still not as good an experience even
more than the iPad the sir
- his designs replaced most of the
things your laptop can do and everything
the surface - does it does just
amazingly better than last year
Microsoft upgraded from a dual core
Tegra 3 processor to a quad core Tegra 4
along with 2 gigs of RAM and I can't
describe how much better it is to use
this device it's still a smart phone
level processor but everything happens
so much faster so much smoother games do
occasionally still stutter and lag an HD
video and Internet Explorer can be
choppy especially when you're
multitasking but the last surface had
problems scrolling it had problems with
apps crashing and the whole thing
started to bog down as soon as you had
more than a few apps open here those
problems are gone battery life is about
the same as last year even with a higher
res screen and those big performance
improvements I always got a full day of
heavy use before it ever died the
problem though is that the surface 2
can't do everything it just doesn't have
the apps the Windows Store is growing
and apps like Facebook and Flipboard are
a great step in the right direction but
it's still a long way behind and it
can't rely on desktop apps like the
surface pro 2 can here you're stuck with
the store and that's just not great the
surface 2 is a great device for reading
but there's no pocket or Instapaper just
worse third-party alternatives same for
Instagram or do even really
cross-platform apps like Wunderlist
you can replace some of those apps in a
browser but they're never as good or as
easy to use being able to multitask and
put two apps side by side while you work
is really nice but Microsoft has the
same problem amazon does if you use Xbox
music and SkyDrive and Office and
outlook comm and Skype and OneNote
you're golden otherwise there's a really
good chance there will be more than a
few critical apps you won't find in the
Windows Store and even while Microsoft
builds its offering of existing apps new
ones don't ever seem to come to the
platform at first using a surface 2 is
lonely in a way iPad and Android users
are getting a steady stream of cool new
apps while the surface slowly builds a
back catalog and that above everything
else is why the surface 2 still falls
short Microsoft's done basically
everything it can with the hardware but
it can't solve the app problem by itself
the surface 2 is a great way to watch
movies or listen to music but the iPads
better it's a decent office machine but
it really needs a mouse and keyboard or
a more touch optimized app to be great
and even then that's not worth four
hundred and forty-nine dollars
I still like what Microsoft is trying to
do and with both Hardware tweaks and
some of the new changes in Windows 8.1
it's inching in the direction of
becoming a device that works well as
both laptop and tablet right now though
in both cases it still falls short
