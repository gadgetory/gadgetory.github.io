we're going to take a look at a
playstation vita 3g running on a CMT's
network running title unit 13 my name is
Aurra and i'm associate producer on unit
13 we're going to show it to you here on
the playstation vita as you can see we
are connected to a team teas network
right now i'm going to go ahead and
launch into launch into unit 13 here you
can see that it's all touch control
really cool
some of the cool features about data
that are pretty exclusives the first
first handheld system to utilize to true
analog sticks we've also got a
front-facing and a rear facing camera on
this thing we have touchpad not only on
the front but we also have a touch pad
in the rear it also supports gyroscopes
gyro technology it also has the ability
to connect via 3G as you saw and Wi-Fi
as well we do also have support for
memory cards so you can go anywhere from
4 all the way up to 64 gigabytes if you
want and this game is very asynchronous
socially competitive which means that as
you saw the leaderboards or a very big
part of this game they're going to be
it's a type of game where you know you
and your friends challenge each other to
see who can get the best scores if i
unlock the 180 star guy I can actually
share that to you on my PSN friends list
and then you can play it for like three
hours you have three hours or so to play
at once even if you haven't unlocked it
and the six different operatives all
have unique scoring capabilities so as
you level them up their scores varied
based on what their specialties are and
we also have chaining together for
headshots for melee kills we're staying
stealth for a certain period you can
even get extra bonuses for stuff like
blowing up mines and killing a killing
an enemy with it
we're actually releasing globally around
the same time so when it comes out here
it's going to be coming out relatively
in the same period of time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
