at a drone tailored more towards
travellers and videographers called
anafi now i had to test two units
because the first one that i got wasn't
working that well and the second year
that I got works a little bit better
than that one
and now if he does introduce three
features that you can't find anywhere
else but is it enough to rival DJI it is
so close to being good but there are a
lot of queries that I just can't ignore
this regarding the software issues I had
there also design decisions that I just
don't agree with let's start with the
hardware when unfolded and ready to fly
the carbon body with glass fiber is
similar in size to the Mavic hair but
when it packed up for travel the anafi
is noticeably larger and just harder to
fit in a bag the SD card slot is placed
100 the battery in a lockable tray that
reminds me of this old cent raise you
would find in Nokia phones also there's
no way to check the battery level once
the batteries plugged into the drone but
at least it lasts a little bit longer
than the Mavic air does there is no
internal storage in the drones so
forgetting an SD card which happens more
than any of us would like to admit suit
becomes an issue although it's nice that
there is a 16 gigabyte SD card included
in the box but the most important
feature when it comes to drones designed
for videographers is the image quality
and this is where Navi shots its 4k 100
megabits per second bit rate footage
looks great I also prefer a Nafees flat
profile better than the Matic here which
kind of helps me color correcting and
post the ability to shoot aged our video
is one of the three features that you
can find anywhere else on the drones in
this price range but I'm just not happy
with how that footage looks it's a
little bit too noisy little over too
saturated and just looks unnatural D not
the second standard feature is the
ability to shoot upward so you can tilt
the camera 180 degrees and shoot up
towards the sky
it's nice but I haven't really found a
lot of use out of it and the last unique
feature also my favorite is an obvious
ability to digitally zoom without losing
quality while filming in 4k you can zoom
up to 1.3 times and if you're filming in
1080p
it goes up to 2.8 even though I can do
similar things in post-processing by
shooting in 4k and down rising to 1080p
I really like that feature because it
kind of puts you in a mindset where your
frame your shots they're friendly and
nowadays drone footage is becoming very
repetitive and very recognizable being
able to change your aesthetic without
having to buy a you know more explicit
drone with interchangeable lenses is a
welcoming change alright let's go back
to the things that I didn't like about
this drone well left in a hover mode it
was kind of drifting away from me which
is just mildly scary
we're shooting HDR which only works in
4k by the way it was hard to tell when
it was on or off and some of the
settings that I chose never got applied
to the files and some of those files
were also just gone a lot of the issues
that I just listed can be fixed with a
software update but it makes for a
stressful piloting experience every time
I switch back to my maverick air
piloting is fun again anafi lacks that
confidence and with good reason one time
when I was testing its sensor at the
bottom of the drone just by putting my
hand underneath it this drone just went
flying in circles finally it crashed
into a tree luckily that wasn't the case
with the new unit alright let's talk
about the remote controller you get it
is massive it does feel good in your
hands however but be prepared for it to
take up a lot of space in your bag ever
since the DJI introduced for moveable
joysticks it's hard to get used to
anything else the phone holder also
doubles as an antenna and despite a few
bad connections I initially had the
Wi-Fi connection otherwise was stable
throughout if you don't want to carry
this big oliver mode you can fire and
off it with your phone as well alright
now the battery it is a little bit
better than what you get with the
mattock here it's 25 minutes and I think
that's really a good spot for the drones
that are meant for travelers and people
want to go and the fact that both
battery and the remote can be charged
there USBC means you can easily charge
it in your car or when
colonel battery pack so that definitely
saved my ass a couple of times and you
don't get that luxury with DJI drones
where you got to spend some money to get
all the add-on accessories with it
honestly I had high hopes for this drone
and I really want all these software
issues to get sorted out because this
door has a lot of potential and we do
need another player in this space
competition is good it forced you to get
better and if force you to get more
innovative in a world of drones DJI is a
clear market leader but wooden avi
parata's may the best competitor for DJI
in years couple with all the unique
features this drone is actually gonna
appeal to a lot of people but
considering it's only $100 less isn't
worth taking that risk there's a ton
more detail in the written post so go
check that out if you have any other
questions just leave them in the
comments and I'll get back to you bye
see ya it's cold</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
