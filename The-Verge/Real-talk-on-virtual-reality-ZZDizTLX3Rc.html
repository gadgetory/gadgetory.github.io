the stuff of films like The Lawnmower
Man and Johnny mnemonic it looked
pointless or just silly in retrospect it
was also the stuff of books like
Neuromancer and Snow Crash a magical
alternate world so ambitious that the
most powerful computers today couldn't
build it but virtual reality it turns
out might mean none of those things the
first time I tried the oculus rift it
was only a prototype held together by
duct tape I spent a couple of minutes
slowly walking around a low-resolution
virtual spaceship the year was 2013 and
virtual reality was actually coming in
the following months people started
releasing demos that could only have
worked in VR you can feel vertigo on a
steep cliff or have your head cut off
with a guillotine first person shooters
became genuinely first person John
Carmack one of the fathers of modern-day
videogames left the company he helped
found to work on the rift at the 2014
Game Developers Conference virtual
reality was vindicated Sony announced
project Morpheus its own headset for the
PlayStation 4 promising partnerships
across the gaming industry less than a
week later Facebook yes
Facebook bought oculus but even a
Facebook has grand ambitions the last
year has been about finding the limits
of virtual reality including the fact
that simply walking around can be
literally sickening at GDC the oculus
demos were low-key one of them just put
you on a couch Sony's were slightly more
ambitious but sometimes this only
highlighted their shortcomings my hands
kept shooting across the room with the
Move controller and when my diving cage
started shaking in one demo it just made
me realize that my body couldn't feel a
thing that's where VR is at right now it
can genuinely trick you into thinking
you're somewhere else but disrupting the
illusion is easy that doesn't mean there
aren't some fantastic things to do eval
Curie is a space fighting simulator that
makes you feel like you're really inside
a cockpit horror games are a natural fit
when something jumps at you it
practically jumps into you people have
created virtual dioramas of places like
Jerry Seinfeld's apartment and relaxing
virtual vacations like a flight over
Iceland the near-term future of virtual
reality looks a lot like these
experiments developers will figure out
what works on present-day headsets and
Sony oculus and Facebook will keep
trying to build hardware that raises the
bar
the rift is a black box and project
Morpheus is an ergonomic Tron headset
but under the shells they're not so
different both put you in an immersive
world that leans on your brain to fill
in the gaps they're a bit blurry a bit
confining and in the rifts case a bit
heavy reading anything at all is painful
we still don't really know how to
interact with them do you use a standard
controller a motion control setup a
giant treadmill but Facebook and Sony
are betting that these are all solvable
problems for now the rift and project
Morpheus are still gaming devices first
and foremost neither is a consumer
product and sony says it won't release
one until 2015 oculus hasn't set a date
but it just started selling the second
version of its development kit in the
next year we'll probably see marginal
hardware improvements and much bigger
software ones oculus doesn't want people
to have to take off the headset to start
a game and creating a usable interface
is a vital step towards making VR
practical outside Sony and oculus a
small group of companies are creating
experimental rift controllers and a
competitor is trying to beat the curve
by making a mobile headset all of which
takes us to Mark Zuckerberg huge bet on
virtual reality as a platform of the
future one investor even likened it to
Google buying Android right now it feels
impossible for now it probably is social
interaction in particular is a core part
of Facebook's plan and that's not one of
the rifts strong points but Facebook is
willing to wait a decade for the bet to
pay off and that's enough time for VR to
either quietly fade away quietly replace
the Internet as we know it or at least
quietly become a new information channel
like mobile phones and gaming consoles
the 1990s give us one VR hype cycle and
if we want VR to succeed we shouldn't
buy into another you're not going to get
addicted or forget about sex and it'll
be a long time until you can throw away
your keyboard the better we understand
what the oculus rift and project
Morpheus can and can't do the better
we'll be able to experiment with things
they might be able to do and to create
things that people will actually use
right now and most importantly we'll be
able to examine what we want out of
virtual reality and whether Sony and
Facebook are the ones to provide it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
