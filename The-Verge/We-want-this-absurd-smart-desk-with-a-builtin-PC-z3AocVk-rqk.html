- Hey, it's Nick Statt
with The Verge here.
And we're checking out
the Cemtrex Smartdesk.
Now this thing has a wild number
of features built into it.
It's got a wireless charger,
it's got touch screen displays
motion control, built
in wireless headphones.
It's a lot going on here
so, let's break it all down.
(upbeat music)
So let's first talk
about the displays here.
It's got three 24 inch
touchscreen displays,
but what makes this really
cool is that it's got a
built in Leap Motion module, right here
at the base of the keyboard.
That way you can do hands-free gestures.
So for instance if you wanna
scroll without touching
the track pad here, you
just move your fingers.
And then if you wanna zoom in or zoom out
you can use two hands.
And they've also got some
other gestures too for
copy and paste and other things like that.
They also have special
customized touch screen
controls for moving windows
around really easily
without having to drag and drop.
(upbeat music)
so it's got a built in keyboard here,
and it's a pretty nice
keyboard from what I can tell.
Other features the desk
has built in include
this wireless charger over here.
It's working with my 10S right now
it's a Qi wireless charger.
And they've even built in
wireless headphones here.
If you just slide this out you get
your own wireless earbuds.
They've worked with a
third-party company to
develop these in-house actually.
I guess the idea here is
that you would have these
integrated headphones
for taking phone calls
so you'd never ever need a desk phone.
Now if all that wasn't
enough, they've even included
a built in document scanner.
So you have a document here, you can just
click &quot;Get started&quot;, flip it around
put it there, and then with
one tap you have a document.
Now the PC is built in.
It's integrated right here under the desk.
And while it's a standard PC
it's got some pretty nice components.
So there's two configurations.
Both of the configurations
come with an Intel 8th Gen. I7
and 256 gigabytes in a solid-state drive.
But if you pay a little bit more money,
you go from 16 gigabytes of RAM to 32,
you also go from a one
terabyte standard hard drive
in addition to the solid-state drive
to a two terabyte one.
And then you also go from a
NVIDIA GeForce 10-50 GPU to a 10-60.
So in terms of pricing the
Smartdesk is not gonna be cheap.
Considering all the things
they've packed into this device.
Now the base model which
comes in a matte black finish
not this nicer reflective
finish you have right here
that's gonna cost you 4,500 dollars
now if you want the better components,
the better GPU, the more
RAM, and this better finish
on the desk that's gonna
cost you 5,700 dollars.
Now that is not cheap at all,
but Cemtrex considers this
more of an enterprise product.
So it's not something
you would as a consumer
buy, it's something if
you were running an office
if you're an office manager,
or you're outfitting a whole
floor with new desks, new
computers, the whole thing
you might consider this for your company.
And you might actually consider
buying multiple of them.
They've actually designed the
layout of the desk so that
multiple different ones
can be configured together.
So if you're a company with
a lot of money to spend
you might actually consider buying this.
They're really positioning it
as the Smartdesk of the future
the future of doing work in an office.
