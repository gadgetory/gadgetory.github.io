and the brand new Samsung Galaxy Note 9.
This year, Samsung hasn't changed
a lot of the stuff
that makes the Note 9 truly special.
In fact, they doubled down on them.
The display, the battery
and the S-Pin have all been revamped.
Overall, it doesn't feel like
an amazingly different experience,
compared to last year's Note,
but it is still an improvement.
It's an evolution more than a reinvention,
but this could end up
being the Galaxy Note
that fans of the line have always wanted.
The Note 9 looks almost
identical to last year's model,
except the fingerprint
sensor around the back
is now below the camera
and easier to reach.
It comes in blue and pink
and if you get the blue model,
it comes with a bright yellow stylus.
It has an ever-so-slightly larger screen
than last year's Note 8.
6.4 inches versus 6.3 inches.
Everything else is the same,
so there's a headphone
jack, water resistance,
wireless charging, USBC, and
of course, a bixby button.
The more substantial changes
to the Note 9 are elsewhere
starting with the largest battery
that's ever been in a Note phone.
It's 4,000 milliamps.
And since the Note 7 disaster
hasn't yet been forgotten
Samsung is taking some extra precautions
with its own safety checks
and also having it validated
and certified by the outside companies.
Above all else, the Galaxy
Note 9 is about productivity.
Getting stuff done.
This year, Samsung has
built decks into the Note 9,
so you can use it like
you would a desktop,
by plugging the phone
into an external display.
The Note screen can be used
as a track pad or keyboard,
when working on documents and decks.
This turns the Note 9
into a really portable PC
with minimal fuss.
Samsung is loading the Note
9 up with powerful hardware
and best in class LTE speeds,
to make sure it's fit for that job.
There will be two models of the phone.
A 128 gigabytes storage
option, with 6 gigs of RAM
and the top end, 512 gigabyte
version, with 8 gigs of RAM
That much memory should make the Note 9
a true multitasking champ.
The Note 9 runs on the
Snapdragon 845 processor.
But Samsung says it has made
improvements to the GPU.
There is an even a new
water carbon cooling system
in the Note 9, which is
supposed to keep it cool
when you're playing games, like,
you guessed it, Fortnite.
I even asked a Samsung
rep if there really is
water inside of the Note 9,
and it turns out, yes there is.
The rear camera is pulled right
from the Galaxy S9 Plus,
and has the same dual
aperture capabilities
with a secondary lens for portrait shots.
New this year, is AI-powered
scene recognition.
The Note 9 will try to
automatically detect
what your subject is,
and adjust things like contrast,
saturation and white balance,
without you having to
do any of it yourself.
The camera will also alert
you if a shot was blurry
or if someone blinked.
This type of thing doesn't
fair so well in other phones,
so we're gonna have to figure out
if the Samsung's
implementation is any better.
You can always turn it off
and stick to the manual or
auto modes, if you prefer.
And, because this is
a Samsung Galaxy Note,
of course there's an S-Pen,
which now has Bluetooth
low energy built in.
Bluetooth gives Samsung's
stylus new functionality.
It's button can act as
a remote camera shutter,
a presentation clicker,
or, control your music.
By default, pressing
and holding that button
opens the camera.
But you can customize it
to open any app you want.
It works from up to 30 feet away
and Samsung has built in a super capacitor
for rapid charging when
it's inside the phone.
You should never have to worry about
the S-Pen's battery life.
Pre-orders for the Note
9 start on August 10th
and it ships on August 24th.
The 128 gigabyte model is $999.00
and the 512 gigabyte version is $1249.00.
But Samsung is cramming everything it can
into the Note 9, to make
it it feel super powered
and super productive.
So overall, the Note 9 definitely
is an improvement over last year.
But it's going to take a full
review and living with it
to really figure out if
it lives up to the hype
and if it's worth the upgrade.

(laughs)
Oh my god, Stefan!
(laughter)
It hurts inside.

It hurts inside.
