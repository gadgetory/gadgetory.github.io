booth at CES and we're taking a look at
their flagship es 8000 TV this TV
supports their new smart interaction
features for voice control and motion
control we're gonna go to their booth
and take a demo this in just a minute
this is our beautiful 8000 a 2012 series
on behalf of Samsung Electronics we're
delighted to present this product to you
hi TV wonderful so if you noticed I just
turned the TV on utilizing my voice we
will be featuring three different smart
interactive features which are voice
control face recognition and motion
control channel number 14
channel 14 all right there we go
volume up don't cancel volume up volume
up mute on TV power off cancel save that
for later
this is a wireless IR blaster this will
be included so it communicates directly
via IR signal to your set-top box okay
so this is essentially a bridge between
your cable box and the smart
interactions correct okay so you were
able to demonstrate that just right off
the bat by saying channel number and
then going to the channel that you want
it to logging into Smart Hub you are
able to now instead of using a numeric
password or what it was in the past
utilize your face as your password and
also Smart Hub is the applications the
Smart TV to access all of your content
your media everything okay so go ahead
and do that
hi TV Smart Hub
canceled
hi TV
okay just to drop that down so this is
just what an overview of what a
smartphone page looks like and this is
now in high definition so much better on
the eyes you can customize your page and
whatnot high t-v login so at this point
if you'll notice if I can direct your
attention to the top center of the TV
there is a camera that is built-in again
it comes with our 7500 and 8000 series
LED televisions it is a stripe
application camera as well as a facial
recognition camera so at this point it
has now not only taken a picture of us
but it is now going to recognize each
individual person and it has already
recognized me as I have set up my
account right as a smart TV or smart
Hill user okay which is nice so just
launch me automatically right in with a
high TV logout and last but not least we
are going to demonstrate okay our motion
all right so just by a wave of the hand
we are now able to utilize our hand as a
cursor so the wave is the activation the
wave is the activation okay so you can
see that right here my hand is the
cursor okay I'm just going to go right
into our web browser and in order to
select that we will close our hand once
open it back up and then we will launch
right into our our into our content or
so what's smart about this is that there
is no more need no need to double click
if you will this is just a single shoot
so we've created what is called a
virtual cursor so I'm going to go ahead
and activate the cursor again so if you
see this virtual cursor extends so that
your hand does not have to be directly
on the link that you would like to
access so targets any link that is a on
a page courage to move near it right as
long as you're within range
okay so to select one of those links
again close my hand open it back up and
we are now into our next content that we
would like to view don't conclude the
demonstration I would love to have you
again come up and using voice control
power the TV off all right let's give it
a shot I can remember so I believe I
have to say hi TV TV power off okay
wonderful</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
