acer aspire s5 this is supposed to be
the thinnest ultrabook yet i believe
it's 50 millimeters in height when it's
closed and it comes to this very neat
little I arrangement back here there's
the button on the side which respond
right here's our state right so I pause
it in and brings it back out comes with
a very special noise it also actually
lifts the laptop up come around to the
front took a look at the specs is
actually an Ivy Bridge laptop so it's
one of the first time which laptop so
we're going to have it as a 1.7
gigahertz quad-core processor has intel
HD graphics 4000 and also comes with the
AC aces new clarify media and clarify
photo apps these are basically some
cloud sharing apps which you can use
with your Windows PCs and Android
devices so it doesn't mean that your
photos or your media is actually in the
cloud they're not they're just loaded on
your computer but this application with
an android device allows you to put up
your computer and and download things
during the 40-year old appliances so
this looks like brushed aluminum over
here including space over here you go to
the labels HDMI a couple of USB ports
and suppose the thumb book for mixing
power I can actually
open it up actually this is the other
thing instant on so I believe the laptop
went to sleep but then when I open it
back up again not since Lee back one and
press the button here now we can take a
look this is the first laptop with a
Thunderbolt port outside of apple's mac
laptops so there we go this is the acer
aspire s5 brand new ultrabook introduced
here at CES 2012</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
