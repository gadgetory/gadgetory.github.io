psychic I'm Nilay Patel this is a real
90 seconds on the verge once again
google has managed to confirm the
upcoming Nexus 5 without actually
confirming it for a brief time last
night the newest flagship Android phone
appeared in google's official Play Store
the starting price was listed 349
dollars but no other details were
revealed in early September Google
accidentally showed off the Nexus 5 in a
promotional video for Android 4.4 KitKat
and then subsequently pulled the video
even still many believe that all these
leaks are intentional google has yet to
reveal anything official about the nexus
5 but I'm personally hoping it has a
half decent camera because that would
actually be surprising Sony's finally
hit a milestone it's been trying to
reach since january of 2011 the
PlayStation 3 was the best selling game
console United States for the month or
September a record held by the xbox 360
for the past 32 months but hey
congratulations Sony for hitting the
mark on the very last month this could
possibly matter the xbox one and the ps4
go on sale in November and finally
everyone's favorite eccentric
billionaire is a phrase I just said he's
real and he's doing things again Elon
Musk confirm that he has purchased the
transformer will submarine car from the
James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me
unfortunately the car in either drives
nor transforms but that's not a problem
for Musk who plans to upgrade the car
into an actual transformer with the
Tesla powertrain I just want to say the
following words submarine Hyperloop
transformer that's it for today's top
stories coming up tomorrow we reboot the
Verge's the tents psychological thriller
was always meant to be Nathan dies</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
