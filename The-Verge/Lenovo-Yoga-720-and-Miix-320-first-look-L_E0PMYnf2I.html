I'm taking a real quick look at a Nova's
latest yoga lineup and a surprise $200
windows 2 in 1 laptop the Nova is
refreshing its 7 Series yoga liner this
year with a 13 inch and 50 inch models
the 13 inch yoga 720 includes the usual
flipping hinge you'd expect to see from
Lenovo yoga range but with the latest
Intel seventh generation processors 16
gig of ram and up to a 1 terabyte of
hard drive space or 512 gig of SSD
storage at nearly 3 pounds it really
feels and looks like a solid machine
especially at a starting price of just
eight hundred and fifty nine dollars
lenovo has included a precision trackpad
and a responsive keyboard so you're not
the likely going to have any issues with
any wonky windows trackpad see both the
13 inch and 50 inch models feature a
fingerprint reader the works of Windows
hello just to log you in to Windows 10
itself and support for a stylus to draw
on the display and use features like
Windows ink stylus support is a nice
addition especially when you can fit the
yoga 720 into a number of different
modes the biggest difference with the 15
inch model is the ability to purchase a
variant with NVIDIA GTX 1050 inside the
Nova is also opted for 4k screens on
both the 13 and 15 inch models but we
have to see how that affects the battery
life you can opt for models without the
4k display which should boost the
battery life by around about an hour or
Corning turnover that means the 13-inch
model is estimated at 7 hours with a 4k
display and the 15-inch should last
around about 8 hours the 15-inch model
is priced at a thousand $99 and both
will be available in April the main
surprise when a nova announcement today
is a new mix free 22 in one it's a
tablet that includes a detachable
keyboard like we've seen on lots of
different windows two-in-ones but it's
too priced at incredibly low price point
of just $199 lenovo has tried a similar
windows combination in the past but the
build quality wasn't that great this
latest model includes a 10.1 inch
display and is powered by an Intel Atom
x5 processor 4 gig of ram and up to 128
gig of storage you can buy variants that
include LTE support but the surprise
hardware Edition here is a precision
trackpad usually cheap Windows laptop
track pads are totally awful but a
precision trackpad makes navigating
around windows and
much better experience as this is a $200
tablet the specs on the best but for a
basic machine you get two USB ports on
the keyboard portion along with the USB
type-c and a micro HDMI port on the
table' itself the tablet docks into the
keyboard base with magnets and it feels
kind of sturdy if not a little bit small
on my lap when I'm typing it's a
surprisingly cheap Windows two-in-one
and it's clearly designed for Microsoft
to compete with low-cost Chromebooks
then over is making the mix free 20
available in April for $199 so that was
a real quick look at lenovo's new yoga
lineup here and the mixed free 20 tablet
