just disappears without a trace we don't
know where he is we don't know where
he's going we don't know what he's doing
we can only hope he's okay that doesn't
mean we don't have a show for you stay
tuned is coming up next hey welcome to
the Virgin Mobile show i am chris sigler
and this are this show is presented by
the samsung galaxy note you may notice
that I'm a little rusty here Peter
usually does this I want to apologize
for the flow of this show which is not
going to be our normal buttery smooth
stuff but I'm joined as always by vlad
savov Vlad hello and we also have a very
special guest to replace theatre because
it wouldn't be appropriate for us to
have anything less than a troika we have
ross miller who is joining us from our
new york studio ross thanks so much for
being here i'm proud to be here une
hookah for the troika and other foreign
words the what wait huneke what what is
one-third of a troika anyway it's a new
note guy he's got a point oka okay
question my logic it's flawless clearly
yeah no I'm I can't argue with your
logic if if Rosalie already made read
and from casting I promised I'd ruin
everything as fast as possible uoka
would be too okay and you know go would
be one more minooka quad Roca we can
keep going but we won't instead we'll
talk about nokia so i think is the first
big piece of news of the week of course
stephen elop laid off 10,000 people or
is in the process of laying off 10,000
people which is just terrible for this
company that what percentage of of their
workforce is that why do you know uh off
the top of my head no no i don't but
it's a thorough chunk but it looks a lot
i'm not i mean this is terrible for the
people themselves because they lost
their jobs you know
doesn't need explaining while as a bad
thing but for Nucky itself it was pretty
much necessary like a lot of people
still feel that nokia has more cutting
to do it's such a massive massive
company it's essentially built out and
designed to be a leader in selling
mobile phones and that's not where Nokia
is today so now it's kind of cutting
itself down to its market share reading
where exactly are the cuts being made
mostly there's some in canada right
canada they're shutting down their
factory in finland one of their
factories in finland yeah and i think
one in somewhere else in europe if i'm
not mistaken of course we could all just
look at the post were not let's let's
pull up our post and yeah I think the
big the big thing that people were burns
up about was shutting down the Finnish
factory I saw actually quite a few
people in Twitter citing the video from
nokia world 2011 where Stephen Elop was
so proudly showing the Lumia 800 and how
it's being produced and how much care is
taken about it and how much how much of
it is finish built-in made and all of
that stuff you know he's really talking
up the whole finish heritage and and
then now as gone but most part you know
this has this finish factory is where
they've historically built most or all
of their high-end smartphones is that
right yeah yeah and then they shuttin it
down um you know so I mean one thing a
Stephen Elop said in the subsequent
conference call it had was that nokia is
still finished to the core and nokia
will remain finish forever whatever but
it does kind of feel like all the words
because the fact of the matter is nakia
is production and manufacturing are not
no longer in finland like every part of
it is moving over to China right so all
that naki really has left now is its
design jobs which is to has and that is
still happening in Finland for the most
part from what I know
but it's still you know it isn't the
company that you used to be as much as
Stephen Elop would like to paint it as
that finish you know source of finnish
national pride but i mean they've moved
they moved a lot of their engineering
resources to sunnyvale to they have that
big new office on the west coast right
in the heart of Silicon Valley so yeah
it's um you know I I feel like I'm torn
because on the one hand I feel like
Stephen Elop is doing some of the things
that were set up like he had no way to
avoid some of these things they were set
by the time he got to the company all
these wheels were in motion and so some
of these cuts he had to make but still
that's just a terrible number of people
to be let go and it's not the kind of
news that you want to convey both your
consumers but your customers and to
investors when you're trying to make
this big windows phone push we're
expecting some big windows phone news
later this week which we'll get to later
in the show actually but yeah this is a
this is not good at no and the other
thing is that with these 10,000 jobs in
toto since elope is taken over the CEO
position he has got over 40,000 now um
which i think tomorrow Wow Thomas ricca
from our team put it really well in
saying that yes Stephen Elop is jumping
off the burning platform but he's
leaving 4,000 people on it ya know so
yes he's a leader yes he's a captain but
he's doing the exact opposite thing of
what the Honorable captain is supposed
to be doing well is it i mean if those
40,000 people cut actually save the ship
or save the burning flat form as it were
it may be a horrible decision to make
but it may be the necessary one to save
everyone else I guess 40,000 yeah but do
we know how big the company is as a
whole even before that let's get some
numbers let's uh let's find some total
employee numbers here hey chris is gonna
wikipedia that for us right now he's
good he's gonna come back like two
billion people if I could reach through
this skype conversation and strangle you
right now I would uh no okay so
according
2 i'm not using wikipedia i'm using
google crying to google nokia had 120
4292 employees as of mar 31st 2009 so if
they've cut 40,000 employees and what
the last year and a half two years yeah
I'm thing like that yeah yeah so simple
math would suggest that they have
roughly 80,000 employees remaining which
is still a huge huge company you know I
was working on that that palm piece for
a long time and you know that they did
everything that they did from you know
2007-2008 through the HP acquisition was
done on under 2,000 employees I think at
all times and at the end I mean they had
just a few hundred so when you write
when you put that in perspective it's
like what are these people doing umm so
so it is easy to see why and how Nokia
could still survive on a much lower
employee count especially since they're
they're outsourcing so much of their
their smartphone platform to Microsoft
but still that's and of course symbian
is me we talked about this last week's I
mean is being run out of Accenture now
so yeah I mean I can totally see what
why it would make sense for those
employees to go but still that's just a
sit I'd said thing to hear and no key
stock to cook took a beating I think
glad you brought it up last week they
were down what twenty percent or
something I'd forgive reach 20 buddy go
above ten percent it was really dying
news but actually actually to Ross this
point I think that that is the realist
perspective the fact that Nokia was
already huge and you do have to cut it
and that is basically only chance to
survive because Stephen Elop and the new
executives they has put in charge that's
the other thing I think he's new chief
something officer is a lawyer and he
replaced quite a quite a few the senior
people as well so he's done a bit of
reshuffling there as much as they want
to put a happy spin on things nokia's
cash reserves
are running out you know nokia is losing
money every quarter and is forecasting
is going to keep losing money every
quarter so things aren't going to just
magically improve while you're still
employing such a massive workforce so
the things that he's cutting our first
of all the people that's the biggest
human impact but he's also cutting back
a lot of research projects he has said
that nokia also prioritized some markets
specifically the u.s. the UK Western
Europe in China because China is big
growth market Western Europe and the USA
is where you make your money and also
the speculation is Stephen Elop hasn't
conserved with speculation is that the
multi me OS which was supposed to be
some sort of middle ground between the
Asha phones s40 and Windows Phone has
also been shelled and now it's basically
what about Windows Phone so what if he
if he had if Stephen Elop had not
already put all of his eggs in the
Windows Phone basket he certainly has
now it because shelved he shelved every
conceivable alternative harmattan is
long since if not dead and gone and
certainly in a state of the state of
stasis and melt unless there's some
crazy skunk works project going on in
espoo but um Mel Tammy was was another
big project for them that yeah I mean
they could have potentially fallen back
on that head Windows Phone fallen apart
and if they freeze that than the other
they're just they're just going full
bore on on Microsoft and I still think
we could we talk about this literally
every week I'm still bullish on Windows
Phone in some a foolishly optimistic way
and we'll see what they have to to
unveil this week I want them to succeed
I want them to be competitive I
desperately want a meaningful third
horse in this race but but yet it's not
looking very good right now there's more
nokia news too though right because they
sold virtue to inequity thank you to you
yeah big news you're in the market
action so doubutsu phone yeah so here's
the really good news here's the great
news about them selling virtue
is that it probably means that they
won't be stuck making as 40 and symbian
devices now because every single device
in the vertu lineup is as 40 or symbian
which you know I'm sorry if I'm if I'm a
multi-millionaire and I have 20 or 30
thousand dollars to blow on a phone I
don't want to send me in device with all
due respect to to the good people
working on symbian and who have worked
seven the money and I don't want to
symbian advice anyway come on what I do
want a gold-plated windows own though
yeah 24 oh no not gold plated rock oh
sorry sorry cellco yeah a little rust
rust is not a pro sorry but i will say
low known fact about this deal it was a
about 249 million dollars which in fact
was paid in their two phones about 10 of
them seal the deal yes that sounds about
right uh yeah that's the filing yeah
what's there it's fact so my question is
uh you know what without having the the
umbrella of a company like Nokia I
wonder where virtues going to get its
guts you know we've seen a mode labs
which is a french company succeed making
devices for companies like tag heuer and
i think they did a Christian dwyer phone
year or two ago or do or I don't know
how you pronounce it but anyway they've
made a few fashion phones and years
multi-thousand dollar fashion phones and
they seem to be doing okay so maybe
vertu can survive doing that kind of
work but you know white label stuff but
but they're they're going to have to
pick their guts very carefully from here
on out I can't imagine that they want to
stand symbian maybe they'll just become
a Windows Phone house I don't know but
then they they don't have as many
opportunities to differentiate on the UI
I don't know why we're spending this
this long talking about a phone Brandon
know there is a reason there is a reason
because this is actually building us up
into one of the most amazing segways
ever because you just said all of the
virtue phones opportune I have been
severe s40 but actually we saw a
supposed league which is showing a 64
gigabyte virtue with Windows Phone on it
Anna is interesting
we don't know this answer pretty
legitimate and we don't know this
necessarily something that's going to be
going to market but it is interesting
because windows phone hasn't had any 64
gigabyte devices yet so that's one thing
the other thing is that this new
integration for skydrive storage which
is showing off by screenshots I've seen
which is another thing all of which is
pointing towards this when the phone
summit which is coming up tomorrow how's
that for sale yeah I like that which is
it's it's very good segue but before we
finish with Nokia okay I'm sorry haha
your segways glad I apologize it was
beautiful what a heck I wonder oh you
were you had this all set up you had a
plan you want take a bone I love the
Segway if you if you had a plan to get
back to nokia i'll allow this egg way
all right okay okay let's see what so
let's yeah let's talk about the Windows
Phone summit um we're expecting Windows
Phone 8 News you know it's it's about
that time where they need to move past
mango and tango and talk about Apollo
and and there are a few rumors floating
around right we're we we saw what was
about a week ago we saw some skype
integration shots that were leaked from
somewhere we've heard rumors over the
past couple months in fact we had a very
credible source come directly to us and
say that current devices will not be
upgradeable to Windows Phone 8 which is
the biggest slap in the face in the
history of the mobile industry and I
went on a Twitter tear when that when
that story broke in fact you want to go
back far enough in my timeline you can
dig that up and enjoy oh we talked about
Mia the story from a last April or this
past April other like that sounds about
right that's about as bad as I'm saying
and if I recall like the didn't issue
denial the issue this kind of we're
working on it we're trying to figure it
out of the issued some kind of niall and
realize that wasn't accurate can someone
catch me up on this one so that the
latest we have on this story that I'm
aware
unless unless fled you want to crack me
but I but we had a source come directly
to us and a credible source and say and
it that's all we can say credible source
come to us and say that current devices
will not be upgradeable to Apollo but
that is I believe all we know official
well it's not official but that's that's
all we know that we can say it's
probably correct everything else kind of
speculation and leaks at this point but
we're we're pretty we're pretty
confident about this upgradeability
thing what that means for people who
have bought devices like the titan to
the Lumia 900 even the Lumia 800 it is
unclear hopefully we'll get some clarity
on that this week in fact Microsoft is
going to have to give some clarity on
that because that's going to be one of
the foremost question questions in
people's minds it's not just about it
III don't want to get on my my soapbox
for too long here but it's not just
about servicing the customers who bought
the Lumia 900 and the Titan tune devices
like that that have come out in the past
few months it's about preserving your
credibility as a platform supplier that
wants to that wants to create phones
that will not be obsolete adore will not
give off the air of obsolescence within
a few months of their release and that's
really important you know Apple has been
so good about that you look at what I
os6 even the 3gs is upgradable right and
that's the benchmark that companies from
every OEM for both windows phone and
Android need to be shooting for they
need to be looking at Apple and saying
that's what we need to accomplish and
you know it's it's upsetting because I
mean for example the Nokia Lumia 900 I
may forgive the focus series for not
getting windows phone upgrades I want to
know why exactly on a technical level
that Lumia 900 which by the way is the
end of the smartphone beta test is now
itself I beta model that can't get
Apollo exactly that's a great so much
credit yeah they've lost so much
credibility or they will if that happens
so we'll see I mean we're expecting this
is
developer focused event this week which
i think is you know microsoft has done
that for a long time right going back to
like mix in 2010 when they first issued
a lot of guidance on how developers
should attack windows phone 7 and it
makes a lot of sense because they need
to get developers on the same page so
that by the time devices hit the market
by the time the upgrades if upgrades
exist hit the market will have products
in the pipeline new software in the
pipeline so but we're expecting news you
know we can we can obviously we have a
long history from events like WWDC and
blackberry jam and all these these kinds
of events of extrapolating
consumer-focused news from the developer
events and i'm sure that's gonna be the
case this week as well yeah she's going
to be a big events as well yeah it's two
days right I think well I'm not sure
about the overall event but just the
presentation looking at because theta is
going to cover that detail Brown going
to cover that for our team and from what
I understand like the whole presentation
to journalists and the whole or at least
the initial stuff presumably including
any potential hands-on opportunities is
going to wrap up in the afternoon
whereas it kicks off at nine a.m.
pacific time yeah i'm kinda imagine
microsoft is gonna go through a whole
heap of things is i mean not you know it
exactly sacrus it's time for windows
phone 8 to be revealed at least two
developers is it's time for us to see
what's going to underpin all of these
upgrades i also feel like if it's enough
to blow us away enough to you know
capture attention in people's
imaginations maybe we'll be more
forgiving about the fact that the
upgrade isn't coming to lumia 900 will
hate it more because we would like to
have it on lumia 900 but if we see a big
enough technical gap exactly as ross was
asking if we see a big enough
technological leap between 7 and Windows
Phone 8 then maybe we can find it more
forgivable and say okay you could have
made these new changes without cutting
compatibility with the old stuff and and
there's still the possibility that
Microsoft kind of the way that Samsung
has been doing with the android phones
they did an upgrade 204 point
my kind of back pour some of the windows
phone 8 features to the windows phone 7
devices yeah that's such a hack though I
mean Elia know what we fight for from
our perspective from up from a geeks
perspective we might forgive them if the
technological gap is large enough but
that doesn't account for the consumer
who you know all they know is that
they've been left behind literally you
know two or three or four months after
they bought their device I mean Louie
900 isn't going off shelves anytime soon
right it's probably gonna be sold right
up until the release of Windows Phone 8
if not beyond so uh you know that that's
a huge slap in the face if two weeks
before Windows Phone 8 is released and
the first devices come to market you buy
a Lumia 900 and you're just you're
you're left behind it really really
bothers me and it's I I don't know and
it doesn't sound sincere as well because
yeah I mean Ross's point is great the
Lumia 900 was supposed to be the end of
the smartphone beta test why don't we
say beta I mean this i'ma go to write
but what I was saying better this shows
like every single show ago this time
abita no this time I'm in tune because
Ross said the tone thank you for us
thank you I'm gonna I'm gonna mess with
your mind Vlad it and if you start out
by saying beta I'm gonna say Vlad is not
beta its pita and if you say bead I'm
gonna say bled it's not beat its beta
you already do show Chris you're already
doing it don't act like you're just
gonna stop now but yeah I mean russells
point exactly ah the thing if you is
Microsoft and it is not here tell people
this is a big leap whatever you thought
about as a smartphone before forget
about it this is the new smartphone and
the truth then you're making a statement
affect people and you need to back that
up whereas if you then go back and then
call it six months later let's say it
takes Microsoft a while to get Windows
Phone 8 to market if you then turn
around and say no actually this is so
much better this is the new smartphone
then you know people do those memories
aren't that short you know and they
won't feel like we can trust you anymore
then they will be like well actually you
just give me a marketing Shapiro and a
marketing message where's the thing with
who is as exact as as much exaggerations
Apple might use with all of this
revolutionary and resolution airy which
is like the worst mix of words I've ever
heard Apple kind of delivers on its
promises okay not on magical
revolutionary but it it kind of treads
the fine line the fine balance between
promising a lot and then delivering on
that whereas if user is going to promise
every six months this is the next real
smartphone and then just upgrade away
from it and then try and sell people
holding you other one then it doesn't
work right right and i'm going to i'm
just going to throw caution to the wind
and say you know when they did the mango
upgrade they actually as long as it took
it did get to most of the phones out
there granted there were not a lot of
windows phones at the time but microsoft
took a lot of effort doing so so until
we hear otherwise i'm going to have hope
at least one phone out there in the
market will get an upgrade probably the
lumia series because nokia more than
anyone probably knows what's up with
Apollo all right great a whole other
mess true because one of these phones
expect so similarly that if you upgrade
one then it's like wait wait why isn't
mine upgraded also the questions without
you cooperated that's but yeah that's
been going on for three years in the
Android ecosystem though like there's no
rhyme or reason to what phones get
upgraded when and which ones are left
behind I mean I think the consumers it
you know especially people that vet
Android devices in the past and are
upgrading to Windows Phone like they
they're just used to that nonsense as
terrible as it as it is and then we're
also in the developer summit I mean app
developers have to now develop for
Apollo but if you develop for Apollo and
it doesn't work with all the other
phones what the mark what market do they
care about are they not going to use the
new features are they just going to go
for universal p or they're just gonna
say well there's not a lot of Windows
Phone out there excuse me Windows Phone
users out there anyway i can just ignore
the ones are currently there and focus
on the new market and what's special
about that and we're already at
fragmentation in a very young platform
right it's a very sore point yeah yeah
and and the other thing is microsoft
even how far we move
from the introduction windows phone 7
way about 18 months two years two years
here thereabouts well I mean sure our
some receive me two years and three
months something like that vamsi
introduced talent of 2010 nose at mwc is
keep guessing I'm going to use the power
of the Google's exile babies won't be
back okay yeah okay well yeah no no
that's fair enough i mean i was actually
thinking when it was actually introduced
to market but you're right Chris it's a
it's actually introduction to developers
was my be c 2010 right that's correct um
so actually microsoft finds itself over
two years removed from that and as ross
says still kind of pitching to
developers the idea of a potential
market because a polo is the one that
potentially is going to expand the
market and get some real market share in
a real foothold which isn't you know the
best assessment of what's happened over
the past few months well so Stephen Elop
one of the things that he said in his uh
in his really dark address last week is
that they are receiving ongoing support
I came over the exact verbiage that he
used but it was something to the effect
of we're receiving ongoing support from
Microsoft which comes soon as a closer
no 250 million no is something he can't
be $250,000 a quarter is it if it is a
quarter million dollars a quarter nokia
is getting ripped off um yeah I think I
think 200,000 that is a quote to my not
cover Steven he loves salary probably
does right you're right um see it's a
substantial payment yes it's 250 million
I'm sorry yeah and and so Microsoft by
all accounts is firmly I mean as it was
a day one they appear firmly committed
to brute forcing their way into the
market which is the only way that
they're realistically going to be able
to do it right they can't they're not
going to be able to do it just by saying
hey check out this cool
because they haven't been able to so far
and webos is a prime example of why that
doesn't work you know the only way you
can do it is is with a lot of money and
a lot of patience and so so I still you
know I hate to keep driving this point
home but I'm very bullish on the fact
that I believe that Microsoft is
eventually going to be able to buy its
way into a very firmly footed third
place whether nokia is a part of that
whether they remain an independent
company one that does finally happen I
don't know but but I do think that's
probably going to happen and let me also
raise another point admit to see this is
in service of my next segue but you know
whatever i'm working the segways today
i'm probably big issues and one of the
big issues of Windows Phone because of
the fact that it's a relatively
standardized on specs and relatively
standardized mean he's totally
standardized so Hugh's experience really
was how can manufacturers differentiate
themselves and I mean I wondered about
the same thing um but what I saw from
Microsoft yesterday when it introduced
is new surface tablets was actually will
hang on this is a Windows 8 tablet that
differentiates itself really well for
more the others and it's done just with
Hardware just with hardware and just
with pretty good design so bring it back
to Windows Phone I think there is
definitely still room an opportunity for
all of Microsoft's hardware partners to
do something that really sticks out and
stands out from others they just need to
as you say Chris invest a lot you know
go with some actual investment of
resources and money and time and plow
those things in because what I saw with
the the windows RT and Windows 8 tablets
for Mike's but was a great deal of that
and something that really does stand out
but then II also kind of has
implications for that's Microsoft want
to do the same thing with phones produce
its own hardware I mean everyone spec
relating the virus of might as well buy
Nokia now because it's kind of growing
to be cheaper than skype at this point
mhm um but let's talk about surface talk
about surface because we said its
tablets but it's so damn interesting
that we should address it and get stuck
into it right and it also is a nice I'm
gonna have my own segue here I'm gonna
backtrack and give this a shot because I
as excited as I am for the windows phone
developer conference that's a that's an
event that Microsoft actually spent a
few days planning whereas the surprise
event was kind of out of nowhere and
they came in kicking I mean this is a
surprise surprisingly good announcement
it was really weird the way this was all
set up the fact that um we didn't know
that the members of the press did not
know until literally hours before the
event even where it was in LA but like
journalists were just told to come to LA
and chill and await further instructions
so the common belief was that and Ross
you you may have been deposit that
someone posited this it was that uh that
you know knowing the location of the
event would give away the the the
subject of the event and that turned out
not to be the case right like milk
studios had nothing to do with with the
surface so I you know I think that this
event was very hastily planned that they
pulled it they pulled off a relatively
smooth event all things considered but
there were a few very important thing
missing from yesterday's announcement
right we don't know critical things like
battery life and much more important
more importantly available in price yeah
it you know until we know that the
surface at least in Windows RT forum is
going to be no more than an iPad and
preferably less it is vapor where I
don't throw around that term loosely but
quite frankly it is a completely
irrelevant product until we have those
details and they do need to at least
match the iPad in price one of the
things that killed the touchpad was the
fact that they sought to go head-to-head
with the iPad which was a non-starter HP
needed to subsidize that device to
by its way into the tablet market they
failed to do that until it's too late me
that's about my gran hours that's
Microsoft's problem in actually entering
the hardware competition because all of
Microsoft's fans all of the analysts
will say exactly what you just said you
either price it on par with the iPad or
much more preferably you price it below
the iPad because one is incumbent and
leading the market and the other one is
non-existent in them but if Microsoft
does if Microsoft just cuts its profit
margin on the surface tablets to zero or
close to zero word Microsoft's hardware
partners end up because as a hundred
partner first of all you haven't invent
invested as much in designing your
tablet and I know they haven't because
not too many companies are planning on
coming out with some special magical
magnesium cases and gorilla glass 2
screens and all of that fancy stuff and
the integrated king stand just I mean
the whole surface package like in
Hardware terms that isn't the PlayBook
or the kindle fire it's not just a black
show it has a lot of really nice design
touches in it and then right if
Microsoft actually competes with the
iPad on price it's screwing in some
hardware makers so how do you reconcile
the two how do you beat Apple without
beating yone OEMs I don't think I think
that Microsoft is finally at the point I
think that they're getting fed up at the
executive level with the products that
they're there chief OEMs have produced
complete pieces of garbage like the HP
Slate that have done that have not
served Microsoft well in any way
whatsoever and if Microsoft can't rely
on its OEMs to produce competitive
products what is stopping them in the
long term from becoming a completely
vertically integrated manufacturer what
is preventing them from going the Apple
route and completely blowing companies
like HP and asus and acer right out of
the water nothing I mean that is that is
a possibility it just that would be a
really major
a change and what word it would leave
where does that leave samsung and Acer
and all them stuck with Google who
themselves I've always you know kind of
play favorites with certain devices with
her Nexus series was supposed to be
setting the tone yeah but what if Google
does the same thing where's that leave
everyone else in terms of platforms to
use yeah it doesn't hear inscrutably
right it's this weird interplay of
hardware and software that historically
i mean you know going back 25 30 years
microsoft has sort of been the this
constant that has allowed the entire pc
industry to throw I've and it's getting
to point where Apple is eating
everybody's launched so hard that I
think that it might be time for
Microsoft to consider a radically
different approach we know for a fact
that they have design chops right look
at Metro which is still very very
attractive in a rate of UX and the
surface is proof positive that they can
produce I mean you know I don't want to
oversell it we need to review it we need
to see if the hardware really lives up
to the hype but from the initial
impressions it we have every reason to
believe that they have the design shops
and the manufacturing chops through
their relationships with with ODMs to to
produce world-class hardware and we've I
see I iPad matching hard work yeah
everything there from the arc mouse
which I still think is one of the best
mice you can get to even the Xbox itself
especially the slim which is a gorgeous
piece of industrial design I mean I
something we can do yeah thank you know
II USM now Ross name the xbox is a good
example because think about the first
well the first gen original xbox which
was just a PC in a plastic show it's
true but I also think about the first
gen xbox 360 which had all of the
overheating issues and other you know
reliability issues well no yes what I
mean Vesta fide slim for a reason i will
give you that the xbox 360 and the
original xbox are pieces of garbage and
of course there's the kin here's the kid
yeah well I probably blame that on sharp
can't you you could just lay down on the
shelf although it was Microsoft design
so yeah Microsoft design they put a lot
behind it
they should know better and okay look
the kin one remains to this day an
innovative piece of hardware the actual
hardware itself was never the problem it
was the the go-to-market strategy it was
the fact that Verizon screwed them on on
plan pricing there were a lot of
strategic missteps they're both on
Microsoft's part and on their partners
parts but it was not the fault of the
hardware i don't think the kintu was was
pretty forgettable but the kin one was
pretty cool but but one point one other
point I want to make about the surface
is that that Microsoft I believe only
needs to match or preferably beat iPad
pricing with the windows RT model I
think with the pro they have a little
bit more breathing room to say look this
is this is not just a tablet it's also
the best PC you can buy and we're going
to price it like a premium PSA fair
enough yeah I mean that's what this will
Microsoft have said what I was just
going to add to the Kin commentary is
that Microsoft completely missed out on
a big opportunity by not branding and
designing the king one to look like an
accessory out of Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles I seriously if they did that I
would have bought one I wouldn't have
used it but every time I would see it it
will make you smile and you know think
about a happier world but yeah let's
actually get back to that um about the
availability point we can actually
extrapolate quite a bit about the
availability of the surface tablets
because microsoft said that the RT the
arm-based surface tablet will be
available at general availability of
Windows 8 which is expected around
september-october and the inter based
windows 8 pro version of the tablet
should be available three months after
that so cheers inside for Christmas so I
mean those are the release dates that we
can speculate on the pricing that Steven
Sinofsky said was that the ARM version
will be competitive with other arm based
tablets which to me basically said we're
going to match the ipad in price that's
my interpretation of the sandusky
language and the inter one will be
competitive with
books which basically says like 79 98 99
just some crazy prices for a tablet I
think I think that they need to beat
with the windows RT model I think that
they need to beat the ipad by fifty
dollars on account of the display alone
yeah yeah i mean the ipad display we
kind of forget how crazy that display is
and let's not forget that the physical
mental holidays grant it is competing
with a 500 our new ipad a few months
after holidays it's competing with a
four-hundred-dollar or three hundred
dollar new ipad with retina display as
they go down a price as the new ones
come out it's a very good point so if
they're going to have any lead time it's
going to be very minimal so yeah like
chris says you have to price very
aggressively even the pro model yeah
apples scale in the supply chain is
absolutely deafening like it it crushes
competitors left and right uh it
happened it happened to palma it's not
as likely to happen to microsoft but
microsoft simply does not have the
hardware scale that Apple does and I'm
sure that they are still fighting Apple
for components even with the sir I'm
sure that that demand for ipad
manufacturing both on the kona side and
final assembly is putting some
constraints on the surface I very very
little doubt about it they've really
kind of sucked all of the air out of the
entire mobile industry supply chain in
China I'm really curious what odm
they're using through the surface we I
think we've heard rumors of quanta and
Foxconn right I don't know about rumors
but I'm curious ooh like that was
actually my first question was who's
actually building this yeah I mean I did
I mean my expectation honestly was to
get something closer to the blackberry
playbook and kindle fire like something
kind of stock kind of well he's just you
know a tablet and then make it
Microsoft's own but Microsoft has really
gone to town on designing this thing so
it kind of is um like like the Kin it is
Microsoft pushing its own design
credentials forward which is nice cause
just a little bit ago
Microsoft has had some brilliant
successes and some less brilliant ones
so it has kind of a checkered past I do
feel like from what we've seen so far
these surface tablets are going to be
one of those my designs that we look
back on if they get I was good one and
but again it's going to depend on
exactly the same thing I said they would
akin which is a software the software
just coming to critical in my
circumstance that's the interesting
thing about the announcement something
that Microsoft I felt when I was
watching and correct me if you felt
differently they talked a lot about what
the surface is but not what it can do
it's almost an assumption that yes it
can do windows and you should know what
Windows is and what that means which is
almost a shame to me because Microsoft
its biggest attribute is not necessary
the hardware and it's not necessarily
assuming people get what's great about
Windows it's this huge ecosystem and
where it works everywhere in your life
mobile tablet home entertainment now
especially and I would I would have
loved to see more of this is the surface
this is great hardware a great design
but this is how it also accentuates
windows in a way that you might not have
thought to do before you might actually
want to get windows as opposed to
sticking with it because it's not an
iPad or OS 10 yeah that that's the crazy
thing to me about Windows 8 is that I
feel like this is the first time maybe
ever or maybe since like the launch of I
don't know windows 95 or maybe XP back
in two thousand one where Windows is it
has the opportunity anyway to be cool
again right like Metro is something that
you want to play with an experienced and
see what it's all about like I think
everybody on the verge team and probably
all of our listeners want to at least
play with the windows RT tablet they
don't know if they necessarily want to
buy one yet but they want to check it
out they want to see what it's all about
and and that's something that is an
advantage a consumer advantage that
Windows has has very very rarely had
through its its 25-year history so
that's it's exciting i'm happy to see a
company like Microsoft really start to
figure out a valid way to compete with
Apple is just saying on Twitter this
morning yeah i love i love the ipad i
love the iphone i love apple devices in
general but it doesn't matter how
she loved these devices you need a
competitive market in order to keep all
the products good and continuing to
innovate up and that is something that
the ipad simply hasn't had and and I'm
excited to see somebody try to finally
make a real go at it and that's an
opportunity that that the Android guys
like Asus have never really had a chance
to do I mean the transformer prime don't
get me wrong it's a great tablet but is
anybody seriously considering it
overnight I don't think so who does the
thing I mean when you think about a
transformer prime right now it kind of
gets whooped by this surface like I
could never be sold on the weight and
the bulk of the keyboard accessory for
the transformer prime but it's the
keyboard that Microsoft introduced with
a magnetic attachment and all that stuff
thanks slick I mean it's a car is
Samaria see Apple smart cover and
keyboard so that's nice I mean to rush
this point actually I don't think that
Microsoft has ever really been able to
property properly articulate the
benefits of its ecosystem which you know
it is to Microsoft great disadvantage
it's trying to is trying to give us a
pitch very much in the Apple and Google
mode whereas it really doesn't need to
do that I mean I'm not saying
Microsoft's old pitches were really work
in particular well but now Microsoft is
okay so they just showed off the netflix
app for windows 8 for the first time
while announcing the surface tablets
well that's exactly the point that Ross
was making Microsoft is such an amazing
ecosystem build up around the xbox 360
for example of entertainment and they
didn't they didn't mesh those things
together at all they were just like whoa
here's our custom-made netflix
application with smart pinches ooh it's
like when your cable Apple could have
that Google would have that anybody
could have that custom made netflix
application right Microsoft has never
figured out how to fully capitalize on
the huge win it has with Xbox and I
think that that speaks this is this is a
topic that's been covered in depth there
are many great articles on it from Mary
Jo Foley and others um the fact that
Microsoft internally
soft historically has been basically a
fiefdom right like there are these these
different divisions that are always at
kind of semi at war internally for
control of Microsoft's future there are
very very deeply rooted political
incentives for certain executives not to
work with other executives and for
certain product managers not to work
with other product managers and so at
the end of the day that puts Microsoft
as a whole in a pretty bad position
because that means the Xbox that entire
entertainment division of the company is
far far more segmented than it than it
should be and and that that sucks
because what they have with Xbox is oh I
think and Ross I'd love to get your
opinion on this but I feel like Xbox 360
has turned into one of the greatest
video game console stories of all time
okay so get into rock for a sec there we
go I mean Ross we need to hear from him
but I have the perfect analogy I need to
get it out I want to hear this about
what Chris just broke down and it's so
timely as well international football /
soccer for American for our American
audiences you have these situations
particularly with the Spanish national
team and the dutch national team where
clicks and groups of players will
associate themselves close with the
Barcelona football team or the real
madrid won and when they actually have
to come together and play in the spanish
national team they hate each other too
much and they can't come together as a
team like this has been Spain's problem
not so much the past few years but it
has been for years and years and years
before that they will have the most
talented teams in the world but the guys
when the teams hate each other they have
all these rivalries built up from the
fact that they compete constantly and
when you put them together as a team
they just don't chair on the dot mesh so
this is kind of the same thing I don't
know how much in several competitions
there is within Microsoft play it was
like a really fitting analogy I like it
I really wish I knew what you meant and
those players because that sounds
awesome I'm sure I'm sure my loyal
audience of you can listen that's a cute
with like yes glad not gonna lie
god I do wish I knew European football
more no I think I think I think you're
absolutely right i think there's there's
a Disney lesson to be learned i guess if
you were of everyone working together
metro being kind of the tent pole that
they're trying to make it Chris to your
point to get back to that what you
wanted I'm not going to say that xbox
360 is a great game console success
story I will say it's the best set-top
box story home entertainment device
because uh yeah yeah cuz to point uh
sorry the closest to your point I think
Microsoft is not looking the xbox so
much as a gaming console anymore as a
way into the TV to the big screen right
Netflix and Hulu or big plays a smart
glass at e3 i think was one of the
smartest moves that microsoft had it's
like this is how a Windows Phone device
a windows tablet windows 8 device and an
xbox can all work together in a way that
you want to own all three and if you
don't own part of the ecosystem you
don't own the phone you can still use an
iphone but you're going to want the
Windows Phone app because it is better
it is Microsoft's thing and it's a
further integration to a system you want
and that's that's Microsoft's beautiful
potential so you want to use it is well
you're probably gonna like something
that Microsoft does and we can now tell
you that you want the rest of it too
here's a couple little features but
we're not going to force you we're going
to kind of we knew into it in a sense
yeah yeah but whether or not they
actually do that hmm I'll tell you what
though there is one thing that the
surface tablet was missing and that one
thing was the PureView camera from Nadia
I imagine Microsoft came out with the
tablet with a beauty if if if I ever see
any company come out with a 41-megapixel
tablet I'm quitting not just this
business but life I I'm done I don't
want to see any 41-megapixel tablets
that's a warning to the entire industry
can I interest you in a 42 megapixel yes
that would be fine Michael I'd be okay
okay with 42 41 42 is the right answer
for Chris yeah yeah
right so you want to talk about the 808
PureView to uh is coming on sale in
America it's coming to America I don't
know we can really talk about it is it's
happening i mean it's it's kind of crazy
because another one of these we're gonna
set it unlocked on amazon for a really
crazy price and that will buy it 699
pretty much the same way to nokia
distributed lumia 800 it's a bundle with
some bluetooth speakers and stuff for
like 8 99 for Microsoft tools I have no
idea then you have to be a crazy crazy
nokia enthusiasts to go and spend that
kind of money on one of these phones uh
particularly with the ADA appear here as
well which is running symbian which you
know even if you can forgive the really
tiny screen resolution and the fact that
this is not a phone but actually a
camera that can make phone calls as
symbian and as much as you know this is
gonna piss off guys XD village field
it's a dead OS and there's a very good
reason why I said I think that Steve
Litchfield understands he has a healthy
understanding of the fact that symbian
is a dead end and so does every mean it
is impossible to ignore at this point
the the the question becomes can you can
you survive on symbian and and do you
want to you know we I think just last
week a new beta of gravity came out
which is the the well-received Twitter
client for symbian which I believe as
far as i can tell remains the only quote
unquote good application for symbian
devices and it is somehow become like
this champion app for the entire
platform so so there is still some
support out there but yeah seven hundred
dollars is completely insane Aaron just
just messaged me to have me point out
and this is a good point yesterday no
key it's said that beta white would only
work over 3g on AT&amp;amp;T and they have since
updated their post to say that it'll
work on 3g on tmobile as well which
makes a lot of sense because of course
nokia is known for selling Penta band
devices and that's something that
they've done for a good year to now
but yeah I'm not going to buy this I
don't know I can't imagine very many who
are the cameras cool but you can buy
some really terrific point-and-shoot
cameras for a lot less than seven
hundred dollars that's the thing I was
just thinking at six hundred ninety nine
dollars I'm pretty sure i have a sony
NEX series camera mm-hmm and then still
have a couple hundred dollars to sign up
for contract and get like you know a GS
free or an iphone or something else
already nine hundred if i still want to
stay in loads not here i can have a
Lumia 900 and a point issue that would
do just as well as the 808 for the same
a firm price right yeah it's the
technology and weight is amazing but
it's you know they're they're they're
packing all this technology in there
only to get the images roughly as good
as as a camera with better optics you
know because that they're not
constrained by the you know the same
physical constraints as a camera phone
is so yeah I don't know seven hundred
dollars that's that's a lot to pay for a
Symbian Belle device did he did he even
try to work with the carrier's on this
is what I want to know or they just say
this is kimo was not gonna want his
first not gonna want it US cellular's
not going on and I'm gonna bother
18-team verizon well if the unsubsidized
price is seven hundred dollars you're
asking any carrier to accept at least a
five hundred dollar subsidy before they
start selling it and then no Carrie will
probably think this is worth 199 when it
has compete with what else compete with
so then carries will be like why she
generally sell this is at $99 up front
which means then the carrie has to bite
off a 600-pound six-hundred-dollar
excuse me subsidy and then monkeys like
you know forget it we're just said the
carriers are they re the the carriers
are very picky about their uh about the
software that's running on the phones in
general and i'm sure i would bet my
bottom dollar that eighteen t and
verizon at the very least
have both black belts and being at this
point there's no question in my mind
yeah and and tmobile i believe the last
symbian device officially sold by an
American carrier was the ascent on Team
Center ascend on tmobile which was just
a c7 um yeah that was a issues as well
late last year I think yeah yeah that
was introduced at ctia last spring if I
memory serves me correctly and it's been
since discontinued I would be shocked if
any US carrier ever carried another
symbian device it would absolutely blow
my mind in fact do we know is there any
evidence that there's going to be any
symbian hardware after they to wait is
is this it I mean it would be a great
swan song for the platform you know that
this is this is platform that has been I
mean as much as it sucks now it if you
go through the history of the mobile
industry it is actually a very important
platform both for nokia but then also
you know it's sort of a huge role in
sony ericsson's history and scion before
that was just got a quarter by Motorola
Solutions actually and this would be I
feel like this would be a great book end
on symbian story to finish it with this
you know really kind of groundbait a
groundbreaking device that has just
maximal specs I don't think you know
probably will be the last one because
the very reason I mean the 808 PureView
really shouldn't have happened to but
the very reason it came out at all was
that naka he'll be working on technology
for so long and had been working on it
just integrating it into symbian making
sure photography stuff and symbian work
together that that was really the reason
to introduce it on a Symbian device
thank you know it had it in stabs and
presumably Stephen it up and senior
management team were like you know let's
just release this thing we're not like
we're going to get a lot of credit for
it which everybody's given the credit
for the technological achievement let's
go like that lets you know give some
fruition to all of our teams hard work
etc etc so the release on symbian i I
just can't see where
and what justification doc is going to
have to release another symbol phone so
yes I do you feel like this extremely
quick quixotic or chaotic device is
going to be this one song symbian i
agree with you chris is fitting one I
would just like to point out we have we
have somebody in comments here old
drunken sailor who says sony ericsson
ran uiq not symbian uiq was a skin on
symbian so as was s60 and then s60 and
Symbian kind of became wanted at one
point after uiq died but yike he was
actually based on symbian and that all
came from epic which was a scions
platform which powered the series three
the series five the series five MX all
the same thing underneath underneath
this game um anyway we should move on we
we still have a lot to talk about this
this podcast could go on for another
year uh what do we have any more nokia
stuff to talk about i think that might
be it yeah which wrinkly we could
actually reverse a little bit and come
back to microsoft surface and tablet
situation and I mean this is the point I
was raising about where Microsoft's
decision to enter the tablet market puts
OEMs and one of the big ones LG at least
in terms of volume of electronic devices
if not success as decided that it's
going to put tablets on the back burner
which essentially means it's just going
to exit the tablet market and focus
completely on smartphones and we've seen
LG do quite a few optimist pads try to
compete with Samsung's Galaxy Tabs it
hasn't worked out nobody is like them
they've had some interesting technology
in them they had three cameras which
again nobody like so doesn't surprise
that never succeeded but it is
interesting that LG which does make
laptops it doesn't sell them in the US
or the UK at least until recently wasn't
selling them in the UK just isn't going
to play ball with Microsoft at all and
try and do it all
sort of ultrabook or maybe the idols but
but you know ultrabook competing intel
based tablets or Windows RT tablet with
arm it just saying you know we're gonna
take a break from this in focus and
smartphone whether there is no years did
they don't see how to make any money out
of the business be honest right that's
it right they um there's this really
weird and depressing long tail in the
tablet market where uh you know after
the ipad you have a couple standout
Android products like the transformer
prime that maybe be profitable on some
level and maybe one or two of the
samsung's just because they're so
ubiquitous on all these different
carriers and they pushing through a lot
of different channels but then beyond
that you have all these other products
like the zai boards and the optimist
pads that are selling for near iPad
prices but couldn't possibly be selling
in any volume whatsoever and we've seen
that bear out with LG's announcement and
then after that you have at the very
bottom end mark you have the 79 and $99
tablets which are just complete garbage
but they're able to to pump them out and
get some traction by selling them like
drug stores and stuff right but but yeah
there I don't see how there's any room
for these guys to play especially as
long as they're they're working with
with Android I mean the thing the market
I see for them is you know it might
sound patronizing but I feel like is the
uninformed consumer a perfect example
for me was somebody while I was flying
between the u.s. and the UK somebody was
unboxing a sony tablet s and I just felt
so sorry for him because I knew he
picked it up you know in the duty-free
shopping area and he thought well you
know it's cheap over here it's just so
many tablet how bad can be now I'm sure
he might have been impressed by a nice
packaging in the first hour or so but
probably by the end of the flight he was
like yeah I could see how bad it can be
you know I want to tell me I'm not gonna
lie I still want a tablet p do you like
it's a little screen back its dual
screen is it oh let's give it up stop
Kristin look at me out stop crazies your
screen is Messiah has
sewing just work done no no this won't
dismiss do screen inside like if you
took two iPads of the new version or if
you took two of the macbook retina
displays and just like I do not know no
two iPads does not count as a dual
screen tablet that's not awkward yeah if
you did that with those viewing angles
yes but you don't do freaking juice
cream with the nasty horrible viewing
angles that you get with Sony's cheap
LCD but no and I mean here's the thing
they like you need software dedicated
specialized software that knows how to
handle two screens if you're gonna try
type on one oh good god have mercy on
your soul we've seen countless people
try we've seen the kyocera echo is in
the acer iconia we've seen the DA yeah
which is just dumb luck that it actually
worked The Courier is still figment of
imagination which means it's awesome
because you've never had to use it yes I
have yet to see a dual screen device
that I actually care about I think we'll
see foldable screens before we see a
dual screen device that actually matters
jigar cordobas greens well vailable is a
beautiful dream I mean like they've been
talking about like flexible and foldable
screens for like literally since I was
like a toddler like this has been going
on for so long remember HP uh was his
name the guy who's at cablevision now
earn at cablevision see a confession
that the CTO from HP he always used to
yeah like Walker everything like imax
something me no that's not his name uh
man i I don't know i hit retired he was
part of the design team yeah he retired
and now he's with vision i think but
anyway point is that we've seen so many
companies bandy around these mythical
flexible displays for ages and samsung
appears to be finally ramping up
production of some flexible oled but i
still have yet to see a compelling form
factor for any device that makes me say
oh yeah I can see why that's practical
and why that's usable and why that
should be important
me when I'm shopping for my next phone
will see but and I understand the need
to want something like a bigger screen
that you pull your pocket you can
actually like lay it down you've got a
7-inch display that like is four inches
in your pocket I get that but as soon as
you see that hinge in between how are
you going to live with that how are you
going to be okay with that and how are
you gonna have to like buy new
specialized apps that actually use it
and are designed for that's a very small
ecosystem I don't think there's going to
ever be a big one that actually uses in
a way that's going to make sense yeah
well and another thing at the same time
people use two displays on a desktop you
know and there isn't a hinge between the
two there's a massive bezel like at
least an inch thick when you put it to
display side by side people find the
benefit in being able to you know split
up the motor task in workflow have one
bit here one bit there sometimes you can
just use one screen to play back a video
whatever I can see the scenarios I a
comedy see it see them to Ross this
planet can't we see them being as
compelling when you're on the move
because when you're on the move you're
even more of a single Tasker than usual
and a lot of people who done some
research and looked into it realize that
we we don't human beings actually motor
starts very well at all we just single
task in rapid succession but i can see i
could see the value of it in the benefit
of it but once again roster spot on you
need like really really good software
which nobody is done and nobody's
related to get it close to doing and so
just bring it back to G then or
particular close to doing it I know they
aren't and and to your point fled every
single mobile platform that has any
traction whatsoever right now
acknowledges implicitly that humans are
primarily single tasking when they using
their phones right because with Android
the multitasking is non-deterministic
you don't know when an app is going to
close behind the scenes iOS shuts down
background tasks after 10 minutes i
believe and Windows Phone has that
tombstoning thing so there there is no
way to truly run many
applications at once like you would on a
desktop and that alone unless there's
some fundamental change in the operating
system that that make sense for
consumers that alone makes a dual screen
phone less compelling which to your
point is interesting because windows 8
itself even the RT mode has a few
interesting development requirements
including the little second sidebar
widget which we make a lot of sense
first I can screen even when that's not
a full size second screen yeah which
means I'm gonna have to eat a little bit
of crow here and say course you might
actually have a good windows tablet in
the works yeah I uh I i I'm still going
to buy a Tai Chi but y'all can enjoy
your surfaces okay we need to give a su
some massive critic here Tai Chi is one
of the coolest names I've heard over the
past four years agree I've ever you want
to tie your even without crazy to
display stuff yeah yeah I agree I feel
you know I feel really really bad for
asus and acer who have been just
churning out all these wild form factors
and tablets for years now and it you
know it they just don't mean to what end
right like Microsoft with one fell swoop
can decide that it's going to just eat
up the entire is going to eat up all of
the mindshare around windows RT and and
that's that yeah so let me see what yes
you can't feel bad about it and yes
Microsoft is I just don't see an angle
or perspective from which Microsoft
isn't building up to screwing its OEMs
hard like they'll sell because windows
devices just sell that popular the
ubiquitous etc but they won't save as
much with Microsoft Azure sacrus sucking
up the older mindshare but on the other
hand let's not be too charitable to asus
and acer because if we actually look at
their performance on android asus
introduced the PadFone exactly a year
before I brought it to market computex
2011 and ASA
it's cloud mobile device was revealed by
the if design award that he got just
before see bit which was months back I'm
still going to come out until sometime
in the third quotes or whatever let's go
into this flagship coming out in
September ish time competing on like
January 2012 specs against what's going
to likely be a deluge of brand new
android phones right including
potentially a new jelly bean phone right
and tablet yeah these guys these guys
have it rough you know there's there are
the haves and have-nots those that own a
platform and those that don't and it's
going to become it's going to be very
dicey these guys are going to have to be
very nimble to stay run over the next
few years I think right and then most of
them have done a pretty good job of
hedging their bets they're playing both
the Android card and the Microsoft card
I wish there was a viable third card for
them right and you gotta say like it's
dumb sure they're all very very scared
of Microsoft line Nokia and Google
actually using Motorola in any yeah like
useful way beyond patents of course but
yeah cuz if both them's become
full-blown hardware manufacturers and
put a huge concern effort behind it
where does that leave these third
parties and right what is open schools
yay right I've lad return via blackberry
I guess that I wanted to reach through
the screen and strangle you should be it
wait wait here's a very simple summary
of where webos is HP was selling off
touch pads on ebay that's how bad it got
for HP itself like it was in fire sales
of its web OS devices let that dream go
people yeah it's uh it's gonna be a long
uphill battle for them there's there's
bada there's bodies a shy yourself
Christmas that now you're just doubling
up with my droning oh yeah i'm i'm i'm
trolling you guys pretty hard right now
no i mean like tyson uh and boot to
gecko both are i think are interesting
initiatives um in that they are
in a way continuing web wes is legacy of
making viable html-based you X's and
we've seen Tyson do some pretty
interesting things but again I mean like
all these platforms you can you can make
cool-looking platforms and devices till
you're blue in the face unless you get
traction unless you get developers on
board unless you get big-name apps fin
set a thousand times there's just no way
to make those devices relevant unless
they can get that that ground swell of
momentum so yeah Tizen has long way to
go we should talk about our LG l7 review
these devices the hell else style series
was announced at mwc we first got hands
on back then there's the l3 which is
their little tiny phone l5 and l7 I
thought the l3 was like really cute kind
of has a xperia mini feel to it but the
l7 is their flagship product in the line
the entire line is a mid-range line so
calling it the flagship in the line
doesn't mean that much in terms of a
flagship Android devices overall LG
still has the Optimus range above the L
style range but the l7 is still a pretty
cool-looking product it's squared off as
a pretty sexy you I I think that you
know LG does a custom skin but I think
that's a little less offensive than some
of the other ones out there um but it
still didn't get the best review III
don't know what to make of a phone that
doesn't have a built-in ambient light
sensor these days like what a weird way
to LG for LG to save 30 cents off the
build cost of this night that is very
valid point I think I mean the l7 is
held back by LG cutting costs in like
really really obscure and we have ways
exactly as you mentioned and also
they're using an ancient ancient
processor in this thing so actually the
I think it's called yes the Optimus UI
three-point oh this is LG skin on top of
Android 4.1 of the first
comments on Aaron's review of the l7
were actually to say is it just me or
does this just look like TouchWiz on
Android 4.2 look like a ripoff I'm not
sure that it's necessarily a ripoff of
TouchWiz but then Samsung's TouchWiz
skin on top of android 4.0 has been
quite clean and minimized and restrained
and actually not pushing itself forward
it's actually been pulling back from
skinning the main interface so yeah LG
risk is gone for the same look and for
the same move and I've actually had the
chance to screw around with that on a
better phone because I've had the
optimus LTE and when you're not
hamstrung by the fact that you know the
elle style has a horrible ancient
processor it works really smooth and
really nicely i mean one of the really
neat things is the unlocking thing where
it's right now I love the unlocking
thing yeah yeah I mean this is in the
review erin has done a video of it and
it's really great you have this circle
which starts around your finger and then
as you drag out it expands and shows you
the last thing you had on the screen of
the phone before you locked it which
functionally might not I mean it is it
might be really rare that it helps you
but it's just a really cool thing very
cool thing to look at yeah and I think
that physically I LG has moved in the
right direction in terms of industrial
design I can't speak to it's been a long
time since I've I've held the phone
personally it was it was in late
februari but Wow time flies but you know
physically looking at the design of the
device it's a very attractive phone yeah
yeah and actually when I first pulled it
out and showed it to me I i confuse it
for galaxy s free um and it's a 1
squared off it's more squared-off yeah
then a galaxy s3 but it was attractive
and it was it was one of these things
that my first reaction was hey that
looks interesting yeah that looks like
something I might want to play around
with at least a little bit I'm right and
if I if I can just like
segue really rapidly I'll say that dr
san diego doesn't look like that oh the
orange san diego what a complete piece
of garbage like Intel should have been
doing everything in its power to make
sure that the first that that the
world's first introduction to Medfield
on Android or Medfield mobile period
would be like a groundbreaking
monumental experience in every sense of
the word and that's just not the case
right right and until design this this
is really annoying thing Intel designed
every single piece of hardware inside
the san diego this is the Intel what was
it the prototype device demo device
which now orange is just branding on top
yeah yeah and the same thing is is
miserable right yes yes um the whole
thing is an Intel production like
carriers have never been into Intel
chips they'd never liked the idea of x86
chips in smartphones because they
haven't really been power efficient
enough even though they've been powerful
weave you don't have the battery life
what's the point so winter has still
been forced to first of all work with
really small carries a small country so
this is why we're seeing things like the
lenovo k900 being in trees in china
before i show western markets getting
these devices but then even if you have
to design all of it as you say Chris if
the best thing you could say about the
design of your first phone is that the
back cover kind of feels nice to the
touch something has already gone very
well with the design stage right and in
it you know what sucks you remember it
was CES 2010 I think when LG introduced
that was the predecessor to Medfield
Wars town w 990 yes ma'am yeah right
yeah and and so they showed this
prototype LG that they said was going to
come out later in the year and of course
it never did but it was like a really
beautiful device and I think it would
have been an interesting differentiator
for both for Intel and for LG
he had actually yes come through with
that device the problem was that at that
time Android was not mature and it was
running some proprietary LG thing and
only recently has has google fully
embraced x86 is like a you know
fundamental part of Android and now they
have it like a native x86 emulator and
stuff so so that's that's encouraging
and well you know there aren't that many
app compatibility problems with the
platform but yeah if they had been able
to deliver two years ago I think that
until might be in a very different
situation than they are now yeah um
actually it's surprising in terms of app
compatibility because aaron broke it
down into top 100 paid and 103 and apps
and the top 100 paid of free games and
the san diego at the time of release
isn't really doing much worse in terms
of incompatibility then things like the
galaxy s2 the gas is free and other
android phones which you would actually
expect to be compatible with everything
and pretty much a iphone when it's
released is housing compatibilities and
has some apps that it doesn't work with
but it's a very high proportion
something like ninety percent over
ninety percent of apps the san diego is
compatible with so it will work and the
other thing I found is that the
performance is in these strong so this
is you know it the film below San Diego
is that it's priced appropriately like
yes we would love for Intel to make a
massive splash and just do this whole
new thing in the smartphone arena but
its price is a mid-range or slightly
less the mid-range phone but gives you
high-end performance so what you need to
do is become colorblind first of all so
you can ignore the orange skin and
figure out ways that you can you know
maximize its usefulness so the real
question is will motorola deliver on a
compelling medfield device because you
know that was one of the big stories out
of CES this year was the the Intel
partnership that they announced and
we haven't seen any devices yet we
believed at the time and I still believe
that Intel was heavily incentivizing
Motorola to make that commitment because
they would have no reason to do so
otherwise but you know we still haven't
heard a peep out of them I think at the
time they gave summer guidance and
yesterday I think was first day summer
wasn't like that so we're now in summer
it's time to hear about Motorola's
medfield efforts I wonder if Google's
purchase has influenced that strategy at
all or if they're there you know
continuing to move along with that
effort but hopefully they can deliver
something a little bit more compelling
than this well I mean they've promised
Motorola and formula to do multiple
devices over multiple years so you can't
expect that partnership would have been
codified in some form of contract
between the two and you expect they'll
have to execute but that also kind of
paints an interesting picture the one
that you were alluding to earlier Chris
which was you know what if this is the
thing that we're staring down the face
this scenario where Google starts to do
x86 and arm tablets and phones and
starts increasing it to produce them
itself via the motorola arm and a
Microsoft starts doing the exact same
thing you know branches out the surface
effort into the phone arena we're kind
of going to get stuck with just free
major companies who have the ecosystem
services software and hardware and that
would be our choice I know I was be able
to Renee I think I would be okay with a
world in which I could get my phones and
tablets from one of three companies
Microsoft Apple or Google I think I
would be okay with that two editions how
much you want American you are three I
would be totally okay with because I
gross you know I you I on some level
look at some level on some level I trust
all three of those companies to make
very intelligent design decisions and
all three of those companies hate each
other hate each other
so like you know they're they're very
incentivized to to compete and and you
know that they all have some very very
bright design people so I think that we
could see some you know and the rest is
kind of I mean like Samsung continues to
be Samsung in terms of the materials
that they're using HTC I love HTC in
many ways but you know I think that
they're you know in the long term
they'll probably get bought do you think
that that's a reasonable assumption to
make that HTC will eventually be bought
by somebody that would be so sadly
poetic I mean it started as a no-name
manufacturer to you know make phones for
carriers your t-mobile branded your
verizon branded had a few years arguably
couple decades with it's an email front
and then slowly wither back into
relevance I mean I was sad but poetic
well not not not irrelevant necessarily
I just think that like I I think that
they are HTC is in this interesting
position where they are small enough to
be a compelling purchase for a giant
company and maybe maybe that opportunity
has vanished since google has bought
Motorola and HP has proven that it has
absolutely no idea what to do with
mobile company and and Microsoft if it
buys anyone will probably buy Nokia so
yeah maybe that's completely ridiculous
notion so I mean so flat answer your
question to chris's point in terms of
hardware ID yeah I'm fine with just
having three choices but also it goes
back to what do you think hardware is
turning into and it's just it's just a
screen for the software I think your
talk about software companies yeah those
are the big three you may still have HTC
because like it or not since is a
compelling argument samsung has tvs and
processors and chips and materials and
they're still going to thrive with that
sony as a playstation brand and
everything that goes with it but yeah i
do see a special trouble for people who
can't make good skins on other people's
platforms who don't have other
compelling software solutions and who
make hardware that looks like everyone
else's i mean kudos for the PadFone for
trying to be different the transformer
certainly was a success story in a way
and if google does use them for
any rumored Nexus branded tablets that
will definitely be a boon to their
industry other companies though that
can't stand out in terms of software or
design I don't see them really having
much of a future and I personally don't
care if their stuff is on my shelves in
best buys so as usual route so but fair
enough oh yeah as usual you know I think
that it's it's it's only appropriate
that we end the show on a depressing
note oh I'm so sorry no no no no this is
this is this is kind of our thing we
always end the Shan a depressing note
and I don't think that we should break
from tradition um I I sincerely hope
that that the the dear dieter bohn will
be back with us next week because I am
completely incapable of running the show
in any sort of meaningful way but for
those of you who stuck through this
complete train wreck I appreciate it a
train wreck on my part not on my dear
guests Ross Miller's part Lauren Vlad's
have sales part but this has been a
complete nightmare for me if you want to
reach us by email as mobile show at the
verge com on twitter i am z power dieter
is back lon Vlad is let's say Bob and
Ross is oh no Rosco which is spelled
exactly how you would expect it to be
spelled I think apparently does
apparently there's a suppose beanie but
uh I don't buy it it's no II uh yeah no
no resign wise ease are very ugly I'm
sorry I've decided all right well thanks
so much for listening guys and we'll be
back to you next week bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
