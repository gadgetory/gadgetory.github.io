that looks less like a Fitbit and more
like a bracelet hello this is not a new
idea
jaw bones been doing this since like
2011
yeah but Fitbit is the market leader by
a lot how many jaw bones are out there
well I guess we don't really know so if
you're considering the new Fitbit Alta
what you need to know and how does it
compare to something like the jawbone up
so this is the new Fitbit Alta its
shipping now and it costs one hundred
and thirty dollars and this is the
jawbone up to it started shipping last
year and right now can be found online
for around eighty five dollars really
Fitbit one hundred and thirty dollars
yeah but cheaper isn't necessarily
better job owned there are certain
things that you wouldn't necessarily
want to cheap out on like an umbrella or
sushi or LASIK eye surgery okay so for
one hundred and thirty dollars what am I
getting with that
well the Fitbit Alta will track your
daily steps and your distance traveled
and your calories burned so does the
jawbone up to the fifth it also will
automatically track your sleep at night
if you wear it to bed so does the job on
up to the Fitbit also will also
automatically track high intensity
exercises like outdoor running and
cycling not just walking so does the
jawbone up to the Fitbit Alta will
vibrate gently to remind you to move
throughout the day if you're not moving
you know so does the jawbone up to some
people really like these gentle
reminders and some people find them to
be really annoying reminders that you're
tired or lazy or you're glued to a desk
all day long I can't possibly get as
many steps in as you know you're
probably supposed to well I suppose
there's that
so what are the differences between
these two well the most obvious is that
the Fitbit Alta has a display which
means you don't have to open up a Fitbit
app in order to see how many steps
you've taken and other stats you can
just look at it
jawbone on the other hand doesn't have a
display which means this one arguably is
still better looking sorry that thing
still looks like a Fitbit to me
well Fickett says that you should get
five days of battery life per charge
with the Fitbit Alta and my experience I
actually got more than that jawbone up
to has you beat there this one will get
seven to ten days on a charge so which
of these is actually better at the end
of the day the software is just as
important as the hardware and I happen
to like jawbone smart coach software
better than I like fits mobile app plus
jawbone syncs with Apple health risk if
it does not yeah but I happen to know a
lot more people that have fitbit's than
jawbone so in terms of the social aspect
like linking up with friends in the
application and sharing your stats for
motivational purposes and all that stuff
FIF it might be a better choice
plus if it has a display so if those
things matter to you the extra $45 for
this might be worth it yeah but if
you're looking for something that's more
affordable and a little bit more
fashionable then jawbone might be a good
bet at least for now
also keep in mind that these gadgets are
not miracle workers you still have to
get up and do the work and walk around
in order for them to work for you for
the verge I'm Lauren good thanks for
