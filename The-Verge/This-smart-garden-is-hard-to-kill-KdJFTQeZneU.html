today we are going to talk about click
and grow click and grow is a smart
garden that allows you to grow plants
very easily and with very little effort
so the this one that I have here is the
starter kit and the starter kit comes
with three basil plants and it's very
easy to use you just have to put the
pods in which have the soils and the
seeds when you buy them and then you
have to add the water to the tank and
then you have to just plug it in during
the night and sometimes during the day
this light goes on and it helps the
plants grow when the garden needs water
the light starts flashing so here's what
I liked about the smart garden with this
one you really don't need to do anything
else other than water the tank wine the
garden tells you to what I didn't like
about the the garden is that this light
at night is very powerful it's very
annoying and when it starts flashing
sometimes it's it's hard to make it stop
because it's very fiddly
the clicking grow comes with an app that
allows you to keep track of when you
plant the plants it gives you gardening
advice and better than that there's not
much that you can do with it what I also
don't like about the smart garden is
that it looks kind of cheap but it cost
$60 and so for that amount of money you
can really just buy 30 or 40 normal
basic plants honestly I find growing
normal basil plants a bit hard I feel
like the plan keeps dying on me and I
never know how much to water it with
this you know it's pretty easy this is
click and grow if you want to see more
