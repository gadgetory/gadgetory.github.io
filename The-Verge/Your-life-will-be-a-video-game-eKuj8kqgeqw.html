our lives and as the years go on that's
only gonna you know heightened games are
only going to become more important to
us and the biggest shift I think we're
going to see is they're moving from
being a discrete experience to an
indiscreet experience so when I was 15
years old and I wanted to listen to
music I really had a couple of choices I
could sit up all night and hope they
played music I liked on the radio I
could go down to the record store
I could buy a cassette tape go home put
it in my boombox and sit down and listen
and I really had to make a conscious
decision so now by virtue of the fact
that almost every device I own plays me
music and services like Spotify curate
and personalize that music for me in
context it pretty much surrounds every
minute of my day from the minute I get
up in the morning to the minute I go to
bed at night so music is really moved
from being this discrete experience had
to make a conscious choice to engage in
to something that surrounds everything I
do so when we think about games today
already we've got more people playing
more games and more platforms in more
geographies around the world than ever
before it's not just a console business
it's not just a PC business it's not
even just a mobile business we've now
got VR and AR and streaming and so as we
fast-forward that to the future you
think about what the world looks like
with a 5g network streaming latency free
gaming to every device you own it's
really easy to imagine that games would
permeate our lives much sway digital
music does today from the minute I get
up in the morning everything I do has an
impact on my gaming life both discrete
and industry the amount of eggs I have
in my internet-enabled fridge might mean
my sims are better off in my game the
length of distance I drive in my Tesla
on the way to work might mean that I get
more juice in Need for Speed if I go to
soccer practice in the afternoon by
virtue of internet-enabled soccer boots
that might give me juice or new cards in
my fifa product and I think what we
start to see is less about is it a
shooter is it a sports game is it open
Walt is a closed Walt is it linear story
is it multiple you know Forks story and
more about this one existing world where
we
play apart so this world where games and
life start to blend I think really comes
into play in the not-too-distant future
and almost certainly by 2021
