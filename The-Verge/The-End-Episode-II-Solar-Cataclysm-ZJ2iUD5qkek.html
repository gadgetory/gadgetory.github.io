blasts of gas plasma actually plasma is
energy and gaseous form actually happens
quite frequently but usually those
blasts go out into space and have
nothing to do with us every now and then
though blaster the issue from the
northwest quadrant of the sun's facebook
from sun spots which are storms on the
Sun explode and travel the 93 million
miles and hit the earth our magnetic
field is designed to protect us from
these blasts and usually it does the
most significant net result is the
Aurora which are beautiful so nobody
from coins about the Aurora but rarely
seems like once or twice a century a
mammoth blast comes in and really does
some spectacular things
the largest such plus we know it was in
1859 called the Carrington event the
Carrington event was actually two blasts
August twenty-eighth 1859 next one in 77
first kaboom kaboom it came in and it
lit the sky up at midnight it diffused
electricity into the telegraph wires
even burned down a few telegraph station
but aside from the scientific curiosity
about it it had a very little impact on
society that would not be so today if a
blast of the side of the 1859 Carrington
event or bless are almost as large that
followed in 1909 and 1921 where to hit
us today and crash through our magnetic
field well it would knock out the
electrical power grid such that up to
130 million Americans would be without
electricity for months or years
that's not just according to me as
according to the National Academy of
Sciences landmark report called severe
space weather events that report was
also co-sponsored &amp;amp; Co researched by
NASA National Academy of Sciences is no
fringe group was founded by Abraham
Lincoln during the height of the civil
war and today it's probably the most
prestigious scientific membership
organization in the world according to
the National Academy of Sciences if we
were to be hit by one that happened in
1859 or another 1909 or 1921 we could be
in big trouble trouble trouble the likes
of which we've never seen our society is
held together by a power grid today
electricity is the cornerstone
technology of his society there's
nothing that we depend on more except
maybe air water and food and we've come
to rely on electricity for so much more
it's not just no telecom needs in many
cases little or no water or gasoline
because the pumps are like it a little
little or no refrigeration banking law
enforcement military security pretty
much everything we rely on to function
and the question is okay well but why
don't we just fix it that's what utility
crews are for right there's no repair
guys and prepare a pair of people or
form
it would be nice but unfortunately that
doesn't work if a coronal mass ejection
hits the earth and hits a transformer it
doesn't just sort of walk it out it
fuses the copper windings inside so the
transformer has to be replaced now these
babies the biggest ones way over a
hundred tons there's a three-year
waiting list in the world market for
these things and none of them is made in
the United States anymore
on Halloween 2003 the Halloween storm
hit didn't do much to the North Pole but
it says South Africa got 14 major
transformers not got and their their
their electrical infrastructure was
crippled for years we think well South
Africa they're always having problems we
tend to be dismissive perhaps and find
no relevance in their situation but you
know transformers the Transformers it's
not because it's African or American
it's a transformer and they had a devil
of a time in June 2010 the United States
House of Representatives voted
unanimously unanimously these guys to
take the steps to protect the powder it
and they won't cross the aisle to
perform the Heimlich maneuver and yet
the US House of Representatives did so
and pass the bill which I have to
control my anger at this which died in
the Senate on addressed ostensibly the
question was they couldn't decide in the
Senate which subcommittee had
jurisdiction over the power grid a bunch
of it's not the lack of money
it's not the lack of technology that's
keeping this from happening and now it's
not even the lack of legal authority but
it's the way that the grid came to be
the grid was not created in one fell
swoop like the federal highway system
you grew up in it's a patchwork of
public and private authorities
commissions utilities with different
jurisdictions overlapping state and
regulatory agencies it's a mess legally
I used to be chairman on advanced plasma
physics research company in albuquerque
new mexico one day in late two thousand
for the principal scientist Roger Remy
came to me and said the Sun is making
mayonnaise
oh yeah shut up Roger Roger the nine guy
so mostly just to shut him up i went on
the european space agency and nasa
websites so the sun had been behaving
more tumultuously and the only thing
that astronomers could seem to agree
upon was that this act the next climax
of this activity would be in 2012 so I'm
impulse I googled 2012 and fell down
this rabbit hole of new age very
colorful stuff Mayan astronomy very
interesting not the kind of stuff that
normally moves me to action but it was
when you looked at the ancient mayan
astronomy you say it was a work of
genius i mean without so much as a lens
much does a computer or spacecraft they
did great jobs in predicting eclipses
and even the movement of moon other
planets and you move into the solar
system iran the galaxy to me it was just
the coincidence of contemporary
astronomers pointed to 2012 as the next
climax of solar activity and ancient
mayan astronomers saying that 2012 would
be a watershed year and it's that
coincidence that got me interested in
this research we need to do is stick a
surge suppressor in between the ground
and the transformer not really nuclear
science scientists are not perfect they
intimidate a lot of journalists a lot of
politicians not necessarily out of any
malignant intent but just because people
don't know people are afraid to look
stupid and sometimes you know they need
what they're saying is does not hold I
was attacked after I wrote new york
times I bed peace by he has such a nice
name ahead of the Hayden Planetarium
famous scientists deGrasse Tyson Thank
You Neil deGrasse Tyson thank you
viciously attacked and in a letter you
wrote to the to the times as an educator
is my duty to empower you to think so
that you can go forth and think accurate
thoughts about
world is put together inoculating you
against the charlatans out there will
exploit your ignorance on anything they
possibly can well guess what Congress
and the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission looked into the matter far
more deeply they agree with me you see a
superior scientist to me absolutely i'm
not a scientist was I right on this
issue yes I am I'm 58 years old and I
have an eight year old and an 11 year
old I am firmly convinced that if not
within my life span within there's the
power grid will be knocked out by solar
electromagnetic khalsa solar blasts if
nothing is done to protect it I don't
want my daughter and son to have to go
through that because I think would be I
think it would could well result in
anarchy and horror it means a lot to me
they'd be safe
