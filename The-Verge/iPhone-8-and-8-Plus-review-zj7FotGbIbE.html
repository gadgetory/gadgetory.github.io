when we at the verge do a huge fancy
iPhone review video and we're gonna do
one of those for the iPhone 10 but this
video is about the iPhone 8 and the 8
plus and that's actually the film that
millions of people are gonna get on
their upgrade plan and it might be the
phone that you get because you don't
want to pay a thousand dollars to the
iPhone 10 or you just don't want to wait
for what seems like pretty limited
availability and there's actually a lot
to talk about with the iPhone it's
basically the same internals as the
iPhone 10 the 88 plus have the same
processor as the iPhone 10 the plus has
really similar dual cameras with
portrait lighting mode they've all got
wireless charging and look I know
Android fans are gonna be in a comment
saying Android phones have had these
features for years and that's true
feature for feature Android has out
innovated the iPhone over the past few
years but when Apple ships features on
the iPhone so many people get those
features and actually use them but the
world around us tends to change
so something that wireless charging it's
been around since the windows days but
now that the iPhone has it you're going
to see wireless charging pads everywhere
actually in use look let's not dance
around it the iPhone 10 looms over this
review like a shadow looms over the
entire industry
it's apples complete redesign of what
the iPhone is it's got a huge edge to
edge screen it's got the face idea fen
occation system there's a huge amount of
changes to have iOS works but that's not
this one this phone is the fourth
generation of the design it will even
seen since 2014 base of the iPhone 6
with a glass back I don't think it's the
nicest design Apple's ever made I think
that's the iPhone 4 this is just the
nicest version of Vista and for most
people that's fine so little has changed
besides the glass back that the 8 even
fits in iPhone 7 cases perfectly the
glass back makes the a noticeably
heavier than the 7 but I like it
the glass is way less slippery than
aluminum and that combined with the
increase in weight just makes the whole
thing seem more solid and less likely to
fly out of your hand like the 6 and the
7 Apple says it's reformulated to glass
in the back to be stronger than ever
but I've already slightly scratched the
8 plus we'll see what happens when
millions of people around the world
start dropping these things Apple gave
me the gold and silver phones and the
silver is pretty familiar but the gold
is definitely a matter of personal taste
the back isn't white it's a very 70s
looking cream color of it
I'm not relating to you but it's
apparently very trendy and several
people my office really liked it and
you'll notice that doesn't say designed
by Apple in California in the back or
just I phone all the small print has
been moved in the software or onto the
paperwork and box which Apple said it
had to get approval by regulatory
agencies around the world to do it's
variable okay but let's be real here the
iPhone 8 is fundamentally the fourth
generation of the iPhone 6 and the
iPhone 6 is far from the most beautiful
iPhone Apple has ever made we've been
calling out the basic clunkiness of the
6 design since the 6 came out in 2014
this might be the first iPhone that's
better in a case actually I think it's
fair to say that they're not the world's
most beautiful phones from a visual
design perspective Samsung's definitely
pulled ahead this generation there's no
question that the 8 is by far the most
polished and refined iteration of this
design but compared to the Galaxy s8 the
note 8 and other Android flagships like
the LG v 30 it's all just starting to
feel extremely dated
yes there's the iPhone 10 but apple says
the eight is also a flagship phone and
by those standards these huge bezels
just don't cut it anymore the s8 is just
a tiny bit bigger than the regular
iPhone eight but it has a bigger screen
than the iPhone eight plus it doesn't
have a camera bump and a general feels
much nicer it'll hold in your hand now
I'm not in love with Samsung's software
but there's no question that the s8 is a
nicer piece of hardware than the iPhone
eight even startup shops like essential
are pushing beyond Apple here all the
other edge to edge phones on the market
including the iPhone 10 use oled
displays but the essential phone has an
edge to edge LCD the same tech the
iPhone 8 uses and yeah as big silly
notch but my point is that Apple's put
all of its design energy into the iPhone
10 and that means the eight suffers in
comparison now none of this matters if
you have no intention of switching away
from iOS or you're just locked into hi
message like me those other phones -
well not even exist for you
the thing to know is that spending money
in an iPhone 8 doesn't get you the
cutting edge of phone design for that
you'll have to get an iPhone 10 as far
as that LCD screen itself goes there's a
couple new things the first is true tone
which uses sensors on the front of the
phone to measure the ambient light and
calibrate the display to show accurate
colors you shouldn't notice it working
when it's on since it adjusts the screen
in real-time but if you click the
buttons and settings you'll generally
see things warm up a bit it's nice
I think the iPhone LCD has long been the
best phone display out there and true
tone just makes it better
you'll see if Apple can beat it with the
OLED and the iPhone 10 the other thing
to note about the hardware is that the
new stereo speakers are actually great
it's the same trick as on the iPhone 7
the earpiece just gets really loud to
act as the other speaker but on my
iPhone 8 it all gets up to 25 percent
louder and it really makes a difference
I cannot believe I'm saying this about
speakers on a phone but I think it
sounds terrific you can hear stereo
separation it's pretty impressive and
because it's me I'm just gonna point out
there's no headphone jack which i think
is a little more annoying than people
are willing to admit did you know
Apple's own headphone dongle is one of
the lowest rated products in the Apple
Store 1.5 stars I think that says
something
Apple's all-in on
so the upgrade of Bluetooth 5 is nice
it's lower power and it alone able
smarter devices but there's not a ton of
Bluetooth 5 devices out yet so we'll
have to just test it out in the future I
will say the Bluetooth settings screen
in iOS 11 is still a mess managing all
these wireless devices with an iPhone is
no fun the glass back enables wireless
charging which is based on the Qi
standard Apple gave me one of the movies
that we'll be selling in stores and we
try to out with the cheap ads from
Samsung as well and it all just worked
as with all wireless charging systems so
far you have to be careful to line up
the phone just right before targets I
didn't have any problems especially with
the bigger iPhone 8 plus but some other
video crew noticed they had to be a
little bit more careful than they
thought
wireless charging is still pretty slow
though in my test I saw the battery go
up about 15% every 30 minutes which is
especially slow when you consider that
the phone has to be sitting on the pad
and not in your hand the whole time and
that the iPhone 8 also supports fast
charging for quick tops
it'll be nice at night on a bed stand
and any wireless charging Lee especially
useful in cars or you can just put the
phone on the charger connect wirelessly
to Bluetooth and be on your way without
any cables at all we tried it in this
Prius with a Qi charger and it worked
fine although I will say I only got
about 15% more charge in an hour and the
phone got pretty warm but don't get too
excited especially if you use car plug
right now the only car in the market
that supports both wireless charging and
wireless carplay is the BMW 7-series
every other carplay user is going to be
plugging in until they get a new car
Apple has made some big changes to how
the camera works in the iPhone 8 and 8
plus and it's hard not to see them as
responses to the galaxy s 8 and pixel
pulling ahead of the iPhone 7 like
Samsung images are more saturated by
default although Apple says they're
still aiming for realism instead of the
extreme top of the s8 an HDR is just on
all the time like the pixel you actually
can't turn it all in a quick
head-to-head test where we just took it
all the phones out and shot an auto
without messing with the settings I
think the iPhone 8 seemed to produce the
best overall images on average with less
smoothing and better colors but we'll do
a much deeper comparison test in the
future after the pixel 2 comes out the
big new feature is something called
portrait lighting on the iPhone 8 plus
which lets you mimic the complexity of
all of this professional
in software there's a few modes there's
one called studio another one called
contour and a very dramatic effect
called stage which you can also do in
black and white I asked the Verge's
creative director to explain what's
going on here and here's his take real
studio lighting creates shape and
definition by balancing the output of
different lights in different positions
around your subject Apple is using its
software to try to do the same thing
studio mode fills in the shadows the
contour mode crunches those shadows and
adds contrast and stage mode
dramatically darkens the background to
emphasize the face Oh which is pretty
clever portrait lighting isn't perfect
the system seems to just cut faces out
of the background and apply filters to
them and it's pretty easy to get some
whacky results but portrait lighting is
also in beta and it's not like most
people have Studios like this available
to play around in so it's a lot of fun
and you should expect to see it on your
Instagram a whole bunch just don't
expect it to be perfect inside the
iPhone eight and eight plus there's the
new AAA 11 Bionic processor which is the
same chip in the iPhone 10 why is it
called Bionic Apple told me it realized
it was losing a branding battle by
having boring chip names like a7 and a8
and when I added the word fusion to the
a-10 last year people started talking
about it so hey 11 Bionic sure marketing
speak aside it should be no surprise the
a11 is lightning fast Apple is at the
forefront of chip design and performance
and a11 has a new performance controller
that manages six active cores two
high-performance cores and for high
efficiency cores
early benchmarks suggests the iPhone
eight is faster than a10 fusion in the
iPad pro and even the Intel Core i7
powered 13 inch MacBook Pros but really
it's what you do with all that power
that matters and honestly I didn't
notice some huge performance boost from
the iPhone 7 when I did basic things
like browsing the web watching videos
and taking photos I played a few games
everything seemed fast and fluid my
opinion is that Apple sells iPhones for
years after they're released the iPhone
6s is still in the lineup for example so
all this extra power just feels like
Headroom for the future and not
something you immediately sense going
from year to you where you do get a
sense of the extra performance is when
you try new apps that use Apple's AR kit
and iOS 11 there aren't
many out there yet but I got to try some
early versions of a measuring app an app
that teaches you about the human heart a
stargazing app and of course an app that
puts Thomas the Tank Engine in the room
with you
these early AR demos are really cool and
they're fun to play with but the novelty
was a fast especially since you're
holding a phone out in front of you the
whole time Apple's not making a huge
deal about AR just yet but it's clearly
in the lead right and it's exciting to
think about what happens when AR goes
beyond these early experiments can turns
into just another tool developers can
use to make their apps work better
speaking of iOS 11 it's a pretty big
update we'll do another video that dives
deep into all the features but part of
the fun of a new iPhone is using an
updated version of iOS and iOS 11 is no
different you'll notice chunkier fonts
everywhere and redesigns of most major
apps the App Store is much nicer now
with big cards and even some blog like
write-ups of interesting apps and games
the new control center makes a ton more
sense and offers a lot of customization
options my favorite thing is that
airplane mode is now sticky so you can
have it leave Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on and
just turn the cell radio on which is
perfect for flights where you're wearing
Bluetooth headphones and connected to
the Wi-Fi notifications are also been
redesigned slightly although Apple
doesn't think you should actively manage
them so you still kind of can't either
these screen shots are really cool now
they slide to the bottom of the screen
and you can tap on them to annotate them
instantly which I love and there's a new
files app which lets you finally work
with files and services like iCloud and
Dropbox directly well they're still not
getting real access to the actual file
system of a phone Siri sounds a lot
nicer as well my name is Siri
although Siri is still Siri I don't
understand and I didn't get any better
answers to my various questions I'm
afraid I don't know the answer to that
but overall iOS 11 is a really solid
update and if you have an iPhone 7 you
might not miss any of the iPhone eights
features once you have it oddly the
iPhone 8 and 8 plus have slightly
smaller batteries in the iPhone 7 and 7
plus an apple says both phones should
last about the same on a charge as the
older models though partially because
the a 11 chip is more efficient than the
intent both my iPhone 6s and iPhone 7
dropped battery life pretty quickly
though so I have to see how the eights
do over time but in these first few days
of testing everything seems just about
the same as before with just under a day
of standard use on a charge the battery
drained far more quickly
I ran a our apps non-stop which makes
sense and you can add the switch for
low-power mode to control center now
which is very convenient if you
routinely need to save them out I said
at the beginning of this video but the
iPhone 10 looms over this review like a
shadow and I think that's really true
especially because the iPhone 8 is kind
of expensive it's $50 more than the
iPhone 7 was this time last year the
regular iPhone 8 starts at six hundred
ninety nine dollars the iPhone 8 plus
with 256 gigs of storage it's all the
way up at nine hundred and forty nine
dollars that's just fifty dollars less
than an iPhone 10 so big question who is
this phone for and I think the answer is
that it's for waves of upgraders if you
have an iPhone 6 or 6s you're on an
upgrade plan with your carrier you're on
Apple's upgrade plan you're just gonna
get this phone you've been paying for it
up front this whole time and you're
gonna be really happy it's a major
upgrade to what you have today but if
you have an iPhone 7 plus and you're
thinking about spending nine hundred
fifty dollars on an iPhone 8 plus don't
do that wait for the iPhone 10 it's a
much bigger upgrade than what you've had
now I think all of this means the iPhone
is just kind of a commodity this is the
default phone for a lot of people and a
default phone this good is actually
pretty great but if you're the kind of
person who wants the latest and greatest
you should wait
