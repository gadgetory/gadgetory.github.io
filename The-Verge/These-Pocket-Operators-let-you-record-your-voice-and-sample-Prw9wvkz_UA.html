in the back of a Ford Expedition right
now in a parking lot but that is because
we stumbled across teenage engineering
and they have created this nice little
hub for us so that we can test out some
of their products we have two new
products from them that build off of the
very popular pocket operator series that
they've had and this is really cool
because for the first time they have a
vocal synthesizer which is this one
right here it's called speak and then
they also have this other one down here
called the Fela book sort of similar
this is the kayo and this is the first
time that they have had a sampler so a
lot of the other pocket operators come
with their own sort of presets almost
and this is the first time where you can
really run with whatever you want
there's a little microphone built into
the top and these can become very fluid
pieces of equipment where you can just
morph whatever sound that you want so
one of the cool things about the pocket
operators series is that you can daisy
chain these together so right now we're
going to put three of them together and
all you really need is just the stereo
eighth inch jack and then they can talk
to each other whichever one you have at
the front and right now we have this
gold tonic this is going to be the one
that is the was considered the master
that is going to set the tempo and make
sure all of the ones are connected
together are in sync so we're gonna test
out speak right now and actually record
a sample into it and give it a go and
see how it sounds so I'm going to press
record this button right up here and
then I'm going to press which pad I want
to sign the vocal to and then I'm going
to speak into it
The Verge so you can hear it gave me a
click track which is something that you
would normally want just to give you a
sense of the time when you're recording
something in so it's recorded my vocal
and then I'm going to play it back
and I'm gonna try and get rid of that
little bit of empty space that was
before my voice and trim it to exactly
when I was speaking and it's triggering
really just at the beginning of that
phrase so now that we have just that
sample recorded in that's where the fun
comes and we can start assigning
different effects to it and really play
around with how the audio sounds whoo
that sounds like it could be on a techno
track do you see up here it's telling me
the type of character it's assigning to
the voice so there's a robot a fifth a
vocoder
oh it's adding a little simple fact
noise that's kind of creepy I kind of
like this vocoder this was a lot of fun
to use I've played with some pocket
operators in the past but to be able to
record myself in was a pretty good time
and I it's it's always fun when you have
multiple units to chain together and to
really just let the creative process fly
so I think I might be getting one of
these for myself these two new models
the KO and the speak finish out the
metals line for Pocket operator and they
both go for $89 so if you want something
that is maybe an intro to synthesis if
you're new to this whole game and you
want something that you can play around
with and it's pretty intuitive but gives
you a lot of flexibility this might be
the thing that you're looking for
especially with this new line because
you can record yourself directly into it
there we go I think odd fabulous as you
hold it yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
