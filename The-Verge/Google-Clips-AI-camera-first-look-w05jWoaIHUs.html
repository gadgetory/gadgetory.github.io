you've ever used before it's made by
Google and like everything Google makes
these days it uses machine learning to
do something pretty special you see this
camera which Google calls clips by the
way let's the computer decide when to
hit the shutter button you just turn it
on point it at the world and the
computer figures out of something
interesting is happening and then it
takes a picture of it now
the craziest thing isn't that it works
because you know of course it works
Google's really good at making computers
do fancy computer things No
the craziest thing is that this camera
which recognizes your face and your
family's faces manages to do all that
automatic recording without being the
creepiest thing on planet earth and
that's not just because it's so small
and cute here's how it works like any
phone accessory you turn it on and then
you pair it to your phone and once it's
paired you can just put your phone away
if you want to you twist the lens on the
clips to the on position and a little
LED light starts blinking to let you
know that it's on and it's looking for
something to record the idea is that
you're just gonna set it down or clip it
to something and let it do its thing it
looks for what Google's algorithms think
might be interesting and then it records
a little 7 second clip of that thing it
might be of your kids playing or
somebody's smiling just right or you
know whatever the camera also learns
over time it has facial recognition so
it can recognize your face your family's
faces and even your pets eventually it
learns to take pictures of those people
and ignore other people it's smart
enough not to record your hand when you
go to pick the thing up and it's smart
enough to ignore really blurry shots
because you're just swinging it around
too fast but you know if you must you
can hit the shutter button to take a
picture manual like an animal so yes
this all sounds very creepy like super
creepy it sounds like a spy camera that
learns your children's faces and records
them automatically and sends them to
Google kind of creepy
Google says none of that is happening
all of the data is stored only on this
little camera fully encrypted and can
only be transferred to the phone that
you've paired it to and all of the face
recognition and pet recognition and
whatever only happens on the device to
Google knows pretty darn well that you
might be sqeezed out by a camera that
recognizes your face and decides when to
record it all by itself so it made this
thing look really obviously like a
camera it isn't meant to be hidden away
and to be clear it does not have a
microphone a blinking LED is the
universal symbol for you might be being
recorded so clips has one of those two
it's also exclusively marketing this
thing to parents and people with pets
here's the pitch
when you whip your phone out your
adorable little monster might stop doing
that really cute thing that it does the
other thing that happens when you whip
or phone out is that you're looking at
the world through a screen and you're
probably not gonna be in the picture
yourself with clips google says that you
do get to be in the picture and there's
gonna be a bunch of candid moments
that'll get captured for you
automatically
and the design is really smart too it's
small and cute and teal but it's also
square so that you can set it anywhere
and it comes with this clip which you
can you know clip the stuff now you can
clip it to your shirt
but Google says that a bunch of people
have been testing that and that it kind
of sucks so you really shouldn't think
of this thing as a wearable camera it's
also thin enough to drop in your pocket
or your purse and when you do Clips is
smart enough to realize hey I'm in a
pocket and it will stop looking for
something that I can take a picture of I
have no idea if anybody's going to be
convinced by all of that but if they are
they're gonna get a pretty neat app to
go with the camera it just creates a
vertically scrolling list of all the
clips that the camera has automatically
recorded again they're stored on the
camera they stream over to your phone
over Wi-Fi you just scroll through them
and swipe one direction to save the ones
you want and swipe the other direction
to delete the ones you don't the app can
also be used to give you a live preview
so if you're trying to set up a group
shot with a whole mess of people you can
preview it live in the app and when you
hit the shutter button it records that
same 7 seconds you can scrub through any
clip and pick out just the frame you
want to save and if you want you can
even trim any of these longer clips to
exactly the length that you want when
you're done you can share it as a gif or
video file or plain old image or in
Google's new motion photos format the
early prototype version of the app I
tried was sometimes crazy fast and super
fun to use and sometimes it was a little
bit slow and annoying I'm really hoping
the final version will be more like the
fun version that I tried oh yeah it's a
camera so here are the specs it has a
hundred and thirty degree lens on a 12
megapixel camera that's not quite as
good as what you'd get on a phone but
it's still pretty nice
it only has eight gigs of storage but
that seems like it's enough to store a
ton of these clips it was more than I
could shoot in a single day it should
last about three hours if you have it on
and actively recording stuff and it
should go for a few days on standby
it weighs 42 grams and again there is no
microphone at all remember it's not
creepy Google says it works with pixel
phones iPhones and the Samsung Galaxy s7
and essayed but that more phone support
should be coming soon maybe the most
important spec is the price 249 bucks to
me that feels like it's at least 50
bucks too expensive but then again I
don't have kids to Google it thinks that
all the personal sweet in-between
moments that this thing can capture is
going to justify the price I guess we'll
see who's right when it goes on sale
very soon so that's clips but use this
thing for well like I said before Google
says it's for parents and pet parents
because pet parenting is definitely a
thing and you know what that's true
you're gonna be able to get pictures
with this little thing that you wouldn't
have gotten before because you know the
camera would have kept you from doing it
this just does it automatically but for
me what's really interesting about this
is that it's a new kind of camera I mean
let's face it how do you look at
pictures you look at them on your phone
and your phone is capable of doing
really interesting things because it has
a screen and a processor and all the
stuff and not a lot of cameras are
taking advantage of that new way
of looking at pictures by making them
move and loop and turn the gifts of the
whole shebang and this camera does that
it's not a GoPro it's not an action cam
it's not a spy camera or security camera
it's something I think genuinely new
it's you know it's an adorable little
glimpse at the future photography</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
