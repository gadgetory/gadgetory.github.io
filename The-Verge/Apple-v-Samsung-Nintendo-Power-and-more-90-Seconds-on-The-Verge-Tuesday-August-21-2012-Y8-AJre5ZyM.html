2012 i'm ross miller commenting laughs
from the mothership this is 90 seconds
on the verge closing arguments began
today an apple vs samsung as it's done
so far apple will try to show that
samsung was obsessed with beating the
iphone and ipad and that the company
blatantly ripped off apple's designs
likewise samsung wants to show its
designs are original and that apple's
own patents are invalid the jury will
deliberate on over 20 pages of questions
accompanied by a hundred nine pages of
jury instructions the tech industry's
biggest trial may finally be over this
week that is of course until one side
appeals and across the pond mobile
network everything everywhere is set to
become the first UK carriers to offer
LTE service UK telecom regulator Ofcom
has granted final approval ahead of the
proper 4g auction expected next year
much to the dismay of direct competitors
Vodafone 3 and 0 to the new LTE service
could start as early as September 11th
leading mini to speculate it has
something to do with it off rumored LTE
iphone which may or may not be announced
on sep tember 12 and finally sorry 10 on
a down note but after 24 years and 280
issues intendo power magazine will
reportedly cease publication according
to Ars Technica nintendo was quote
uninterested in renewing its contract
with publisher future US intendo power
senior editor chris hoffman said on
twitter and will try to make the last
issues very memorable and that's it for
today's top stories coming up tomorrow
why not what the world's longest game of
civilization to has so far accurately
predicted about our own dark future
