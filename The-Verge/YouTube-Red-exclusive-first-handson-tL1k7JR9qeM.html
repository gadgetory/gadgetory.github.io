about to go hands-on with YouTube's new
subscription service it's called YouTube
red so you can see I've got YouTube red
up here which means I'm logged in as a
subscriber so it's just like ordinary
YouTube the only difference is when I
click on a video it loads up with no ads
it's kind of a surreal experience it's
like driving without a speed limit and
another thing that you'll notice here is
as I'm going into different videos so
let's pick up some Daft Punk over here I
have this button where I can download
the video to watch offline now when I
decide to save a video you see it gives
me some options here and that's a big
deal because compared to music video can
take up a ton of room and you can also
remember your settings there so now
you've got a little status bar here it's
saving the video to go offline another
thing that you'll see in YouTube red is
background place so I'll go into my
settings here and I've got a tab called
background and offline background play
is I'm watching a video and I get a text
I want to jump over to that or I'm
listening to music with my headphones on
and I want it to keep playing even if my
screen turns off so you've got some
options here always-on when you're using
headphones or turning it off so that you
know background play never happens the
video will always pause from in here I
can also choose on my video quality set
that up and I can decide if I want to
download videos over Wi-Fi or you know
even when I'm on just a regular data
connection now down here at the bottom
you've got your internal storage and
that's nice to have you know if you're
going to be downloading a lot of videos
for offline you're going to want to know
how much space you have free I think
basically the only other thing that is
worth demoing here with red is if I'm
inside of a video and it's playing and
then for example I were to get a text
message or something like that let's say
I switch toggle over to that
notification so now I'm you know in here
hanging out I can type back and write a
message hey watching YouTube and my
video when I toggle back over to it here
is still playing so it picks up you know
past where I left off and if I had
headphones in I could have been hearing
that the whole time okay so that's
YouTube red
