much to say about the Apple watch it's
apples first new product in five years
and it's the first one developed after
Steve Jobs died there's a lot riding on
this thing Apple introduced it at a
celebrity-filled event last year so huge
they built an entire temporary building
for it you can spend anywhere from $350
to $17,000 on it it's crazy it's a big
deal so what's it like
first the Apple watch doesn't look
anything like Apple's other products its
rounder and friendlier than the iPhone
or the MacBook it really looks more like
a first generation iPhone than anything
else it's also pretty heavy it's just
under three ounces and it feels like one
solid object in your hand
it's just way nicer than any other
SmartWatch out there it also has more
stuff unlike Google's Android wear which
basically extends your phone the Apple
watch feels like an entire little
computer on your wrist and that's both
good and bad unlike every other
SmartWatch the Apple watch is all about
physical controls it literally has
buttons and knobs and it takes a while
to figure them all out there's the
digital crown scroll wheel which is also
a button the screen itself which uses a
new technology called force touch to act
as another button and there's a side
button which is especially confusing
since it looks just like the iPhone
sleep button but actually opens the
communications app Apple is making a big
deal of the digital crown which lets you
smoothly scroll and zoom on a watch
without your fingers getting in the way
of the screen it's definitely nice to
have after using a watch for a while I'd
look for the crown on my phone but you
can also just scroll through lists on a
watch just fine with your finger and in
general anything you can do with the
crown you can do on the screen the back
of the watch has a raised area for the
obstacle heart rate sensor and it's also
where the magnetic charging cable
connects the cable is nice but I wish
Apple had included a nice dock like
Motorola does with the Moto 360 of
course all the real action with the
Apple watch happens on the screen and
the Retina display is beautiful it has
super bright colors great viewing angles
and inky blacks that make it seem like
it blends right into the sides of the
wall
it's great my only complaint is it's not
laminated super close to the watch face
there's definitely a small air gap that
you can see from time to time once you
start using the watch it's pretty
obvious that there's actually three
different things going on the first and
most important is that the watch face is
an entire little SmartWatch platform all
by itself it's where you're going to
spend the most time there's really only
a few basic templates but you can
customize the details on almost all of
them there's not really a great digital
watch face though and you can't create
your own or buy new ones like you can
with Android wear it's a missed
opportunity and Apple has to be working
on it but the watch face is really about
two things notifications and glances
when you get a notification you'll feel
a slight tap on your wrist but the
screen won't light up when you actually
look at your wrist the watch will first
show you what kind of notification
you've got and if you keep looking it'll
show you the actual information that
came in this is great if you get a lot
of notifications and you're almost
certainly going to get a lot of
notifications because the iPhone app
that controls everything comes set to
full blast by default so we're really
looking forward to launching this new
thing we're thinking a lot about the
future we want to bring in food and
technology and kind of think about how
we can you know spin that into a really
great package and we were wondering if
the verge was interest in collaborating
with it so this is an email from a
co-worker who is not this coworker
I don't have time to answer this right I
want to pay attention so I'm just going
to dismiss it for it so we thought that
you know this is something that could be
a really great collaboration for either
we're wondering if you guys have made
thoughts on it yeah there's so much this
is an Instagram like and here's the real
problem with the Apple watch right now
the settings for how you control it
notifications go from your phone to your
watch aren't very granular it's kind of
all or nothing for every app you have on
your phone so I'm getting all kinds of
notifications I don't want and to turn
them off I have to go through a huge
list and pick which ones yes or no and
so really all I'm doing is knowing more
about what's happening on my phone than
ever before is there somewhere that you
need to be right now yeah I really want
to talk about this I think it's such an
exciting project there's so much we to
do together
yeah absolutely another thing we
thinking about is mind this is another
text for my wife so now I'm not paying
attention to Sonia I'm not paying
attention to my friends and family but
I'm more aware of how many people that
I'm ignoring than ever before I'm not
sure that I like
if you miss a notification you can just
go back to the list from the watch face
and take it from there
but you'll sometimes notice that
notifications slow things down which is
a theme on the watch it's a little
underpowered
it's the same with glances which are
basically little status screens you can
open from the watch face you can quickly
check your heart rate or figure out your
location or look at the weather apps on
your phone can install glances so I can
see what the top trends on Twitter are
or look at mass transit options using
transit it's cool but glances don't
update in the background so you have to
wait for them to load from your phone
anything that loads data from your phone
takes a while to happen on the watch
especially if you're loading location
data if you want to send a quick message
to someone you click on a side button to
open the communications app which is
really just a favorites list once you
pick a contact you can either call them
right in and watch send them a text or
emoji or poke at them using digital
touch if they also have an Apple watch
digital touch is pretty cool but it's
kind of more of a demo than anything
else you can send little drawings and
taps and even your heartbeat and they'll
play back in real time for your friends
and then disappear
I had fun setting my heartbeat to people
but other than that I'm mostly stuck to
texting apple also has weird ideas about
emoji you can send the standard ones but
you can also send one of three animated
custom images that are exclusive to the
Apple watch I'm not sure why this smiley
face has a tongue I'm not sure why this
heart is exploding and I'm not sure why
this mimes hand is giving me nightmares
this is by far the strangest part of the
Apple watch I had a lot of fun with it
but I also think I freaked a few people
out with this thirsty Rando beyond the
watch face in the communications app you
can click the digital crown to open the
home screen and launch apps it's a world
of possibility but it's also where the
watch definitely feels the slowest apps
on the watch right now look remotely off
your phone and they feel like it uber
and Twitter take forever to load
anything that needs to grab location
data from your phone is extremely slow
and in general you're going to look at a
lot of waiting screens these apps also
don't offer that much functionality
think of them more like remote controls
for the apps on your phone you don't
really need them Apple says true native
apps are coming later this year and
hopefully they'll do more the Apple
watch also has Apple pay which lets you
pay in
where you can pay with an iphone you
just DoubleTap the side button and wave
the watch over the payment terminal once
you've got the watch on your wrist all
you have to do is unlock your iPhone
with touch ID and you're ready to go
that was actually pretty cool the watch
stays authenticated until you take it
off which means it's even faster than
paying with an iPhone this is Apple at
its best with hardware and software and
services all working together and it's
by far my favorite feature of the Apple
watch one of the biggest features of the
Apple watch is health tracking it can
measure your steps it can count your
calories and even remind you to stand up
every so often the heart rate sensor on
the back takes your pulse automatically
every 10 minutes and you can set goals
from movement and exercise throughout
the day the three rings in the activity
app fill in as you get closer to those
goals if you hit the gym you can open a
workout app and select from a few
presets to guide you through a workout
but once you set a preset in your goals
the watch will give you little taps to
mark your progress but it's really only
geared for cardio walking running an
elliptical exercise bike a stair stepper
a rower
anything that's not cardio doesn't
really get picked up so weightlifting
yoga things that don't make your heart
rate go up don't really get accurately
tracked by the watch none of this is as
advanced as other fitness devices but it
is all right there on your wrist Apple
expects third parties will build apps to
expand on these basic capabilities over
time which will definitely give the
Apple watch a leg up over other
platforms but wait a minute
all this seems really interesting is a
tech gadget but the watch is supposed to
be a fashion item as well is it actually
cool I went ask the fashion editors a
track calm to find out these are like a
lot of interest for me readers from like
young women who read a fashion magazine
is there not a lot of interest what's
the what's the vibe I think that there
is a certain kind of like person who
wants to know what's happening let's
have the latest product immediately
because it makes them feel really savvy
I feel like that's dissipating a little
bit so like that person who like has to
have the iPhone first like I don't know
that they're going to feel that way
about the watch well this is not luxury
yeah it feels very much like two
separate objects that were not designed
in tandem like if it feels like you very
much have a computer sitting atop a band
which is not the point
in terms of whether the fashion world
will adopt it or not I don't know that
they're gonna adopt it as a design
object I do think this is a watch that
makes you feel important and people who
work in fashion like to feel important
like is this coolkid doesn't stand a
chance of being cool I think that if it
gets adopted all over the place
fashion people are going to find a
reason to love it but I don't think that
they're going to love it as a
beautifully divided object I believe in
the future of this I'm not into this
first version but I believe in the feat
I think there's like there could be
something here so that's the Apple watch
it's so much more powerful than every
other SmartWatch and it's infinitely
more stylish but it's still a SmartWatch
it can do a lot but it definitely can't
replace your phone and it really can't
do much that your phone can't do to be
honest it's a little unfocused it's like
it has half of every possible feature
it's a first real step towards what
seems like a revolution of wearable
computing but it's definitely just a
first step so should you buy it I'm not
convinced anyone actually needs a
SmartWatch yet and there's nothing about
the Apple watch that really changed my
mind but there's certainly enough here
to be interesting and it's definitely
the nicest SmartWatch out there but it's
also one of the most expensive so if
you're going to get one I'd only
recommend the sport model for 350 or 400
dollars you'll get all the same
functionality is the more expensive
versions and Apple is definitely going
to improve the software a lot over the
next few years but spending any more
money than that right now seems silly
the Apple watch is interesting right now
but I bet next year's model and the one
after that will be the ones to Ashley
