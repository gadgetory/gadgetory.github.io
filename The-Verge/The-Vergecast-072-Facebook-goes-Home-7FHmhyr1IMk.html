the week of april first 2013 I'm Josh
Topolsky nilay patel david pearson yes
yeah and uh just today you're nilay
patel yeah note and we're back we're
back on the verge cast uh and actually
well of course the verge Casas the where
we discussed the weekend uh I just we
were just adjust what's good talk about
that we're at the point this forward to
tell you what we're talking about uh but
we're actually starting this one off on
kind of a kind of a downer note kinda
sad note we just learned that Roger
Ebert passed away at the age of 70 after
a long battle with cancer which I guess
just he kind of beat it yeah and it came
back which is which is cool of cancer by
the way to do that uh it's very
surprising right yeah yesterday
published a long piece saying he was
taking a leave of presence yeah that's
what it was his phrasing uh and he was
just gonna publish less he was he he'd
been at a frenetic pace so it's very
surprising that uh yeah you don't expect
he said he was gonna take he was just
going to kind of step up step back and
now he's dead yet which is very
depressing and weird yeah so I don't
know we don't know what have I don't
know what that with how you know I
assume the dudes cancer-related yeah and
I nothing s impossible it's not but no
details I have been forthcoming and on
but what will the post up on the site
about it because I think what's
interesting about Ebert is that he he
went from uh and he was always a
multimedia guy mean he obviously had his
column uh and then he had a show yep uh
and but he really you know when he when
he lost he lost his voice due to the yet
the cancer uh and
he really started blogging and tweeting
like Twitter was he was all over for ya
I almost from the start and he really
had a second life I feel like online
yeah and they're always wonderful
stories about like he people would ask
him and he would describe I guess he
wrote everything on like little pieces
of paper or wood type it and he would
always talk about like I'd still feel
like I have my voice because I have
twitter yeah I was like that's the best
reason to use Twitter I've ever is
pretty cool yeah and and um you know
it's uh as a film critic you know you
could agree or disagree with them I had
both experiences and often where I was
like yes totally with you on this one
then that time fan but you know great
writer great great storyteller about
stories you know one of the things I
thought he was always uh mazing that is
being able to say to tell you about a
movie about telling you about the movie
yeah yeah they talk about izing the plot
talk about a film and tell you what it's
like and what you you know whether you
like it or not or whether he thinks you
like it or not or whether he liked it
without sort of just telling you what
the talent of ur of a crabber reviewer
of a critic night the only movie reviews
i had read is a method do something else
we only reason I ever ran Reba tree
really you mean day AO scott or i mean i
would say that those would be like
metacritic and then i would click over
and then every day I I I read a lot of
reviews I did to ironically Berman who I
should agree why do you I read them for
like their literary value mostly but Eva
was the one was like if he hated a movie
i just wouldn't go see that movie and he
was the only one who ever really really
to me yeah i feel like you know just in
terms of film criticism in general uh
it's very subjective I mean it's one
thing to say like this phone is sluggish
bris with this one's not but I'm saying
yeah you know like that's not really
like an opinion sure either is or it
isn't er uh I mean to some degree you
know art is a little different to review
and you know film is the most is really
like filming music of the most reviewers
right uh I always take reviews the grain
of salt but his were always the first
ones that I checked yeah you know you
guys I okay whatever give it yeah
I was very definitive a lot of movies
that I definitely did not like pretty
high ratings now I mean Ebert loved like
he kind of went for the big spectacle
movies in addition to the weird small
movies a mass-market movie yes just like
her guy you know like the movie man of
the few times he would leave and be like
I like that movie and I shouldn't have
but I don't care he's a man of the
people he spoke he spoke his mind it is
very sad though yeah I also like really
really hated some movies and was like
not afraid oh you back you know when he
really hated movie that was his bet I
was Ebert at his best like there's this
one I was looking at her a bunch of
people were tweeting his North review
which is a movie I remember nothing
about I guess Elijah Wood isn't it more
Rob Reiner directed it okay the Jason
Alexander's not wearing a bad not ring
on how it wasn't good but he the third
the last paragraph in this review is I
hated this movie hated hated hated hated
hated this movie hated it hated every
simpering stupid vacant audience
insulting moment of it hated the
sensibility that thought anyone would
like it hated the implied insult to the
audience by its belief that anyone would
be entertained by it Wow like a kind of
really want to see this movie I mean
that is really intense yeah that is
amazing and it's like he you know
printed that in a newspaper he put in
his paper that way into the hands of the
public yeah how depressed for the people
who made that movie the movie probably
made eleven dollars yeah we've never
heard of it perfect what's it about I
don't know it's that it's about it if
you know what north is about call us
something going up north I don't think
the opposite of south I don't think it's
a sequel sir I'm having a hair issue if
it's back shot oh wow return he plays a
kid with inattentive parents he being
Elijah Wood decided to go into court
free himself of them and go on a
worldwide search for nicer parents yes
I'm shocking this I'll be honest that
sounds bad that sounds like a bad idea
for a movie yeah any also so so very sad
news today and obviously our condolences
to his family his wife and uh and that's
just a downer but this is like what they
do on the news this is said they're so
good on the Doozer like you know for
dead in a you know shooting and coming
up it fuzzy the bear he's not real some
people think you uh know but we're not
in today was actually a big news day
Hugh James day yeah the biggest news day
ever in the history
news wait can I say one more your
birthday I just thought of yes because
we ran a big piece from been about
bioshock yeah earlier this week and
Ebert was I would say the one place
where I always disagreed with Roger
Ebert because I read his reviews
canonically like they're the ones that i
read right but he was insistent that
video games could not be our yeah and I
think that's the one area where he just
didn't have it daily didn't bat a big
thing about bioshock infinite yeah but
how this is conclusively art did he back
away from that a little bit now he was a
he he was actually very much like I'm
not acknowledging no more I'm dying yeah
yeah what was his logic was it his logic
was that because we did it you interact
with in it's fundamentally game right so
there's like checking which asses on art
which I think like chess players would
often be like you know you're right and
I think that's actually very interesting
i think there is there there was his
ability to like write a review of movies
like unquestioningly great and then
there is this now this burgeoning
additional type of narrative and story
yeah i'm in it that to me is the the one
place where I think he had a little I
think he had a blind spot for that but
it's it's understandable i mean if you
spent your life reviewing film yeah it
and you don't intuitively your natively
understand or play video games you know
i think our generation comes to the
minute from a very different perspective
than his generation you and I we should
actually shot but i think he reviewed a
couple of Game four wire nosy and i
think that's like you know that it would
have been irritable of yeah for a while
ago i would have loved to see him review
bioshock yeah yeah are like so this new
breed of games it is like deeply
immersive and like very narrative driven
since that's like since you brought it
up we talked about bioshock you haven't
talked about yet right on the on the
verge cast Oh Eva I'm being told you
were backtracked yeah I just saw that he
did backtrack yeah that's what I thought
but I'm but it's just one person well
III hope you got a chance to see
bioshock infinite it's all ok so the
have you played i haven't played it yet
but the one thing I renders injury or me
you're you're in life is meaningless I
that solon told ya but I want to know if
this is true with the guy i read a
review i can't remember where it was but
what the review was saying was basically
all of the bed
parts of Bioshock are when you're not
actually playing the game when you're
just walking around seeing the world and
well there's new distracts from what so
awesome okay so I think that it is it is
an action game and that the action is
fun and entertaining have you played it
no okay the action is fun entertaining
and it works and it's can be thrilling
at times very much not the thing that's
most interesting to the air seems really
awesome yeah it's cool it's fine it's
nothing it's not like incredible like
I've never had an experience like this
the thing that's incredible is that the
world is is ridiculously lavish and and
clearly like the attention to detail so
overwhelming in the world that they
create and that just the the idea of the
world that they create and the the
storyline is uh just uh you know
unbelievably compelling I have to say I
was it of extremely compelling storyline
extremely well formed characters I mean
what is like the basic story can you
tell me that ruining the whole game um
you play a character named booker dewitt
strong name who is uh I'm just as a
spoiler alert I don't know what
constitutes a spoiler anymore who is
sent to retrieve a girl that uh named
Elizabeth from a city that floats above
the America that floats in this is as
much as in the trailer you should a city
that is basically a sovereign nation
called Columbia uh which is based on I
would say it's a it takes patriotism to
a religious extreme it's like a
religiously like like Lincoln and George
Washington and Jefferson are deities to
the people who live in columbia and and
so there's there's there's a religious
fervor to all the citizens into and it's
and it's it's run by a the city is run
by a guy called the profit that his name
is Comstock general Comstock also a
strong name um and that's as much as
I'll say about that and then you shoot
is about it's about a man in trouble
okay in a girl in trouble and
that's a by the way that David Lynch he
went on The Tonight Show and and uh when
he was promoting lost highway and and
Jay Leno asked him what it was about he
said it's about a man in trouble and he
went on to promote Mulholland Drive and
he asked was by accident it's about a
woman in trouble uh it i would say it's
about it is this game is about a man and
woman in trouble but but justjust and we
don't we can move on Joseph talk about
yeah I just have to say um just an
incredibly compelling story incredible
pacing it definitely is a is a game
where you like kind of immediately fall
in love with the characters in it and
you understand them and they're really
well formed and and and the deeper you
go the more like I was playing just so I
could get to the next part of the story
you know I was like exploring the city
but and you can do all sorts of
different things and I probably didn't
see all of what you can see but I just I
just wanted to know what the story was
because it creates an incredibly
interesting fascinating story and um and
I have to say that the that the game
completely fulfilled you know my wildest
hopes for it and when it ended I had a
feeling that was and I don't think these
two things are really related but
there's a kurt vonnegut book called
breakfast of champions which is you know
might be my favorite certainly my for a
favorite kurt vonnegut's story book and
it might be my one of my favorite books
ever price second favorite book ever and
when it ends you feel just like
speechless mhm and that's how I felt at
the end of Bioshock in five so somebody
send me the Ebert stuff here's what
happened okay so he wrote in what a good
could say we're back to Ebert Eber 2010
right he wrote video games to never be
art and then later he wrote my error in
the first place he didn't backtrack off
the statement he said my error in the
first place was to think I could make a
convincing argument in purely
theoretical grounds and I still believe
you video games remember you are with
capital a but I should have never said
so some opinions are best kept to
yourself mmm interesting which is like
another like a snake like Ebert not
quite a backtrack yes I mean he does say
what was it I would never
express an opinion on a movie I hadn't
seen which is like him being like I
don't know yeah that's a really good
point though if you don't if you haven't
played all the best game yeah it's kinda
hard to say whether or not I met but I
think this is like to me this is the the
fascinating thing it's I for somebody
whose opinion I valued so highly to see
where that the point had come where you
could be like to play this one it will
definitively change your mind yeah and
that yeah that's that's me is like that
what up with bioshock yeah it seems to
me I don't know he may look he anybody
may have some people may play this and
go I know Josh talking about I don't
know what every so up in arms about I
mean it has been a critically like
almost universally critically acclaimed
game polygon gave it a 10 right which is
a huge deal yeah basically perfect and I
and I don't disagree I mean I've never
felt more um satisfied or excited about
you know it just is an amazing
experience and I was probably near tears
at the end of the game yeah i mean
really is it really is pretty bonkers
like and as a person is read a lot of
you know I've done a pretty good amount
of fiction reading science fiction and
fantasy uh and just you know straight
you know literature uh I think it works
on the in the way that like the some of
the best artworks yeah and in fact you
know that I think you I think the people
who play it will see similarities to a
lot of modern serialize modern stuff
uh-uh I don't want to say what but i
think it was it let's just say that
there have been a very popular serialize
modern works of fiction on television
that that that took a lot longer to get
through were far less rewarding uh then
then this game so I in storage wars
story I mean Pawn Stars seasons one
through three if you see the one that's
in a trailer park that is uh no whatever
I called if it's not duck dynasty I
don't what it's called like it's all
everyone or something it's it's just
what duck dynasty's okay like a
breakaway runaway hit not break it's
amazing yeah yeah everybody should watch
it immediately okay let's talk about
let's talk about
to talk about Myrtle Manor is what it's
called okay watch we are sticking in
there is like Myrtle manors at off Brad
no because there's no in duck dynasty
it's like they're successful because
they make the duck calls right Myrtle
manors just literally it's TLC
exploiting people live in a trailer park
yeah they're like are you poor yeah and
it's amazing a camera here it's like
shot beautifully like they shoot
everything like the magic hour so it's
like gorgeous oh yeah yeah uh I saw I
just saw show that was like this on on
like the UH some weird channel like the
detective Chandler where was it was you
know but cajun justice or so yeah and it
was like they were falling around some
new orleans and so beautiful and it
looks like it looks like a documentary
the most beautifully shot documentary
what are you doing yeah I said I saw
they were gonna fire the security guard
cuz he kept on hitting himself in the
face of the like a water like what am I
watching here with you saw it was a
given his I even another one TLC show
ended and the other one began yes of
water what has happen initially was 11
hours yeah I blame I was really worried
about this security guard I don't know
if this is founded but I blame Ryan
Seacrest for this I I mean I feel like
it's subway he's responsive look at my
facebook Myrtle Manor of the internet so
facebook today so I get so distracted by
people walking by your I should I should
learn to ignore it but I haven't I don't
hate by the way can I just say I hate
this arrangement i feel like i'm doing
this is russ 5 it's yeah but like I need
to be just looking so honestly look at
the viewer yeah I'm look look into their
eyes I like it knew I uh yeah you guys
look at each other worse so now this is
uncomfortable time so Facebook huge news
today yeah Facebook home a launcher home
screen replacement for Android not that
big of a deal that has a bunch of it is
pretty interesting function but it kinda
is because it seems like it like it
doesn't sound like that big deal because
it's just a launcher know there's a
million launchers out there but which
seems to totally hide everything else
about Android no ish but present so
Google now I talked to dieter it was at
the event so we did her and brian and
alice there and they play to the stop I
just tossed me the dialer is going to be
whatever your the dialers there right
even it's it's over
touchwiz it's it's over sense yeah it's
a launch I mean I use apex launcher on
every phone that I have that's not a
stock phone and like this one x sorry
not with this one and it's just a while
it's just a 1 i'm sorry um and it just
is the home screen in the drawer right
and then when you leave that you're in
another app yeah and it's whatever that
Google now is there yeah and I don't
know after they're they're not doing the
little chat heads right in it with that
just a home launcher that has to be the
phone itself now I think China ads are I
think it is part of the yet part of the
law so how could you how could you be in
another app and have chat heads appear I
know because they were demoing chat
heads on TouchWiz phone they had three
phones we you know obviously our team is
like nerding out one or what is Jack now
how did that ? because I don't know of a
I mean I guess it's a messaging
absolutely they were showing dizzam they
were showing a vacation they were
switching back and forth between an HTC
phone and a samsung phone yeah during
that when they were doing it during the
stream and all of that swiftkey
installed like literally our team was
like zapper during the stream when they
were showing us yeah and the chat heads
were definitely in a samsung phone um
okay so I don't know that one so maybe
it's more than a home screen home screen
replacement but the gist of it is that
it replaces your home of your home
screen your home area on your it also
does the lockscreen I'm yeah the lock
screen is that's so what happen on then
that's got to be a separate app no you
know emitter apps to replace a so screen
no they're replacing your lock screen
but I'm saying right so what they the
facebook home it was described as a
family of apps ok so you but they're all
bundled under face with them so you
download it from Google Play when you
open the facebook app on your android
phone if you have a gs3 or a 1x or 1x
plus one of these supported phones yeah
you open the facebook app on your phone
it'll say download facebook home you
push it it takes you to google play
right you install it and you launch
facebook home and it like runs five apps
ok that's that and that's fine but then
that would mean that the lock screen is
like a secondary sort of component
you know if you're in chrome yeah you're
not in their meat anymore right so I
don't know how chat heads work there
maybe they were just showing because it
replaces like the it replaces the SMS
app as well yeah butBut inhibit it's a
totally custom notification that would
have to sit like as a layer over top of
the rest of what you're running right
yeah like cuz even those notifications
aren't native to maybe dieter else but
now we're definitely on his stuff on top
let's not get hung up on this particular
point but the point is that the gist is
there's it there's an app or a suite of
apps you can get for your any Android
phone running four-point-oh basic well
so any android phone that Facebook
selects so right now it's the popular
ones from HTC in Samson okay fine and
but they've said they're gonna roll it
out it's basically but it's basically a
home replacement says yes it's a
launcher um but they also announced uh a
phone from HTC Amaze he called the first
which I was which is really hoping that
wouldn't be the name which is thought to
tell me it makes it really that makes
sense as an addition yeah we should we
call the agency like yeah it should be
um the first should be like a YouTube
phone but the first is basically let it
fact it is basically like the it is the
bastard child of the iphone 3gs like a
random android phone and ryan win in
windows phone yeah yes it's like it's
like the new facebook stuff is all like
Windows Phone II it's like they're all
of your stuff you know of your you know
people imitating the lines are like your
phone should be about people or not
wraps yeah like somewhere you know Joe
Belfiore is crying crying and riding
into his head yeah lucious he's playing
that journey money is flowing longer
Dabo a tears but um but uh so here we
have a video of it which you guys can
run if you want while we're chatting
yeah we have to Vidya to pick we can run
the hands on and we have a supercut of
the event we don't have the hands-on
aren't you looking at it right now on
the screen yeah but they can't run it
there why do we run the supercut of the
event and what's up Zack talk to us are
we gonna do they are we gonna run the
whole supercut now it's will run a
couple min let's look at let's take out
of the event is for those listening to
audio you can listen in on
zox thailand's yeah hey what's up today
we're finally gonna talk about that
Facebook phone if we're all spending so
much time on our phones interacting with
people then how can we make this easier
what would it look like if instead of
our phones being designed around apps
first and then just being able to have
some interactions with people inside
those apps if we flip that around and
made it so that our phones were designed
around people first and then you could
also interact laps when you wanted to
what would it feel like if our phones
were designed around people not apps
we're not building a phone and we're not
building an operating system but we're
also building something that's a whole
lot deeper than just an ordinary app you
don't need to fork Android to do this
it's a family of apps and you can
install it and it becomes the home of
your phone so we're calling this home
here's what you're gonna see you can
comment right there from the home screen
and cover feat is great for being able
to stay on top of what's going on with
all the people you care about but
sometimes there's a more important
message and you want to get notified so
let's say I got a message from my friend
I'm gonna get a notification with her
face and her name so I'm easily gonna be
able to tell if this is a person who I
want to interact with now and if I do
that I could just tap on it to pull pull
her up and interact with her or if not i
could just swipe away to throw her horny
how so let's say you know i think this
is a you know it it's clearly i'll say
this from a design standpoint pretty
pretty good you like it I like it and
I'm super cartoony at sucks avatar yeah
as it shows your avatars like the thing
actually an icebound was the idea of
like a smiling I think it's a nice
balance between between no real real
realism and sort of computer yeah scheme
offices I morphism then in the opposite
okay I kind of agree about the faces
thing now it's like you spend all this
time the home but going home you tap
your face yeah yeah I'm is weird well
well here's the thing I okay so here's
the thing you know he's like what if we
flipped it around it was about
perhaps it's like well here's the deal
um I'm doing a lot of like checking
stuff out of my phone it's not a lot of
direct interaction of people yes I email
people yes i will text or or have a
google chat with people or whatever
google talk I am conversation i'm on
twitter mostly reading on twitter not
interacting directly with people
facebook i don't really oh boy i can
hear them into me it's so it's like what
yeah but like here's the thing but the
apps are the thing that I'm using Yeah
right and I feel like there's a little
bit of a I mean yeah you're going to
interact with people in your apps that's
what's gonna happen I mean I just feel
like everybody at Facebook walks around
with like a professional photographer
all the time and they take gorgeous
pictures of like skydiving constantly
and I'm like that's what i wanted my
home screen like i would to make that
girl friends pictures yet to make that
work me i need to get rid of like half
of my friend know these like it happens
my pictures i just a nightmare mountain
like where it's like I take out the
phone and it's like some girl from high
school tweeting a bikini photo my wife
what is yeah yeah yeah that isn't my
fault facebook sorry they on the on the
one on the new a new sense they have a
thing if you put your facebook account
in it like throws the photos into your
yeah photo um like gallery app and when
I open it up the first time I was like
whoa what's happening here like I do not
want to see other people's stuff on my
phone in that way ya think i want to
show you it if i want to see your photos
I'll go find your photo right I know
where they are yeah I know how to look
at like I said unless there's like about
my locks here in my facebook yeah also
like you're right about this thing with
like the skydiving it's like my photos
are a lot of my photos are of my dog and
they don't look that great they're like
grainy nitromethane of the men's
bathroom at work that's not well that

theme song is incredible more I think I
did know we had like a thing going a
serious even working on it yeah but okay
so so so lets up with the phone so
there's this home suite of apps and
there's a phone the HTC first 4.3 inch
display we assume 720 it took a
mid-range to very middle-class
generation is probably like basically
the guts of a Galaxy Nexus telling is 39
and on it comes in four different colors
white black red and light blue yeah
which i think is cool I wish there were
more phones with colors but I kind of
like basically I like the blue to
basically looks like an iphone is like a
3gs not very friendly and that is like
is that Foley skinned or is it just is
it so here's that here's the other so
that net in addition to facebook home
the thing you can download for your
Galaxy Note 2 yeah um which you can do
today anal or else uh giant face photos
are huge enormous face because uh you
can the manufacturers can participate in
the facebook home program where they get
facebook essentially gets deeper access
to android you know and they can roll
out these additional hook so they can
take over the notification center they
can take over there's a few other things
that can do mess i love this i love this
is the new thing now it's like Samsung
is doing touch with agencies doing sense
in that face was going to sneak in on
the side well what are we doing a couple
little things in here changed it pretty
much and so it's like I mean I think
this is this will be the new mid-range
phone for a lot of these companies so so
so anyhow but the phone is so here's my
figure out who it's like Samsung Sony 18
th t see ya and they were showing their
partners they have partners HTC Samsung
Sony and ATT and actually showed an
xperia phone again zapper during every
minute yeah yeah of the event they
showed an Xperia yeah
while they were demoing so so here's
what I think so I before this I was like
who would want a facebook phone and they
ACC made an attempt during a facebook
phone they made a device called the
status yep which had a facebook button
that allowed you to I guess jump quickly
to Facebook or do I look like a like a
window yeah it was a Saturday as well
but I now I now see first off I think
that they're that their UI design is is
kind of pleasant enough that I that I
get what they're trying to do and after
seeing this phone and seeing their the
UI design um I actually think this is a
fairly viable product for a lot of
mid-range phone buyers are gonna walk
and I think it is real so uh there's a
deli in our building and the checkout
lady always has she's a mid-range
samsung phone yeah she's like an older
lady and it's everyday it's opened it
yeah I don't think this is I don't think
this is for us necessarily not at all
but i think that that there is a segment
of buyer out there um I think like your
mom on faith your moms on Facebook yeah
yeah she needs a new phone I could see
her going into the store seen that red
phone or the baby blue phone or the
white whatever vivid black phone with a
black fur hood if she's like evil real
badass yeah uh and got and the guide the
story's gonna say like do use facebook
and she's like yeah I look at my kids
photos on here all the time this is the
phone for you this is the facebook phone
and may got super easy and they'll be
eight people be like yeah I'm into there
is a big outcry in our comments on
Twitter when dieter was at the live dog
and I to QA and some we had soccer world
support widgets it was like not yet so
important and they're like you know the
Nerds exploded right but that all of the
numbers if you ask HTC or Samsung nobody
ever changes their home screen nobody
ever joins true look at right now agency
just blinkfeed right yeah they were like
nobody does anything me get in a just
look at anybody if you're on a trainer
would ever check out if they ever go to
their home screen it is I don't know
what's going on there it's wild it's
like when you see people with like their
computer desktops and it's just four
hundred thousand files all ya know is
mine looks like people but I see people
who have who like leave the Android help
thing on it's like click me if you need
help start it it's like dude you bought
the phone a year ago you
you know they started this band even
they're like there's a UH you don't even
know how cuz it's a secret function
you've done hold it down and then take
it to the trash like you know how to do
that so I do think that I'm you know
there's a certain buyer ninety-nine
bucks is the right price I think the
phones are attractive right i think that
the interface is attractive i think that
you know if you use facebook a lot yeah
which I do not right I barely touch it
yeah but if you use it a lot I think
there's actually kind of attractive you
know this will steer you might steer you
away from windows phone so here's that
he'll say look you look you get all the
google so here's a big question Julie &amp;amp;
weavin that's the well that is a quick
but right so we and our team has been
talking about it since the event
happened and I tweeted facebook is
stabbing google in the back about as
gently as possible because they spent
the entire event talking about how open
android is and only andrew it allows us
and google did such a good job well
there in the back as much as as amazon
therapist but this is like this is less
than this is the first step jam is on is
like not really a stabbing isn't gonna
have that so we're taking on do we know
ya know it's it's a google phone it's a
play so i could certified right all the
stuff like you know your Galaxy s3 how
is it bad for google I think it's
terrible for google once once Facebook
establishes that your primary interface
to a phone looks like this right all
that back end stuff can I move away but
that what once Facebook an established
that that first like bulkhead beachhead
yeah but Beach habit but anyways search
away from google and direct it to grab
sir yeah you can do that for the small
segment of buyers you're gonna get the
facebook phone but like the core or does
not do a huge segment of buyers it might
install this other thing I mean this is
if you have a GF screenshot facebook
home on it and I think that are gonna do
monthly updates I think the home is a
much less compelling argument like I
think a launcher replacement is some
people try and get stuck with it and use
it because they don't know how to get
rid of it mm-hmm some people try it and
then just go back to their launcher most
people probably won't try it you know
well I mean that's if you open facebook
on one of these supporters phone it's
going to tell you a big thing is it's a
big part of the deal well you tell you
are changing the way the
tire phone works I think once people
experience that the Billy wait a second
I don't want that I think messaging is
easier to get during one is the biggest
chance they have to do kind of what
you're describing it's like instead of
having you know that they're trying to
say just message with a person like
don't care about the platform you use to
do it I am texting and yeah faced with
me right that's a that's a lie because
when people ping yuan on google talk you
not responded in with facebook Messenger
right but that you know I will be a
separate app that's they rolled up SMS
and facebook message made the same thing
like it'sit's all is it were camera
rolled up things like Google Talk right
or it works like I did acceptable work
on every platform and it'll work on the
web and you'll be able to have their
they're saying like here's this one
running conversation that you can
literally have anywhere and that's what
the SMS won't won't copy that's
something it's like messages on the
iphone said yes messy a green and the
facebook messages right okay right but
that's all won't won't show up in your
facebook account will and no well gee
just on the phone right but like I
message it'll privacy does they do show
SMS is I mean if they're part of if
they're like I'm saying if you send
somebody a and I message it will only
show up in your computer if it's not
right it doesn't show up the but the but
yeah I guess there's no distinction
between like an eye but if you're on
your computer you only send like I
messages on your phone it's like right
they access it send something to you
yeah right right right but Sir they have
this that's why I mean I'm not that's i
mean i agree with you that's not a great
because they don't they change the what
you're actually doing inside of messages
right so they're doing the same thing
for fits almost exactly the same right
and I just think like they have I don't
think launchers like alternative
launchers and Android are like big
outside of the small market of people to
use them right rennard's right yes I
think Facebook home when they start
pushing that out and they're like do you
have an android phone you can it's
almost like getting a whole new phone
that runs facebook I think I'll be
compelling for a lot I actually outta
people probably pretty upset about that
you thinks I think when they install
they don't know what it's going to be in
a changes like they're like where my
stuff go where's my weather widget that
came installed on the phone
that I look at the weather on yeah I
think though people will flip out the
people who don't understand what's going
on will be very upset yeah I mean in its
name it had to explain sir not a over
they'll explain on stage like if you
just want to try it out yet hit justice
ones right if you want to do it
permanently like when people hit always
and can't get back to what they are
regular home screen is like that's the
thing yeah I mean most who are putting
apex on their phone most people are just
running TouchWiz or whatever I don't
think that that's necessarily a
compelling way to get facebook into
people's lives I think it will be seen
as a UH very like disorienting thing as
you know what you're doing I think I
think that's why I made a phone I mean
because they are they there his whole
big thing at the beginning was that you
know we want to do this to any phone but
then I think people will just deal with
whatever you give them and you know
they're always like the 10 million
strong against new facebook and
everybody's like oh right this is just
what facebook right yeah sure that and I
think this is like that phone is there
you know hundred-dollar foot in the door
where it's like I they sell you this
thing you get used to it you know you
you know show your friend or whatever
and then they're like oh I just can go
down by I was this the strategies
interesting we've never seen a larger
company besides the the OEMs besides the
people who are making the phones we've
never seen a larger company like Amazon
could have done this yeah amazon could
have made the Amazon home screen with
the amazon searchbox and like all kinds
of deep links to their store and stuff
and their app store we've never seen a
major company try to do a third-party
launcher yeah on Android as a real part
of their business I think it's genius i
mean i don't it's a pretty smart thing
it's I think it's tripping I will say
that the downfall is that at the end and
during the QA when they're like will you
put ads and cover feed yeah soccer is a
yep right and that sucks well that's a
bit like making phones or making
launchers it's making its selling
advertised right and that's a bit vets
like that sucks like ultimately that's I
don't want a phone it's like hey you're
in a place by the way this is also the
hell of a thing so yeah this is also the
Google's desperate trying to sell rice
also the facebook phone in the facebook
home screen you know and you have to ask
yourself how important facebook is to
you and to the people the target
audience mm-hmm I mean that that stat he
quoted that people on I don't know if it
was just phones general or Android spend
twenty percent other time in facebook
and then twenty five if you include
Instagram like that's crazy yeah I'm
definitely not one of those people yeah
I do look at Instagram a lot yeah I mean
I look I check it I have you know I have
I go through my process of checking
stuff right I've got like Twitter all
the time emails like always coming in so
I don't need I mean I know it's there so
I just go and try to deal with it but
you know Instagram is like one of those
things but I'm like oh god what can I
check next yeah I need to look at
something something new yeah I'm always
like oh instagram yeah I could look at
Instagram yeah i trow our forums what do
i do after what do i do after instagram
what's my what's my troll the forums
it's really quite entertaining i'll look
at the forums I Bailey tend to live that
are monism I look at the forms on my
desktop or my laptop because you know
and get a couple of tabs open yeah a
couple tabs of insults or or or why did
why did you why did you write this yeah
uh but but then would I check after that
there's really almost nothing tumblr all
look at tumblr yeah um that's it and
then I'll then I'll go to my RSS I liked
my thanks google yeah or you I liked by
the David Karp tumblr CEO was at the
event and there was like 10 minutes of
just wild speculation that Google Earth
at Facebook was buying tumblr what was
he doing come see our new home on
Android it he come down that would be
kind of what that would be kind of
monument yeah I mean I would be crazy I
don't think I think I think he was just
there did not happen to he was now he
was apparently just there I don't say
Ralph delavega for eighteen t got on say
he would really thought he did a howard
dean remember Howard Dean he was a
presidential candidate in the primary
thousand four Democratic primary
candidate and he lost one of the major
primaries and you know during his like
what is your dream that our area during
his like we're gonna beat this thing
it's we're not done yet give us a new
hampshire he would really loudly yeah
and literate like this is how stupid are
you our new cycle is people are like
what's going on with howard dean this
would seem really crazy
you bet he had to he was forced to drop
out of the race be like an hour is he
would yet as he went to now and that now
Joe right now Ralph de la vega's has to
be dropout lv man it's all over he's
never get a president yeah yeah I don't
he was pumped though he was super
excited this is like the save us from
the iphone he said I quote I've played
with a lot of phones this is the most
immersive experience I've ever had it
doesn't make any which is just I mean
like that's like saying that's like say
nothing about to say lose very high in
the HTC first you think I play with a
lot of phones and this is one of them
yeah pretty much the most immersive we
shall we should move on yeah do you
wanna do anything else two more things
to buy this week uh ones little wonky
but it's actually very important uh area
Oh areas serviced you explain the area
of situation so area is a company okay
that's great Greg ran a long explain
around this we need it but there is a
company and owned by Barry Diller they
own a warehouse in Brooklyn that's full
of tiny little TV antennas be deal I
love Barry Diller's by the way yeah
they're really if you don't know about
Barry Diller like read up on Barry
Diller yeah he's amazing he's an awesome
crazy dude uh and he has a long history
of taking on television broadcasters and
winning and just invented the miniseries
yeah like no joke yeah yep strip what
was what was it no I don't know but now
using programming just walked in he was
like you're like what is he's like what
if we did like six hours of TV
programming like serialized that's
awesome anyway so area is warehouse in
Brooklyn full of dime size TV antennas
and you log into their service and
computer somewhere signs where those
antennas to you and lets you either
record stuff onto it he must have a lot
of loud devia it's like thousands right
yeah there's more than wild lights why I
mean they're like what do they have what
do they have 10 million subscribers
they're gonna have to get 10 million and
I think they're gonna have to do some
math and figure out how many are going
to concurrently use the service yeah
yeah they're getting they like a big
part of their plan is to get new data
centers which are be sure and the
antennas like mounted on plywood like it
so we're gonna need a bigger boat haha
bigger your warehouse in Brooklyn um
anyway so the you basically stream live
television to yourself over the computer
they need to put the rain wet right
high-precision they need to put that
warehouse somewhere else because
Brooklyn is not that I have to sort of
geographic spacious there geographically
limited right so yeah they want New York
could they go to the Bronx cuz they get
a Riverdale Brooklyn's a big place
anyway could they go to Rivendale
Rivendale yes uh so the broadcaster's
sued them and said you can't you can't
capture our signals over there using
these little antennas and stream them
over the internets people you can treat
which is insane an area said why it's
just like we're just renting the
antennas out and so basically the
argument came down to the broadcaster
said well when the cable company puts up
one big antenna and runs a cable to your
house they have to pay us right you're
putting up thousands of little antennas
and using the internet and saying you
don't and that doesn't make any sense
area said no you're stupid this is like
we're leasing you an intent on a
slingbox and that's all that's happening
and the court basically stomped the
broadcaster's they said there's no that
broadcasters have yet to explain why
this is different than putting a roof on
your intent on the roof of your house
that's perfectly legal I just a got a
black series going into my TV and that
works from the roof is here here's why
broadcasters are freaky now right they
believe that if enough people do this
they will start stop subscribing to
cable know what they believe because Q
is the real customer the broadcaster
it's not you it's it's time warner
that's what I'm saying and they know and
they believe that Time Warner will say
screw it why am I paying you for my one
big antenna I'm gonna just put up a
thousand little antennas and stop paying
you the billions of dollars in reach I
was asked the fear because I was think
that's the oh I wellman to fear I wrong
in this fear was like if people can get
this the basic case some of the like a
lot of what people want it's like local
channels they can get that without
having cable at all well I think so
that's fine so that mean these are these
two there are two revenue streams the
broadcaster's right ABC right whatever
you put up the antenna they're legally
required to like broadcast you stuff you
watch their ads that's great the other
stream which by the way sorry go ahead
well but the other revenue stream and
the more important one is they they
literally send the stuff over satellites
to Time Warner and Comcast and they are
eels they have deals with all the cable
company they deliver their deals the
cable companies pay them billions yeah
and and and and they and that's where
get bundling and after another
otherwise they sell advertisements
ending right but that's why Fox can say
well you want to carry Fox proper
broadcast you have to carry FX yes
you're saying that you're saying the
time warner could say and I by the way I
don't think that they could do this no
they definitely can do this now yeah
butBut so area wind up but ups but a
single person like 88 a point-to-point
deal vs a like I guess it'd be the same
it's actually it's exactly the same
exact if they can say if they can say
well now that working yeah goodnight
Anna for all of our customers yeah I
mean area is basically just a cable
company Aereo's like it has always been
a severe guide they have a guide it's a
cable company they've always been
differences it doesn't go to your
television it goes here but it cool but
they have an app for every Roku yeah so
just go to your television right so it
means literally in the argument this is
bonkers by the way like yeah it goes
your television through Roku through the
internet and it's again the argument has
always been from the Cape from ABC CBS
of course is one of the lead CBS looked
at innovation and like immediately began
throwing Thunderbolts out of the sky
here's what I've here's that I would but
you know the area's argue the CBS's
argument has always been you're just a
cable company in the fact that you have
a lot of little antennas and you found a
loophole and they went to the court and
I said look this company is designed
like their technology is designed to
evade the copyright law and that that
should be legal and the core came back
and said no their technology was
designed to evade the copier which makes
it Linda it works and that's like it was
remark so here's the quest at E what's
going to happen is our they're going to
see of a little chain Greg interviewed
him Greg's amazing by the way yeah great
guess reg Sandoval is like one of the
right Sandoval is a beautiful man and a
people wonderful wonderful I mean just
having somebody else who's isn't already
about coffee no you got bad for Greg
bunch of he walks in it like i like i
think i know i know we have a bunch of
people on our team that you are like
it's having a weird love affair with of
her over nerdy copyright look it's like
it's really intense it really does
anyway so nice to greg did interview
with the CEO very own i forget his name
on top my head but
jerk oh I just always remember Barry
Diller but his his line was if they fail
in the courts their next move is
inevitably to go to Congress and Greg's
piece was very much like he doesn't
sound like overjoyed he sounds like he
passed step one and that's true like
they can go they're gonna keep they're
gonna go back to trial to have some
other Cal Supreme Court wet/dry all
right well so it's like do they have to
go over here in part of the argument and
the preliminary injunction to stop stop
running your business while we figure
out this legal argument failed right so
they're gonna keep running the business
and ultimately like when it's not about
you know I mean there there are cases
like this when you want some kind of
congressional yeah you do I want a
congressional ruling on a naughty to
take it and if you ask the TV Paul's
team you know it's weird that we think
about Internet policy is being like this
new thing like why are why are they
looking at the internet because the last
technology that ever the last two were
satellite radio and cable television you
know that had the same level of like
immediate interest from the government
and it's literally if you ask the
teacher bossy guys they're like all you
have to do to swing a district is to
tell them the congressman is going to
make TV more expense let me ask you this
what's to stop another company from
basically utilizing in areas business
model so they're so this is here the
area story gets really incredibly weird
there's billionaire named alchy David oh
yeah yes he has a company for another
guy worry David algae David emailed me
uh another David is the heir to the
email me about a story I think he might
send a mass email but it looked like it
went just to mean otherwise alchy Davies
is crazy is like Israeli Billy easy and
he's only Israeli he is the heir to the
coca-cola hellenic shipping company or
something which is like a he started
film on just please I'm sorry not not
Israeli yeah as in Nigeria born
greekcypriot no yeah i got that about
his wrong as father please welcome i
endeavor i'm sorry i encourage you his
full name is alcovy ah tease i encourage
you to find his Instagram feed no no let
me just finish a good look cuz i did a
little research into did al-qaeda so he
started a company called film on he's
like a billionaire but he also started a
company california called Aereo killer
I don't know why that's the name of the
company or companies area killer same
business model power move and the goal
of that company is to lose the same
lawsuit in the California chol courts
he's a little he wishes crazy I saw that
there is commander the guy I don't
slander algae David cuz you'll probably
see thats insane he might be a little
bit of a scam artist that's bite that's
well he's a very rich camera but area so
there's so all this area stuff is
happening I'll be saying then on the
other side of it there's just like weird
Aereo killer in another he's got other
he's got other designs I think you need
to look into his work his previous work
I mean algae David is not like just a
regular guy who happened to do that he
also was in lawsuits with cnet we
actually wrote about him we made
reference to him in one of the stories
we wrote about CNET's right so Aereo
killer by the way has lost their case in
California leave one because they're
called area because you won with this is
like crazy like I mean you start a
company which want to lose it to they
wanted to they could set a precedent so
they could seneca say like Aereo is
illegal and we can tell you because here
we fought it in court and it was beat so
Eric so an eye out for so we now have a
precedent yep so if they fought two lose
which is crazy like higher terrible
lawyers and let's like drug yeah you
hire me what it boils down to is that
there's something very wrong with our
legal system in America watches you
split up right i mean it's i do think i
don't know why we keep acting like these
states are in any way related I mean
honestly I don't understand it we're
just like a bunch of little countries
and I think we just need to get just
that's always get the United States not
the not there's a king of America ya
know there should be a king of no I
don't want it to be a king of America
maybe several I wanted to be 50 kids and
a what let's say a seven season battle I
wanted to be who's I wonder a 50 kings
and you do whatever you want your Little
Kingdom yeah we'll see how it all turns
that worked really well for Europe
everyone has never tried it Westeros it
worked okay for England wait so I want
to know I have another question about
area not even work on it rings all right
there's a country yeah yeah
what for their country for their little
country you know tiny England is you can
put in your back pocket so we have to
divide America into England sighs yeah
England sighs you don't you they
basically are all england sighs look
well I want to be king of Montana you
can be there's no one else there exactly
let's go now I don't it may I limits get
around Anah that I think these Montana
there are like more of cows and people
actually that's cool king of the cash
okay okay my people here i'ma tell ya
here baby site they're like finally some
representation about how in the cow
world um okay anyhow what else do we
have one more question area before so at
this point like what's to stop Ariel
from going to you know ESPN or whoever
and knotting them up to now so is that
is that the next to this is or I don't
think areas key innovation in the world
is the thousands of little renas I think
they're key innovation is that they
exist but if they cut right but but here
they deliver television people over the
all-area has to do at this point is is
is look you evil you roku right at areas
a channel on it Netflix is a channel
yeah area to ESPN could be a channel
yeah oh they Bloomberg right yeah a
Bloomberg right so but I'm saying but
they could sign up uh ESPN or HBO that
flex their innovation is it literally
that they exist and they're providing
people with television that they want so
it has to happen now is comcast shows up
and buys them for a tremendous Madame is
all goes away and then with it I don't
think Barry Diller sell anything to come
yeah i think uh i mean literally it's
Apple might buy them right there's an
apple TV treat monster that so they have
only but they have all these problem but
the promise yet areas like they can't
stream New York television to people in
Wisconsin right also also so they got to
build aware of hair I also they're not
we're here being done getting sued Joe
there's I mean in a year's time when a
year's time they could be shut down
right said like and that's like a real
possibility that's not like well that
what happened ball they're nowhere near
being done being sued in the nowhere
near CBS and fox and ABC going to
Congress and me like check out our my
will I will say this though if you I'm
just gonna say this yeah you know uh if
you want to watch New York television
and you live in your
live in California you you definitely
can do it with area as long as you tell
them that you're in New York just
getting your IP wrong yeah just an
iWatch New York TV yeah if New York you
gonna get a leg yeah but you don't
stereo you have an area in every area is
great you didn't marry region Montana
for instance lots of room for areas yeah
antennas um but you would have to have
them in every state ready they dress
every market where we market that and
those markets are caught up by the like
which is like an area but also there is
current business model is like the key
innovation is not we're going to put the
antennas everywhere it's not we're going
to follow these old byzantine rules for
broadcast television and like hack the
internet on to it their key innovation
is they found the loophole that allows
them to exist like this and once there's
once now they can go to AMC and Cartoon
Network and whatever and say we're
delivering ABC and CBS you could be next
with you you have to you have to which
is what the what the cable companies did
initially does this become you know my
eighty dollar a month cable bill I just
get it over the internet now yeah don't
say I'm that's what everybody was me
that but that's what I mean that's where
their heads were 12 put 12 bucks a month
12 X month yeah which is expensive but I
remember like coming back from CES with
you and the the package i watch amazon
and you watch the game in the cab and I
was like this is the coolest thing one
area yeah yeah there's our works really
well we haven't spent a lot of time I
can't get outside in New York right but
if you're here it works awesome I mean I
get it outside of your long as you tell
them you're in New York yeah um but but
they're big gonna go out of business
right no we'll see ya I think they're
the company I mean assuming alchy David
doesn't get in the way love ya like a
fight between him and Barry Diller yeah
I think they just don't like each other
yeah I think that's why he started
company called Aereo killer in the main
purpose is best uh I'd say yeah but now
I think there's a I think they're the
company that other companies will not
latch onto you right there they're
winning these victories have got the
Barry Diller money behind them yeah
they're gonna be a lon they're going to
be the one that that makes TV over there
like happen in a real way right and it's
just slow and steady I'm excited about
it it seems like a real thing yeah
I mean it's real for now the technology
is super interesting yeah what happens
what happens Aereo in a bad storm just
go out do we know so i have so i have a
belief that they're saying that there's
this is how it works and that they are
they're backing out there some redundant
that they're doing a good job of like
making it that would be illegal that
would be illegal but i don't i don't
know how any the way the law is
structured i don't know how any like IT
guy is like you know what we'll do we
will make 10,000 copies of the same show
on 10,000 hard drives like yeah that is
done like that's just openly dumb and I
they're gonna have to get around that
somehow and I think that they're doing
it in some way cuz it's dumb to do it
any other way iCloud pretty much all
right what else we have sir just gonna
wrap up the last one is Leah which a TV
story it's like a fail yeah so David
review the changing food were you
calling it the review yeah for like
through video your fire the John Locke
marcin a--they got me fired it's an
interesting time for the living room
yeah talk about to you I want to start
with you you back this thing on
Kickstarter ooh why I did uh well I
wanted one why I I only back to Toki get
one I I wouldn't say I paint ninety nine
dollars for this I don't consider that
back in it cost me nine is I doors okay
you know one I bother I did you want one
backing but that was on my intention
this is a huge fight in our comments but
go on my intention was to buy one yeah
cuz I wanted to check it out why why why
what does anybody do anything the world
is a mysterious but full of full of
light and color mom I don't know it
seemed interesting I just just like a
$99 android-based console with a whole
new you no idea why not sure i'll check
it out it's no very low risk for me $99
right I mean it's plus if it's bad you
know expense it and we all go I really
expensive um no and and uh it just
seemed like an ambitious crazy thing and
I thought like if they could pull this
off it'd be really awesome and if they
don't well yeah it's not about yeah um
and and they didn't pull it off yet yet
I mean I'll say this it's very
disappointing I played I was very
disappointed with it
uh the game selection is bad the
implementation is bad this interface is
sluggish the hardware is extremely
mediocre um I did I did think I mean you
know for nine bucks it's you know not
bad sure uh might exists in like that
you can see here you can get a sense of
the slow interface we see some of this
video it feels a lot slower than it
actually looks like it actually looks
sort of these in here uh it's sort of a
shame because I think there's a lot of
good ideas letting it stop at play uh
and it just I don't think they should
release it in March yeah they should
have released this is the big this is
the big argument about coming holidays
it's coming out it there it's it's
coming out in June uh yeah like a UH
60,000 people who you know backed it on
Kickstarter that what they're trying to
spin this as you know if you backed it
on Kickstarter you're admitting you know
you signed up to get a beta product that
isn't finished and you are like along
for this ride with us but like I don't
think that's what happened i think
people paid a hundred dollars for a
hundred dollar product because they
wanted the hundred dollar product yeah
right now they're getting it and I think
anybody who did that is going to be
deeply disappointed by this thing yeah I
asked your developer right if you're a
developer this means I yeah honestly
it's all they had competition right you
know in the ninety nine dollar right
Kickstarter console they could have been
like listen guys the games aren't ready
yet we want to make sure the experience
is great developers are hard at work
we're gonna hold this until June for our
full global launch right and tough tough
cookies yeah I mean and the thing is
like the cookies that's being something
totally the whole this software isn't
final it'll get better is a lie that
every company tells remember it's kind
of like kind of like yeah I mean and
sometimes they're right like in in in
this case it's not hard stuff to fix
they just need to make the interface
faster and also my mortification yeah
that makes the interface faster what's
been trying to do that no I cried your
google got it you you you but after five
years its Android for it's not like
rocket science e1 yeah yeah I'm just
made it whoops oh why they made it worse
but I've heard over and over and over
again the Android on TV is like a
problem and the reason the goo
tvteam kind of fell apart is that they
never got the support well I'm not gonna
play movie on Android just yet well I
mean I thought I think it's playwright I
think it's much harder to do what
they're trying to do sure then anybody's
it's not just make Android run faster
optimized Android I think there's
another step which is optimized Android
to make it work on anyway you know it
and that has been very difficult on the
Xbox interface used to be really
sluggish too yeah I mean I'm not I'm not
I'm not worried about the interface much
i'm worried about this is the thing
that's hard buy-in from publishers yep
buy-in from developers and maybe they
haven't but there are some key games
that seem they seem like they should
have been easy to port something like
shadowgun well they could they could
show off what the hardware can do and is
actually like a decent game yeah um and
the hard part there is that and this is
I think the mistake that we may have
made is by saying every game has to be
free to download like period right so in
in it the two things that you have to do
to portion android no it's also hot
dollars that trigger or something which
is free free free so the two things you
have to do our make sure that works for
the controller which is easy it's just a
Bluetooth controller people that devs
have been doing forever and you have to
make it free to download which sounds
small but it's actually for if you want
to like make money off your game a
tremendous amount of work because you
have to build either in-app purchases or
an upgrade system where you have to have
a demo version and it just like if I'm
shadowgun and I'm like I'm making a ton
of money off the Play Store and there's
not that many people buying Lea's why
would I take time so they end up with
again this stupid developer chicken or
egg problem there it's it's a real look
it's a huge undertaking look at this
this is yeah that game is fun so strong
you just beat up a pig where is for like
a long time it's great the game is this
it's called beast boxing oh you got shot
a gun right on there yeah and that's
that's the other programmers okay is yet
shadowgun is is totally playable it is
just frame rates a gigantic amount of
work to get it onto the device itself
and this is why it's such a cool
developer play thing and why like I hope
and that's not even awesomeness by the
way know the time I had to spend you
know ten minutes remapping every button
to do something right in shadow guns I
did the game works fine I think
could be great but it's just not what
some what'swhat's troubling about it is
that you know yiling you only get one
chance to make you don't get a second
chance make a first impression right
right and the first impression here is
well the hardware a little bit janky and
I mean you know and the games aren't
there ready interface is sluggish I mean
this this is I think that there's a
bigger thing about Kickstarter here to
understand right which is well Leah came
out the Astron what nine hundred
thousand dollars i'm gloria saying a
meeting earlier today and it's like they
just want enough money to build a
prototype I wanted to show what they
were gonna build and then right and I go
to like a store and be like Best Buy
like invest in this yeah or like place
an order or like give us some way to
build the rest of them with the ended
was they ended up with eight and a half
million dollars wells in 2000 PP ended
up pre-selling sixty thousand of them
yeah which is essentially what what
happened they didn't get this like
investment round they pre-sold and then
kept selling them Ryan capsule they
didn't have to do that I a patent is not
the same i mean yeah i think the age of
my massive Kickstarter projects from
indie devs i think is I think
Kickstarter doesn't want to have them I
think I think everyone just learned i
got i don't think that i I don't I don't
fault Kickstarter here but I think that
well Kickstarter's like you know they
put up the post we're not a store
they're doing a far more controlling of
what's going on but I do think it's fine
if you have a prop I don't knock the
ambition we were say I said earlier I
don't knock the ambition I'm all for
people being ambitious but if you're
gonna be ambitious you need to deliver
on it right that's the thing about being
ambitious and the thing to you if you're
gonna do to say unit make this cool new
kind of console like deliver on doing
that well or else people are gonna be
like well who care and I have a really
smartly was they they waited forever to
get it out the way they got out they got
it out that's my point first sometimes
you gotta admit the Pebble watch is not
bad no no he does a lot of pretty cool
things right it's not perfect I
purposely don't have one cuz I'm a like
I'm afraid of like having notifications
on my wrist talks all the time about the
phantom vibrations now that he gets on
his wrist yeah like I liked it so much
when I had it reviewing it that I was
like
he's gonna get glass I'm glad and we
gotta wrap up we have a lot more who you
