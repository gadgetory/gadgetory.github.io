we're here in Anaheim California at NAB
which is the National Association of
music merchants show now a lot of this
show does center around traditional
instrumentation so we're talking pianos
drums guitars things like that but there
is a portion of it that is devoted to
technology and there's a lot of it so
we're gonna wander inside and see what
we find and play around with a lot of
cool stuff and hopefully we will uncover
some cool technology that we can share
with you so there's really been two
overarching themes have been really
interesting at NAMM this year and that's
the educational side where people are
really trying to simplify the music
making process and make it so that total
beginners can enter and not feel scared
and can can learn to play any sort of
instrument with relative ease we saw
teenage engineering they came out with
some new pocket operators and they're
very cool little calculator size kind of
mousetrap looking things that are
sequencers with a very minimal set of
buttons and they're new ones let you
actually record vocal samples into them
so you can take your own voice and
create a completely synthesized version
of it and play around with it it's it's
really wild they're cheap they're fun to
use those were great and then we also
saw this little thing called the blip
phlox which is a synth that cement for
three to eight year olds they which is
insane and it's got these little arrows
on the top that show you the signal how
it goes throughout the instrument from
button to button to the eventual output
so the idea is for little kids to get
comfortable with the origins of
synthesis before they actually graduate
to some
that requires a little more precision
and attention then we also saw the one
highlight piano strip so it's an 88 key
strip that you place on top of your
keyboard and guitar trio style it
teaches you how to play the notes light
up as they're supposed to drop down
on-screen and you just follow along I
tried playing it I screwed up quite a
few times but after about five minutes I
got the hang of the melody and nailed a
hundred percent I felt really good about
it - it's great we're also seeing this
whole category sort of third-party
add-ons of do all things that you can
use in conjunction with equipment that
you already have to add functionality or
to make them even better than they
already were another thing that we saw
was a little rectangle called sustain
and the phase is something that you put
on top of a record on a turntable and it
communicates with a hub and your
computer to eliminate the need for a
tone arm so you can scratch a record you
can scrub through songs and you don't
need to have a needle you don't need to
have a tone arm at all it's wild
also solving the tonearm problem we had
a company called 'rain which had
actually created a brand new turntable
from scratch that did not have a tone
arm built into it whatsoever and that
had a little pad on the side where the
tone arm would traditionally be but it
was a smart strip instead and you could
just take your finger and run it on the
side and use that to find your position
within the song where ever you wanted
the song to land just in a weird part of
the music spectrum there's been a couple
of VR experiences as well there's a
company called arrow drums which lets
you play drums in VR so you have the
sticks and then you have metallic
reflectors on your feet and then there's
camera and using oculus you can play an
entire drum kit without making any noise
without actually buying a drum kit at
all and you can swap out the drums to
make a custom drum kit to whatever
specifications you would want so there's
definitely a couple of companies that
are trying to figure out how music can
be accessible in a VR space how
successful they are I'm not really sure
but it really was fun to try them out at
the very least
so those are really the two main
categories that we're seeing here at
NAMM and it's a really interesting time
because over the past few years there
has been this intersection of music and
tech that has really tried to simplify
the music making process and it's cool
to be here and to see all of it in
person to watch that revolution
happening for more information and to
follow more news about music and
technology follow us at the verge calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
