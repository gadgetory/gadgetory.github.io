relationships since well forever but
with the massive increase in digital
dating platforms sometimes it gets a
little much an ever-growing list of apps
like tinder grinder hinge serve up an
unending number of potential partners to
evaluate headlines are calling it the
dating apocalypse but is the constant
swiping really such a bad thing the
evidence out there is mixed on the one
hand there's the concept of choice
overload the idea that too many options
might make it harder to choose and to be
happy with the result experts point to a
study done in a grocery store where
shoppers were much more likely to stop
and try the samples at a table crammed
with options but they actually bought
the items more often when there were
fewer to choose from it's like when you
fall asleep watching countless trailers
on Netflix before you manage to decide
on a movie of course shopping for jam or
picking a movie is a little different
than looking for a life partner where
the stakes are a lot higher and whether
choice overload exists and applies to
online dating is actually kind of
controversial in one small study of a
group of undergraduate students who are
mostly white and mostly female so not
really representative of the general
population the students were less
satisfied when they picked a date from
24 options than when they picked from
six but that's an artificial situation
and when you look at actual couples
having more choices might work out just
fine in the long run various studies
show that couples who met online stayed
together about as often or slightly more
often than couples who met in person and
actually digital matches ended up
getting married faster more importantly
online dating and dating apps have
actually been pretty helpful in the
LGBTQ community as the internet gain
traction in the 1990s the percentage of
gay and lesbian couples who met their
soul mates on the internet spiked and
continued to rise so looking at the data
it kind of seems like even if we feel
overwhelmed at dating options it isn't
preventing us from making decisions we
wind up being happy with just the
opposite still mainstream dating
platforms have a long way to go before
their inclusive of everyone that's why
new apps like thirst a dating app for
queer people of all genders have popped
onto the scene regardless of how
sophisticated dating platforms get there
are still just tools
they don't magically take the effort out
of relationships sadly so if you're
single and feeling overwhelmed keep
swiping and hope for the best you'll
probably find someone probably</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
