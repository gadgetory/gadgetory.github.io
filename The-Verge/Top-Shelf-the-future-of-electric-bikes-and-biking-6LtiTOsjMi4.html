Pierce and this week we're talking about
bikes bikes don't seem like they've
changed that much over the years they
have pedals and when you pedal them they
go forward but there's actually a lot
happening so we're starting with
electric bikes they're not that new but
they're cool and they're interesting and
I just really wanted to ride one so I
rode one New York City and electric
bikes have a particularly strained
relationship lots of people use them
delivery men and just people looking to
get around without a car but they're
also illegal and you can actually get a
fine for using it and there are a bunch
of different reasons it's been back and
forth the changes there all the time so
we're here at a company called nice
wheels it's also NYC e wheels where they
actually sell electric bikes and
scooters and folding bikes and all kinds
of stuff so I would figure out how
they're here how they stay in business
and where they see the future of
electric bikes bill
my name is Peter use kaskus I'm the
manager here at the shop I've been here
about three years the store in itself
has been here for about ten years
overall we became one of the first big
dealers of electric bikes in the whole
country what was the technology like on
an electric scooter ten years ago you
know noisier motors a lot of chain
driven drive trains instead of having
the motor inside the wheel so things
have developed a lot in terms of
batteries and also motors and a lot of
new like sensor developments too why for
you guys electric bikes and electric
scooters and why is that particularly
interesting again well it's just you
know part of it is having a little bit
less dependence on gas being able to get
around in a clean quiet way gas powered
things are noisy in general they're
easier to fuel up everywhere but if you
can charge your battery powered vehicle
it only takes a couple cents per day and
you can get you know really good range
out of them so for inner-city commuting
you've got like 20 miles to go you can
totally do that but electric like these
seem perfectly designed for cities and
maybe not as much for other kinds of
people well it depends I mean we have a
lot of customers who are been bike
riders for all their lives you know I've
been in good shape all their lives even
and like you know maybe they have a
physical problem now with their knees or
something or they can't you know get the
same you know distance that they want to
yeah like my mom for example has a
bionics motor system installed on her
bike and it allows her to keep up with
my dad doing like 50 mile rides that she
could never do otherwise yeah so you
know we could sell it to a lot of people
who aren't in cities as well okay so
you're in New York City and there's all
sorts of complications with be bikes in
New York City so I've read a lot of
things where do we stand now with
electric bikes and especially New York
City well this is a confusing problem
because the media will have you believe
that electric bikes are evil and that
they change people into evil people who
will run you down on the street so it's
really not true so is the logic
basically that it's it's quiet but it
goes really fast and it's really heavy
so they're definitely gonna kill you
what it is is that there's always been a
problem with delivery guys riding on
sidewalks riding the wrong way and
hitting people not obeying traffic not
having licenses and so there's been no
accountability and it's always hard to
tag like a certain thing as being the
problem right now that there's electric
bikes it's really easy to be like whoa
hey look the Vice
different therefore it's causing the
problem their fault but really what we
see is that we have customers who are
riding these bikes commuting to and from
work every day are totally considerate
are not giving any money any hassle and
but all you hear about with electric
bikes is like oh I saw this guy riding
down the sidewalk and he almost hit me
with all his you know food bags and
whatever and he just throttled off down
the street I mean the big thing is that
they're heavier so they're more
dangerous because you know they're
moving out of fast speed they're heavy
and that's what is theirs
sure so what you've seen in that New
York now is a delivery guys have these
vests and they have the name of the
restaurant and a little ID number and so
I think what's going to happen is
there's going to be a sort of a
crackdown at first and then they're
basically only going to bother people
who are breaking traffic laws or are
working delivery that don't have this
commercial kind of get it right so the
real problem there is not is not the
bikes but the bikers like and and this
is I guess an ongoing problem for people
in general it's like you know people in
cars like to complain that bikers think
they're pedestrians and think their
drivers and just do whatever they want
at any given time I mean for example I
read a study that last week seven people
were killed by cars and crosswalks you
know why isn't there a crackdown on cars
driving through crosswalks that's much
more important yeah there's a lot be I'm
sure that's causing many more accidents
and it seems like that would be
impatient just get rid of cars and put
everybody on electric bikes and that
would like meet we solve this problem so
what's what's gonna change you think
we're just gonna get to the point where
are they going to treat it like cars
where they're gonna have to have license
plates and stop at red lights and things
like that or I gotta wear how do we
figure that out I mean I see probably
like in European countries they're
usually a little bit further in terms of
regulations you can kind of take a cue
from Europe they're probably going to
have a little bit more licensing maybe
some insurance thing I mean I don't
think it has to go that way I think we
can all just be considerate and obey
traffic laws and kind of like get along
that way because in a lot of other
countries these they're super prevalent
right like they're they're electric
bikes are everywhere well for example
our most popular electric bike the
Stromer
over the u.s. they probably sold 500
last year but they sold 3000 and
euro flesh so so you think well we'll
land somewhere that makes sense with all
this eventually yeah I think so yeah I
mean come on it's it's here to stay it's
a cool technology it's really changing a
lot of people's lives for the better and
you know most of the cases is not people
who are like getting their lives ruined
by being run over it's people who are
having their lives change for the better
getting more exercise staying healthy
enjoying the outdoors cool so can we can
we see a few of these bikes I want to
yeah of course see what's going on and
actually take a look at some of the tech
here okay so let's start it sort of the
low end like what's the cheapest easiest
way for somebody to get into this sure
well we get that question a lot a lot of
people are unsure how much to spend you
see a lot of kits out there for like
$300 $500 and it's like thousand watt
motor 15a power batteries any of those
works yeah I mean what we sell is only
like the best quality stuff so we won't
always have the cheapest but we'll have
the best stuff so for example a Bionic
system which is this is the battery for
a bionics yeah this is something as
co-ops
on your bike and you replace the rear
wheel with a motor wheel just like this
right and then the battery goes on like
where your water bottle would normally
go and so with that system you can start
it around $1,000 if you install it
yourself it's a little low powered but
it's nice and lightweight
again this is assistance it's not like a
motorcycle so it is low power that means
it's already more powerful than you are
and you 11 okay but it's um you know
it's lighter its cheaper and so in this
case I'm still pedaling it just does a
lot more every time I pedal yeah
essentially you'll see that with all the
bikes we have pretty much we're all
based on assistance we don't want to
replace your leg power in our like
augment then if I want to get an actual
electric bike everything built-in I
don't want to you know stick this in my
water bottle holder what's what's next
where do we go from there
the next thing would be a bike like this
Stromer this one is one of the latest
technology that we have the battery is
actually in the tube here and you can
remove it I pulled it out of another one
of these bikes so you've got this
removable battery that's a is all fancy
I think that it's purple yes there's one
that's orange too if you like orange I
like that I'm gonna make the battery so
you know this again is like the highest
level technology this is the kind of
cells that you have in like an Apple
computer battery just like the best sort
of thing just a ton of them yeah and
this is from TD high tech which is a
really good battery actually and it's
made in Taiwan so a bike like this what
you get is a much more powerful motor
typically in the full electric bikes you
have like a 500 watt loader back which
is like way more powerful than Lance
Armstrong for right don't quote me on
that
but um I mean I assume it's more
powerful it better be more powerful yeah
it's it's super powerful and then they
tend to be also a lot more kind of cool
and integrated so they have like a
little light up console here that has
all your bike computer functions like
how fast you're going how far you're
gone and all that stuff these will tell
you how much you've got left in the tank
in terms of percentage and yeah you can
select like modes of power from low to
high cool
so the best electric systems will like
sense your pedaling power like
automatically and smoothly like as soon
as you pedal the motor just engages and
you're like whoa how did I get so strong
who knows the superhero is that yeah
yeah and that is the thing that is the
coolest part about electric bikes these
days is they're not they're not like
mopeds are not replacing your light
power you just feel like like like great
all of a sudden you feel and are really
far yeah - all the steroids it's great
exactly
Wow
it's wild this bike is super heavy so
it's like when I don't have any
assistance actually really awful and
then as soon as I turn it on just ain't
no thing if I'm on eco this is the least
mode this is like every time I pedal
it's like I pedal you know three times
I really do want this just to get to
work I guess we could park bikes at our
office I would start I would get one of
these riders working
I will say this battery is not dying
slowly Oh ready you wanna see how fast I
can go
just between here and there ready I'm
gonna take my keep up at this car I mean
and beauty is I don't have to worry
about cars cuz I'm much faster than all
of them
I don't know if that's true I have no
science to back that up but I think it's
probably true especially Newark so
having written one of these now I kind
of get why they're illegal it's all of
the fun of riding a bike and none of the
work and you go about five times as fast
that's not to say I don't want one I do
but I really don't want anybody else to
have one at least not until there's a
way to make them a little safer or put a
bell on it that make sure it goes really
loud so for now I'm the only one who has
one so I don't care I'll see you later I
really want an electric bike but I don't
exactly have four thousand dollars
burning in my pocket luckily this guy
found a better way Evan Rogers you
actually built yourself an electric bike
right yeah pretty much
I mean I assembled it what it was the
difference so you had all the parts you
hadn't like make battery you can
retrofit a regular bike frame with all
the parts you need to run an electric
bike and it's a lot cheaper than buying
a ready-made pre-made electric bike
probably by the order of a few thousand
dollars so really yeah it definitely
pays off to do it yourself okay so like
in in your case what where do you start
what like what do you do you're like I
want to build an electric bike well they
sell kits like you can buy kits on
Amazon um you can get them on eBay uh or
you can buy them piece by piece from
various like enthusiast shops online so
what do you need you need like a back
wheel with the right kind of motor on
you can actually get a front or back
wheel depending on what your what your
fancy like yeah yeah uh wouldn't if you
had the front wheel that would be
terrifying because it would just like
take off and without you well I mean if
you're going short distances and you
there's an are a lot of Hills like a
front wheel is usually cheaper because
it's usually a smaller motor um it's
also a lot easier to like remove and
attach because of the front wheel
attachments
yeah but you also need a throttle
assembly you need a electric brakes so
that you know when you when you stop the
bike it you know stops the motor um
solid play you need a control box that
just kind of controls all the
electronics any new battery and that's
pretty much I know it all just comes in
a kit that you just sort of scale on it
looks like I mean if you if you have any
experience just repairing or maintaining
bikes it's easily within the realm
so tell me walk me through like the
process so you buy this kit it shows up
yes
ready go so one thing you got to kind of
consider is that the torque of a large
rear motor might actually be a little
bit too much for thinner road bike
frames so a hybrid frame or a mountain
bike frame is really kind of more better
better suited make sense also just it
all kind of just holds together feels a
lot better if you have a mountain bike
frame because there's a lot there's a
rickety other one yeah it's a lot of
power behind it but usually the back
motor in one of these kits is actually
fully was already attached to the tire
okay so you basically you just remove
the back tire um and kind of replace it
with this entirely different motorized
back tire right um you kind of snake the
wires through the frame on the back part
and replace your existing brakes the
electric brakes kind of mount the
throttle up on the top and find a place
for the control box and your battery and
you're good to go okay so this is like
an afternoon project yeah theoretically
just you know flip the bike over in your
backyard and just do yeah I feel like
this would also be a great thing to get
horribly wrong on your first try and
either doubt yourself into the
stratosphere or just like nothing would
happen I don't know it's that I don't
even it's pretty straightforward
um the pedal detection actually now that
you mention it can be a little funny
because there's a little black motion
detector that you put near the pedals um
but I actually found that to be really
annoying and I just never used it uh
also it's just way more enjoyable to
just throttle it just as hard as you can
yeah it just feels awesome yeah one of
the places where I went wrong is I
thought that I would need a huge 40 amp
hour battery okay um this is back when I
was in school I was traveling between
two and three miles to campus every day
uh just riding a clock just riding to
class which is I feel like what most
people need is that range it's like I
for me I'm the same way I need that ride
to work and from work every day that's
all I yeah um and I you know I was on a
really steep incline both ways actually
depending on which way you get to my
apartment so three miles
so like miles I mean but it accumulated
like going back and forth between campus
and classes like ten miles a day okay
but I would have to charge my my 40 amp
hour battery maybe once every week and a
half
realist overkill like krei
and a 48 hour battery would be like
enormous yeah it's very range very heavy
and I really wish that I had gotten a
smaller one because it does a lot of
weight and it just makes a bike very
cumbersome yeah especially considering
that when I originally got the bike the
battery was mounted behind the tire
above above it so the center of gravity
was very high and shifted towards the
back and made it very awkward yeah I
ended up retrofitting the battery into
the center of the frame which helped a
lot but it was still a very large
battery I think you try to carry that
thing upstairs and you're just you're
gonna die yeah and the other thing I
wish I would have done was was buy the
frame and all the parts separately so
that I could have chosen like a higher
quality aluminum so you also maybe got a
smaller battery and it was just you fit
it to what you needed yes this is the
big thing I was worried about seeing all
these folks with the electric bikes at
nice wheels is that they have their
range is like 40 miles some of them and
that's like that's nice yeah you know
people get mad about their electric cars
with 300 mile range like I get that it's
different but it's still I would worry
but I guess for most people it's just
the kids I need to go few miles at a
time and then the others case it just
becomes a bike I would really much
rather have a lighter bike with
significantly reduced my like even if
you can only go 15 miles in a day yeah
I'd really much rather have that and
take it like actually in two buildings
instead of like struggling with those
like an 85-pound bike assembly there uh
so how much did you spend on this whole
thing the whole thing was seven hundred
and fifty bucks which is pretty good
like that booting a bike frame yeah
including the bike frame that's the
thing is the bike frame was yeah it's
just not a good bike for spend a bit
more on automatic brake I mean that's
still that's a quarter of what some of
these electric bikes yes artwork you
don't have to spend four or five
thousand dollars right um if you really
pick out a good kit one that fits your
needs well and use a quality bike frame
I mean you might go over a thousand
dollars but a lot of enthusiasts or
well-designed pre-made bikes are well
over to the two or three thousand dollar
so I'm assuming I know you relatively
well and I'm assuming you looked at
every single kit on the internet before
picking one yes why did you pick the one
you picked um that battery it was in the
just like give me all that battery well
the bet ya the battery by itself usually
cost like $350 okay for like a 40 amp
hour battery yeah and I mean that may
have gone down slightly since I got it
but I got the most battery for my buck
which I feel like was a good thought
process at the time until I really came
to grips with how much it actually
weighed so is that the big difference
between all the options you looked at is
just battery everything else because
it's all basically the single assembly
right well be the 500 to 700 watt motor
that I got I wouldn't skimp on that
because it'll take you a pretty steep
hill but not without a little bit of
help but anything less than that I think
it would really chug and you know if
you're just on flat ground I mean it
really depends on your situation yeah so
if you are like here in the city and you
it's really pretty flat um don't spend
this much on a motor you won't need it
yet I mean it'll go it might take you
pretty fast but I mean it's also pretty
dangerous well that's I mean that's
that's my other question here is like on
one hand I feel like it's more dangerous
just cuz you made it yourself well but
on the other hand like did you feel you
know you're in a college situation it's
there's a lot of people around did you
feel unsafe like I haven't spent that
much time on electric by god it was
terrifying I just killed so many I mean
I got used to it and like it wasn't the
experience was not terrifying but well
and it seems like to me riding this
thing with bike breaks but a motor just
felt terribly like efficient it was like
oh I'm gonna just use these little
handles and that'll stop me it know
doesn't stop you it just nuts the motor
here like you have to put apply the
mechanical pressure to stop yeah your
body and like a 60 pound or a 60 pound
battery from moving it like a pretty
decent clip okay going it like 30 miles
an hour yes it's crazy it's pretty scary
on the bicycle yeah um so I mean well
first of all you should definitely wear
a helmet um a few people ever do but
they're if you're going 30 miles an hour
on a motorized piece of equipment I'm
gonna recommend that you use a helmet
fair enough so speaking of safety that's
actually one of the big things that we
looked at this week there's a lot of
issues here city bike doesn't require
that you wear a helmet in New York and
accidents have gone up because of it and
electric bikes as Evan said will almost
definitely kill you if you don't wear
the right helmet so we went to NYU to
talk to a professor there about what
they're doing and what they're working
on to make helmets not only safer but
cheaper and lighter and better so that
you'll actually wear the thing and stay
alive my parents always wanted me to
wear a bike helmet when I was a kid
because you know it keeps me alive but I
never wanted to it was big and ugly and
made my hair look funny but there were
people trying to solve that we're here
at the Polytechnic Institute at NYU to
talk to dr. Nikhil Gupta who's worked on
helmets for Olympians the military
athletes of all kinds and basically his
goal is to make the safest best-looking
lightest coolest helmet on the planet
and it all starts with foam so okay so
first sort of at a very broad level what
happens in this lab what are you guys
working on in here well we work on
understanding how materials absorb
energy and that's a very important
application when you look at helmets you
are looking at a very small space in
which a lot of energy has to be absorbed
we don't work on individual products we
mainly work on developing materials and
finding out what kind of loading
conditions those materials will be
working well in so we have six different
kinds here right so what what
differentiates I guess sort of my
scientific knowledge is lacking so what
what differentiates sort of one foam
from the next so there are a few things
that you can look at the foams if you
look closely that the cell size of these
forms is different that means how big
the pores are and these forms and that
kind of determines the density of these
materials okay and how much energy they
would absorb is related to the density
of a form the denser the foam is it may
absorb more energy compared to a much
more lighter weight forms okay but now
we have new methods of making forms
lighter but increasing their energy
absorption capability so some of these
fancy forms not these ones but the ones
that we are working in developing new
ones might actually involve things like
carbon nanotubes or nano fibers interest
so which keep the foams low density but
at the same time they absorb a lot more
energy then the traditional forms dr.
Gupta told us that what he's testing
isn't how aerodynamic your health it is
or how cool it looks he's not testing
any particular helmet at all he's
focused on foam every kind of foam you
can imagine at about 10,000 other kinds
phone is the backbone of your helmet
it's what absorbs the impact when you
fall off your bike or get punched in the
head and depending on what you're doing
you need something very different in his
lab dr. Gupta tests the power of foam
over and over he's constantly trying to
find how much of a beating a certain
type can take what if there's a pebble
flying at it at 100 miles an hour or if
you're on your bike skidding along the
ground on a hot summer day what happens
then dr. Gupta knows the effects of
temperature vibration and time he also
knows what happens if you fire a gun in
terms of its ratio of density to
strength the phone he makes can be
stronger than steel
of course everyone needs different
phones though dense foam is heavy foam
and dense foam might not be what
protects us best anyway
dr. Gupta works with the military and
Olympians and regular people like me
he's designing armor for the military
that's both incredibly light and
incredibly strong he's worked with
Olympic boxers who need a helmet that
will take repeated abuse he's also
worked with equestrians who need to be
able to fall off a horse and survive
those riders need a helmet that will
take huge impact once rather than lesser
impact over time or Olympic cyclist who
spill off their bikes at huge speed and
skid along the ground each needs a
different kind of foam for a different
kind of impact dr. Gupta's making sure
helmets do what they really have to do
keep us safe and that's her first show
thanks so much for watching thanks to
the team at nice wheels for hanging out
with us thanks to dr. Nikhil Gupta and
the team at the Polytechnic Institute at
NYU and thanks to Evan Rogers for
probably convincing me to buy a bike
that's going to kill me we'll be back
next Monday and we'll see you then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
