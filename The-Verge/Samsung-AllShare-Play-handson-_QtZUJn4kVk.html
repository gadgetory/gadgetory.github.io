at Samsung's booth at CES taking a look
at their AllShare Play technology which
streams media from phones to TVs and
computers you don't have to be on the
same network so let's get in here we can
take a quick look at this so if you
click the AllShare Play app opens up and
it shows you devices you've registered
there's the phone itself but we've also
got a notebook registered here and these
devices aren't on the same network so
you're pulling things from different
locations but I click on the notebook
it'll bring up all the media you've got
pictures music film and so forth you can
tap film to look the movies here and I'm
pulling things again from a computer
that's not on this network if I watch
one of these movies and stream it to
another TV there's a TV here hooked up
for the same Wi-Fi network as a note so
I can check the movie hit this play
button here they'll start buffering and
in a moment it should come up so
actually should be I can select which
device
I'll have it go to this TV the note and
the TV are on the same network but not
the computer
and now it's playing on the TV so again
these are hookups of the same Wi-Fi
network but it's blowing from a computer
and a totally different location we also
have one more feature like the show you
can bounce webpages off to these TVs as
well so there's a web browser and if you
click this here it'll send it out
against the same TV we were just looking
at on the same network and you can
actually use the touchpad to move the
cursor around so if you want to you know
tap around Google that's how you do it
so that's all share play with Samsung at
CES</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
