today we're going to be looking at the
best keyboards and keyboard cases for
your iPad first up is the Logitech
tablet keyboard which looks a lot like
Apple's white keyboard but it's plastic
which means it's lighter and it's black
and it's blue accents it includes a
pretty decent stand that doubles as a
case and it has magnets to keep it
closed so when you flip it open there
are two modes upright and at more of an
angle depending on what your preference
is and it's portrait and landscape feels
like a full keyboard and the key action
is great but there's no function row
like Apple's keyboard has this thing
lasts 10 months on for triple-a
batteries which is nice for traveling
it's reasonable at 70 dollars which is
the same as Apple's but this one also
includes a stand the Adana tri Terp
Loess keyboard folio looks nice on the
outside with this red accents but once
you try to get your iPad inside you
realize it's not made out of that great
quality so this thing does have a
removable keyboard which is a nice touch
and the keys are small but they work
well they're nice and firm and there is
a function row for iPad specific
functions that you might want to use you
can either use the keyboard in its
default setting or you can remove it and
use magnets to align the keyboard with
the rest of the case but the magnets are
finicky and don't work that well and
it's expensive in $100 the Logitech
solar keyboard folio is a new one and
it's expensive at 120 $9.99 but I think
it's one of our favorite options it's
kind of everything the Adana
writer plus wants to be but it's
excellent build quality the back is
actually fully embedded so it's not
flopping around and it's actually
solar-powered even though you can use
ambient light in your room that can give
you two years of use for charging it for
six hours so the keyboard feels very
solid since it's embedded into the body
and we really like the design we like
the most as medium mode when you flip it
down so you can see the additional
function keys when you're on the plane
or when you're watching it on the table
it's unique and stylish it's definitely
a winner the touch fire keyboard was
born on Kickstarter and it kind of looks
like a fruit roll-up for your iPad it's
made out of conductive silicone rubber
and uses magnets to align its keys on
your iPad screen and believe it or not
it actually does help a lot because
since each key has four contact points
towards the center of the key on the
touch fire when even if you
touch the sides of a key it actually
will make contact in the center of the
key and it does work feels expensive at
$49.99 but you'll also want a smart
cover since it magnetically attaches to
that and you probably don't want to be
typing flat on your table clam case
turns your iPad into a plastic netbook
so it's pretty heavy and also gets oily
like the original MacBook since it's
plastic during my test I found the clam
case nearly impossible to type on
because if it's cramped keyboard with
flat keys and no space between the keys
but the spacebar is the biggest problem
because you're hitting it pretty
frequently and it just doesn't work so
it only has seems like one contact a
point with the sensor so some nice
features are its great hinge for
flipping it around and protects your
iPad but it's very top-heavy and flops
around a lot if you're moving at all
lots of people swear by this thing but I
pass it around the office and nobody
liked it it's also a small fortune at
$150 next is the Logitech ultrathin
keyboard folio which is pretty ingenious
it acts as a smart cover for your iPad
and since it's also aluminum it kind of
looks like you have two iPads sandwiched
together its thinnest and lightest
Hardware I tested besides the touch fire
and it has a magnetic latch on the side
but also magnetic slot for your iPad
which keeps it very securely locked in
it's good for portrait and landscape
mode but it's only packed at one angle
so it's going to be pretty upright the
keyboard is fine but you're making
compromise because it's so thin so the
keys are kind of plasticy given what
you're holding in your hand it seems
expensive for $99 but it's the only
smart cover replacement here and it
works really well
the Targa's versa vu keyboard folio
looks nice on the outside with this
leather case and moleskin desk strap and
there's even a stylus holder once you
start using it you realize it's not so
great the keys are Square firm and
responsive and there's some interesting
function keys like select all but
there's a real deal breaker here with
the keyboard that I just can't recommend
it there's no : key you have to activate
: in its places an apostrophe which is
slid over so it's very confusing when
you're using it and not only that but
the iPad doesn't feel too firmly in
place when you want to touch the screen
but besides that it feels like it's a
good product quality for ninety dollars
but because the missing keys I can't
possibly recommend it next up is the
Apple wireless keyboard apple is known
for its great keyboards and this thing
is terrific quality very good feedback
from the keys replaceable double eight
batteries so you're good for traveling
it's on the heavy side for a keyboard
but it's also the best built since it's
white it's prone to get very dirty and
there aren't any iPad specific function
keys like all of its competitors $69.99
is a great deal for what you get you can
also use it for your computer but you'll
need to spend a bit more money propping
up your iPad using Apple's own Smart
Cover or even better in cases
ultra-modern
origami which is a case for your
keyboard and a stand for your iPad the
Belkin your type keyboard folio is a big
pain in the ass to get your iPad in and
out of it fits really snug but once you
do get it in you realize that your iPad
is very much upright you kind of have to
Crane your neck down to be able to see
what's going on on screen but you can
step back a little bit because it does
have a removable velcro keyboard which
you might like or you might not like so
the keyboard feels nice to use until you
realize that it's not registering any
key presses unless you press directly
down onto the key the corners if you
press down on them doesn't work there's
a nice magnetized flap on the top too
but there no magnets turn off your iPad
when you close it not recommending
Belkin your type at $99 the Zagg folio
is the third generation of zags famous
iPad keyboard folios and it is really
good it holds the iPad firmly in place
and it's also feels very strong can
protect your iPad when it's all closed
the carbon fiber backs a bit tacky but
there's a clip that keeps it closed
which is nice and the aluminum keyboard
feels solid and durable lastly if you do
want to use the iPad in portrait mode
you can remove the keyboard and scrap
the case that props the whole thing up
which is a nice touch it's $99.99 and
you will get months of battery life
according to zag Kensington key stand
unfolds from a unique felt foldable
enclosure into a flat iPad keyboard with
just one place to put your iPad so you
can do portrait and landscape though you
really just have one viewing angle to
choose from Keys depress hard and fast
though the keyboard itself does flex a
little as you use it there are a lot of
function buttons in the brightness
button which is great not many of them
have that and we like that it folds up
for Portability and there's a magnetic
enclosure to make sure it stays closed
the Kensington key stand at $69.99 is a
great buy skosh keypad p2 is a tank it's
got nice leather it's very protective it
has a kickstand but that flap you see on
the top it's a
is in the way the water resistant
silicone keyboard is very mushy and hard
to feel out it's also cramped you're
gonna be making a lot of mistakes
especially since this thing also only
has one key between l and the enter keys
once you're using it you realize too
that when you're touching the iPad
screen a little shove will quickly knock
over the kickstand 75 hours of battery
life on the skosh keypad it's $79.99 in
the end if you're going to be doing a
ton of typing on your iPad you can't do
any better than Apple's wireless
keyboard if portability is your top
priority Logitech ultrathin keyboard
cover is both practical and ingenious if
money isn't an object Logitech's brand
new solar keyboard folio never runs out
of battery and its medium mode is
perfect for watching movies while you're
on the go lastly if you're going to be
tossing your iPad in your backpack a lot
or it's going to be banging around a lot
in the car you can't beat the Zagg folio
for durability</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
