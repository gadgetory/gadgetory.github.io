verge and I'm standing here at the New
York Auto Show in front of the Toyota
Prius Prime now Toyota released a brand
new Prius last year but there are three
big differences between this one and
that one the first is that it's a
plug-in hybrid so instead of just using
deceleration regenerative braking to
recharge the battery you can plug this
one into a wall the eight point eight
kilowatt hour battery inside can get you
22 miles just on the battery and that's
not too great compared to a plug-in
hybrid like the Chevy Volt which can get
you about 50 but it's a step in the
right direction for Toyota you can also
go up to 84 miles an hour when you're
just running on electrical power which
is a little bit higher than you can on
most plug-in hybrids like this now the
second big difference is the appearance
Toyota's really toned this version of
the Prius down and it doesn't look quite
as aggressive as the one that we saw
last year which is nice it looks really
good
now the last big difference is the
interior Toyota's really sprucing to
prime up with the option of an 11.6 inch
touchscreen tablet a move that Tesla and
Volvo have been really doing for a
couple years now so it's nice to see the
interior get as much of a futuristic
upgrade as the overall technology of the
car
now there's an 11 point 3 gallon gas
tank inside to go along with the battery
and those two combined can get you a
range of about 600 miles which is pretty
great for a plug-in hybrid and all this
stuff is really important for Toyota
going forward they definitely offer the
best-selling hybrid that we've had for
years now but there's a lot more
competition not just from those electric
car companies like Tesla but also from
other companies that are starting to
release full lines of hybrids plug-in
hybrids and electric cars Hyundai
recently announced the ionic which is
not just one car but all three of those
so Toyota's got a little bit more ground
to make up as we go forward in this
category how well the prime is going to
sell we won't know until later this year
when it finally goes on sale but for
more news from here at the New York Auto
Show make sure you go to the Virg calm
