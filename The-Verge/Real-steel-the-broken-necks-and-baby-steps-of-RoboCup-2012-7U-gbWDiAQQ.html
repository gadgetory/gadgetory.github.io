happening for real it's very different
from the laboratory environment or you
just do point the camera and the robot
and wait until it has worked and then
you shorted it verte one time here it
has to work on time and it has to work
in a dynamic environment or other robots
are bumping into you and there's all
kinds of disturbances undefined light
things like that the competition is make
more difficult to get to see the real
problems it's not so easy to know what
the purpose of Robocop is there used to
be this original vision of winning
against the human soccer players in the
year 2050 and it's also like a big we go
to the moon project of artificial
intelligence research the problem is
that if the most competitive league is
the kids size where you're always less
than a meteor less than a half meter
tall it's not going to go anywhere very
fast right so you need to actually
upgrade to some of these larger size
leaks so we have the kids size which is
like half a meter tall now we got the
teen size league which is starting to
get more competitive and that's a meter
tall adult sized league which is just as
tall as us and that one's still a little
bit how do I walk around how do I kick
the ball without falling over if you
have also Gator 300 parameters of the
software that is put out in a text file
though you can have easy access to it
plus there is a number which which I
don't even know hard coded in a cold
let's say there's a 500 numbers we
should term in how well the robot plays
and if you miss adjust one of them it
doesn't work
we start approximately two months before
competitions and then it gets more and
more time intensive the closer we get to
listen to the first day here we didn't
do as much of the iterative design
because there's no machine shop so a lot
of the work was behind the scenes you
know before aerobic up then be here
that's basically all we do you get up in
the morning you come into the hole your
work and work and work on the robots and
evening you go back to bed I am dead
tired of course when I get home it's
just that there's so many things
spinning in my head you know the whole
program with robots is basically
lowering my brain when I sleep and
trying to still find the errors than the
bugs I'm going to sleep it's pretty
difficult challenge to get a robot to
act like a human and how to interact
with the environment of soccer ball all
the lighting conditions how they vary to
be competitive with humans we need a
much more powerful robots and the same
time much more safe robots you need to
put a good deal of research in there
before you can even think about doing
artificial intelligence you need to have
a very strong mechanical platform
the general point of the at-home
competition is to show that robots can
do something in a home environment the
board should be able to do something in
an previously unknown environment they
have to manipulate objects recognize
objects of course and it's quite a
complex problem it whines a lot of
different things
lot of the things we learn from the
soccer robots we applied in the home
robot so we started initially the circle
robots and had the communication robot
but then we carried over many of the
insights to the at home robots it's
about intelligence in machines and the
challenges is about modeling the world
and understanding the outcome of actions
of different types of actions if you can
make something that's very reliable what
you're doing is making sure that it
doesn't trip over small disturbances
when it touches a robot it doesn't fall
down when it's walking in an environment
it won't run into things right so you
don't want a robot that's in at home or
an office or a workspace there's
constantly running into a refrigerator
or a desk or something like that you
don't want something that is tripping
while it's going up the stairs because
there's you know a few papers lying
around something like that and robocup
there are so many of these problems that
we actually are addressing and putting
into larger scale humanoids it's all
about reliability it's all about
stability it's all about increasing the
size and power of your robots people ask
me about 2050 of you that's ridiculous
you see like they have these tiny robots
they can now walk pretty well but
they're really not very smart and they
have trouble seeing the ball you'll
never be able to do it I just tell them
well that's probably what people were
said in 1903 when they saw the Wright
brothers fly 300 meters in a kite
basically 50 years later and Chuck
Yeager broke the sound barrier in a jet
plane so that was an enormous
improvement over 50 years and now we
still have 38 years left in the speed of
change is
is much faster than it was about a
hundred years ago in robotics it's
always about the robots and what they
can do but I think it's also important
to look at the people who are doing the
research behind it what their goals are
what they want to get out of their
robots for a lot of people it's just
getting robots to work but for us it's
also learning about the human for
example our bio by pet approach taking a
deep look into human locomotion and how
human muscle activation works and all
these things because i think the
evolution has shown us that the system
humans are using is quite useful and
working quite well so it's very part to
me everybody here feels like they're
making a contribution towards this kind
of robot goal it is driven by the into
the Asimov its participants and if you
go through the different halls and the
different leagues and to watch the
different people the different teams
they are very dedicated their
enthusiastic I think this is one of the
most important issues that it is really
driven by thousands of enthusiasts all
over the world
I mean I think the biggest thing is that
you don't want to forget the human power
involved in this a lot of times
everybody's looking at the robots in
that robot this this there's a whole
consortium of teams and people that go
into making these robots robocop is
basically a reality check or you could
say a site where you can test these
skills that we developed and lab you
know in a more dynamic and unstructured
environment ultimately they have to work
here on the soccer field that's what
it's about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
