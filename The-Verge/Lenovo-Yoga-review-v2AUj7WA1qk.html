is the lenovo ideapad yoga 13 part of
lenovo's new lineup of Windows 8
machines on the one hand this is a
fairly normal looking laptop it weighs
3.5 pounds it's about two thirds of an
inch thick it has a mix of soft touch
and kind of leathery materials it feels
a little odd and not like a machine but
is well-built has a 13.3 inch display
and a fairly standard set of ports for a
laptop you get HDMI two USB ports and an
SD card reader so you might never know
that it does anything else other than a
normal laptop until you push the screen
back a little and find that it'll
actually rotate 360 degrees all the way
around that's why it's called yoga the
device is super flexible and you can use
it in a bunch of different positions you
can use it like a laptop obviously or
you can flip the screen all the way
around to the back and hold it like a
tablet in both hands you can also prop
it up like a teepee which is pretty good
for watching movies or use the base as a
stand and have the screen pointing
outwards the device also actually knows
which orientation it's in and shifts
accordingly so it'll make apps like
PowerPoint it'll kick them straight into
presentation mode when you put it into
stand mode which is pretty cool you'll
wind up using it like a laptop the vast
majority the time but it's nice to have
the other options when they're
appropriate the u.s. 13.3 inch display
is a pretty good one it's a 1600 x 900
IPS display and has great viewing angles
and color reproduction it's also a
touchscreen but it's not a particularly
good one it occasionally registers taps
as swipes and vice versa and sometimes
just doesn't register anything at all
it's not a huge problem and for the most
part works fine but it's definitely
there and unfortunately the yogas track
pet doesn't really help matters either
its surface is really smooth and it
works great just as a pointer but things
like two finger scrolling or edge
gestures are really hit or miss the
keyboard on the other hand is great it's
a lot like Lenovo's thinkpad keyboards
with the smile design and the concave
keys and they feel great though I don't
love the extra row of keys on the right
side which kind of throws everything off
center I went up having to set my hands
down and then shift one key to the left
and then start typing before I would
actually get it going so it has some
crazy features but performance wise this
is pretty much your average altar book
it handled all my daily tasks really
well from streaming music to dozens of
tabs to watching Netflix but it's really
not great for gaming or anything
intensive like that better life is solid
you'll get about 5 hours which is pretty
average for an ultra
that gets totally destroyed by basically
any kind of game lenovo preloads a bunch
of apps onto the yoga but it's a
different sort of Windows bloatware that
I'm used to there aren't really any
pop-ups or nagging notifications from
norton or mcafee you just get a bunch of
apps you don't really want kind of like
phone the yoga starts at nine hundred
ninety nine dollars for a model running
a core i3 processor but the model I
tested had a core i5 along with four
gigs of RAM Intel's integrated graphics
and a 128 gigabyte SSD for 100 more than
the base model it's a really solid
ultrabook with a good screen a bunch of
cool form factors and no huge flaws the
touchscreen and trackpad were
frustrating at points but neither is a
deal-breaker it's definitely still clear
that there are some bugs with drivers
and with Windows 8 in general and those
will get ironed out over time but if you
want to buy into windows 8 right now
this is a really solid way in</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
