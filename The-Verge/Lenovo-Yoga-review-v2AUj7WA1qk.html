is the Lenovo IdeaPad yoga 13 part of
Lenovo's new lineup of Windows 8
machines on the one hand this is a
fairly normal looking laptop it weighs
3.5 pounds it's about 2/3 of an inch
thick it has a mix of soft touch and
kind of leathery materials it feels a
little odd and not like a machine but is
well built has a 13.3 inch display and a
fairly standard set of ports for a
laptop you get hdmi 2 USB ports and an
SD card reader so you might never know
that it does anything else other than a
normal laptop until you push the screen
back a little and find that it'll
actually rotate 360 degrees all the way
around that's why it's called yoga the
device is super flexible and you can use
it in a bunch of different positions you
can use it like a laptop obviously or
you can flip the screen all the way
around to the back and hold it like a
tablet in both hands
you can also prop it up like a teepee
which is pretty good for watching movies
or use the base as a stand and have the
screen pointing outwards the device also
actually knows which orientation it's in
and shifts accordingly so it'll make
apps like PowerPoint it'll kick them
straight into presentation mode when you
put it into stand which is pretty cool
you'll wind up using it like a laptop
the vast majority the time but it's nice
to have the other options when they're
appropriate do your 13.3 inch display is
a pretty good one it's a 1600 by 900 IPS
display and has great viewing angles and
color reproduction it's also a touch
screen but it's not a particularly good
one
it occasionally registers taps as swipes
and vice versa and sometimes just
doesn't register anything at all it's
not a huge problem and for the most part
works fine but it's definitely there and
unfortunately the yoga's trackpad
doesn't really help matters either my
surface is really smooth and it works
great just as a pointer but things like
to finger scrolling or edge gestures are
really hit or miss on the keyboard on
the other hand is great it's a lot like
Lenovo ThinkPad keyboards with the smile
design and the concave keys and they
feel great though I don't love the extra
row of keys on the right side which kind
of throws everything off center I went
up having to set my hands down and then
shift one key to the left and then start
typing before I would actually get it
going so it has some crazy features but
performance wise this is pretty much
your average altar Brooke it handled all
my daily tasks really well from
streaming music to dozens of tabs to
watching Netflix but it's really not
great for gaming or anything intensive
like that better life is solid you'll
get about 5 hours which is pretty
average for an ultra
that gets totally destroyed by basically
any kind of game Lenovo preloads a bunch
of apps onto the yoga but it's a
different sort of Windows bloatware that
I'm used to there aren't really any
pop-ups or nagging notifications from
Norton or McAfee you just get a bunch of
apps you don't really want kind of like
a phone the yoga starts at $999 for a
model running a core i3 processor but
the model I tested had a core i5 along
with four gigs of RAM Intel integrated
graphics and a 128 gigabyte SSD for one
hundred more than the base model it's a
really solid ultrabook with a good
screen a bunch of cool form factors and
no huge flaws the touchscreen and
trackpad were frustrating at points but
neither as a deal-breaker it's
definitely still clear that there are
some bugs with drivers and with Windows
8 in general and those will get ironed
out over time but if you want to buy
into Windows 8 right now this is a
really solid way in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
