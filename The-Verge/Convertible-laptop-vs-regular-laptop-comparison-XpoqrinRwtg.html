this is also a laptop both of these run
on Windows 10 but from a hardware
perspective they're pretty different
first things first this is a Dell XPS 13
and this is the 13 inch Lenovo yoga 900
but one of the biggest differences
between this laptop and that one is that
this one is a regular laptop and this is
a convertible what does that even mean
a convertible laptop is basically one
that will fold into a tablet or other
modes these are sometimes referred to as
hybrids or two-in-ones or detachable
Ziff the keyboard comes off entirely
from the display so as you can see this
is as far back as the display will go on
this laptop whereas the Lenovo yoga has
four different modes you can use it like
a standard laptop how is that different
from what I'm doing but you can also
bend display back keyboard down like
this and watch a movie or something like
that you can also put it into tent mode
so turn it around and you can put it
into tablet mode and use it like a
tablet
one other common difference between
convertible laptops and regular laptops
is the touchscreen this Dell XPS 13 also
happens to have a touchscreen but some
regular laptops still don't like Apple
laptops on the flip side no pun intended
convertible laptops can sometimes weigh
a little bit more because of the hinges
and other components that go into making
them convertible so you're still more
likely to get something that's both
super lightweight and has super long
battery life and a regular form factor
or maybe a detachable still the idea of
getting both a laptop and a tablet for
the price of one it's probably pretty
appealing for some people so what do you
need to know about actually using a
convertible laptop personally I find
that even types switched from a regular
laptop to a convertible that I rarely if
ever used all the different modes
available with a more flexible laptop
you're so basic I'm a creature of habit
also if you're a frequent traveler
you might like a flexible laptop or when
you're crammed into an airplane seat and
you want something that can bend
backwards although keep in mind that
using a 13 inch tablet with a full
keyboard folded underneath it it's
really not as comfortable as using a
smaller thinner tablet you might have a
point there see and in some cases
hybrids or convertibles really just feel
like a gimmick or an attempt to sell
more pcs okay so convertible laptops
might not be for everybody but they do
have their benefits so if you happen to
be considering one I hope we've helped
answer your questions for you oh yeah
