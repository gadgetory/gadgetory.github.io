in New Orleans at CTIA 2012 and for a
while we've been looking for what a free
Android phone would look like on
contract with reporter we could expect a
new neck though is showing off this
Quattro phone which is a sub $200
prepaid phone and we really think this
sort of hardware is what we could expect
from a free Android phone when it
eventually comes available on contract
connector Quattro is a dual SIM Android
phone that has a 4-inch 480 by 800
resolution screen and as you can see
here the build of Android is pretty
stock this is Gingerbread and they've
made a few changes and we're told that
this is a pre-production model so they
say that they're still working on the
software a bit and they're going to add
more customization which is a little
disappointing but you can see here that
the scroll back here is not stock and
there are a few other options here
they're a bit changed
it's a capacitive screen there's a VGA
front-facing camera and a 5 megapixel
rear shooter otherwise for dual Sims
it's got a micro SIM and a full sized
sim and there's an option in the menu to
choose which SIM you want there's only
one in the phone right now but they've
added this settings menu in androids
that we can choose which SIM we'd like
to use the United Quadro is a dual SIM
phone the only runs an eighteen T 3G
which means 850 megahertz and 21 hundred
megahertz GSM the two sims are micro SIM
and full size SIM and it's designed for
you know business travelers who want to
have you know one sim for work and one
sim for at home or personal use and the
phone's going to be available the next
couple months were told but it's not
going to be available from a TNC they're
going to be selling it through Amazon
Newegg and other third-party retailers
for under $200
