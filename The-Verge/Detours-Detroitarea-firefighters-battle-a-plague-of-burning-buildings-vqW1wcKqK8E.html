I don't want to say I like seeing things
burn or I like seeing people's houses
burn but I'm a fireman my job is to put
out fires I want to be where the fires
are to be put out you're not supposed to
say it but what I like most about being
a firefighter is you know the risk and
the adrenaline with it that'll never
pass any kind of sight board if you take
it but here it seems to work
let's talk about Highland Park Michigan
27% unemployment more than 40% 40% of
the population is living below the
poverty line
we've got stats about police and fire
being cut
we've got stats about Public Safety not
being invested in good gangs be
responsible for the recent rash of
intentionally set fires in Highland Park
according to investigators and homeland
security the answer is yes and if you
have any information on who could be
responsible for these arsons please call
Highland Park Police or the fire
department because it could only be a
matter of time before someone is hurt or
killed you know they say we get fire
bugs now and then where you get a bunch
of fires like a rash of fires for a
couple days and then it'll go away
somebody's probably it's probably one
person doing it you know but I'm not an
expert so I really don't know just my
theory
I don't know why people let a lot of
houses on fire around here honestly but
I know if I lived in the city my
investment was in my home there's a
house filled with diapers next door
when I had a chance I'd burn it to the
ground
Highland Park is I believe it's don't
call me on the the number of the square
miles it's like two point eight square
miles something like that it's small
we're completely landlocked by Detroit
so all our border is all way around the
city Detroit I mean there's a lot of
history here this was on him from my
understanding was one of the richest
places in the country at one time
obviously Highland Park out back in his
heyday when Ford Motor Company over at
Manchester and Woodward you know fort
had pay our workers $5 wages and
everybody came behind the party would
want to work everybody wanted you know
you had big people from for living in
hang up our gear CEOs people on top you
know
but unfortunately riots and just the bad
stuff came in you know and then
obviously people scattered when people
scattered baking homes the drugs the
violence it's just an ongoing battle
the fire department and Highland parts a
lot different set up the most fire
departments because we run with way
fewer people than anybody else Detroit
for instance they drop 21 people on
average on a house fire and we drop six
to seven on a house fire our department
used to have 80 members and we're down
to 28 people I think our chief said
something a little while ago was like 80
85 percent arson most of my friends that
are funded in the suburbs they go to a
kitchen fire and it's a small fire they
get there put it out person's house is
fine we pull up to a holy full fully
involved house with two other houses on
fire
and we got to put it all out somehow try
to save these houses try to save the
houses next door to those houses we do a
lot of things kind of old-school ish
because yeah that's what we have is the
old scrap junk department the old
station was so old they tried fixing
things and the cities didn't have money
to put big repairs onto it
the roof was leaking really bad and it
end up getting condemned so they
scrambled around trying to find a place
to put them and this is what they ended
up with and it was supposed to be
temporary that was eight years ago my
first three months here I slept in a
tent I mean another guy that got the job
together we put tents up back there and
just put little you know mattresses on
the floor and stuff in there until we
knew that we were gonna stay here cuz we
didn't know we'd they were gonna keep us
you know because we didn't know if we
were gonna make it when I came back from
my first deployment in 2006 from Iraq I
showed up and the guys were back in this
warehouse I actually had to asked one
the cops in the area where it was I saw
the guys had little cubicle walls set up
throughout this 40,000 square feet not
given any the guys a bunch of privacy I
just come from an area where they had
very minimal structures there I decide I
want some privacy of my own so I built a
little 8 by 12 room guys started asked
me to build them rooms after that a
couple guys want a bigger room so they
started adnan doing their own thing on
the outskirts of it we need somewhere
the winner gets so cold in here you can
see your breath the only place there's
heat is usually up in the front where
the trucks are to keep them warm but
other than that if you're back here you
gotta have your heater on in your room
and same thing in the summer it gets hot
in here
a lot of our houses don't get knocked
down so we'll drive through the city
sometimes and you'll pass what I'm doing
that was a good stop remember that one
remember what happened there tell the
story everybody talks about it yeah
remember this happened that we fell in
on us or this happened or you know we
see some of the craziest fires here and
you tell people's stories and they're
like no way that didn't happen yeah it
did
don't get an opportunity to go into a
fire unless you're a fireman this is the
fire camp 1080 it attaches to the brim
of my helmet I come withstand heat from
900 degrees to 2,000 degrees so I can
take it into fires with me so I started
filming and like putting him up on
YouTube and and uh mostly just my
friends and like some of my family would
watching my mom refused to watch it for
a while she's like I don't like that
crap I missed a lot of good fires for a
couple months seemed like and we finally
got a real good one I did not think
anybody would see that video I thought
it would be just the guys here some of
my friends other people that have
watched my videos and that would be it
then I put it on YouTube and it got like
so many hits
I never thought it would get put on a
website so they got put on and then it
was on the knew that it was kind of
crazy maybe weird stories of the day how
about that it comes from a young
firefighter who wore a camera on his
helmet for an entire year you get I get
a lot of is that thing on gonna talk
about it because that does that
Ziggler's got his camera
I give Scott a lot of initially for
putting on the helmet camera now is
actually gonna tear it off his helmet
throw it into the fire sometimes we
don't like people to see some of the
stupid stuff we do
when I made the the video that got like
a million hits or whatever so many
people are watching it but got a lot of
negative activity from comments from
people in the fire service if you read
through some of the comments on my video
amazing
some of the people just say the most
ridiculous thing they don't realize what
we're dealing with here there's one as
literally as a car fires video of a car
fire I mean we just ran up took our hose
line I popped into a hood other car
within a matter of five seconds the
fires out and these people are like
because we didn't have our masks on we
didn't have this we didn't have we
didn't go by the book which I understand
there's things that can happen and I
don't know just different style of
firefighting here it's like uh we feel
like it's like an older old school you
get that here in Detroit to a lot you do
it you do it so much so when you're
doing it today and then you got another
one tomorrow or you go a week without
one maybe and then you get three or four
house fires it's more of a second nature
so you it's just different
why is there only three of you because
we don't have any help why don't you
call mutual aid well because mutual aid
around here is scarce the Detroit is
busy all the time I mean if they're
getting their butts kicked you usually
we're going in here too
some days you just run from fire to fire
to fire you end up on equipment like our
old ladder truck which wouldn't pass a
test in any other area to be used and
you're going up on this thing you don't
know if it's gonna come down you run out
of air bottles you end up having to go
down smoke hallways without a tank on I
don't know I don't know how it's not
safe it's not gonna maybe maybe that
fire took a year off my life
we get a lot of grief with the internet
stuff going to this risk versus reward
thing you know why would you put out a
vacant house but what they're not
thinking about is that just because
someone's not paying their taxes doesn't
make it vacant I think that we've found
more people living in vacant houses than
we have in houses that are supposed to
be occupied so just cuz somebody doesn't
pay taxes doesn't mean you're not
supposed to go get them out you know our
job isn't to decide financially where
anybody's at we kicked in the door in
the house one time sheet of plywood over
it with a padlock on it we blew the
padlock off went off there's five kids
laying there with who I assume with
their father the whole upstairs is on
fire and this is by all definition of
vacant house we don't we don't listen to
vacant or occupied there's none of our
business
fire we go put it out
there's no money you just do what you
got to do is kind of improvised with
with what you got kind of thing
I don't know why does that why is that
happening in an American city why are
people just kind of being cross-eyed I
feel like people say oh let's Detroit so
then you get people say well just let
the whole city burn down but the houses
burn it's not the answer you can't just
let things burn down
when they started calling up here and
asking about it I was hesitant I was
like you know I don't want to I don't
want it to seem like I don't want
anybody thinking oh you're you're trying
to like a glory hound for your fire
department it's not that at all
I want people to know how hard we work
and how hard firemen worked I just want
everybody to know this is what we're
doing to think about it when you go to
vote to pay an extra 50 cents a year or
a day it's not going to affect your life
very much but if you go against it if
the politicians go against it it might
affect someone else's it might affect
yours your house might burn down because
he didn't have an adequate response a
fireman might get killed god forbid
because they didn't have enough manpower
on scene or they didn't have the proper
tools to fight their fire
nobody here works here for the money
we all work here because we love doing
the job</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
