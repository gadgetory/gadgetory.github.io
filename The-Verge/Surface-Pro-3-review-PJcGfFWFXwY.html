a phone a laptop and a tablet the
phone's not going anywhere but can the
new surface pro 3 replace the other 2
Microsoft sure hope so this marks the
third surface Pro the company has
released and a little over a year and a
half and it's a result of a completely
relentless refinement on one single idea
to find a hybrid of a tablet and a PC so
you can use one device for both things
let me get this out of the way first the
surface pro 3 is really just gorgeous
Microsoft has stuck with magnesium for
the casing at a matte silver color
that's a little darker than Apple style
it has the classic angled lines of the
original surface and there's a thin port
for the fan across the top this is a PC
after all and PCs need to be cooled
Microsoft says that she'll never hear
the fan and rarely feel any heat both of
those statements are a little bit
optimistic but the fan is nearly silent
and the surface never got hot enough to
be uncomfortable yes it's still a tablet
but it's a very big tablet Microsoft has
increased screen size to 12 inches and
increase the resolution to a super-sharp
2160 by 1440 pixels that gives the
screen a 3x2 aspect ratio and it makes a
world of difference in using the surface
when you pop up the keyboard and
landscape there's actually enough screen
left to do stuff on and in general it
just feels more computer like than
tablet like although the screen size has
been bumped up the rest of the surface
pro 3 has been shrunk down it's thinner
and lighter than the last surface pro
and even the current 13-inch MacBook Air
you've got a single USB port in a single
display port plus a nicely redesigned
power jack that's easier to plug in and
harder to bump out there's a micro SD
card slot under the hinge and while I do
wish that Microsoft had found a way to
make that a full SD slot it does keep
the whole thing thin there's also still
pen input completing the tablet side of
this equation the pen is bigger now with
a nice round shape and a comfortable
heft it no longer attaches to the side
of the surface which is a bummer but the
bottom line is that it's super accurate
and fun to use one of the best features
is that you can just click the top of
the pen to instantly launch OneNote and
jot stuff down there are five megapixel
cameras on the front and the back
they're fine
eventually Microsoft will release a
software update to let you take a photo
and then draw right on top of it in
OneNote but otherwise if you're
depending on a device this big to take
pictures you probably need to reassess
your gadget priorities but the best
design feature of the surface pro 3 is a
new hinge the first surface only worked
at 22 degrees which made it a desk only
kind of affair the surface pro 2 gave
you a second angle but this new model
can go pretty much
angle you want all the way down to 150
degrees it uses friction to hold itself
in place and feels really sturdy maybe
someday it'll get loose and slip around
but my guess is that it won't Microsoft
really wants you to believe that you can
use the surface pro 3 on your lap and a
big part of that as a new type cover
it's 130 bucks and it's way better than
last year's model
Microsoft has cleverly added a second
magnetic strip that folds up and
attaches to the front of the surface
that adds a ton of stability and it also
elevates keyboard slightly which makes
it much more comfortable to use but my
favorite part is a new trackpad it's
much bigger and it works much better
than it did before but unfortunately
it's still not as good as what you'll
find on a real laptop in general
Microsoft solutions for helping use this
thing in your lap or better but there's
still more complicated than the dead
simple action of just lifting your
screen up on a laptop battery life is
pretty close to Microsoft's claim that
it can last all day it lasted just under
8 hours in our battery drain test and
when I was using it much more heavily I
really didn't need to plug in until mid
to late afternoon the model we tested
had a Core i5 processor and 8 gigs of
RAM and it rarely felt slow if ever
because of the high resolution Microsoft
has set a display scaling of 150% and
it's a good default for most everything
although a few apps can still look fuzzy
here and there this isn't a gaming
powerhouse by any stretch but it can
handle the basics just fine
on the software side the surface pro 3
runs Windows 8.1 pro and I still find
that it's an operating system with a
million great ideas that can sometimes
still be a little frustrating to make
sense of the split between the desktop
world and the more modern app world is
still here and it can still cause you to
spend too much time arranging things
Microsoft's app store still feels more
barren of big-name quality apps than I'd
like but it's improving fast and there's
always a huge world of traditional
Windows desktop apps to fall back on the
surface pro 3 ranges from 799 for the
bare-bones i3 model all the way up to
1949 for a top-of-the-line i7 model but
most people are going to want to pick
something somewhere in the $1300 range
no matter which model you pick make sure
you remember to kick in the extra 130
bucks for the type cover which is pretty
much a must for this device is the
surface pro 3 a laptop sort of if you
don't mind a little awkwardness here and
there is it a tablet sure but it's so
big that's not really great for
traditional tablet stuff like reading
and casual games what the surface pro 3
really is is the best hardware and
experience for Windows 8.1 whether
you'll love the surface pro 3 will
depend a lot on whether you love Windows
that's increasingly a pretty big if for
a lot of people
but Microsoft has at least put its best
foot forward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
