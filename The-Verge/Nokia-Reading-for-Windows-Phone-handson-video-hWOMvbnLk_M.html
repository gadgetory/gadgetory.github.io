and i'm here with Rhydian from Nokia and
he's going to show us the Nokia reading
application for windows phone has just
been announced so what I'm going to show
you here is not be reading on the Nokia
Lumia 900 this is part of the process of
deepening deepening the experience the
entertainment experiences to enhance
those experience as we've done with
knock your music with mixed radio and
what I'm showing you here is a reading
application which has three components
new stream which is short form internet
content my books which are long for
reading books and an integrative
bookstore so you can buy those books
direct from the app okay so and when
this initially launches new stream going
to be available right it's coming over
bringing that in in the coming months
yet again solutely we take a look at new
stream course so go into new stream and
we
come together a series of different
articles from a series of different
internet sources you can see them there
what we've got here
just really beautifully presented come
with an image click on the story you see
the image there in the headline
scroll down all presented in the same
way so it's nice and easy for you and is
this all available so this is no this is
so when you sync it it pulls pulls
together all of the stories and then
keeps those cats so you could read that
offline so when you're traveling and you
can add in any RSS feeds and you can go
no meat or you can share we've got some
settings here you can save it to another
new stream for reading later I find that
useful what I'm talking about you know
stuff I wanna talk to my colleagues
about work or you can go do it on the
web and then yep you're right you can if
you go back
click on move
you can create your own
and we'll put the series under different
different categories we've just got a
few here for the demonstrations
illustration purposes at the moment and
you can also search for your own
put all of this together save it
call it red
and then I've got my marathon my new
strength quiet
that loads up and then we can in that to
the start as well so that it comes up
and you've got that new stream available
properly there you go and you've got
that never be updated as well and the
other great thing is that you can also
pin your books the start that's a great
way of trading with a box function
straight back in there you go and and
that takes you straight to the page that
you're reading always updated with the
page that you last thread so that you've
got your head up up reading ebooks in
here these are purchasable within the
applicators are purchasable within the
application so i'll show you that in a
second but pin to start settings and
then can you change the font size yeah
you can tell you in full size and have
black and white you can go back and
white black white background tonight
night mode we're calling it honey can
change the brightness so there you know
c.t.r environment and then there's the
bookstore these ones update from a list
of books Joe's my editors so you got the
latest pet sellers you've got all the
content you'd expect to see all right it
has put lots of content together input
lists again so it's nice and convenient
you can search by genre or you can
search
for a given
ulta so there you go
another place
nice predicted surgical to make that is
possible so
that's rookie reading on the Nokia Lumia
900</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
