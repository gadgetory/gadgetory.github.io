and we're here checking
out the Lenovo Yoga A940.
(upbeat music)
Now the A stands for all-in-one
and as you might have guessed
from just looking at the device,
it's Lenovo's answer to the
Microsoft Surface Studio.
Two things that jump out at me right away
from just playing around with
this device for a few minutes,
are that it's got a
different sliding mechanism
than the Surface Studio,
so it has a place to put
your mouse and keyboard
uh, right under the monitor.
It's also got all of its components here
in this base station with
two easy to remove screws.
That way you can upgrade
things like SSD and the RAM,
which is something the Surface
Studio doesn't let you do.
So, that can be a big boon
for creative professionals
who are looking for a cheaper alternative.
Like the Surface Studio,
the A940 is designed
for people who do a lot of photo editing,
a lot of illustration, that kind of work.
People who would need to
kind of, take this monitor,
pull it down, and get like,
up and close and personal
with the images that they're working on.
So, with that you get a stylus,
which sits over here in the
wireless charging stand.
And uh, you also get this
nifty little knob on the side,
similar to the Surface Style
in that you can customize what it does.
You can tap in for uh, Settings.
And the Settings are app specific,
they change depending on
whether you press the button,
whether you're rotating the first dial,
or whether you're
rotating the second dial.
You can change those for Photoshop,
for, you can customize
them for Illustrator,
for Lightroom, whatever you want.
So with this dial, you can also,
if you don't like it being on the left,
you can just pull it out,
and switch it to the other side.
Uh, each of the two
USB-A ports on each side,
have magnetic covers
and then you can just take them out
and stick them to the back of the machine,
if you don't like.
So Lenovo is also bundling a stylus here,
it's just a standard, standard stylus
using Wacom technology.
It's got 4,096 points of pressure.
You also got two buttons on the side here,
for customizable settings depending on
what apps you're using.
(upbeat music)
So the most important
component of the A940
is obviously the display,
so it's a 27 inch,
touchscreen, 4K display.
What makes it different
than the Surface Studio,
is obviously how you're gonna be using it.
So, you have an area to put
your keyboard right here,
and then you have an
area to put your mouse.
And then you just pull this down
now that your desk in front
of you is uncluttered.
And from there, you can just get to work
right on the screen.
So this light isn't quite as high quality
as the Surface Studio,
which is more than $1000 more expensive.
But it is still a 27 inch, 4K display.
It looks great, it's very responsive.
You use it really easily
without a keyboard.
It's, the whole point is that you would
basically pull this down, keep
the keyboard out of the way,
and do all your work
right here on the display,
up close and personal with every image.
So powering the A940
is a Intel HN Core i7.
Um, you get AMD Radeon RX 560 graphics.
Uh, that can't be upgraded.
But you can upgrade the
memory and the storage,
so you uh, it starts
with 8 gigabytes of RAM.
And 128 gigabytes of storage
on the solid-state drive.
The RAM goes up to 32 gigabytes,
and the solid-state
drive can go up to 512.
You also get a separate hard drive,
that's just one terabyte or two terabytes.
So there are two display configurations.
You can get the 27 inch UHD
model with the IPS touchscreen.
You can also get the QHD model,
which is a lower resolution.
Uh, that also has the IPS touchscreen.
So the big differentiating factor here
with the A940 is obviously the price.
It's more than $1000 cheaper
than the Surface Studio 2.
It starts at $2,349,
that includes the dial,
the keyboard, the mouse, the stylus,
and the inductive charger,
all-in-one package.
The device is slated
to ship in March 2019.
And considering it's $1000 cheaper
than the Surface Studio 2,
the A940 could really give Microsoft's
all-in-one desktop, a run for its money.
