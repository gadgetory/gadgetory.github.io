to change the iMac it's already thin and
light though none of that really matters
for a desktop it's good-looking it's
powerful its high resolution it's not
even terribly expensive for what it is
so how do you change the iMac this year
Apple picked one thing one crazy
high-resolution thing this is the Apple
iMac with retina display the screen
really is the whole story here and with
good reason
it's a 27 inch display 5000 120 pixels
wide by two thousand eight hundred and
eighty pixels tall that if you're
counting is 14 point seven million
pixels and they all look amazing blacks
are deep White's or bright viewing
angles are outrageous colors pop off the
laminated display this is flat-out as
good a display as you will see on any
computer anywhere having a resolution
that high means a few things one is that
you get just an incredible amount of
space on this screen you can play a 720p
video at native resolution open a
half-dozen Safari windows side by side
and have plenty of room left for Spotify
and your calendar and your email it's
kind of like being in OS 10 expose view
all the time except you can use
everything by default the retina iMac
runs at 2560 by 1440 turning pixels into
an apple calls points points are
basically a stand-in for physical
distance which means everything on this
screen is the same size as on a lower
res Mac but it looks better because
where you used to have one pixel now you
have four that's why at native 51 twenty
by twenty eight eighty resolution
everything is hilariously small on this
iMac if you're using 4k video or a
high-res photo the iMac is content-aware
enough to render that part pixel for
pixel while still doubling everything
else basically this is all a complicated
way of saying that when you have the
content to suit a 5k display the iMac
shows it accurately and usually with
space to spare otherwise it tries to
find the middle ground to make
everything a little more usable that
content thing is the sticky point of the
retina iMac yeah it has a 5k display and
yeah that makes most things look amazing
text is the big one I can't get over how
much I like reading on this thing games
to at least the ones that play at 28 80
by 1440 look great BioShock Infinite
looks incredible in this screen 4k
videos look amazing and play perfectly
and I love editing high-res photos on
here but when you have pictures and
especially video that isn't this
high-res
can look really bad Netflix doesn't
stream in 4k on the iMac and even its
highest possible resolution is fuzzy and
soft same with Hulu same with most of
YouTube and just about anything else you
want to watch basically just don't try
to watch anything that isn't 4k
fullscreen at least not while you're
sitting just a few feet away from the
iMac of course this happens every time
Apple puts out a Retina screen that's
more impressive than the last one it'll
take the web and developers a little
while to catch up and play at this
higher resolution but I think they will
you just might want to wait to pull the
trigger on an iMac upgrade until then
the other thing that usually happens
when Apple bumps up its resolution is
that the first model is slow it takes a
lot of processing to power a lot of
pixels on my review unit at least that's
not a problem but I've been using the
top-tier model
it's crazy fast consistent and powerful
no matter what you're doing it even
handles Adobe Premiere playback and
editing the things our video team work
with every day faster than just about
any other machine it's also of course
four thousand $399 for a certain kind of
person that's a deal
it's certainly cheaper than a Mac Pro on
a 4k display but for most people that's
kind of the definition of overkill
the thing is though I get the sense that
the iMac with retina display needs just
about all of that power to really sing
even with specs like I have videos will
occasionally still stutter when I open a
new Safari tab and games will flicker or
tear as I play particularly complicated
scenes performance on the iMac is
fantastic having this much solid-state
storage in particular is great but I
don't know how much room there is to
spare here tread carefully at the bottom
models for $2,499 you get a 3.5
gigahertz Intel Core i5 processor 8 gigs
of ram and a one terabyte fusion drive
which is port solid drive part spinning
drive that's a lot of hardware but it
might not be enough if you're going to
really put this thing to the test if you
just want Safari and Chrome and iPhoto
and Spotify though by a way this is the
best screen ever for using those things
it all runs underneath OS 10 Yosemite
the newest version of Apple's software
and one specifically built for a screen
like this there's lots that's new about
Yosemite but nothing specific to the
iMac the things like handoff and
continuity might actually make a desktop
more usable since it's so easy to take
your work with you now the insides are
all new but the shell of the iMac is
still the same it's the same thin silver
aluminum shell that bulges slightly in
the back and hides all its ports and
looks good absolutely anywhere you put
it there's a Thunderbolt 2 port for USB
3 slots and SD
slot a headphone jack in an Ethernet
port their good sounding stereo speakers
firing out at the bottom but I'd still
connect something external it's it's
even on the same stand as ever the
hardware just hasn't changed here and it
didn't really need to for some people
for some uses the iMac with retina
display is virtually perfect I love
editing photos in this computer and I
love just reading and browsing the web
on it this is a computer I want to use
but it's expensive and it's really
expensive if you want to take full
advantage if you want a machine that is
as powerful as it is pretty but make no
mistake retina is the future of the iMac
and that is great news</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
