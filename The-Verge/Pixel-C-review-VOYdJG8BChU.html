seems like everybody's trying to do
something new with tablets this year and
Google's getting in on the act too
they're actually making their own tablet
for the first time and it's this
good-looking little guy the pixels see
so how is this Android tablet different
from all the other new tablets out there
well first off its made by Google's
pixel team which means it looks like a
Chromebook pixel it has great design
thick aluminum straight edges and a
sense of monolithic ruggedness you can
even tap on the top to check your
battery life it is a little thick about
a quarter of an inch but I don't really
mind that though because I'm on team
battery and so far I haven't had any
problem using the pixel C all day long
but really what sets is $499 Android
tablet of heart is that you can get this
$149 Android keyboard to go with it it's
actually really impressive feat of
Engineering
once you figure out how it all fits
together the keyboard is bluetooth but I
connect up to a tablet with a really
strong magnet and an even stronger hinge
so you have a full 90 degrees of angles
to use it at when you close it all up
the tablet wirelessly charges a keyboard
so you never even have to plug the thing
in and this is one of the better
Bluetooth keyboards I've ever used
Google actually eliminated a few of the
keys on the left and right edge which
means that the ones remaining can be a
little bit bigger it's not quite a full
sized keyboard but the keys that you
actually type on are big enough and deep
enough to let you jam along at speed so
those are the tricks and the specs are
pretty good too it has a high resolution
10.2 inch screen and to really loud
speakers it's got three gigs of RAM and
a fairly speedy and Vidia processor
there's even an array of four
microphones up top so you can bark okay
Google from across the room and have it
respond to your commands so Google's
hardware team is clearly ready for the
future of tablet computing but Google's
Android and developer teams they just
can't keep up the pixel C runs Android
6.0 marshmallow and Android needs some
serious help when it comes to being
productive on tablets there's no way to
do split-screen with any app and now
that Windows iOS and even Samsung are
doing it it seems like a really stupid
thing to be missing that's even weirder
because the pixel has an aspect ratio of
the square root of 2 on the screen which
is theoretically perfect for cutting it
in half and
painting that same ratio and I could
even forgive all that if it weren't for
the fact that there are little delays
when I tap the screen to jump between
apps and sometimes even within apps if
you have to go one app at a time it
needs to be really fast switching
between them and it's just not it seems
like there's just more optimization work
to be done here even this fancy keyboard
sometimes has issues communicating with
Android sometimes I get missed or even
repeating key presses it doesn't get
better inside most apps because very few
of them take advantage of the tablet
size even some of Google's own apps feel
like just wide expanses of wasted space
heck even Google Docs seems to think
that I'm on a phone it has this new
research feature but it slits a screen
vertically instead of horizontally I
could look past all of that if I knew
that apps from third-party developers
were optimized with tablets but
basically none of them are in fact a lot
of them including really popular stuff
like slack Instagram and Twitter they
throw up screens that kick you into
portrait mode even when the keyboard is
attached in landscape it's infuriating
at the end of the day I just don't know
what the pixel see is trying to be maybe
it's a development platform for Google
employees whatever it is it's certainly
not something that most people should
buy at six hundred and fifty bucks for
the whole package you can find way way
better value by going with another
tablet so the pixel team may have done a
pretty good job here of rethinking what
an Android tablet could be but until the
rest of Google puts more thought into
making Android better on tablets just
engineering great hardware isn't enough</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
