ouya or vo yeah whatever you call it
it's an Android based gaming console
that a lot of people have been waiting
for
back in July the company behind the
device raised more than eight point five
million dollars from more than 60,000
Kickstarter backers all of whom backed a
super simple cheap hackable Android
gaming console the Ouya device itself is
a black and silver cube just under three
inches on every side Ouya makes a big
deal about how it is designed by yves
behar but it's really not that
interesting and design there's a glowing
power button on the top and a handful of
ports at the back but it mostly just
looks like a futuristic Chinese food
container it's fine looking and since
it's so small it fits neatly into nooks
and crannies of your home theater setup
but it's not particularly remarkable
same goes for the device's controller a
slightly plasticky black and silver
device that fits somewhere between a
nice Xbox 360 controller and one of
those cheap Universal controllers you'd
buy for $20 at Best Buy it's a Bluetooth
controller connects pretty easily and
has plenty of buttons to analog 6 lots
of triggers and bumpers and the standard
diamond of color buttons that in this
case spell booyah instead of a B X&amp;amp;Y the
analog sticks feel great but the
triggers are pretty mushy all in all
it's just an average controller it's one
really cool feature is the trackpad in
the middle kind of like the PlayStation
4 switch you need at various points to
Mouse around between menus and text
boxes most games ignore it and I did
occasionally hit it by accident and end
up with a random mouse cursor in the
middle of the screen but it also came in
handy a bunch of different times it
comes in handy mostly because E is
software is kind of a mess it runs
Android 4.1 inside the Chinese food
container box is basically a smartphone
with a Tegra 3 processor and a gig of
ram plus his own TV friendly interface
on top of it the interface looks nice
it's really simple and definitely easy
to use but it's really slow and kind of
clumsy in places it's also only about
half implemented so you often end up in
an Android settings menu or a dialog box
or switching between the Ouya and
Android interfaces and that's really
when you need the cursor who use
interface is definitely on the right
track here but it's not nearly finished
it's like they designed a home screen
and kind of left it at that actually
that's kind of the whole story of Ouya
right now the company makes a big deal
out of being open and hackable and
that's definitely true with a lot of
effort we were able to sideload almost
any app on the Ouya play with roms even
get Netflix working but it took a lot of
effort and that's way beyond what most
normal people are going to do right now
plus the games and apps that exist for
the US tour right now see more like
proof that this thing can play games
than actually making it a viable gaming
platform people should buy there are
about a hundred games available but
they're mostly simple mostly kind of
retro and mostly pretty boring after
about five minutes this device can run
great games though we managed to get a
version of Shadowgun running on the
device and even though we could only
play it on hard for some reason it
worked great and it's one of androids
most intense games but getting anything
other than the US tour running is not
for the faint of heart and even for
developers there's some work to do to
get their games running on the platform
for one thing every game on eeeyah has
to be free to download that's cool on
one hand since you can try any game
before buying it but it also means
you're constantly being up sold and
cajoled into buying full versions which
is maybe worse than just paying upfront
basically the Ouya is still just a
developer device this $99 box has lots
of potential and is certainly capable of
doing some great things but unless you
feel like spending hours of your time
and dealing with some really shady
legality when it comes to roms or side
loading apps there's really not that
much to do with it yet the company is
planning to improve it constantly and
it's gonna need to work fast if I were
one of the 60,000 people who already
spent $100 and are receiving a device
now I'd be pretty mad the controller
needs some refining the store needs a
lot more games and hua desperately needs
developers of all kinds to buy into the
platform I don't know if or when any of
those are going to happen but don't buy
this until they do</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
