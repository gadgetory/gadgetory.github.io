reporting from CES in Las Vegas and I'm
here with James Park he's the co-founder
and CEO of Fitbit hey James thanks so
much for being here with me early on a
Friday morning kind of a lot I think
we're the last day here towards the
tail-end for sure yeah some people are
pretty tired I really appreciate you
being here this morning let's get right
into it the most serious question I have
to ask you about this week is how many
steps have you taken it's interesting
because I was actually doing a step
challenge with Gary Shapiro who runs the
CTA and I think this week I've been
averaging between 20 and 25 thousand
steps a day so yesterday 125 thousand
how many miles is that you know 2500
steps so yeah 10 10 miles a day that's
really impressive but in in all
seriousness you did have a pretty big
week here at C at CES you introduced a
new smart Fitness watch called the blaze
you're wearing it yeah wearing it yeah
we we announced this Tuesday Tuesday
morning so this is the Fitbit blaze so
I'll take it off at this point so it's
it's what we call a smart fitness watch
it's really focused on Fitness first it
has the right set of smart features such
as caller ID text notifications calendar
reminders music control etc the right
set that don't really overwhelm users
because I think the common knock against
general-purpose smart watches today is
that they're very overwhelming they do
too much etc cuts in their battery life
the device is actually modular so you
can actually transform the entire look
of the device so we have different
frames different frame styles colors etc
that will be launching personally I mean
it you know we've talked about this
eyewear and try a lot of wearables and I
thought and I thought it doesn't support
third-party applications it has much
longer battery life you know so I didn't
see it in the same category as Apple
watch but what what is your response to
that when people say that's that's where
you're going with this I think that's a
very logical superficial observation but
I think there's been a lot of trade-offs
for the product and
you know balances that we've made to
really cater towards our core audience
which again is that active user who
wants a little bit more smart capability
and it's not a general-purpose device I
mean obviously as you said there's no
third party apps but the trade-off there
is we get you know five days battery
life which is what our active users
really like because look they want to
wear a device 24/7 including when
they're sleeping and this device really
allows them to do that did you consider
making something that would support
third party applications
you know the hardware on the blaze
actually is pretty capable so I think
for us is we do expect blaze to get
smarter features over time but we still
want to be a little bit selective
because not just from a power
perspective but I think people
appreciate the simplicity and ease of
use of the blaze and our other products
and we don't want the device to be too
overwhelming that makes sense but it's
possible in the future you're saying the
hardware the hardware spec technically
it can do it yes interesting ok so let's
talk about heartrate because also on the
heels of you introducing this watch if
it was hit with a class-action lawsuit
from some consumers that were
complaining that the heart great
accuracy of some of your other devices
wasn't as accurate as maybe they'd hoped
or they feel the company had said what's
your response to that you know my
response is we have a pretty extensive
Rd effort around our pure pulse heart
rate technology we've done a lot of
internal studies around testing and
validation so we really stand by our
pure pulse technology and you know for
the lawsuit you know we don't really
feel that it has any merit you know for
us look it's a huge advancement in
convenience for people I mean before
really if you wanted to get continuous
heartrate the only way you could do it
is you know wearing an uncle chest strap
exactly so look this is the logical
progression of technology you have to
start at some point and then the
technology always improves over time but
in general right now look we stand by
our technology
we're gonna vigorously defend the
lawsuit we don't feel that it has any
merit and there's gonna be continued Rd
so but you do feel there's room for
improvement or advancement in a software
um look it's with any technology I think
if you look the original iPhone and the
camera on it I mean it was okay but it
wasn't fantastic and look at the
progress that all the smartphone makers
have made in the camera module to the
point where a lot of people you don't
you know don't even think you need the
SLRs anymore so for us pure pulse was a
technology that we launched last year
and look there's a lot of things that
pipeline R&amp;amp;D wise for us that we're
really excited about interesting James
they've one more question for you what
is the weirdest or most bizarre thing
you've seen here at CES so far this week
I'm asking everybody this it's really
fun I think for me it's it's actually
kind of useful but maybe not practical
and it's also very weird it's the I
think it was called the laundry
it was the laundry folding robot there
actually is a laundry folding yes I'm
here yes and I've seen that I'm on
YouTube before it was a huge cabinet and
you'd put all your your laundry in this
in the big shelf at the bottom and I
think after like some period of time it
just opens up and all your laundry's
folded how does that happen it's
mysterious it happens in the cabinet
that they're faking it until they make
it and then they have this this
television running the I think the
benefits of you know how many hours in
your lifetime do you fold laundry and
you know how many days will you recover
I was like oh that's a pretty
interesting proposition so but I think
they got the company laundry oh right
yeah right laundry James Park wants your
product so you should send him a loaner
if you can thank you so much for taking
