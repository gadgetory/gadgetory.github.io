anybody wants to talk about is big games
but this is one of the coolest things
for little games this is the razor
jungle Kappa it's a game controller for
iOS and those have been kind of much
talked about but haven't really caught
on that much but this actually seems to
be one of the best ones for sorters it's
not huge it's it's about the size you
know twice the size of the iPhone you
can see you've got it's it's basically
like having a really giant battery case
on your iPhone but instead it slides out
of the bottom and you get the d-pad and
the buttons and everything's a little
shallow and not you know the greatest
controller you've ever used but it seems
to work fine and it maps to a lot of
different games razer has a bunch here
that it works on but there's also a huge
store and Apple has certified a lot of
these games to work with any controller
including this one and so you'd be
meanie they got access to all kinds of
four controllers and you can map the
different controls you can map the
sensitivity to however you want and it's
pretty full-featured actually like a
bunch of games that I didn't necessarily
expect would work seem to work nothing
actually changes on the screen so if you
have other controls that exist on the
screen they don't exactly go away and
things where you need to move the screen
and all that don't really change but
when you have a game like limbo for
instance where you're just on the screen
and you move with touch or tilting
having a screen and controls like this
tents work really well so this I'm still
not totally convinced is the right idea
even an iOS game controller like this
but razors really good at making gaming
peripherals and this is about as good as
any game controller I've seen yet so of
course the first thing we asked is why a
d-pad and not analog sticks and it turns
out the answer is basically for space
they wanted to keep this small to keep
it as something that you don't ever have
to take off you can access the power and
the headphone jack right with the case
on and that's not true of most cases but
they had to make some sacrifices and the
analog stick was definitely one of those
I'd rather have it but the d-pad seems
to work alright it's the Razer jungle
cat it's $99 it's going to be available
in July and if you play asphalt 8 it's
kind of a cool accessory to have with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
