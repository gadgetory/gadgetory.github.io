we're taking a look at the Microsoft
Surface the much anticipated
long-awaited first ever tablet designed
and built by Microsoft the device is a
black rectangle the edges are tapered
back a bit so it's got kind of an
angular profile the device itself is
made out of a material that Microsoft
calls vapor mag or vapor mg though it
feels like thin aluminum in your hands
that's not a knock it actually feels
quite nice around the back of the device
you can see it has a metal kickstand
it's actually made the same material as
the rest of the casing and it flips out
with a reassuring click I like the
kickstand idea on paper though in
practice it really only has one function
which is to set the surface down on a
table you can't really put it on your
lap and you also can't adjust the
positioning of the kickstand the device
has two cameras there's one on the back
and one on the front
they're both 720p and they both kind of
don't look that great on the top of the
device there's a power and sleep button
on the left side there's a volume rocker
and a headphone jack on the right side
there's actually a USB port and a micro
HDMI jack the device has two microphones
and it's got a set of stereo speakers
that are located along the top of the
tablet which sound pretty good though I
did notice them distorting on a few
things that I played back on the bottom
of the device there's a magnetic dock
connector which is used at this point
only for the type and touch cover the
surface feels really well made when
you're holding it I mean I would say
that the construction of the device is
on par with the iPad it feels a little
bit thicker and it's definitely a little
bit heavier and due to the 16:9 display
it's a little bit awkward when you're
holding it in landscape and it's really
awkward when you're holding it in
portrait it kind of wants to be on a
desk the surface has two unique
accessories that do double duty as
keyboards and protective covers one is
called the type cover and one is called
the touch cover the type cover is
actually a dedicated tactile keyboard it
snaps on to that magnetized dock on the
bottom and covers the front of the
device with kind of a gray felt you can
flip it around to the back though it is
a little odd holding
to a tablet and feeling an actual
keyboard behind it the touch cover takes
a slightly different approach instead of
having real keys with travel it has
raised characters on the material that
the protective cover is made out of it
does work fairly well though it's
definitely not as easy as using the type
cover or a dedicated keyboard though I
will say I'm impressed by how well the
trackpad and multi-touch response works
on both the type cover and the touch
cover of course the big story with the
surface isn't the hardware even though
that is a pretty big story the real
focus here is the fact that this is a
Windows RT device Windows RT is of
course a variation of Windows 8 which is
made for armed chipsets and it has some
peculiar idiosyncrasies for starters you
have a desktop Windows environment that
looks a lot like Windows 7 but there are
only five apps you can actually use in
this environment and that's Word
PowerPoint Excel OneNote and a desktop
version of Internet Explorer there are a
couple of other small windows apps like
paint and notepad but they're really
more of system utilities and a dedicated
application luckily you don't really see
the desktop environment that much you
really are going to be spending the vast
majority of your time in the new modern
UI environment the good news about the
modern UI is that it's actually a really
interesting new operating system that
has a lot of potential in my opinion
from the get-go the tile interface seems
really inventive and useful right when
you first log into the machine you get a
bunch of live tiles that are giving you
information like your next calendar
appointment or your latest email and
it's actually something that I found
myself looking at and using day-to-day
while I was testing the surface there
are a bunch of gestures that are used to
get around this environment and they're
not immediately obvious there's
basically four main ones that's a swipe
from the right to bring up the charms
bar a swipe from the left to multitask
or to flip through the apps that you
have open a swipe up or down from the
top or bottom of the device which brings
up a contextual menu for different areas
of whatever app you happen to be in
and finally there's kind of a dunking
motion which is when you swipe from the
top to the bottom
and sort of pull the app that you're in
I guess into the garbage you throw it
away it's how you quit an app
one of the standout apps in the modern
UI environment is the browser it did a
great job of rendering pretty much any
page that I went to for some reason
Microsoft decided to equip the arm
devices with flash and the pre-installed
plug-in doesn't do that great of a job
at playing back flash video
html5 video definitely fared better and
I was able to get some decent framerate
fullscreen video playing within the
browser while performance does seem good
for most of the applications there are
places where it seemed to suffer a few
of the games I tried had sluggish
behavior and some of the third-party
apps and even some of the first party
apps took a while to load they were
often very slow to get going
though once they did they were usually
smooth enough speaking of third-party
apps the Windows Store is not heavily
populated right now
Microsoft says that there are more apps
on the way and I suspect there going to
be some bigger name apps appearing in
the store after the launch of the
surface but during my testing I found
the selection quite lacking the surface
is available in three different
varieties you can get a 32 gig version
for $4.99 you can get a 32 gig with an
included touch cover for $5.99 or you
can get a 64 gigabyte version with a
touch cover for $6.99 otherwise you're
going to pay 120 bucks for the touch
cover and 130 bucks for the type cover
while reviewing the surface I spent a
lot of time thinking about who this
device was for Microsoft has been
touting the surface is kind of a
do-everything device it's a laptop when
you need to get real work done and it's
a tablet when you want to have more
casual Leanback experiences the problem
is that as a tablet I don't think the
surface is as good as its nearest
competition in terms of the ecosystem
the app selection it's just not there
and frankly this form factor is just a
bit awkward and so things like reading
in bed seem kind of out of the question
with the surface on the flipside as a
laptop there are some things that the
surface is really lacking the big one is
obviously legacy support for Windows
software if you're a current window
user it would be a very jarring
experience to move to this device
additionally the form factor gets in the
way of this thing really making sense
you can't put it on your lap so in a
similar way that the form factor makes
it awkward as a tablet it also makes it
awkward as a laptop ultimately
Microsoft's promise that Windows 8 would
be a no compromise operating system
isn't realized in the surface the
service actually requires quite a lot of
compromise some users will be able to
make those compromises and will love
using it but for a lot of users out
there it may be asking too much</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
