face is the avocado live headset
it's literally blasting 720p HD video
directly into my retinas
and you know what it's pretty ridiculous
looking and to tell the truth it's kind
of uncomfortable and you know what else
is pretty awesome the glove is a headset
that we've seen knocking around the
Kickstarter world for a little while now
and now it's finally available for the
not at all low price of six hundred
ninety nine dollars the basic idea is
simple take what looks like an oversized
pair of Beats headphones and then embed
a screen in the headband flip the sucker
down over your eyes and bam you've got
instant personal cinema but you should
know what the clip is not before you
understand what it actually is it is not
a VR headset sure it can do some head
tracking but that's not really what it's
for also it's not really as 100 percent
immersive as an actual VR headset you
could look above and below it so you can
grab a drink if there's someone sitting
on the table in front of you but the
glyph is really for is putting a giant
screen right in front of your eyes it
feels about the equivalent of a 50 or 60
inch TV in a standard living room you
can use it to watch anything that you
can plug into it via a standard HDMI
cable I've used it to watch TV movies
YouTube on my iPhone buy an adapter and
to play a hell of a lot of Far Cry
primal on my xbox one abakan says that
the battery lasts about four hours and
that's almost precisely what I got time
it again in my testing you could also
just use it plugged in all the time it
uses micro USB to charge I really feel
like the perfect place to use a glyph is
on a plane you could watch movies or
even use your laptop and nobody can see
what you're looking at and since you're
already on a plane you don't have to
worry quite so much about looking like a
weirdo the glyph works by shining a
light on a couple million micro mirrors
which then reflect the image directly
into your sockets through two tiny
adjustable lenses and honestly you're
going to be doing a lot of adjustment
with this thing when you get started
there's seven or eight little fiddly
knobs or switches that you need to move
around
the image to look just right and to make
the glyph feel comfortable on your head
there's swappable nose bridges rotating
eyepieces to match your vision on each
eye and there's even an optional
headband if it weighs too much you can
also adjust the brightness but there's
only three settings and even the lowest
setting is way too bright I have this
giant rectangular square after image in
my vision after I take the headset off
all that adjustment is a lot of work and
if you get it right it's actually
amazing but 15 minutes later it may have
fallen down your face a little bit or
you may find it's too heavy or you may
find that you have this giant bruise
looking thing on your nose from wearing
it for too long
here's the thing though once you get all
those adjustments dialed in you'll see
something very cool a crisp bright HD
video or video game it doesn't feel low
res or jagged like most of the stuff
that you see and like Google cardboard
or a gear VR it just looks like HD TV
right on your face with actually really
good audio pumping into your ears is it
all worth 700 bucks almost surely not
but if the next version weighs half as
much and cost half as much well color me
interested no matter how crazy it looks</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
