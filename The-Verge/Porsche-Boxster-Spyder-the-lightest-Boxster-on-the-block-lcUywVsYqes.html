in front of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
which is the latest version of the
company's long-running series of
relatively low-cost convertibles
relatively speaking this this particular
model is special because it's stripped
is like all the options are gone if you
buy it stock there's no radio there's no
air-conditioning and the top opens
manually it's a cloth top with a vinyl
rear window very very old-school it's
designed to evoke old-school spiders
which are traditionally over the roof
cars but that doesn't mean cheap it's
it's 82 over 82 thousand dollars to
start and
fortunately if you want to add in things
like air conditioning or radio you can
do so at no cost so it's not that this
is a cheap box for by any stretch of the
imagination
it's just lightweight everything has
been taken out Boxster has a 375
horsepower inline six which is a little
up rated from other boxers in the range
even the relatively high-end Boxster GTS
so this car really is all about
performance and that goes hand-in-hand
with the fact that it's super
lightweight it has a manual transmission
you can't get any other kind of
transmission which is increasingly rare
and it doesn't come with a radio or a
navigation system or air conditioning
it's all about saving weight so
hopefully we'll be able to get this
thing on the road in the next few months
but then again maybe not it's very
limited edition so we'll see</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
