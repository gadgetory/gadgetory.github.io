Pierce and this week we're talking about
Google so Google's biggest announcement
is coming up through Motorola in the
Moto X later this week but a lot
happened last week two from motorola and
verizon and google itself so before we
get too far in let's take a look back at
what happened last week we figured this
week was going to be the big one for
google it's getting ready to launch the
Moto X which appears to be the first
motorola phone made with lots of
Google's input but last week may have
been even more significant it started on
Tuesday an event where no one really
even talked about google it was motorola
and verizon launching three new droids
the droid ultra of Max and Minnie are
relatively normal droids but they came
with some hints of what Google's up to
and what's coming the new droids are
always listening to you always ready for
your commands just say ok Google now to
wake up your phone and ask it a question
they have always on displays to showing
you notifications or the time without
you ever needing its power button the
horribly named droid zap definitely
won't be a standard Android feature at
least not with that name but it's a neat
way to share photos of people around you
the three phones each have a reason for
existence one has long battery life one
is super thin one is just the right size
could Google and Motorola be working to
make the Moto X all three in one phone
we'll find out soon enough one thing we
know for sure is that whatever comes
next will run Android 4.3 google
announced the new version of its OS
still called jelly bean at an event on
wednesday android 4.3 comes with a few
new under the hood features but also
shows what the Android team is clearly
focused on games and tablets there are
more multiplayer games more ways to
track your achievements and scores lots
of new tablet apps in their own section
of the Play Store and a new tablet to
play the model the Nexus 7 was Google's
first great hardware play a year ago and
it announced a new 229 dollar version
this year as well but that wasn't even
lose most interesting hardware that
designation goes to the chromecast a
little dongle that sticks into the side
of your TV and brings YouTube Netflix in
your browser from almost any device to
your television it's like airplay except
it's $35 to buy and the details are
still really fuzzy it's actually maybe
more like the Nexus Q except it's
hopefully not terrible so a few things
are clearer Google is clearly focusing
on games it's focusing on tablets and
its really really focusing on your TV
and it's not google plus that's the
spine of everything
it's chrome chrome unites all your
devices and Google is hoping to unite
even more chromecast but there's still a
lot left for Google to do and a lot left
for us to find out like whether or not
chromecast is any good or why on earth
the droid ultra and Droid Maxx both need
to exist and are there even any
surprises left for the Moto X will find
out okay so big week lots to talk about
so here to talk about all of it and more
with me nilay patel managing editor of
the verge and some call him the david
duchovny of Technology I want to believe
that's fine we're just gonna risky keep
right on going ah let's talk about
motorola let's start with them so they
were like they preempted all this google
stuff at like you were there with me
it's like let's do some deep section
alisis of this event is the weirdest
event ever truly it was more like a like
a wedding or a Bar Mitzvah than a film
launch it kind of was there's like round
tables the guy got up there like six
minutes he was like cell phones and that
was that uh I don't know I honestly
cannot tell you why some of these new
droids exist when the Moto X is coming
out yeah because some of the the
overlaps are enormous I think the droid
maxx i understand why that exists that's
like two full days of battery life yeah
like your mark and there are some
serious compromises to get there right i
mean it's a very mid-range phone right
it has a dual core processor has a 720p
display but two days battery life so get
it and that the max would i think was a
very popular product for motorola and
verizon um but the droid mini i don't i
don't know the droid ultra phone I feel
like everyone somebody wants that phone
but nobody wants that but that put them
the new Moto X especially the same size
so like I don't there's a lot of like
how are you gonna sell these phones how
they're gonna be different and and
they've even like shifted the droid
brand right because it used to be like d
android brand and now Dave Dave so used
to be defined in flagship verizon and to
their credit it worked right i mean it
was until Samsung decided to throw money
at galaxy marketing that that was the
Andhra all over the place literally all
of them I mean they're they're one of
the biggest advertising / sensors on the
base advertised in the world not you
know one brand in one carrier in one
country can't compete with that global
scale so like it makes sense but I think
it's interesting to verizon motorola
have refocused it not to compete with
the
four knots right with one in some ways
not even compete with the iphone 5 even
the specs are kind of the same but to be
much more mid-range right even the price
points are the same for the same time it
has some of the I don't I feel like some
of the coolest Android features i saw
this week we're not from google they
were at this event so i don't know if
that's motorola or if it's verizon that
can't be Verizon Verizon can't put
decent software there's not I will you
know but at this it's like this
relationship between motorola and google
increasingly confused they don't talk to
each other I mean I've talked to people
at Google I'm like do you know what's
going on motorola I don't know anybody
look I know you literally just they
don't know each other so what happening
so as motorola advancing android with
you know there's the droid zap which is
the worst named thing ever but there's
also know your foe that sits there and
we'll show you notifications interrupts
turn it on yeah and you can talk to it
and say okay Google now right I mean
that stuff is cool where's that coming
from I think that's coming from Motorola
I think that's them trying to
desperately trying to find ways to
differentiate their friends from Samsung
and HTC and LG and sony and whoever else
and it's funny because what they've bet
on is what we've been asking phone
manufacturers to bet on which is leave
android alone like add in where it makes
sense and build great hardware and now i
don't know if Motorola's real great
hardware the more i think about these
phones the more particularly the ultra
at the glossy back it's yeah it's pretty
it's pretty boring the oat the max god
these things are terrible the max is a
thing altra the fact that the max is
better than the ultra he has no sense to
me no no um and the here's the best
phone and the mini exists and like they
all have the same spec so if they're all
720p they're all dual-core processors
motorola made this big deal out of how
they have a new 8x computing platform
and then just like told some wise and
there's no there's really no getting
around it they just like told some lies
about it um I mean it's basically an
off-the-shelf processor that it's an
office or and a processor and every
frame pretend is a thing and so I think
they're pure on played this game where
they want to be really high end they
can't be on and I and I have this other
phone this other flagship phone which
we've been talking about for a year yeah
and then they come out and they're like
here's all these other phones that you
that are probably hablas on five because
this other ones coming out as huh and
yeah so the event they said it will be
like why are you doing all this and the
answer was it will be very clear at the
moto accident what the plan is like why
the Moto X is exists but yet they're
doing it you know they're owned by
Google and yet they're doing it on a now
outdated version of Android chance for
to Jack well you know what is it it is
it listen sits off for three this is
this is for three years I do what I do
cuz you love Bluetooth smart I do so
alright so that's what we'll get to this
but this is the nexus 7 I've had it I
reviewed it I completely think I'm crazy
I think you're crazy we'll get to this
let's let's check out the review real
quick fine this is David at the verge
and this is Google's new Nexus 7 last
year Google's first Nexus 7 immediately
became the best android tablet on the
market but in the last 12 months it's
become plotting Lee slow and buggy and
just outdated so Google's back with
another this time for 229 dollars
bringing the device way up to date it
starts with the hardware made by a sous
the new Nexus 7 has a 7.0 2 inch 1920 x
1200 IPS display that is way better than
the last model or even something like
the iPad Mini it has fantastic viewing
angles and gorgeous color reproduction
and it's just insanely sharp at 323
pixels per inch it's good enough that
you can even read tiny text I could
actually read a book through the
screenshots in the play store and
everything from movies to books is just
more pleasant to look at the screen gets
incredibly bright and absolutely
destroys the battery when it's turned
all the way up but its overall one of
the best tablet displays I've ever seen
maybe be best even while improving the
screen Google managed to make the nexus
7 a little bit thinner and a lot lighter
it's a little taller now and it feels a
lot taller the bezels on the sides are
thinner than last year's model but the
top and bottom bezels are still big and
fat it makes the device feel kind of
asymmetrical which the office in our
camera lens on the front doesn't help
either but the Nexus 7 is even more
comfortable and usable in one hand than
ever it's still soft touch and
comfortable but it feels much more grown
up somehow I could see James Bond using
this nexus 7 Google and a suits also
added stereo speakers which are great no
matter how you hold the new Nexus 7 you
get genuine stereo sound that's pretty
loud and pretty clear there's a new 5
megapixel rear camera as well but it's
not very good or very interesting for
229 dollars you can only expect so much
but Google did make bigger promises this
time the new Nexus 7 runs on a faster
processor and a GPU that google says is
more than four times as powerful there's
double the RAM now too which is a big
upgrade
and it's fast other than the fact that
Google has somehow not figured out how
to animate scrolling properly there are
basically zero performance issues with
this nexus 7 games look great even
intensive ones and the operating system
flows smoothly part of that is
definitely due to the fact that the
nexus 7 runs Android 4.3 it's still
called jelly bean but it does bring a
few new things to the table restricted
profiles basically just gives you
parental controls for the tablet you can
pick and choose which apps certain users
can access it's a future lots of tablets
have had though it's just now baked into
the OS one genuinely cool new feature is
play games which is essentially a not
hideous game center or xbox live for
Android it tracks your achievements and
high scores shows you what your friends
are playing and so on Google's talking a
lot about tablet apps and how many of
them look good and work well on the
Nexus 7 there are definitely signs of
life for the Android ecosystem here apps
like Flipboard and Evernote and pocket
work great on a 7-inch device and
Netflix can now play in gorgeous 1080p
but there's still plenty of examples
like Rdio which is just a blown up phone
app and looks pretty bad particularly
for game players to there are just many
more great apps on iOS than on Android
but for most things androids caught up
and on a 7-inch device even the blown up
phone apps don't look quite so terrible
the new Nexus 7 is far more powerful
than the old there's no question about
that but I'm still a little nervous in
our benchmark tests it's raw numbers are
much better but relative to the
competition they're about the same as
the nexus 7 was a year ago I was hoping
for insane crazy power so this tablet
would be able to hang around for years
but that may not be the case I guess we
might just be stuck paying 229 dollars a
year forever which does make the more
expensive models like the 32 gig model
for 269 dollars or 32 gigs plus LTE for
three hundred and forty nine dollars a
much shorter cell battery life is
another thing that was odd about the old
Nexus 7 at least the 1i bought it was
great for a couple of months and then
basically fell off a cliff for now the
new model easily last through a full day
of pretty heavy use even with some
gaming and movie watching and it burns
almost no battery on standby which was
not true of the Nexus 7 i bought a year
ago I'm hoping that holds up so yes I'm
still a little worried about the future
but in some sense such as the price of
progress and the Nexus 7 has such good
build quality such a gorgeous screen and
finally such a good selection of tablet
apps that for as long as the processor
can hang around this is going to be one
of the best android tablets on the
market Apple may well come out with an
iPad Mini with Retina display and it may
well continue to have a big ecosystem
advantage especially for gamers but if
you want to tablet the
great for reading watching movies
browsing the web and checking your email
the new Nexus 7 for all of two hundred
and twenty nine dollars is pretty much
unbeatable okay so I like this tablet a
lot and you don't or you think I you
don't like as much as I do on the inside
this is what I did it look like the
david dakota new technology right there
right there look look I think it's a
great piece of hardware I think Google
is built a great piece of hardware i
think the screen is spectacular yeah i
think present something to me this more
of as i was putting up the reviews i
can't believe a su speed Apple to a 7
inch Retina tablet right is true and
it's like you know if Diana disagree on
the software but the screen is great I
think the bezels are stupid just
ridiculously stupid and I you know I
have a real issue with on-screen buttons
I've decided I've decided like yeah I
think that wasting actual display space
for buttons is not useful so you'd
rather the buttons be down at the bottom
right yeah I'd rather have that at the
news fours content and I hate the fact
that androids on-screen home button is
under the spacebar but then every time
claims about how the buttons are like
capacitive and not on the screen that's
like the pure Android way yeah that's
just made up like those people are crazy
okay is Android a good tablet OS and I
say yes and you disagree I why do you
discreet I think it's a good tablet OS
if your your tablet is this big because
then it's a phone OS that's kind of big
that's the thing is this is this big but
it's so this is a giant phone it's like
it's like they can't build a tablet they
can build a pretty big phone and then
like kind of get there and they can like
half step their way to that and I just
think all of these apps are like big
phone apps I actually think the browser
chrome on Android like it's really close
to being the best browser ever but it's
not there it makes a lot of mistakes it
doesn't rent it certainly better than
safari it's sometimes pilot it I
disagree well support mean I suppose
router Safari on iOS is still leaps and
bounds hood it just doesn't do very much
but it does it's right now chrome does
all the cool stuff right they does all
the sinking it's like all the stuff that
it does but as a browser in terms like
being fast and running page as well a
dad and that's like I mean those are
those are big deals and so like I think
on a phone android is
great and I there I keep saying over and
over again the only things that lock me
into having an item I found it I Tone
Loc me into having an iphone a full-time
our airplane I message right and the
apps are like they're good enough on
android phones where I'm not like
constantly waiting right right but I
mean you just I suppose it's just a big
phone but this is just a big phones I
think why do I got I just have great
because the goal of establishing me to
be your primary computing device not
just like here's a bigger screen believe
they just fit but that's like that d
adds the aspirational goal of a tablet
so like you i think so i think that's
the aspirational goal of motion ipad i
don't think they even the iPad Mini is
trying to be your primary computing
device I think a lot of people would
would tell you that the ipad but it
could be because it runs all the same
applications and that's incredibly
powerful i think if you are all right oh
the people ask me what they what tablet
they should buy are really asking me
like what should my main computer be
when I let go home and like do computer
stuff like I think nerds have a lot of
answers a question wrong yeah well it
depends on you're talking to but the
people were asking me like I think about
my friends and family who have iPads
most of full-size iPads yeah and they do
not use other computers in their home
they just don't they like have laptops
they don't like using them but sit have
Windows PCs and like using them but I
knew just arguing against 7-inch tablets
in general or no I mean I understanding
the ipad mini can like serve that role
for a lot of just because it has the
same because as st. absence of powerful
and the ecosystem is built out and it's
the ipad ecosystem not i OS the ipad
ecosystem is building towards this can
be a computer right now I think everyone
and I think where the Android ecosystem
is building towards the best we can do
is a pretty big phone if you're any
other android phone manufacturer and you
don't have like a PC line or something
that you want to go already shrinking
you have to stay the hell away from this
because it's going to eat away your
phones and I think that's like the truth
about android tablets wait I mean
business decisions aside it's a really
good device like I don't care no it's
whether they're absolutely that's a
really nice screen I still don't know
what your lock pattern is it has a
really nice screen
uh definitely gonna just erase his phone
I got you I just call it a phone look it
has a really nice screen and that's it
that's it it's it's really thin and the
most expensive one is what 32 gigs has
LTE yeah and it's three and its twenty
dollars more than the cheapest ipad mini
and I think that is incredibly that's
yeah I think it's in credit like that's
all great but I think too it's a mistake
to say that that Android is competitive
on tablets when tablets spans a range of
a bigger screen that i watch netflix on
to I'm gonna replace my computer with
this and a mini can configure ethically
do both i bought i ran out last year
about a nexus 7 yeah that last year yeah
it was last year Jesus time time flies
uh which is now a piece by the way it's
a piece of junk yeah and I never really
said I mean the only thing i like about
is that the back has a like dimpled
leather pattern that's nice um what do
you tell people who are got burned by
that experience uh that I mean
ultimately that's like the price in
progress an apple does really well I
said this my review Apple is the one
company that does really well supporting
it's all products yeah and I hope that
this is good enough and even if it's not
it's still okay how does the criterion
for watching how is it the price of
progress I mean you're any phone from a
year ago is crap now that's just how the
world works it's sort of unfortunate but
that's how it is like every day last
year of your phone contract you hate
your phone unless you i have an iphone
like that's the rules it's all right so
lets rule so the other thing they
announced actually this is in a way more
interesting business is the chromecast
sure so you spent some time to grow i am
very fond of the crown and you which is
interesting cuz you said the the airplay
and I message are the two things that
keep you on iOS yeah and theoretically
the chromecast is supposed to fix that
so you reviewed that we're gonna watch
that real quick and then I have
questions this is the Iowa the verge and
this is Google's chromecast the
chromecast is a $35 hdmi dongle that
lets you stream video from laptops
tablets and smartphones and it works
across max pcs Android and iOS devices
like the iPhone and iPad the only
complicated part of setting up a
chromecast is getting it power and even
that is pretty simple almost all tvs
have a USB port that you're not using on
them and the chromecast can just plug
right into that if you don't have a USB
port on your TV there's a small power
adapter in the box all in all it's a
tiny little bit more cable
other than you might expect but it's
also one of the simplest setups out
there the only thing left to do once
you've plugged in the chromecast is
either open the Android app or the setup
page and chrome on your PC give the
dongle a name and configure the Wi-Fi
connection which takes just a couple
minutes you'll also be prompted to
install the google cast extension in
chrome on your Mac or PC the first time
through but I get the feeling that we'll
all be built in a chrome very very soon
once you've got everything set up which
took me just five or ten minutes using
the chromecast is ridiculously simple
supported apps and services will display
a little icon when they see the
chromecast on your network and when you
hit it it'll tell the chromecast to
connect to that service and stream the
video using chromecast and apps like
Netflix and YouTube is almost perfect
since the chromecast is streaming video
directly from the web and not your phone
the video looks great and you can switch
to other apps and tabs on your phone or
pc and keep working while the video is
playing there are some glitches I found
it pretty easy to confuse the netflix
app on my iphone and occasionally you
find yourself sort of lost while the
video is playing without any obvious way
to control it since you've closed at a
verse which taps it's not the end of the
world but Google would be smart to build
some basic controls into that Android
chromecast app and released a similar
iOS app the other problem is that right
now the list of apps and services that
support chromecast is pretty short it's
Netflix YouTube and Google play music
and TV on Android that's it compared to
something like Apple TV and airplay
that's a pretty sparse list google has a
long way to go and convince and content
companies to support chromecast directly
although I imagine Google's working
pretty hard on that and I imagine those
content companies are pretty interested
in supporting chromecast since it's at
this point the only viable competitor to
airplay but you don't have to wait for
Google really you can also just stream
any tab from the chrome browser on Mac
PC or the Chromebook pixel that means
you can stream pretty much anything to a
chromecast I tried the Verge's home page
vimeo Spotify Rdio ESPN whatever I
wanted really clicking full screen on a
flash video makes that player full
screen on your PC and on the TV the only
things that didn't work we're video
players that rely on quicktime which is
built by apple dragging a video into
chrome from the desktop that played
using quicktime sent video but not sound
streaming video from a tab isn't perfect
though there are some clear stutters the
scrolling lags way behind your finger
and the audience
especially in bad connections but it
works which is important and google says
the feature is only in beta so I'm
really hoping it'll get better and
that's pretty much it the chromecast
does what it says it's going to do and
it does it really well it's the first
device that's made it easy and desirable
to put a web browser on your TV and
while there are definitely some glitches
in places where Google needs to fill in
the gaps it's pretty good for
thirty-five dollars in fact it's
probably one of the best impulse
purchases you'll make this year so
chromecast is kind of airplay minus a
few things is that a fair summation okay
it doesn't do audio only yet it it local
file streaming is a little like
interesting ya hear rumors that Plex is
super interested in doing stuff yes
there should be super cool I mean look
it's $35 I think people are gonna buy
them they're selling out so fast I to
cancel their own netflix promotion yeah
I got him you got nailed it yeah it was
like the last person to get it hi I
don't know if I but I look I just think
like they're gonna be a lot of them out
in the world and people are going to
interesting things with it and right now
at this moment it actually works which
is for Google and a 1 point 0 product
service that's pretty impressive for so
all right so prove it so we have a bunch
of devices here and a chromecast yo it's
I mean it's basically as simple as like
just pushing a button right so he has
the same as airplay so we have this with
the nexus 7 review which is
nine-point-oh hundred percent correct
what a smart guy whoever wrote that
genius really um so we can do that and
it starts playing and then there's
literally just a button and it just does
it and it's just appears right this is
that so what what you've done is you've
told the chromecast you haven't sent
anything from here you just told the
chromecast to go get that YouTube so the
chromecast is essentially it's Chrome
it's just running a browser it's running
it's running YouTube now ok yeah so
that's cool so if you stop that the in
here's where it gets a little wonky is
I've noticed that chromecast gets
confused a lot this is remarkable by the
way is that it works across so works
across that's the thing about forms and
I think you're gonna see a real like API
war between Google and Apple because I
think apples gonna really want on his
google talked about theirs are they
gonna open it up and get yeah i mean
that's me necklace i've been wanting
likes an iOS right now um and it works
like there's a chromecast it's like a
really spill its instant queue going on
over here yeah Curious George my niece
and nephews with my netflix account so
let's let's do I know here's a rest
about it so I'm just going to press a
player s development on my phone here
and it's going to be slow because
arrested villains that's fine so I just
push the button in the corner and there
it is and there's our chromecast it's
just playing YouTube I've never actually
tried to do this before chromecast is
called verge cast by the way which I'm a
bit yeah and I just switched over so
she's not jacked mine completely yeah
just app so that's interesting I'm gonna
make your life hell Pierce let me suss
it out its loading netflix straight from
the web and the phone my iOS device is
turned into a controller and it's going
to take a minute I've noticed netflix
takes a minute longer than you so then
theoretically should i be able to
control netflix on there with yes if you
open netflix well no because that's a
different count right okay but if we
have the same account we have the same
on this device and would pull it from
there okay so now this is playing out
still me Jaime and I can just like hit
pause it'll take a second this is gonna
start and Paul like a lot of a lot of a
lot of wars yeah actually positive just
gonna have notice of stuff up there goes
and then you know I can just just threw
some you can I breaking bad place oh
let's watch an eye out so like this is
all very cool and really what's
happening is the chromecast is doing
most of the work right it's going out to
the web it's getting the contents
requesting it I'm basically what it's
doing is it's running chrome and Netflix
at this point like it has apps baked
into it and it's well it has your chrome
right okay so it's like it's doing
acrobatics right yeah without the
browser chrome and the dried stuff what
it is missing is the other soft hair
play can do where it's you've got an mp3
of your house you just like stream it to
the rent that stuff isn't there yet now
it can do google play stuff but that's
still hitting the web in a way and it
can stream tabs from your computer which
is still in beta and we this can it's
buggy like we say trying to get this
computer to work we'll just we'll just
cast it yeah that goes and we'll see so
now it's plenty Netflix it's I think
that my options are cast this tab stop
cast
yeah something should have that it went
black that's either good or bad oh look
at weren't Sammy worked right so is you
know it's like there's a little bit of
like hours behind but it works and so
like you for thirty-five dollars for all
of that to just have just worked yeah
kind of on the first go and for us to
like monkey with it as much as we do
yeah I think a lot of people are gonna
buy the comcast I think just to be able
to do this to be like hey I have this
picture on my thing I want everybody to
see it and just pop it on your team is
pretty cool I'm so look as an airplay
competitor I think it has has a way to
go so where they have to yet what do
they have to do they've got to get there
they've got a cuz that what kind of wins
cuz it's all Apple right so I'm just so
if you're building an iOS app you're
going to put in the app store and fit
this place video does audio people may
wear that was airplay right so the
demand isn't adding airplanes as I
understand basically it's baked into iOS
right if you're a Mac Developer you know
in Mavericks there's gonna be a lot more
airplay support so I apples like using
this they've known for a long time and
they've been pushing people towards
airplay since they watched it which
actually airplay started with just
itunes and the airport express and like
well like years before the iphone came
out so like it's understood it's there
Google's in that position right they've
put out a thing they've got a dongle
that works and they've got to convince
all their developers across Android and
you know pretty much every web app that
touches chrome to start supporting it
and that's the fight they have if they
can if they can get there that's like
really powerful stuff yeah and if they
can get you know Samsung and LG and
pioneer and whoever else and Sony to
build chromecast directly into TVs which
they were talking about doing that is
like that's something else I don't think
you google something that problem I
think Google's all those companies make
android phones anyway it makes the
android phone better like it sneaker
system at work so I I think comcast is
home potential I think for $35 I think I
there you can buy three of them for the
price of what happens right well I just
hope this makes Samsung and everybody
else stop trying to make smart TVs like
no outside it won't put it or at least
you know put less emphasis on it because
what this does is all of the things that
I need my smart TV to do or at least
this is sort of where it's headed if
they get you know they need more content
that's the big thing they need I'm
Amazon and Hulu and
whatever else but once they get that
it's just I'd rather use these as the
remote and then just pop it on the TV
like that's what we've wanted forever
right I think I think what we've learned
is that you need to keep the processor
in the UI as far away from the TV as
possible and just send stuff the TV and
like I'm sitting here with my phone
watching TV all the time anyway I don't
have a problem using my TV as a remote
oh so that is the one thing you can with
the ground fast you can definitely end
up in a weird world where it's doing
stuff and you have no idea how to make
it stop yeah like you said it a video
and you hit close and like what the hell
boy do you and like it's there you can
do you just have to click on the right
icon do it but it's not intuitive and
there's no direct control of it and I
think that that's like a problem for
them to just figure out how to solve
like a chromecast app on your phone that
just like here's what the hell I'm doing
you can tell it to stop like I think
that would be really useful all right
Neal I thank you so much I my chromecast
is coming I'm excited it's gonna be
great probably good all right that's our
show thank you so much for watching we
will be back next Monday and we'll see
you that
