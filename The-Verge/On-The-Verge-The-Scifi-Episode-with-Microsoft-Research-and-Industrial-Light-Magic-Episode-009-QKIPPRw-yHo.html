all right fine you keep going that makes
me feel very good thank you thank you
thank you thank you so much I'm not too
proud to beg for applause as you just
witnessed hi I'm Josh to welcome the
editor-in-chief of The Verge and welcome
to on the verge thank you guys so much
for being here really appreciate it we
have an interesting show tonight it's
kind of a sci-fi themed show so we're
gonna be talking about sci-fi science
fiction by the way if you didn't know
that you have to leave I was I'm worried
about how many people might have known
that it's cool we're talking about a lot
of science fiction stuff we actually one
of our editors went to ilm industrial
light and magic and did a tour there and
did some interviews there so we've got
some some footage of that which is
pretty cool we have from Microsoft Andy
Wilson he's one of the researchers he
brought a really crazy I can't describe
it it's like a backpack thing with
you'll see it he's like kind of like a
nerdy predator and and he doesn't
actually kill anybody but it's almost as
cool and and and Paul went out on the
streets and asked people about what they
wanted from they could have something
from science fiction that was highly
entertaining oh and we have some cool
stuff here that nobody else is see we
have the new HTC phones not that sci-fi
but they are kind of futuristic so sort
of sci-fi anyhow we should get underway
I just want to thank forward our sponsor
they're helping us put this on and that
is awesome so I think we should get paul
miller and nilay patel out here and get
this thing started Paul and Neil I yeah
butcher I just after now
so good to see ya so good to see you how
are you how are you yes hi hi nice to
see you again it's great spent a long
time we never see each other no we don't
work together yeah just that was a great
intro by though I don't know if you ever
get compliments okay I don't know nobody
ever says anything nice to me about the
intro so that means a lot oh it really
did I meant it thank you thank you so
much could you get closer baby here
alright so we have we have things to
talk about besides Paul complimenting my
great intro thanks for nothing Neil I uh
I mean I deliberately said nothing there
was some news this week I don't know if
you guys heard have you heard the news
have you did the iphone Safin there's a
new iphone really it's the new iPhone
iPhone 5 is out this week kind of big
news we did a review of it you can see
here and slightly big have a large story
here's here's some beautiful shots from
our review it's a fine phone I reviewed
it it's if you love the iphone yeah you
love the iphone 5 but I have to say I
went on The Today Show to talk about
that's a humble brag in case you're
wondering I went on to the today show to
talk about the iphone 5 and which is
weird because it's a phone the footage
they shot up no this is our footage are
excellent footage but also when we were
when we were driving past the cube very
early in the morning there was a massive
people there to the crush of people and
I'm concerned I think it's a little bit
weird that we're still waiting people
are still waiting in lines for the phone
this is rough own 6 iphone here's here's
people right here a sleeping outside I
mean this is the sixth time they've
released a phone yeah and it is just a
phone it's the back I'm saying this as a
nerd okay here's people outside the cube
you know in some of these some of these
situations got a little bit scary a
little bit out of hand I mean here
you've got riot police moving in just
people trying to get their hands on the
phone here the I don't know why these
guys hazmat suit you know and I'm
worried I mean here people were just
rushing to escape from a scene where
they were handing out phones I guess
and I'm worried what it could mean for
Humanity yeah frankly I'm I'm worried
that we're headed towards a scary place
this topic at this topic nightmare
really no charge of the iphone 5 launch
lines I mean it's funny is it Iowa six
with the maps really appreciate I mean
this scene predicted by apple in its own
mapping song there are some issues I
don't know if you've heard there are
some issues with in apps where they're
not properly just playing here this is
the Brooklyn Bridge right way that
doesn't that didn't turn out quite
apocalypse there will be no points of
interest there will be will be taking
wrong turns all the time yeah Italy
adesso Legends will be startling a
desolate wasteland I actually have I
actually have my phone here and that
what's amazing by the way I just saw
these today for the first time and item
Paulie sorry internet everyone if the
iPhone 6 has some sort of fusion reactor
inside of it and something goes wrong
that is what its gonna look I know I
have the phone here this is I just
pulled this up because they were like
wells or other stuff that's weird this
is the I don't know what camera I'm
going to maybe this one over here the
Statue of Liberty there is controversy
can we get that it's not there you know
it literally is not present yeah gone
it's been taken out so you have Hoover
Dam I'm is my favorite yeah here's
Hoover Dam something's gone wrong
horribly wrong with the road could we
get that up she the dip their the road
doesn't go like that doesn't go in does
it go into the water I'm is shockingly
exciting yeah but look it's a really
nice phone but they do have problems
with maps and that's been kind of I mean
when I went on The Today Show again
humblebrag Al Roker humblebrag asked me
who is my good friend now asked me yeah
I was like telling them about the phone
they're like what about these maps yeah
the people are riled up yeah anybody
here have any problems with the new maps
nobody here has any wife oh this guy
right here have you had issues you gonna
return it yes somehow I got here not
returning it though yeah you're just
gonna power through it that's cool
that's that problem yeah alright moving
on there is there is other news yeah in
the world I don't know if you've heard
but we have some HTC phones here that
are awfully cool looking in fact I'm
gonna bring them out check these out I
think I have to say I'm getting
excited sexually about about what people
are doing with starting to do with
phones I mean for a long time not if you
guys can see these then I made a vacancy
rate they're made of polycarbonate I'll
pound I'm gonna pass them down shape is
not there you go I won't take I want to
agree i'm gonna just give you that color
instead i mean because you want the
yellow one so these are not out yet but
these are new windows phone devices and
they're awesome looking am I crazy no
they look great missin this to me is
like 80s ski gear yeah which is is that
cool that's cool right yeah uh okay too
but they're really nicely made plastic
yeah Oh much fun I just want to say like
and this is not too big a base you see
or whatever but I mean I do wish these
had android instead of Windows Phone um
but I just think there's an HTC guy in
here right now actually crying uh I just
think we need to get a little crazier
with that phoned is I think Mike likes
probably pushing the ease of color right
colors you know Nokia's doing it as well
I mean Apple can't be the only guys who
are doing a cool phone design like it
needs to end all right i can go i can
launch into a big rant about this but i
think if you're if you're competing with
apple and by the way you are if you're
making smartphones mmm you need to bring
your A game Iran is about this in the
podcast let's not you need to bring your
a-game this be Selah I'm seeing some D
stuff out there top just stop that what
was that LG really they made a square LG
LG someone who will not be sponsoring
and any future out the herd is how it
happens we can't editor actually the
other two you want it you want to say
about these my new phone bring give me a
river the thing I've done is they look
best together right that's true yeah I
bios yeah I like the phone that i want
is like this look like hello yeah like
having one and like they just lonely
without each other you want a stripe
phone it's like it's like the Beatles
recording technique where you have like
two voices seeing over yourself and it
harmonies what you're describing so
harmony is it's it's you know John
Lennon would do it cuz is with Paul with
Paul McCartney know how Harvey which was
owned voiceover solo he would double his
doubling which one is reasonably okay
I'm not gonna get ready
teryn I'm not getting into the details
at all anyhow I'm just happy to see my
point is the iphone 5 is really
beautiful but these are really beautiful
too in a different way I think I'm
thrilled I feel like you look at the
galaxy s3 or for whatever it is and like
it's like oh that's good it has a larger
screen right that's empirically great
phone but this is just like oh my gosh I
need that right now yeah I mean and I
have no use for the love to see what
Windows Phone 8 is like yeah I'm not
buying these right now yeah but i would
consider buying them and that's the
important thing well you know the rumor
is that HTC is making the next Nexus
device would you wait is that the rumor
that's the rumor this make this the
Nexus just put android on art whatever
I'm not you're gonna get me a nerd rant
and we'll be here all night as I ran ah
so we should there's there's other
little news we're not gonna get into
that and I want to get to andy wilson
cuz he hasn't really cool stuff to show
off but as I said we took a trip but we
didn't all take a trip at bryan bishop
who you may know who did a lot of our
coverage during the Apple Samsung trial
went to ilm and sat down with people
there and talk to them about you know
creating science fiction everyone's very
jealous in yes in film for film for
science fiction films you know to me he
made a film no question science fiction
film yeah it's very cool check it out
we've got brian bishop at ILM and we'll
be back with andy wilson checks out
we're at Industrial Light &amp;amp; Magic for
the last 37 years I ulemas mates on the
most well-known effects in Hollywood
history have you seen the Star Wars
movies the Indiana Jones trilogy all the
Transformers films you know the work of
ilm
Jeff white was the visual effects
supervisor on the Avengers and
Transformers Dark of the Moon i sat down
with him to talk about what first
inspired to me get into special effects
and a problem eilam had about a
particularly colorful Hulk you know I
think so many of us Star Wars and said
okay this is this is where we want to
work and you know knowing that ILM kind
of was founded to create that and then
just following it over the years and
then getting a chance to get a job here
was was really a dream come true let's
talk about the most recent film you do
the Avengers ruptures any here in the
motion-capture stage where you said he'd
shot a lot of stuff for that movie
what's the process what happens in these
four walls one of the great things about
Avengers especially with the Hulk was
having Mark Ruffalo come up here and do
performance you know and we actually did
several rounds of that he came here
initially just to come here on the mocap
stage and we showed him his motion kind
of retargeted onto a hog very fast and
loose so they could play with some ideas
and at the same time we captured a range
of expressions from him that we used to
drive the digital version of him and an
hour process on this one rather than
just kind of jumping straight to the
Hulk was to actually build the mark
digital mark ruffalo first and and
verify that when we took the the data
that we captured you know from all his
expressions put it on the digital
version of him and then looked at them
side-by-side that they would look the
same so that you know we were really
figuring out the difficult problems by
having a perfect reference and then
because the Hulk had elements of mark
incorporated into his design which I
think was a really great decision for
this film we were able to take a lot of
that same work and kind of applied to
the hall sometimes I feel like you may
ccg character's name will kind of like
pop out from the environment they won't
kind of blend in and he is seamless
throughout that entire movie you know
what steps would you take to kind of
make him blend in like Max's it was it
seemed a step above the stuff I've seen
recently because the design was based on
him he did a performance for every shot
he actually came up here and put on the
helmet cam and put on the you know
ridiculous looking
suit and went through the entire process
and Joss could direct him and you know
very quickly work through you know what
the shot was makes him selects off that
then we track all of that data apply it
first to our mark ruffalo digital double
again make sure that we had that as a
good match and then apply it through
retargeting process to the Hulk because
the Hulk is such different proportions
from Mark Ruffalo there's a lot of work
in terms of you know taking his
performance and then the animators
really crafting it into you know what
you see on the screen and a lot of hand
on you know work in terms of putting
that together what I think then helped
us really blend it into the plate was
when we were on set mark was there for
every Hulk shot and so we were able to
render the Hulk and stack them up side
by side with Mark Ruffalo there and it
was something that we kind of learned on
Davy Jones from parts of the Caribbean
is you have the real actor there even if
you're not using any part of them just
to have the reference of what do you
know marks eyes look like in this shot
in this lighting in this environment and
then making sure that our Hulk matches
that because a lot of times we would
we'd put our same digital character in
there we'd render it and you know like
hey this looks great and then we'd start
comparing it like whoa there's a lot
that's off that we need to go fix even
down to just the angle of the eyelashes
could make a big difference in terms of
your perception of the character and
that kind of match so you know I think
especially for the things where cg tends
to be a big struggle like around the
eyes where you're trying to put some
thought into a motion into the eyes I'm
being able to have that reference
performance and was really valuable what
are some other areas that are
traditionally a struggle when you're
trying to go and put a character
together like that well I think you know
for the Hulk he's he's a human and yet
he's not only giant-sized but he's got
green skin and you know we sort of joked
around all the time that green is a
really difficult color humans are very
sensitive to green and differences in
that color and he's in so many different
environments he's down on the Park
Avenue viaduct and he's jumping up you
know stark tower to the you know outside
and you know the the blue sky or the the
building shadows would all change his
green color to sort of bad looking
colors we had minty Hulk and we had
pumpkin Hulk and so we worked very
closely with Marvel in terms of trying
to make sure that his color was
consistent throughout and that we also
early on in the process Joss decided
that the green really wanted to be a
pretty deece a chewer ated grain and I
think that helped us a lot in terms of
making him look real because it's it's
very similar in saturation to kind of a
natural flesh tone so you know rather
than something that kind of pops off the
screen he integrates really nicely with
the other Avengers that are there also
Joss Whedon directing the avengers not
something that had done a huge big
budget film like that before what was
that experience like I you know I was
really excited to get a chance to work
with him on this project and had been
such a huge fan of his coming into it
and it was it was really fantastic I
think you know all the humor and that
you see in the writing and that you see
on the screen is what it's like working
with him you know every day and you know
he's pretty amazing at pulling out
references to movies and artists that
we'd be scrambling to go you know look
up to see what he's talking about but it
was it was a really phenomenal
experience and I think the great thing
that he brought to it was making sure
that in the end the visual effects
always serve the story that he was
creating you know I think people really
connect with these characters and then
you know our job was to just make sure
everything look good one of the really
fun parts about working with him is that
because he's such a fan of comic books
to begin with he knew what people want
to see the Hulk do and so he gave us
those moments another effects supervisor
influenced by Star Wars was Grady Cofer
we talked to Grady about has work on the
film battleship and paul thomas
anderson's there will be blood so we got
a call that there were there were a few
shots on there will be blood that kind
of sat in the middle of his movie and
that was kind of the big country know
whenever they strike oil in the middle
of it and there's the big kind of the
big geyser of oil and there were lots of
ways to kind of tackle that kind of shot
now for for Paul who's
definitely a purist and and it really
honors kind of the craft of filmmaking
and likes the purity of the frame and
all of that because I could have done
this is a little early I could have done
like a big CG simulation had done all of
that and for that show that didn't
really seem like kind of the right
solution we kind of it was something
actually a special effects for me was
great had a pretty good looking kind of
representation of oil and we did a big
kind of we shot it as kind of a
miniature we we actually sprayed oil up
in the air down in LA and filmed all of
these elements and it became kind of a
large kind of comp of those kind of
elements and it worked really well and
it was all very real and meant a lot of
the lot of the cameraman Ghana got
covered with this kind of fake oil but
you know it worked out in the end you
had the supervisor on battleship you
guys have a long history of great sci-fi
movie special effects when you're taking
something on like that you know was it
daunting and you know and what is the
process and some pretty good innovations
you guys brought to the table with
battleship it was daunting and you know
a lot of that were I mean there was a
lot of big ideas and this and that's
kind of what you want you know when you
can when you find a director who and
Pete is definitely an idea guy it's like
he it's kind of non-stop he'll show up
in the morning and go I've got it you
know get my previous guys out here and
he'll throw out some all these these
interesting things and you go down all
these different kind of creative
journeys and and like ideas and stuff
but when he pitched it it wasn't just
kind of naval warfare it was naval
warfare meets sci-fi alien invasion you
know on a grand scale on a summer
blockbuster scale and and he wanted he
wanted spectacle it's like he you know
he wasn't shying away from it you know
he was he's like I'm here I'm making a
big you know mega summer movie and the
way he described it was that these alien
and this alien invasion they landed
these ships called stingers which are if
you look at kind of their their
silhouette they're kind of based on like
these water bugs right so they kind of
hover or kind of a walk along the
surface or float along the surface of
the ocean but he wanted them to start
kind of submerged so in their reveal in
this kind of a big part
the movie they all kind of breach up
through the water then they splash back
down that's already pretty hard right we
know that that's that's a kind of a
large-scale fluid simulation and that
was going to be something we're going to
wrap our heads around but as the the
project we were in we were you know and
in pre-production he said okay not only
do they breach and they sit on the
surface of the water but I want them you
know I want all of these tubes and stuff
underneath them and they they kind of
suck water up out of them and then
recycle it over them constantly like
they're just constant waterfalls you
know and you know of course you nod
you're like okay that sounds great very
interesting and we so we we kind of knew
at that point that an island has
actually great you know history of water
show specifically they've done some
really really groundbreaking stuff but
maintaining that over the course of this
entire show for a lot of it in broad
daylight and in very very wide kind of
spectacle shots we knew we were going to
have to raise our game and and it was
you know it was pretty amazing here at
ILM because they you know they have a
really really strong R&amp;amp;D department and
so you get all these guys together in a
room and they came up with a call it the
battleship water project and pretty much
over the course of columns two year they
re engineered how we tackle kind of
large-scale fluid simulations at ILM and
and then how we render it you know
render it for all you know we wanted to
kind of represent water kind of through
the entire kind of life span of kind of
water from from from a big kind of
splashy massive water to to you know to
the little speedy kind of particulate
that comes off of that to the little
mist that comes off of that and all of
it we wanted to be influenced by
airfields and simulated kind of movement
of vortices in the air was a huge huge
project but the end of the day it really
enhanced kind of did your experience of
these stingers became a part of their
personality you know Pete's mandate from
the beginning on this film was
authenticity right everything had to be
very authentic and we were scouting the
Missouri one day down in Pearl Harbor
and there was kind of kind of
hopman throughout the day that people
wanted to have a bit of an effects
meeting dockside at the end of the day
so I met him and so we're kind of
sitting there and there's this like you
know wall to wall there's the Missouri
kind of beautiful and majestic kind of
filling the horizon and he said all
right that I get that's real you know I
feel that that ship your work has to
look just as good as that I have to
believe your work and it was I mean it
was a challenge you know that's your
pressure that's not right yeah but you
know but it was great and it actually
it's set kind of a high lofty goal for
us and that's its kind of what you want
you know you want to aim high well Grady
thank you so much for spending some time
with us it's been a real treat is to go
inside of what you do every day and the
facility and yeah thanks for tucking in
soon yeah awesome thanks now I'm i was
going to be fan of battleship personally
but but i think yo I know what you're
saying it's based on a board game maybe
not that great of an idea for a movie
but you've got to respect those water
effects cannot mess at the water effects
so I think we should bring out our guest
he's a brilliant guy the principal
researcher at Microsoft he's making some
frankly bizarre stuff and I'm looking
forward to this conversation please
welcome Andy Wilson from Microsoft
alright thanks a lot
no pressure no pressure you have to
one-up battleship oh you do that I'll
try actually kind of low pressure ah so
Andy these guys don't know you maybe
they know you a little bit we did a
video uh months ago like right here ago
or something yeah then I thought was
really came visited yeah I came to visit
your home away from home your lab yeah
which you actually do a lot of fun you
do live there right yeah pretty much
tell me what you do where how did you
how did you start doing this and what do
you do at Microsoft and give me your
give me a little your backstory so I'm a
researcher at Microsoft Microsoft has a
big research group of about 850 PhD
level folks doing research on all sorts
of things I'm mostly interested in
natural user interaction and different
ways that we can exploit sensing
technologies and display technologies in
in completely novel ways and we make the
way that we relate with computers so a
lot of the things you saw there are
prototypes where we believe very firmly
and and building things and playing with
them and to sort of finding our way
through all these new things just by
experimenting and trying as many things
as we can and your work is I mean from
what I saw and some of the stuff we're
going to show today your work is really
about I mean we're very used now to
these kind of we have a screen or we
have something in front of us we have
some in our hand we interact with that
we're kind of like going into that
interface your stuff is like taking that
interface out into the world I mean a
lot of what you do is is it's like
projecting on to the world basically in
making the world the interface where
does that where does that instinct come
from I mean what is that what is the end
game for you with that so that's right
so so I like to call it beyond the
surface Sam so I worked on the first
version of surface and the one that used
a video camera is the large 30 inch
tabletop and so for me it's always been
about what can we do with sensing
technologies and interesting ways and
for me the work that we've done with
depth cameras for example you know lifts
all of the interaction we're getting off
of touchscreens out into the real world
and that's where we really live we don't
live in the the flat plane of a display
we live in the real world let's bring
the sensing and display into our real
world I mean
you headed up the surface project that
when it was a large table so I did the
very first prototype and a couple of us
a couple guys and I did the first
efforts around surface and building the
first product it was a lot of fun was it
painful to watch microsoft introduced a
tiny tablet called the surface today
don't really know it was very flattered
that they decided to reuse our name i
thought that was a great choice but now
you can't call the surface to serve
that's right there that's that there's
that ring that does that hurts doesn't
it a little bit you can share not is no
judgment here in this room okay so you
also incorporate a lot of connect sort
of like technology and into what you're
doing is connect the first I mean that's
you know there aren't many consumer
products that are actually utilizing the
physical around you not yet to be is
that the first step do you see that it's
just like that you know Oh point version
2.1 of this absolutely is it's the
opening opening move and a thinkin a
great you know Renaissance and natural
user interfaces you know people have
been doing this research for a long time
I was a graduate student at the MIT
Media Lab in the 90s and what we were
doing a lot of this hand tracking kinds
of things and interacting with with
things on screen that now you can go out
and buy it's really nice to be able to
see that move from the lab gosh just
taken a little while but now it's like
it's now that its commodity at least in
for certain kinds of applications let's
think about other applications where
that where this would actually be useful
can is this the kind of thing that you
would find in a in a conference room at
a workplace or gets me excited when I
hear that with would we find is in a
conference room probably yeah I'm
working is there anything more exciting
than something in the conference room I
mean I know baby that's up here that's
like you're in a fridge I know you're in
bright orange on the conference room
tech but like can we go to read what
about for the home what about for the
kitchen friend yeah kitchen is a nice
one because you know you don't want to
get your hands all dirty on the on the
touch pad right so maybe you maybe you
put that on the on your table top in the
in your in your your kitchen counter you
actually lay out the recipe and the
things that you need and we have a we've
had a few demos over the years on
Microsoft where you it would be really
fun for kids you set out the recipe and
the ingredients for the recipe and kids
get that and then yeah sure can I pitch
an idea to you go ahead the kitchen
let's hear it so I'm imagining
been like you know these tentacles
hanging down over your over your kitchen
work surface and then you use some kind
of motion tracking the tentacles are all
full of different spices oh and use the
motion tracking you put a chicken or
something underneath and then you just
kind of minority report the spices all
over it excellent do they get something
you could work on or absolutely we
actually have complete make that happen
I just can do for me we actually have
some video stuff that you that you
couldn't bring with you yeah this thing
is called a Bhima Tron can you explain
this is the Bema Tron that's the Bema
Tron and so with that the Bema Tron is a
pan tilt motion platform kind of like
what you see at rock concerts with
lights except we replaced the light with
a projector and a depth camera and so
what we're doing is projecting the car
and the car responds to the real world
just as as if it were a real model you
know radio-controlled car and so by
using the the pan tilt movement we can
actually get all the way through the
room we can project a graphic into this
person's hand and move that that graphic
from one hand to the other here's a shot
another shot of the of a ramp guys a
terrible driver yeah absolutely so so
the idea really is to bring the the
interaction out into your entire world
so with one camera one projector in this
this motion platform we can we can you
know track these people there's we can
project graphics on to this person and
reacted appropriately she can actually
pull graphics from the wall and send
them from one place to the next and like
a spice yeah sure for instance you do
that you could track that the get the
Korean yeah I guess exactly paprika boom
tentacle down onto the chicken why not
uh and then you have another one but you
have another one that we have video of
which is called the hollow flector can
you tell me a little bit about this this
is like this freak this is insane so
this is not done on post right this is
actually video shot of the of a mirror
and I'm standing in front of the mirror
and then I'm interacting with this this
graphics and it'll be like the peppers
ghost illusion you might have seen it
and you know a Disney theme park it's a
little different but we can superimpose
graphics on to it and so it's really
augmented reality but in a very large
form factor and we're incorporating some
some concepts from the phone here's you
know maybe I'm doing a little
holographic phone calls is actually
connect record
you that's you talking that's me holding
yourself this is my little Maj to god
princess land you know a little that's a
little weird yeah so so but you brought
something today I did in the end and we
should take a look at it let's let's
check this out what is it called what
did you bring this is the wearable
multi-touch projector okay I'm gonna
come up with a better name for that is a
wearable multi-touch projector let's
check this let's check this out
this is handsome this is nice now now
now uh what did you say this is called
again we call this the wearable
multi-touch projector we got to come up
but once she's got the predator the I
mean it's kind of I don't know yeah a
little bit looks a little bit it looks a
little bit violin see this is kind of
like a connect here it is basically like
the kinect uses the same technology it's
a short-throw version of connect right
so it actually works in this sort of arm
reach volume just the area in front of
me and you think in the future everybody
will have like a lenovo laptop hanging
off of her hanging off of their side is
that it is the future i feel like we
build prototypes right and i'm just
starting the projector there's also
laser projectors that appears in a pico
projector projectory okay great and so
this is our this is actually our second
prototype the first one we built
actually just connected to it should
have a desktop that was hanging off
anyway so it brings like a full day meet
our goals you have like a little
assistant to carry next you're a second
one of course if we were to consider
product izing this i mean we would not
have this this is but this is a really
nice setup because we can actually you
know right like really sloppy code and
get that running on here and yeah and do
all the experiments we wanted so you met
your code is sloppy abscess fine nothing
nothing wrong with that all right so
show us what this thing okay what this
thing does so when tell me why it does
right so this is the idea is to bring
some of the interaction into the world
so we can actually co-opt surfaces in
the world and I'm just going to lean
over here and start this and it'll take
a moment to start hopefully and just now
what version of windows is this this is
one of seven actually uh-huh so I'm so
you have an upgraded yet huh nyan nyan
interesting okay so we're using the
depth camera to enjoying that completely
exactly all right all right past it so
here I am so I'm gonna touch this the
wall here you notice that I get a bit of
a menu okay it's a little bit like our
supposes the new windows phone 8 i've
been about so and you notice that as I
move back and forth whoops they're just
disappeared that's all right we can
start that again and as I move back and
forth that actually stays the same size
we're actually using the depth camera to
rectify or make it appear as if the
graphics are the same size are actually
the real goal would be to stabilize it
so it feel feels like there's actually
painted on the wall so what I'm going to
do is show you a couple things there's a
phone icon we can actually touch this
and there's
this ubiquitous slide to a mono
ubiquitous that's it that is a patent
case right there Apple are you watching
because you can have to you're going
down you're done yes I even bother I
would ahead just I just find to take
whatever money is in your bank account
right now and send a pic yeah right so
we have a dial pad here so we can do the
kind of expected thing you notice
there's the sort of red red ball here
and that's showing me where it thinks my
my finger is an actual phone number well
I gosh I hope not keep going yes okay
let's call someone and I'm just dialing
a random oh he's gonna call the number
cuz this actually capable of dialing it
does not dying so that's that's just
something we've been playing around with
but it gives you an idea of the sensing
technology that we have so we can do a
few other things oh by the way it's
multi-touch right so in we know what if
my finger got in here what do it happen
Scott you might try a min so if you come
and you know yeah look at that it is
working yeah I don't erase that yeah
yeah absolutely this is horrible what
you've drawn yeah I mean see if I can do
me see if I can do something yeah so it
works a little bit better if you come in
from the side or a flat oh there we go
yeah so and that has to do with the way
the algorithm how we run let's give draw
face but that's obliterated right ah you
notice that I'm actually so I'm stopping
each of the little demos when you by
putting my hand over the cameras kind of
a funny thing to do but it's a way for
us to reset the system I'm going to show
you a couple more things okay great so
we have yours here's your map and again
as I move back and forth Apple might
want to also take out of it
and so it's multi touch as well and so I
can scroll around and there we go so
that's the map and not nothing
surprising there and then let me show
you guys see the Hoover Dam on that as
well as he was intact so there's a
couple of other things that we can do
one is the notion of being able to
invoke an application just by drawing
the space in the world that you want to
see that see it and that's not be the
space that you want yeah it's what
you're saying yeah so can you tell me
what that so tell me what the practical
what you envision a practical
application for this is what is it was a
typical yeah exactly something like that
so Ashley its currency converter that's
great yeah so give me a prize so I'm
walking around aight in the future when
these are just commonplace yeah we'll
give me a scenario where this is
becoming you know I need this so a good
one would be you know where we just met
and we're you know maybe we met on the
hallway and we're you know I want to
show you something over here and i want
to show you it in the large I don't want
to like you know huddle around the tiny
little phone right actually throw this
up on the wall and lamb ajan that's
bigger and brighter and all these things
projector technology is going to get
better of course then we can interact
with this as if it were a real in a
large multi touch display right right so
it to the guys like a guy just met this
nerd with this thing on it now and now
you wants to show me something exactly
that's right because everybody will have
that well imagine it's a tiny thing
maybe it's actually fits in the end you
know in a button on your shirt you the
entire the entire thing and a button on
your shirt yeah you think we can get
there I think I think so it really
matter of time yes I mean all of these
things that I'm showing you here are
really small when you sort of take them
in the women I mean the pico projector
is just a there's not even a lands on a
pico projector right show the audience
turn around here I just want you guys to
see you're seeing the back but do you
see this whole setup here I mean the
idea that this could get down to the
size of a button seems frankly like a
pipe dream are you on any dope right now
but look at the size of the first cell
phones right and look at what with her
that's right now that's layer originally
like this tall they'd have wheels on
them I mean if you turn a thing o thing
with a wire that came out you took a
modern cell phone showed it to somebody
from you know 30 years ago they'd be
like what is this alien technology
you're showing me
it does look it does look alien well
this certainly does Yeah right let me
let me show you one more thing okay and
so we set this and then I just want to
give you a little bit of an idea of the
processing that we're actually doing so
this is just a display that shows the
the fingertip tracking and you notice
there's it's multi-touch and then as I
reach in it goes from hover state to a
touch state and its we doing two at once
and then finally on the back out a
little more time and real quick I want
to show you the the nature of the
processing that we're doing and this is
this is basically just showing you the
depth stream that we're getting from the
Kinect camera Wow right I can I get in
you can get in there right so you get an
idea of some of the processing that
we're doing you want to yeah I don't
know I don't know what this was our
exactly but that's cool though right
shows you in this out there we go that's
gone yeah I was gonna say far away it's
too I was too funky for it which is a
problem a lot of people feel I'm too
funky and then and the sheets and the
other thing that we've been studying is
the idea that we can actually project
onto anything not not just a whiteboard
or a wall or something like that huh and
and then we can we can actually track
this you know this notepad for me I
don't actually use that as this is why
you tripping me out and so we can
actually do slide to unlock now
ubiquitous so I do unlock you band then
but and then we can even do it on your
back so it was a turnaround on my back
yeah yeah so for example like where this
is headed potentially joining to take my
pants off we go I get this to work okay
right so yeah there we go so all right
this a little bit lower i have a little
bit of back pain tonight Yeah right
there is perfect there's rocky press
really hard on your slide doma okay
right is it so literally we use any
surface available and it's a slide to
unlock supposed to make you sexually
aroused is that saturday all right
that's very cool
gets cut very cool just turn around here
let me just uh Andy Wilson everyone Andy
Wilson and his and
and we never we never did come up with
it we never did come up with a name for
this huh gonna call it the sex machine
that cool sure Annie thanks so much I
stick around guys we have a video Paul
took to the streets and asked people
about what they wanted from sci-fi
technology and there's a really one
great interview in this video that I
want you to take note of really smart
awesome dude so check it out Annie
thanks again thanks we're in union
square right now and we're going to ask
people what's sci-fi gadget do they most
want in their real life I think it's the
Minority Report touchscreen josh thinks
it's a teleportation Michael Shane
thinks it's you sniff pairs is that's
what I don't know Joshua Topolsky oh hey
I but I'm convinced people are gonna
save Minority Report David told you to
say that I noticed an acceptor we're
gonna find out regular people are gonna
find out right now we're gonna say
teleporter what gadget from sci-fi would
you most want in your real life
teleportation machine teleporter I need
the transporter from Star Trek but how
to say teleport a time for taste
convenient everybody's saying teleport a
bunch of lazy people yeah communicator I
would love a communicator yeah so you're
able to speak to everyone and like sort
of break down walls that they have I
loved the Jetsons okay and I loved when
she got up in the morning and she was
ready in five seconds because the
machine came over her maybe some sort of
device that would take my thoughts and
put it on paper the quick quotes quill I
think it was what it's called I would
want to fly who doesn't look like sure
would it be a jet pack or just be like a
super natural innate ability um I think
a jet pack would be cool something that
would subliminally reduce happiness just
that if you wanted it you requested it
you got it this is me happy right now
the awesome picture I'll do a drawing of
you guys it's the future draw me in the
future where I'm happy you're not happy
now well I'm so miserable where would
you go right now got so far that's a
good idea what if if you had a
teleporter then you had like an hour of
nausea after every time you teleporter
that's fine you're sick or well it's
better than six hours of nausea on a
plane isn't it yeah but that's like
lower plane bird maybe the gadgets
within you you know maybe your are you a
gadget what no I'm human being but this
turn gadget being a mechanism to produce
something is uh I told within ourselves
you know I guess I think of technology
is like gadgets like watches and wxga
touchscreen so bad for me I think people
are just people just want their lives to
be better they want to love each other
they want to be in Hawaii right now they
want to end slavery of the mind and I am
literally
and I think that's pretty awesome but I
still want a hoverboard Josh teleporter
teleporter that's what I want you're
here for ISIL Shane says he wants a
holodeck percents
that's pretty good my dear nice Paul
Neil I everyone
just let me be let me be crystal clear
okay Paul ramp to me on the street I was
walking to the office and he said what
technology people want from science
fiction and their real lives I said
teleporter I was utterly said everyone
is going to say teleporter everybody
wants the teleporter out every ball
would not listen to me he fought with me
there were some fisticuffs anyhow
screwed up knee light we don't know what
I just want to point out I was right I
knee like we don't we don't have you
ever seen would you want the great Mel
Gibson science fiction film what women
want I figured I'd of guy I really
thought here's a battlefield earth which
is actively we should all everybody
should watch it right now no like if I
could read mine so be great you want to
read mine yeah earlier I thought we
talked about that before and you said
you wanted an invisibility cloak yeah
then I thought about which is I think a
very creepy thing to want would you I
just want to be able to be invisible
like why for what reason can you think
of any reason is it heinous to be
invisible huh think of one reason that
is not diabolical to be invisible you
could you can't rob a bank Linus I vote
is you're high you're so shy um but I
eyes are from Baltimore hide from
Voldemort is that what you said that's
like a user like a real consumer me I
mean do you have to drag us see the
harry potter talk edited with every
conversation you would you would want
not to be invisible which is gross i was
thinking about it but to read we need to
read people's mind wouldn't it be great
to like just also girl i get a keynote
event and like like really know what
Phil Schiller is thinking like he's like
God the foot weird used for cuz what I
was going I was just think about all the
places I go where people tell me one
thing I know that they're thinking or
believing something else like she's
thinking like crap it just has a bigger
screen
like that's probably when he's like
x-ray icons yeah see I would go to a
lien or not by would go to apple before
yeah the announcement mm-hmm and I would
use it to read the minds of the people
who are working there yeah and then I
write a story about yeah and Paul what
would you like for what would your be
you know what would your science fiction
invention be if you could have in real
life I just wish I could I was at a time
machine so I could go back in time and
when you said like everybody's gonna
want teleporters like i would say i
would have listened to you because you
know because you're my boss and you're
my friend and and you don't lie to me
you're trying to help me you were trying
to tell me the truth true I don't like
were you doing this I'm in the middle of
something very weird oh I also want to
have hoverboard yeah everyone oh okay
fine oh the shoes that man what the
shoes that what Marty McFly she's always
were a race of them so alright okay
alright okay are we done with this thank
you for acknowledging around how just
how deeply wrong you were yeah I
appreciate that okay so we have I just
turned this card over here we have one
thing one other thing that we're doing
tonight that is a something we haven't
done before and it's kind of a big deal
like the snorgtees girl nobody knows
what I'm talking about let me let me
explain we'll never we're never gonna
get through this unless I explain
there's a company called snorgtees what
there's a company called snorgtees and
there was a period on the internet where
every site that I went to there would be
a ad on the side that had a picture of a
girl and it was like snorgtees and she
was wearing shorts said I'm kind of a
big deal yeah and so now whenever I
system is a big deal I in my mind see
the little banner ad of the store tease
you know what some things you just
should keep to yourself yeah yes that's
a weave I think you said we'll never get
through this and less like unless I I
think we would have gotten through fine
anyway okay so so here's here's here's
here's the thing we're gonna show you a
video of
of the three of us driving around New
York in a car and then and then I'm
gonna tell you something kind of awesome
so watch this new york is an amazing
place and I definitely don't spend
enough time doing things so we're gonna
take the Ford Focus Electric out and see
what we can do in New York on a single
charge this whole car is basically a
gigantic video game I believe Paul will
do the best at not only winning the
video game but surviving the video game
I'm trying to drive much more
efficiently than I'm sure nialaya and
Josh are driving I'm sure they're just
doing doughnuts so there's a lot of cool
information in this dashboard what the
most important thing is the butterflies
the butterflies represent how efficient
your being and I'm gonna be the most
efficient I'm thinking we're pretty
close to the Guggenheim this is the most
incredible pretzel I've ever had so
where should we go next you know the
best part about a car like this is the
smug sense of superiority I'm actively
saving the earth Keith left onto Maurice
Avenue all right Denise let's go save
some baby pandas oh my god what is
happening ahead of us film this my God
look at all those motorcycle errs what
is going on this cars the future
and this car is very clearly the past
it's an electric car we're test driving
an electric is all electric this car
okay yeah we're at Prospect Park right
now you take a little breather and
regroup please say a command call Paul
Miller what do you think your car's name
would be like um like little buddy
little buddy you have a very different
lationship for the car than I do fine
her name is Denise and you gonna make it
funny right yeah spent the day driving
down to thirty percent of the battery 26
miles left to go that's ivette still
just one butterfly but I'm coming for
you in the ill I I'm coming please say a
command good bye Denise goodbye forever
and this trip has inspired me to see
more I'm gonna latch my teeth on to this
city like that like a vampire onto the
neck of its victim and I'm going to suck
and suck until the city is drained and
when I'm done I will fly away like a bat
it's in the form of a bat
yes ah so I know you're thinking why why
are they driving around in the Ford
Focus Electric we were test driving the
car for you not you guys here just don't
get too excited we're giving away a Ford
Focus Electric yeah to a reader of the
verge it's a forty thousand dollar car I
just can I be clear it's very expensive
and actually does short is giving us one
drive it well to give away and here's
how we're doing it we're gonna hold a
contest whoever can catch the most
butterfat no ash mail us actual bodies
of butter we are going to have a gif off
a gif gif away yeah or Jeff if you're
from Canada uh we when this goes up
here's we're gonna do we want people to
make hilarious gifts out of the show
this show and post them and then the
editors of the verge will pick a winner
whoever made the funniest gift we are so
vain yeah we're extremely vain and then
that person will win that person will
drive away in that car we're making it
easier for the game material you bake
let me explain you could be creative you
can do whatever you want it's just gonna
be based on the show and the winner is
chosen by the editors of the verge we'll
drive away a fly way in the form of a
bat in but also in a Ford Focus Electric
which like they're not even out yet so
uh so yeah we're giving away a car which
is the most expensive thing by far we've
ever given away we don't have to have a
raffle and we don't have to have a
refugee sorry but everybody here's like
you're gonna raffle it off right now
right I have like a wanted 150 chance of
putting it uh and that's our show now
that's our entire show i want to thank
Andy Wilson Paul O'Neill I obviously and
you guys for being here thank you so
much and of course our sponsor forward
for giving us a car that's pretty cool
thanks so much we'll be back next month</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
