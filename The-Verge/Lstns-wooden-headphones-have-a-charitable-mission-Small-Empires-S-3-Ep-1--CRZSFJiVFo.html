in 2013 they make headphones with
handmade wooden backs and they spend a
portion of the revenue helping charities
by hearing aids for people who can't
afford them that sort of social mission
used to be rare but it's becoming more
common and something called social
enterprise and in a world where most
startups fail it creates even more
challenges for young companies trying to
get off the ground so can a company like
listen actually survive and compete with
giants like beats and bows when they're
spending money on social causes instead
of billboards so I was working in the
music industry and that was here in Los
Angeles at the time I was like really
into all of these social enterprise
companies like toms or Warby Parker that
had just started and I realized that
there was nothing music related in
social enterprise coincidentally at the
same time I saw a video of a woman
hearing for the first time it was just a
really great lightbulb moment of like oh
this is what I want to do with my life
so basing a brand on social
entrepreneurship it's tricky it's
thought that's a it's a tricky prospect
listen is an audio company that makes
high quality headphones and speakers out
of real wood we actually started the
company to fund a charity called Starkey
Hearing Foundation and for every
purchase that somebody makes they're
also helping somebody here for the first
time is it possible for a brand like
listen to take on this huge monster like
beats no it's not the headphone market
is crazy now it's something like a ten
billion dollar industry a year and it's
growing essentially headphones I mean
it's just shorthand for like look you
know I'm cool I don't think that's the
game they're gonna win no they're never
gonna you know have 90% of the market
share and in beats is oh it's gonna be
the monster in the room or whatever
comes next it's hugely funded getting
into big-box retail is definitely been a
struggle for us so far somewhere like a
target or a Best Buy like beats and Bose
collectively probably have 80 to 90% of
the real estate in the store so all of
the other brands are
p-ting for that you know 10 to 20
percent in the store which is a very
tough fight but it's it's worth fighting
when we started we had no capital it was
just you know me in my apartment and
trying to figure out how to make a
prototype of headphones from basically
nothing I took 10 grand loan from a
friend and basically went to China and
worked with this factory that I had
found on Alibaba I tried to do
Kickstarter but they actually denied us
because we had a charitable part of our
company builds a simple website on
Shopify took some photos of the only
pair of headphones that we had some
producer from the Today Show it actually
seen it somehow they ended up putting it
on the show and then you know tons of
people went to the website in order but
we didn't have any stock like we
literally just had like one pair of
headphones so that was quite an
experience they had to wait quite a long
time longer than they were expecting so
we ended up having to talk to every
single customer you know like and then
when they finally came in we wrote like
handwritten sorry notes basically to all
of them the biggest early challenge
listen faced was scaling up they'd made
one pair of headphones and had consumer
demand but now they needed to start
manufacturing at scale finding retail
partners and actually selling headphones
to customers I met Joe around the same
time they actually got introduced to him
through a mutual friend it was kind of a
perfect match like between my marketing
and music background and with his
logistics and social enterprise
background I'd started a small little
clothing company with a friend of mine
some friends asked if we would help ship
their product out of that space and we
said sure of course you know gotta help
our friends up so cut to a few days
later some more friends hey heard you're
helping so and so do this and one of the
brands that we helped launch was TOMS
shoes that's a big part of also my
understanding of social enterprise we
officially launched in April 2013
definitely a crazy time starting a
company
it's very stressful I didn't sleep very
much there's a huge learning curve like
I didn't really know how to manufacture
anything or how to get into retail I
think the biggest hurdle in the journey
of listen so far is really just
competing with these huge huge companies
seeing how we can kind of like hack the
system with press and with our story if
we had started with something like a
speaker a record player it wouldn't
really have worked because our whole
business is based on people telling
other people about the story they
Instagram it they put it on Facebook
they tell their friends like I just got
an awesome product that also helps
somebody else
our first retailer was actually Whole
Foods which is interesting because we
are like their first electronics they've
ever carried that following Christmas we
actually got into Nordstrom probably our
biggest account along with Birchbox and
Brooks done so it's been a pretty crazy
ride when you go into a space that's
dominated by billion-dollar companies
with this like I've got my heart on my
sleeve like we're gonna go and see if
the world there's a lot to overcome
I think there's been criticism around
social enterprise people don't believe
that it's real and then it comes from
the heart
it wasn't an afterthought of like oh we
should do a charitable component like
this company never would have started
without Starkey the Starkey foundation
travels the world and gives those in
need hearing aids people that might have
not ever heard before or maybe they're
just having struggles with their hearing
the reference point in social enterprise
is still Tom's it's the only real
gigantic success story that means that
most people still don't even know what
social enterprise is we're not the
charity or charities or whoever we work
with we actually have the ability to be
you know relatively dynamic we can
collaborate with other organizations to
maximize the effect I mean it doesn't
really matter if it's playing on your
heartstrings a sincere you know move on
your part or on their part I don't think
it really does matter if some of that
money is going back to do good then
doesn't really matter how they're
getting it from you
I think when people choose
listen over other brands billion dollar
brands for example they're choosing to
say something like positive about
themselves and saying that they not only
care about great design and sound but
also care about you know more than
themselves you know how things are made
where they're made
where did the proceeds go you know
things like that and it's super
important in the market right now if
you're wearing you know listen and
you're wearing where we Parker and Tom's
and brands like that I think it's very
important to consumers to advertise that
they care about other people and not
just yourself I mean do people want to
buy this too broadcasts hey I'm a good
person I'm giving back sure certainly I
mean there's always people that want to
do that I think that for social
enterprise to really work and to take
away any doubt you have to make it a
product that people already want that
they were already gonna buy and make it
a quality product that there's no risk
make it risk-free
I think brands with stories are really
that's where it's at right now people
want to be heading back to a more
boutique type of thing it's a
one-of-a-kind thing which is kind of
brilliant to make it a cool sleek
product to make it something that says
hey I'm a good person and I'm a
different kind of person I'm different
than the rest of them that's thick I
mean that's you've hit the mark listen
is making a real impact and that's why
our customers are so behind us with the
headphones off the ground listen is now
investing in new product lines and
growing the company it's an expansion
that will force listen in a competition
with a whole new set of deep pocketed
rivals so we just changed our name from
listen headphones to listen sound
company because we're putting out a ton
of new products the last six months
we've been really focused on product
development like speakers and ear plugs
and kind of figuring out the next step
for listen so we could not only compete
with the bigger brands but also give our
customers who loved us like the
opportunity to have more
from us I think these kind of brands
can't stick out their own little corner
to buy this little special boutique
brand I think there's always a place for
that is it gonna be for the major
populace is it gonna be the big place no
they're not gonna beat beats at that
game but you know what is there always a
place for that and can they survive I
think they totally can yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
