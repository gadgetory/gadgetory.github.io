half an hour I was someone else I was a
woman I was a stranger I stared down at
the clay mask I heard him her hands
struggling to comprehend how those hands
which would clearly not mine were
allowing me to feel its curves and
cracks as I glanced at the mirror in
front of me
my new lip piercing glimmered under a
harsh fluorescent lights this is not a
video game
this was the machine to be another we're
always finding new ways to connect with
one another email and text messages
Twitter and Facebook Instagram and
whatsapp and with every passing year
keeping in contact with friends near and
far becomes easier the concept of
telepresence of virtually being
somewhere that you're not it's been the
driving force behind this march of
progress surgeon can perform operations
remotely business deals are hammered out
opposite sides of oceans and millions of
us use Skype and other services every
day to be my faces across the world
however this presence is generally a one
dimensional experience remote
interaction for the most part there's
limited the sight and sound or dream of
true telephony still eludes us I visited
Fab Lab in Barcelona a small scale
workshop offering tools and teachings in
the areas of architecture engineering
and computer aided design the specific
team I met be another lab focused on
experiential telephones demos that
promote empathy Parliament's and
self-understanding by showing you the
world from another person's perspective
the experiment I tried is called the
machine to be a mother and it's
disorienting after being carefully
positioned I close my eyes and listen to
a voice paid for a pair of headphones my
voice was Norma a 29 year old
anthropologist from Germany who's
wearing a camera hooked up to my head
as I opened my eyes I was staring at the
same room but from a different
perspective my hands look like Norma's
but they still appear to obey my every
command one of the artists from being La
Follette approached me and shook Norma's
hand and I felt her the experiment
continued as a series of objects which
wore it out for each of us first a mask
then a cigarette tin and then finally
America
I could feel each object with my own
hands while seeing it through Norma's
perspective as I inspected each object I
started to believe what I was seeing
with reality Norma's voice was still
being piped into my head but with a
constant sentry bombardment I had no
time to think and her voice became my
stream of consciousness the demo finally
ended with me standing face to face with
myself shaking hands through simple
means the machine to be another shows
what I might be like however be another
live stream isn't telecommuting or
robotics or anything like that this was
to make us understand and care about one
another the another lab has investigated
the issue of identity and perspective of
a massively popular experimental gender
swap which as the name suggests lets
male and female participants what
buddies but also empower people to do
things that would otherwise be
impossible like connecting a disabled
ballerina with a surrogate dancer who
expressed their dance outside the
confines of a wheelchair the team is
constantly looking for new collaborators
from both the art and science fields and
it believes a little empathy and
understanding would be enough to truly
change the world
the experiments unofficial motto sums up
be another labs ambitions perfectly you
could better understand each other
could you better understand yourself if
you could see the world for the eyes of
the other could it make a better world
to live in</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
