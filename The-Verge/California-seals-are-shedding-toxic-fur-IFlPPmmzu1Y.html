marine creatures playing with beach
balls reeling the ice are just generally
blubbering about but could kissing a
seal kill you
researchers have traced methyl mercury a
particularly toxic form of mercury found
in some California coastal waters to
elephant seal fur and humans mercury
poisoning causes nervous system
disorders kidney damage even death
so are your dreams of a real-life
recreation of this kiss sunk well for
starters that's a sea lion and this
study's about elephant seals but suppose
you really wanted to kiss a seal what
are the risks methyl mercury can be
transferred from skin-to-skin contact or
if you're into it seal kissing but
chronic toxic concentration occur in
humans at about 10 micrograms per gram
study found these seals carrying 3.1 to
4.5 micrograms per gram dry weight and
they're molded fur but basically because
an individual seal doesn't have toxic
levels of methyl mercury in their skin
there's no way that making out with one
could kill you so go ahead kiss all the
seals you want well maybe not they're
still pretty dangerous and you're not
off the hook yet for over two decades
scientists have puzzled over these
annual mercury spikes along the
California coastline now that they trace
the mercury to the elephant seal there
are a lot more questions and let's be
clear these elephant seals have a lot of
mercury in their fur and it's leeching
out during their molting season toxicity
in the surrounding water jumps to 17
times normal levels so how these seals
getting so hyped up on mercury major
sources of mercury pollution in the u.s.
include coal-fired power plants boilers
steel production cement plants and
incinerators a lot of mercury is pumped
in the air and falls into the ocean as
deposits in rain or snow and then you've
got the point sources like industrial
and mining waste that straight up dumped
mercury into the ocean once the mercury
gets into the ocean tiny microbes
convert it into methyl mercury a
neurotoxin easily absorbed by animals
when they Chowdown on those microbes as
it moves up the food chain the methyl
mercury accumulates and increasingly
large quantities and then proceeded to
just stick around because mercury
doesn't break down easily this is why
you see all those warnings for pregnant
women on tuna fish cans out in the open
seas mercury accumulates and a lot of
fish that humans and seals like to eat
now the study has shown us a mechanism
for bringing that neurotoxin back to
shore from the open ocean potentially
introducing more ecosystems and speedy
three dangerous chemicals we don't know
what kind of affect that much mercury
will have on these seals or how much
this murky leeching will be infiltrating
human food sources but knowing about the
mercury in seal fur that it's in such
high concentrations and affecting
ecosystems is worrisome to say the least
so kissing a seal won't kill you but
it's probably worth us doing something
about all that mercury and the best way
to reduce that mercury in the
environment toxifying are seals cutting
emissions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
