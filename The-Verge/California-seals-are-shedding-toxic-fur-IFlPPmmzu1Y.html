marine creatures playing with beach
balls really in the ice are just
generally blubbering about but could
kissing a seal kill you researchers have
traced methyl mercury a particularly
toxic form of mercury found in some
California coastal waters to elephant
seal fur in humans mercury poisoning
causes nervous system disorders kidney
damage even death so are your dreams of
a real life recreation of this kiss sunk
well for starters that's a sea lion and
this study's about elephant seals but
suppose you really wanted to kiss a seal
what are the risks methyl mercury can be
transferred from skin to skin contact or
if you're into it seal kissing but
chronic toxic concentrations occur in
humans at about 10 micrograms per gram
study found these seals carrying three
point one to four point five micrograms
for gram dry weight and they're molded
fur but basically because an individual
seal doesn't have toxic levels of methyl
mercury in their skin there's no way
that making out with one could kill you
so go ahead kiss all the seals you want
well maybe not they're still pretty
dangerous and you're not off the hook
yet for over two decades scientists have
puzzled over these annual mercury spikes
along the California coastline now that
they trace the mercury to the elephant
seal there are a lot more questions and
let's be clear these elephant seals have
a lot of mercury in their fur and it's
leeching out during their molting season
toxicity in the surrounding water jumps
to 17 times normal levels so how these
seals getting so hyped up on mercury
major sources of mercury pollution in
the u.s. include coal-fired power plants
boilers steel production cement plants
and incinerators a lot of mercury is
pumped in the air and falls in the ocean
as deposits in rain or snow and then
you've got the point sources like
industrial and mining waste that
straight up dump mercury into the ocean
once the mercury gets into the ocean
tiny microbes convert it into methyl
mercury a neurotoxin easily absorbed by
animals when they chow down on those
microbes as it moves up the food chain
the methyl mercury accumulates in
increasingly large quantities and then
proceeded to just stick around because
mercury doesn't break down easily this
is why you see all those warnings for
pregnant women on tuna fish cans out in
the open seas mercury accumulates at a
lot of fish that humans and seals like
to eat now the study has shown us a
mechanism for bringing that neurotoxin
back to shore from the open ocean
potentially introducing more ecosystems
and species to a dangerous chemical we
don't know what kind of effect that much
mercury will have on these seals or how
much this Murphy leaching will be
implicating human food sources but
knowing about the mercury in seal fur
that it's in such high concentrations
and affecting ecosystems is worrisome to
say the least
so kissing a seal won't kill you but
it's probably worth us doing something
about all that mercury and the best way
to reduce that mercury in the
environment toxify our seals cutting
emissions</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
