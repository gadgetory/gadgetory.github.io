you're taking a look at the new HTC ten
this is HCC's new flagship phone for
2016 it's a very obvious successor to
last year's m9 and a nine kind of blends
the design of those two phones together
much like every one of HTC's flagship
phones for the past couple of years the
10 has a full metal unibody design
really has a ton of metal here there's
only a little bit of plastic for antenna
bands at the top and these stripes on
the back one thing that HTC is done
different this year is this massive
chamfered edge which has a different
kind of finish than the matte finish of
the back but otherwise it feels and
looks pretty similar to last year's
phones as well around front we've got a
5.2 inch quad HD display this is a new
Super LCD panel that HTC says has 30%
more color than its prior panels it's
very bright and vibrant and sharp of
course kind of what you'd expect for a
screen in 2016 below that there's a
fingerprint home's button as well as
fingerprint scanners so you can wake the
phone up and unlock it right with that
and you can see next to it that there
are now capacitive buttons HTC has
returned to this design after a few
years of using on-screen buttons one of
the things that HTC is long struggled
with is the camera and of course this
year they're promising that it's much
better the new camera is a 12 megapixel
ultra pixel camera so it has larger
pixels it's got a 1.8 aperture lens as
well as optical image stabilization dual
LED flash true tone type the flash as
well as a second generation laser
autofocus system also around front the
new camera up top is a 5 megapixel unit
it 2 also has an F 1.8 aperture lens as
well as optical image stabilization
which is a HDC says is the first phone
with an optically image image stabilized
front camera so that's pretty unique
it's supposed to improve your selfies
there one thing that this phone doesn't
have from last year is front-facing
speakers you might notice that the
speaker port on the bottom here is for
the main speaker which handles a lot of
your base frequencies HTC's also says it
put a tweeter up top with a supper amp
for both of them so it's supposed to
have a very high output as well as great
range and she si says that the
10 is an HD audio or hi-fi audio
certified phone so it'll have better
range and output as far as software goes
it's running Android 6.0 marshmallow as
well as with HTC's interface on top
HTC says it's done a lot to reduce the
number of redundant apps here as you can
see it's using Google's calendar HTC's
mail app Google's Play Music app Google
Photos instead of HTC's old galleries so
that it reduces the number of duplicate
apps that you have of course this being
an unlock model though that will likely
change when carriers get their hands on
it but otherwise the interface is very
similar to Google's Nexus interface very
stock like here it's probably one of the
most stock like interfaces that HTC has
ever produced there's very little bit of
HTC's customization there
the HTC ten is powered by a Snapdragon
820 processor it's also got four
gigabytes of RAM so it's certainly the
higher-end processor that you'd expect
from a premium phone in 2016 inside is
32 gigabytes of memory there is a micro
SD card slot for expansion as well other
unique features this year USB C charger
its quick charge 3.0 compatible inside
it's got a 3000 milliamp hour battery
the HTC claims up to 2 hours of battery
life on which is a really long time for
this size of phone HTC says that this
will be priced around a flagship phone
price so you can expect this to be at
least $600 or so probably even a little
bit more to be available on all of the
major carriers in the US and it should
be hitting shelves very soon stay tuned
we're going to have much more on the HTC
10 including a full review in the near
future thanks for watching we are really
