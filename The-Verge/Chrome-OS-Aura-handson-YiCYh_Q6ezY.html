a samsung series 5 Chromebook it has the
latest development version of Chrome OS
on it this is the aura update a lot of
UI changes a lot of new ways this thing
works so let's dive in and take a look
so the biggest change here is actually
this desktop environment you can see
there's a desktop background older
versions of Chrome OS just let you see a
chrome window but now you have these
icons at the bottom these quick links
you've got a little control panel over
here lets you change volume brightness
change your Wi-Fi stuff pop open the
main settings window if you need it
there's also this launcher UI which is a
lot like what's going on a lion these
are all just bookmarks the web and it's
pretty much just chrome you can open
chrome we can try to open the verge
chrome Wes still doesn't support Typekit
so the verge doesn't look great but it
loads because there's window management
now I can move this window around there
are some windows seven style window
management features so I dragged it over
here I can snap it I can make it
fullscreen if I want like that there's
also this kind of interesting new
scratch pad app which connects to google
doc so you can see it's a nap it's just
a little app over here and if i go back
if i open docs proper as you can see
there's now a scratch pad folder and i
can see this note that i just made in
scratch pad so it's cool it's a little
floating app over the top of everything
else it's kind of the one non chrome tab
interface environment that's here but
it's pretty interesting that connects to
google docs so that's it that is the
Chrome OS or interface on a samsung
series 5 Chromebook
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
