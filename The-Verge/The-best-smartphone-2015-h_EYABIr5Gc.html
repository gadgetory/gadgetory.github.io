most important gadget in your life it's
a single portable portal for information
entertainment communication navigation
gains photos and oh so much more there's
a reason we pick these things up
hundreds of times a day and stare at
them for hours at a time so if your
smartphone is so important in your life
it's smart to get the best smartphone
you can get compromise in one area or
another and you're looking at hours of
frustration over the two years or so you
might use the phone a great smartphone
should have a great display fast
performance a great camera reliable
battery life the best apps and great
support for when something goes wrong or
you just need a little help the smart
phone race is closer than ever which is
a great thing because it's becoming
harder and harder to buy a bad phone but
if you want the phone that's going to
give you the fewest headaches over the
next two years there's one that stands
out the Apple iPhone success is the one
to buy it doesn't matter if you get the
smaller success or the larger success
plus you're going to get an incredibly
well built and capable smartphone with
no real drawbacks the display is sharp
and vibrant the processor is wicked fast
and the camera takes tremendous photos
Apple's app ecosystem is still the
strongest around if you ever have any
trouble with your phone the company
support is second to none a lot of
people will be really happy with the 4.7
inch iPhone 6s the power users might
want to consider the iPhone 6s plus it's
bigger yes but it also has a larger
battery and a bigger display makes
everything more immersive both phones
have fast and reliable fingerprint
scanners and support Apple pay and when
you go looking for a case dock charger
or some other accessory you'll find the
widest selection available for the
iPhone but if you don't want to buy an
iPhone that's fine there's never been a
better time to buy an Android phone and
the best of the bunch is Google's Nexus
6p the 6p has a great display great
camera fast performance and simple clean
software without any garbage from the
carriers the 6p will also get the latest
and greatest Android updates before any
other phone it's only available for
purchase unlocked and direct from Google
but it works just fine with every major
carrier in the US the Nexus 6p is a big
phone but if you want the best Android
phone you can buy you just kind of have
to deal with a big phone every other
smaller option whether it's samsung's
galaxy s6
HCC's 189 or google's own
XS 5 X makes compromises in one way or
another that lessen the experience
compared to the 6p there are other big
phones that are excellent too like
Samsung's Galaxy Note 5 it's even
slightly better than the Nexus 6p in a
handful of ways it has a better screen
better camera and comes with a stylus
but the note 5 is a lot more expensive
and we don't think that the extra money
you spend for it over the 6p is
justified unlike the iPhone which only
comes at one premium price
there's a whole array of Android phones
up and down the price spectrum such as
Motorola's Moto X or the oneplus 2 but
the money you save with those models
over the Nexus 6p isn't that huge
and when a device is as important as
your smartphone it's worth spending a
little more to ensure the best
experience so there you go
if you're buying a smart phone you
should buy the iPhone 6s or the Nexus 6p
there's never been a better time to buy
a smart phone and you can't do better
than either of those</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
