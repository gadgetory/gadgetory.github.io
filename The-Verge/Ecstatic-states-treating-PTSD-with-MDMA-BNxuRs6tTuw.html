to be anything that's going to take away
your PTSD because every time you start
talking about all this and we've been
talking about in this room my fucking
memory banks just start getting one back
it right I had to live with it for such
a long time and I try to wash it out of
my mind
I tried fucking everything well okay
that's nothing that you're going to
forget I got in the army when I was 19
and 1964 and has it in country and 65
and 66 Vietnam as a helicopter mechanic
more like best friend I saw him
decapitated by helicopter blade and that
one that was the one that got me
I think that's 22 when I got out you
know I knew something was not right
emotionally I couldn't put my finger on
it
PTSD is basically a collection of
symptoms that happen to people after a
traumatic event such as sexual abuse
rape war accidents that kind of thing
and it can be really debilitating for
people there's a significant instance of
suicide and there's a lot of suffering
and disability that comes from living
with that someone described PTSD is like
having a big broken heart and I think a
pretty good description you bury those
emotions that make you human well
historically the treatments weren't
terribly effective um a lot of
supportive counseling a lot of groups
discussing feelings and what's far
better is treatments that involve
exposure depending on what literature
you look at probably around half the
people are not well served
there's also pharmacology Zoloft and
paxil and other medications kind of help
to decrease the intensity of symptoms
like anxiety but they don't tend to get
at the root of the problem and really
or cure the disorder I got to the point
where I study drugs I just put him in a
big bag and throw away said I I don't
want to be drugged for the rest of my
life
that was kind of fast a desperate I just
want to do something friend of mine who
committed suicide I was just tired of
kind of carrying the baggage and I saw
this clip on CNN this is the place where
we do the study this is where we meet
with people and then this is where we do
the MDMA sessions intense psychotherapy
including eight-hour sessions after
taking a capsule of MDMA of ecstasy MDMA
is methylene dioxide and that amine it
produces a reduction of activity in the
amygdala the fear processing part of the
brain it enhances activity in the
frontal cortex where people put things
in context it releases oxytocin and
prolactin which are hormones of bonding
and affiliation and love and the
remarkable thing that we've learned
about memory is that when you remember
something you have to reconsolidate the
memory you're basically recreating the
memory so that if this memory is linked
to fear and under the influence of MDMA
you can bring back the memory but the
fear response is dampened down then when
you reconsolidate the memory it doesn't
have that fear to it and you've been
able to put it in context as then and
not now
well it's certainly understandable that
people don't necessarily realize that
this can be a potential therapeutic tool
and a lot of people don't know the
history most people don't understand
that MDMA really began as a therapy drug
in the middle 70s and early 80s and then
from that some people realize that they
could make a lot of money selling it in
more recreational settings and more
public settings and so it was just
inevitable that there would be a
crackdown the conclusion of the
administrative law judge the
did the DA hearings was that it did have
medical utility and it should be in
schedule three meaning you can't sell it
in bars but doctors can use it and the
DEA administrator overruled that and put
it in Schedule one anyway and I felt it
was important that we look into this
further no no control research had been
done we designed a study in which people
would have eight-hour
all-day sessions with me and Annie in
which we give them MDMA and then spend
the day with them helping them process
what came up I had a very chaotic
childhood and because of that I was
exposed to you know a lot of random
abuse sexual abuse as a child I had a
lot of symptoms I was anxious I had
sleeplessness I had vomiting irritable
bowels but I didn't get any real medical
attention until I was like 22 no
psychotherapy cognitive behavioral
therapy rapid eye movement therapy drugs
and medication anything that came
through I would try it with complete
abandon and it seemed like the more I
tried I would uncover more and more
stuff we'd come up to the surface and
then I it would start to just get worse
the first study was inactive placebo
compared to MDMA so some people got
inactive placebo with all the same
therapy the same all day sessions the
exact same approach
I got placebo so I was not changed even
though this was the best of the best of
the best I knew that I could come back
and I would be getting the medicine two
months later
now that
when everything changed well in our
first study basically in a nutshell 25%
of the people that got the therapy with
placebo were basically free from PTSD at
the end compared to 83 percent with MDMA
so 83 percent no longer met criteria for
PTSD there's thing called a cap score
that rates how sick you are after this
last treatment he didn't we did my caps
evaluation I came back for the two-month
follow-up to do the caps to see what the
results of it were and he comes back and
sits down he says Rachel you don't have
post-traumatic stress disorder anymore
you don't have it when I first heard
about the studies I signed up right away
and it's like I got to thinking about I
mean it was like 2,400 miles and
logistics there's cost involved then I
broke it down I said well when I got
ecstasy a therapist
hell I live next to college town it's a
no-brainer you know the treatments that
are that are sold to us at the VA are
are high in number and varied in
legitimacy and MDMA is one of them if a
veteran said listen I saw this on CNN
and this is something I really want to
do why aren't you offering it it might
work but we don't have the data to
support that this was my own thing you
know what they were doing was 2,400
miles away I said I've got to deal with
what I have and I didn't have any
compunction about it whatsoever
fortunately I had a friend of mine son
he'd met some guy in Sacramento who's
going down to Los Angeles to score a big
bunch and I was able to get some and it
worked out beautifully
the first time I did is like it's just a
blanket of warmth of glowing I just like
felt alive again in touch with my
feelings and stuff and music music was
incredible
under the influence
and after I did the first first session
by myself I just like I felt a
noticeable noticeable difference
then I get touch to the somebody new as
a therapist explain to him what I was
trying to do and then I did three
three-hour sessions and it was
extraordinary I mean it just like you
know I did what three sessions I
couldn't do in 34 years well right now
we're in what the FDA calls phase two
which is a number of small studies and
then hopefully in a couple years we'll
be able to move on to Phase three which
means two to three hundred people each
in multiple sites and you need two of
those two that apply to FDA for approval
as an indication as a treatment if it
keeps going well what we think is going
to happen is it would be approved not
that you can give a prescription people
can pick it up at the pharmacy but that
it can be would be approved for use in
specially licensed clinics last year the
VA spent around five and a half billion
dollars on disability payments for over
275,000 vets they perceive this as a
crisis there's 22 vets on average
meeting suicide every day so while the
VA has certain therapies that they've
developed there's a pretty strong
awareness that there's a substantial
number of people for whom these
therapies do not work the best
treatments are cognitive processing
therapy and prolonged exposure we know
that these work it's hard to then say
okay now that we've finally got
something that is very effective in 65
to 80 percent of cases let's try a
far-out type of treatment
if somebody were to come along with a
treatment that has a lower side effect
profile lower attrition same effect size
easier to do well then we'll do that
would I fear though and what I don't
like to see and what basically just
pisses me off is when people forego the
effective evidence-based treatments for
the peripheral type treatments that
don't have any real evidence they don't
have a great outcome and then they give
up on any treatment and that bothers me
a lot that does happen sometimes the
real issue is does this help people or
not and if it does if they're suffering
from PTSD and this is a tool that can
help them we should develop it and even
though there's a short-term cost that
some people will seek it out on their
own and may find impure drugs or not be
sufficiently supported that's not a
reason not to develop it into a medicine
in effect it's a reason to develop it as
quickly as possible there is so much
enthusiasm from medical students
residents young therapists that are
interested in this field I mean just in
the last four years I think the amount
of enthusiasm and people wanting to do
this and open to it has really changed
it's funny I tell people about this and
you know veterans is stuff like that and
it just it goes right over their head
and then they don't understand it but
you know just I sure did I picked up on
right away and you know wouldn't start
the word gets out I think things will
change
so what's X what are they treating
almost now that you're staying with you
well they're looking at using MDMA to
cure PTSD basically that six is a cure
of another to be fun there is a it is
there is a cure
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
