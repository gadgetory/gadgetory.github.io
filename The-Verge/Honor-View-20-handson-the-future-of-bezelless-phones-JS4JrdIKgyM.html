- In 2018, bad notches happened
to good Android phones.
But in 2019, the notch will be succeeded
by the hole-punch camera,
such as on the brand-new
Honor View 20, which I have in my hands.
This is my first experience
with the hole-punch display,
and I've got to tell you, it's no where near
as bad as the notch and, in fact,
I think I'm going to like it.
(upbeat music)
So as I say, this is my very first time
with a hole-punch display in my hands
and the experience compared to my
Google Pixel 3XL is an
absolute revelation.
The massive notch,
the massive cut-out on the
top of the display is gone.
This is honestly as good as it gets.
If you want the camera, it's
going to be as small as this.
So even though this is probably
one of the very first fractured phones
to feature hole-punch display,
it is as optimized as you can get it.
I do love the fact that
you get this clean,
minimal bezel at the top.
Some people will complain about there
still being a chin and there is
a larger bezel at the bottom,
but I'm not one of those people.
I appreciate the fact that this chin exists
because in order to remove it,
the phone will probably cost tons more.
The only people who've
really achieved it
is Apple with the iPhones,
and that's done by folding
the OLED display underneath.
This isn't even an OLED display,
this is an LCD display on this device.
It includes the Kirin
7nm processor
from the Huawei Mate 20 Pro and such.
And also includes quite a
few pieces of Huawei software
such as this wallet,
which includes Huawei Pay.
And this actually
illustrates one of the things:
there'll be quite a few apps
which haven't accounted for
the spot of the hole punch.
But in terms of the
software adapting to this,
most software is already adapted
to not using the very top
of the display anyway.
So I've been looking at things
like calendar, that's fine.
All your notifications and
status cycles, they just shift
to the side of the hole punch.
Most apps are just perfectly fine with it,
gallery, et.
Taking a look at photos,
taking a look at videos,
comparing this to having a
notch is much more discreet,
much more out of sight.
And in fact, if you choose
to use a darker wallpaper,
I'm using a brighter one at the moment
just to demonstrate the
position of the hole punch,
but if you choose to
use a darker wallpaper,
it pretty much disappears.
(upbeat music)
Now, as I say, this is an LCD display,
it has a resolution of 2310 x 1080,
which isn't all that high
given that its 6.4 inches.
But looking at it, it's one
of the better LCD displays.
It can actually be
confused for an OLED display
except for when it's outdoors such as now,
and I've got it at brightness maxed out.
That being said, I think
this is very decent display.
I think Honor has done a terrific job
creating this &quot;V&quot; pattern under the glass
on the back of the phone.
This is the blue version,
but there's also red version
and that one is quite hypnotic,
it's even more impactful.
So it's a pretty design,
it's a handsome design,
there's not much of a huge camera bump.
Honor is still sticking with
having a headphone jack.
It's actually quite a nice package.
You can get this device with
8GB of RAM,
256GB of storage, as
I say, the Kirin 980 processor.
So it's got really good
performance as well
and it's got this absolutely minimal bezel
all around the place.
Oh, also 48-megapixel camera on the back.
I've taken just a couple
of sample photos with this
and it's encouraging, it's promising.
So the View 20, even though it's
already been announced in China,
we'll get a formal
announcement on January 21st
in a big gala event in Paris.
The hole-punch display is
going to be the trend of 2019.
And this being my first
experience and my first look at it,
I have nothing to worry about
and I don't think you
should be worried either.
2019 is going to be a much better year
for smartphone design than 2018.
To keep track of how things do develop
in the mobile world in 2019,
keep track of the verge.com
and youtube.com/the verge.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
