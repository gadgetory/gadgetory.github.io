thing is super thin it's super fancy and
it comes with this great cover I mean I
I just feel smarter already
okay why did you spend nearly three
hundred dollars on a Kindle because I
have the old paper right here and it's
totally fine yeah but this is new and
this one's just a hundred bucks it's
also square and this one's rectangular
which is more like an actual book here's
what you need to know about the new
Kindle it's thinner and lighter than the
previous model it weighs just 4.6 ounces
and it's really comfortable to hold in
one hand especially if you're holding it
on this side okay the paperwhite is a
little bit heavier than that it weighs
around 7 ounces but I can still hold it
comfortably in one hand also like I
mentioned earlier this one's square it
still has a six inch display but it's
crammed into a more compact body I still
don't see what the big deal is with
square it's more ergonomic also it has
physical page turn buttons on the side
here oh yeah well you can just tap on
the screen here to turn pages on this
one yeah new Kindle Oasis lets you do
that too the display on the new Kindle
Oasis has a resolution of 300 PPI or
pixels per inch so does the Kindle
paperwhite
yeah but the Kindle Oasis has 10 LED
lights for brightness and page lighting
consistency what does yours have this
one has 4 LED lights but it still looks
pretty even also when you turn the
Kindle Oasis upside down like this the
page flips with you this one doesn't do
that but your fancy new Kindle over
there still isn't waterproof and it's
called the Oasis I mean they literally
named it after an area of water and it's
not waterproof and it's $300 sorry
did you say something I was reading on
my new Kindle Oasis let's talk about
covers yes let's talk about covers this
cover comes with the new Kindle Oasis
for free
unlike other Kindles and it's super easy
to put on and take off
well this one's really is gonna take off
debut just you just get your nail in
there you go just just pop out the
corner and it clicks there it is it was
too breezy this one even smells good
like actual leather-bound books well
listen that thing is basically a battery
pack disguised as a fancy leather cover
and Amazon says the new Kindle louis's
will get months of battery life but
without the cover it just it gets weeks
of battery life which is just like every
other Kindle so what it's a cool design
and it's a good way to add extra battery
life without adding bulk to the actual
hardware listen the end of the day this
new Kindle Oasis is the Kindle to be
it's smaller it's thin it's light it has
a nice evenly lit display it has
physical buttons here it has a
touchscreen and it comes with this great
cover that extends battery life okay
I'll admit that Kindle is pretty nice
but it starts at $290 for a model that
shows you ads on the lockscreen
and then goes up to three hundred and
eighty dollars for a top-of-the-line
model and that's a lot of money you can
still get something like the paperwhite
or like the Kindle voyage for a lot less
and have a pretty nice ereader I'm
sticking with this one
Alexa read it out loud Alexa download
the everything store Alexa call me an
uber you know she doesn't work on that I
wasn't able to understand the question I
heard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
