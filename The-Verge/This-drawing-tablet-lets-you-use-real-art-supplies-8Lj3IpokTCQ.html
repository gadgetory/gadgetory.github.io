- So, I've been a
cartoonist for a long time
and I'm always trying to look for ways
to get away from the computer
and stop looking at screens so much.
This is The Slate Repaper
from a French startup
called iSKN and this'll
let me do just that.
So, what's special about The Slate
is that it comes with these magnetic rings
that you can take off and put on
to any one of your drawing
tools like your own pencil
or pen and there's a
magnet inside the ring
that works with the magnets in the tablet
so it knows exactly where you're drawing
and it shows up in real
time on a companion app
on the computer or your
iPhone or Android phone.
So, this is the fourth
generation of The Slate
and the company actually
started out as a Kickstarter
back in 2015.
I actually tried out its
second generation model
and it had a few issues,
but the company's worked
out most of its kinks
and what's special about
this new generation
is that it adds pressure sensitivity.
Before when I tried it out,
the lines would sometimes
go off on their own or it wouldn't pick up
most of the strokes, but I
think the latest generation
has fixed all that.
They said they have a new firmware update
and it seems to be
working pretty accurately.
So, how it works is you slide in
a piece of paper into the tablet.
Keep in mind this is just a prototype
so, the final version
is probably gonna have
clips on the side, but once
you have your paper in place
you can just grab one
of these magnetic rings,
put it on any pencil or pen that you own
and you have to connect it to the computer
or your phone app so you can
use it with the companion app
and then just start drawing.
The companion app gives you
a couple different brush options.
There's felt pen, chalk,
there's an air brush
and you can also choose what color
you want to be shown on the screen.
So, what you're drawing on the screen
could look a little bit different
from what you're drawing on paper
but that just opens up
more room for creativity.
But you don't have to use
paper if you don't want to.
You can always just take it out
and use it as a regular tablet
with the stylus that it comes with.
So, it's light enough to be portable
and you can actually unplug
it and take it with you
to a cafe to draw on the go.
The company's planning
on adding an SD card slot
so you can draw without WiFi
and it'll be stored internally
and uploaded to your
computer when you get back.
So, The Slate Repaper's
gonna cost around $200
when it launches in September.
That's around the same
price as other tablets
like the Wacom Intuos but
this also gives you the option
to digitize your paper
drawings and that's super cool.
