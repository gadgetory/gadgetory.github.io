New York City to see the company's
project glass the wearable computing
device that's been working on for a
couple of years and nobody's really got
the chance to play with I'm personally
excited because I'll finally get to put
it on and see what it's like for the
first time ever people want to be
connected and technologies enabled that
but a problem is that it also that
technology creates distractions and
takes you out of the moment what we
think about on the team is how to solve
that problem how to get technology out
of the way when you're doing activity
but have it there when you need it so
this is a fight against it like glancing
added smartphone or you key part of us
solving that problem is bringing
technology closer to your senses now
sort of a hunch we had that if we did
that it would allow you to connect in a
faster way but then a challenge we had
and Isabelle is going to speak to this
is the design challenge how do we get
technology out of the way if you're
going to wear something in your face how
can you get technology out of the way
when you don't need it I think when
people see glass the big thing is like
what is this weird object on everybody's
face I mean it's they're not you call
them glass but they're not glasses and
there's obviously something else so what
were the design challenges with making
this thing real well I asked myself the
same question you know 20 months ago
when I first joined the team and I saw
these people around I came into the
office and they were wearing this so
do you think I think it's actually
prefer this to be honest with you to the
new decide but but this is so this is
the original prototype this is the stuff
that everybody's messing around with it
when you got there yeah and you know it
freaked me out a little bit I have to
say but at the same time you know the
team is really really passionate about
this idea and I could sense that and I
could see the experiments that was going
on and and I you know I finally could
could wrap my head around this idea of
that we need to you know remove
technology but but still you know wear
it a little bit it's oh I see what you
really want is yeah I can see it fine it
says okay glass 325 it's just come Oh
record a video okay oh yeah and I can
see so this is seeing what I'm seeing
though like because it is a guy who have
a desire to do that but I don't have to
you don't have to you just live your
life okay glass take a picture that's
very I mean that's very cool so you've
got this kind of one size fits all right
now which is this is what glass looks
like there are a lot of people the same
people who kind of like they see 3d
glasses and like I don't want to wear
those and people who have to wear
glasses for like I do we know what how
do you try to meet that challenge I mean
you've got a design here but we're
talking about lots of people are very
different
they've got out you know prescriptions
like how do you how do you battle that I
mean this is okay this if I were sailing
you know if I were gonna go sailing I
might use the blue the sea breeze is
that what they're called we might we're
gonna talk about that I thought it was
that was sky guy is what they're called
I said sea breeze yeah it's much better
we designed it in a way so that the
components are off to one side and this
frame you can remove it it's detachable
from from the frame and its current form
in this prototype it's there's a little
screw here that you unscrew and you
remove this frame and you can attach
different kinds of frames and are you
working with partners like Ray Ban for
instance I mean I've actually talked to
a lot of people and they're like are
they going to do something with Ray Ban
because obviously they're very popular
are you talking to people like that
building an ecosystem around this is
very important to our strategy right now
we're working on a reference model for
the prescription lenses but we
definitely want to partner with others
okay glass Google when was the first
Terminator made 1984 when does this
become a retail product when can I go
into Best Buy and buy it we are aiming
on the team to actually have it out as a
consumer product by the end of this year
in 2013 2013 like to purchase yeah full
regular people can particular people
fully polished product we don't want
this to be a niche thing we think this
can help every human being and so we
look forward to this being used by
millions and millions of people doesn't
seem weird to you that to get people
having more human interactions we've
reached a point where in order to you're
saying I want people having more human
experience and more human interactions
that we have to augment ourselves with
glass okay here we go
Sergey for GPS hold on I just stopped it
like an idiot okay glass Google nearby
restaurants loading directions okay it's
not telling me to cross the street have
we done something wrong like if we
screwed up so we're fundamental that
you're like I just want to have a more
human experience let me put on these
robots on glasses it is a paradox and I
think we continue to need to make it
even better make it faster make it
lighter you know this is just baby steps
