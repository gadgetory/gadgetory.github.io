for 2015 and as you can see we're just
outside Sony's booth and the thing I
hold in my hand is the new experience
that vibe the brand new smartphone
company is introduced and it's part of a
family there's usual experience that
five compacts it's four point six inch
display let's say the standards at five
is five point two inches and then
there's a brand new experience at five
premium which is 5.5 inch 4k display
Sony's calling this a super flagship
whatever that means and I really haven't
no idea why it has a 4k display I see
5.5 inch phones with 1080p displays and
it probably fine you know more pixels
more power to Sony I guess and there is
one other feature about this phone which
you will find pretty cool which is if
you turn it round this is a chrome
version which means that Sony has
literally put a mirror on the back of
this phone again white put a mirror or a
4k display on the phone I don't know
you have to our Sony about that this is
it's the experience that five premium
you notice on the side this thing has a
fingerprint sensor on the power button
which is also true standard and compact
z5 the specs pretty much Universal with
all of these they're Snapdragon 810
processors three gigabytes of RAM in the
premium and the standard everything
people gonna start crying the dead for I
have standard standard I've sort of done
it so many times but yes same folks is a
same 23 megapixel camera this brand new
sense the first new sensor in the Xperia
series you know with the Zed 500 and
finally selling his chosen to upgrade
the sensor Kony twenty three megapixel
one it says it's the best mobile cameras
I've made I would love that to be the
case I have to try it out for myself
and the fingerprint sensor I want to get
back to that because it works really
well works surprisingly well in fact it
just soaks moving quick and I'm a fan of
having it on the side as well so it just
unlocks your phone so quickly you don't
need to reach down for home button and
go up it just makes a ton of sense to me
also the design of these phones again
sitting inside the chrome one which is
outlandish
they have these map finishes on the back
or singular matte finish on the back and
these colors you've got this gold in
this gray silverish one I'm a huge fan
of them I have to say and I've always
been a huge fan of the compact and I
still the case I love the size of this
it really feels like a phone for a human
being rather than you know an NBA player
or whatever but we set that aside for a
moment and just take a closer look at
the zip file itself it changes from the
XIII series that it's more angular it
has more defined edge all around the
sides it's more of a rectangle is block
here and you know I can understand why
Sony did that because what is that free
you've really smoothed out the corners
and curved everything and I could make
for slightly slip your grip so now you
feel more of an edge right around the
back there it's not an uncomfortable
thing it kind of protrudes a little bit
the side kind of protrudes from the back
but it's not uncomfortable feeling it's
kind of reassuring honestly and I feel
like the weight of these phones is also
really good I don't feel like the
premium is too heavy I don't feel like
the compact is too light you just kind
of feel right so so he has done what
soli usually does is keep the Xperia Z
series pretty much consistent all across
generations but it's that made a few
tweaks and I think that for the thing
that for the better also worth noticing
the micro USB port is waterproof the
headphone jack is also waterproof the
entire thing is waterproof but they
don't need that city cab it's only used
to have in previous generations so I'm a
big fan of that small little tweak but
makes a difference so to be honest I
find he's exciting I'm finding is
interesting it was kind of an
underwhelming presentation from Sony
today it didn't have all that many
surprises mostly because these phones
leaked the seeing them in person you
know set aside a 4k resolution in the
premium the clarity the contrast and
just the quality of these displays is
impressed me and you know I'm excited to
see and to spend more time with these
particularly with that new camera if
someone lives up to its promise with the
z5 camera being amazing particularly
with the compact I mean a phone of this
size having an awesome 23 megapixel
camera is something I've dreamed up for
a long time and that's
forget the only promise is two days of
battery life out of all these phones and
it's usually lived up to that in spirit
generations so I can say there's a lot
to live up to with these phones I'm
looking forward to seeing more of them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
