nightmare if you've ever watched the
Super Bowl you know it's much more of an
event than just a game that adds the
tie-ins the spectacle it's all much
bigger than what happens on the field
but the spectacle isn't just on TV it's
a real physical thing that follows the
event wherever it goes with TV studios
and event spaces and toboggan runs it's
like all the ads in the Super Bowl
crawled out of the TV and set up shop in
the most overwhelming place in New York
Times Square
this is super bowl boulevard 13 blocks
stretch of broadway that's been taken
over by the NFL in honor of Sunday's
game you can catch a touchdown pass at
the bridgestone tent or pepsi and
tostitos will set you up performing a
fake halftime show almost all of the big
corporate advertisers for the superbowl
have a physical presence here
this divider is particularly crazy
there's fake icicles fake first down
markers to get in we had to buy tickets
to look like the actual tickets to the
Super Bowl this isn't even real snow
it's soap suds have you ever wanted to
climb inside the body of an NFL wide
receiver if so this is your chance
this is the Lombardi Trophy right at the
epicenter everyone see it get a picture
of it many as 30,000 people are going to
see it just today everyone's lined up
outside do you want to actually touch it
you have to win the Super Bowl
this is a big screen tracking the social
media reaction to the different teams
and the different players I don't know
why they did this
Papa John's brought two things a 71
Camaro and free pizza people care way
more about the free pizza
New York is a weird place to have the
Super Bowl it's cold it's crowded it's
stressful the NFL ignored all that
because Bluebirds New York is built for
exactly this kind of spectacle Times
Square has spent a lot of time preparing
for this event cutting off car access
and building out pedestrian areas over
the course of years and as all this is
going on people are still working in the
buildings over the street as if
nothing's even happening as strange as
it feels in 2014 you can build a
miniature football Disneyland in the
center of Manhattan and the city will
just go on around</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
