hello thank you thank you thank you
thank thank you hi I'm Josh polski
editor-in-chief of The Verge and welcome
to on the verge I hope you're ready to
have a devilishly good time tonight
we've scared up some ghoulish Oh screw
this I really want to do a halloween
show we had one planned for the 30th and
we had to move it because of the
hurricane that's what the smoke was for
kind of likes actually like something
was on fire not like a I said I want to
look like a graveyard that didn't really
happen anyhow yeah we did have to move
the show as you know a hurricane hit new
york and jersey and all over the place a
very bad hurricane named sandy and i
just want to tell you guys if you want
to do something about it you can go to
the Red Cross org can donate some money
they're probably 'king blood I mean I
don't know how they do that over the
internet but I'm i understand it can be
done anyhow but so we had to move the
show and we thought let's pick a day
where nothing's happening let's let's
just find a day there's nothing going on
in the news we can just have this all to
ourselves and we thought november six is
going to be great it's going to be
perfect for us and I think you'll agree
we chose correctly haha any other
there's an election happening right now
which is exciting but we have a big show
we have an exciting show and I'm really
glad that you guys are here apparently
we're live-streaming this they've told
me which is terrifying so if anything
happens that seems like it was a mistake
that's part of the show and we are very
good at faking stuff so we have a great
show the CEO for squares here Dennis
Crowley we're going to talk about the
yeah we're going to talk about for
squaring whatever that is gamifying I
understand it's very exciting some of
our friends from polygon are here Russ
fresh Nick and Chris plant we're gonna
be talking about yeah we talked about
video games and and emotions it's going
to be very heavy very heavy stuff and
Paul and Neil I hear of course Paul went
to NASA he went to make her fair we've
got some videos from that stuff
and they're very cool I think you guys
will enjoy it and if you don't that's
tough we did our best so we should
probably get underway I want to see the
show tonight is presented by Samsung so
give them a round of applause they put
this on and and on an unrelated note
we're giving away we're giving away
three Galaxy Note 2's tonight so so some
of you guys some of you guys will leave
with the device and many of you will
leave with nothing as usual so I think
that's it we should just get started so
let's do this
it's a big week as you know and we had
there's a bunch of news this week
there's been a bunch of news this month
in fact I don't even know why I'm
telling you about all the news when I
could just be talking about it with paul
miller and nilay patel so please welcome
Paul Miller and Nilay Patel
right there straight right there here oh
right there okay good all right ah I
feel that really cuddle I was worried I
don't know why you did that that was
normal right that's normal stop you do
that when we would have just done it on
around yeah you're not that you don't
have to force me to cuddle me like hell
normal people touch like that that they
do right okay good I'll take that weird
like me you know when your silence in
the room when it's actually the sound
has been removed it's not just like
people aren't ya anything that's what's
happening right now so as you know first
off hi hey are you so i just mentioned
that there's an election there's the
election going on right now in America
the presidential elections over uh-huh
the candidates are it's a heated get
hotly contested race yeah Barack Obama
berry o the the Pratt current president
yes and his his his rival mitt romney
the the pret the guy who wants the guy
who wants to be President many are
anyhow so so we realized that even
though we're streaming this live now we
realize that many people would see this
after the election and the president
will have already been decided yes and
we there are there are things we want to
talk about as far as the president is
concerned and technology so we thought
we just run through whoever wins we do
one for each we talk about their views
on technology and talk about them having
won the election what it means yeah and
and then we'll just edit it then
retrospect will seem smart it will seem
like we had a great talking point about
the but the winner of the election so so
let's just do that now so the election
is over and and the winner has been
decided Barack Obama is returning
he's returned he's he's returned to the
president what welcome i learned barack
obama head rock the world Obama you want
me to tears no after we get some help
this would
Obama is so amazing I Leon us which I've
ever seen using confetti explode right
towards your face that was horrible that
was really how Barack Obama hat has a
ruckus it's I'm so excited as once I got
frightened as one second term in office
and me like you wrote an editorial about
it about how you were voting for obama
does he is for net neutrality a dead
what do you think the next what's gonna
happen the next four years how do you
think obama's next four years which he
won in the election how do you think
those will look which conclusively won't
you totally won in the election many
days ago how that affect our how will
that affect our lives you notice to be
better if i had a small american flag to
waver oh oh yeah wait a second sorry um
here you are and i have where to listen
Alex I read all about that uh you know
when I think about America and I think
about the next four years with Brock my
buddy um you know I think about the
future of the internet I think about the
few short company yes and you know the
thing to me is that net neutrality is
the only issue which i care about is it
your it's really sad people are
single-issue voters yeah me like there
are people in America without jobs right
now yeah they should get jobs in the
internet on the internet yes but we if
only we had net neutrality we would have
everybody would have a job yeah that
that's the serious point is that there's
a secondary economy on the internet and
the companies that provide access to the
Internet want to be in want to be the
gatekeepers to that economy and I don't
think that they should be allowed to do
that right and you're in your if you
guys haven't read this editorial that he
wrote it's quite good and it basically I
mean you know you might agree or
disagree on lots of different things
when it comes to these guys but I mean I
think a lot of people who work or at
least spend a lot of their time on the
internet we know we think and i'm sure
you guys hear think and everybody
watching net neutrality is important
it's important to find a way to have a
free and open Internet that everybody
can compete on that everybody can use
and you know what i find what i think is
really interesting is that when i do
other editorials and I criticize ATT or
comcast over
nobody ever like disagrees with me we
were a death threat to you yeah nobody
ever knows like you're dumb and you
should be shot right but when I say you
should vote in a way that supports those
editorials then the death threats come
then those people find you hard and fast
yes yes they want to murder you let me
tell you where Neil I lives it's no he
lives in Brooklyn back there the other
day and I slipped a death just right
over hey hey but you know him I mean I
mean Paul I think it's even a place
where obviously we have you know Paul
Paul and I and in perhaps an Eli and
Paul have differing viewpoints on some
political items all of them but uh
you're at net neutrality believer you
believe in net neutrality or am I
putting words in your mouth you're
putting words among you hate net
neutrality I am I'm always scared of
regulating companies regulating
especially regulating somebody in the
name of freedom but because I think
sometimes you end up picking winners so
I don't really know too well we're
either candidate was on net neutrality
because I voted on other time there's
non non debt to child yeah you had this
is this has multiple other single issue
yeah I yes I'm a single issue voter and
multiple category no it's very confusing
i hear ya but I under and net neutrality
was not the reason I voted but you know
it's still so what's important we
figured out what do you do you think the
next four years are gonna fair under
under Barack Obama Barack Obama um well
now that Barack Obama has been elected
president again yeah sweet as we
definitely know as we found out yeah we
are you as we've known for a few items I
think the Internet is gonna be kind of
in estates is I think we're gonna have
this back and forth argument I don't
think we're gonna figure at least for
the next couple years I don't really
know what its gonna look like past that
but I think I think we're kind of in
this holding pattern and we're gonna
argue I think we people still need to
figure out what the words net neutrality
mean because both sides use that term
not anymore oh really no can't just call
it that well we got to move on because
we got a lot of stuff to talk about yeah
give me those flags yeah okay here we go
let's clean this off let's get this all
right okay i really put these here like
so
okay all right all right good wait let
me just move there okay hmm I didn't
work is everything we're here you ready
okay good you ready good you don't have
to do this now yeah okay uh so it's been
it's been a big week in news big month
and news and of course we just had that
the election the presidential election
and bit bit of a shocking result Oh Mitt
Romney has been elected yes Mitt Romney
has cheering success on so many
different levels it Robbie has been
elected the 40 the next president for
2045 45th president the united states
he's going to be gliding on into the
White House yeah thatthat slicked back
hair and anyhow Neal I recently wrote an
editorial about net neutrality and why
he was voting for barack obama and i
believe did yeah yeah what do you think
about yeah how do you have another no
way that we've been beaten now that it's
set time to sink in yeah god this be so
much easier if i had a small american
flag oh you know what let me actually
just pass one of these down please we
are right there you know the way of
displaying in sadness today really yeah
you know I believe that we should move
forward not backwards and onto the
Internet yeah and not onto a highway
often not off the internet yeah online
so you're saying the cutoff line whoever
is the president of the United States
which we just found it is Mitt Romney
definitely met I was the Internet yes
should tweet could you be be your hanabi
rely your premise your premise of your
editorial was that Mitt Romney is
against net neutrality that he would
partner with or he would he would not
partner with but he would a stand for
the rights of AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon and
Comcast over the rights of American
citizens to have access free and open
access and competing businesses on the
internet and now we're living in a world
where Mitt Romney is the president
definitely the preselected president
okay America of the United States of
America and so what do you think can
happen in the next four years you know I
don't think I don't think Mitt Romney
thinks that we should side with 18 teen
and
Comcast I think he believes that there
is a free market that exists that will
achieve good things and I like waving
while you're doing I don't believe that
market exists i don't think that people
have a real choice for their home
broadband i think people in the aura of
Time Warner Cable would tell you that
time warner cable does not feel that the
pressure of competition I think people
have ATT and have to upgrade to a mobile
share plan what's the I guess days time
it's the opposite of pressure of
competition cuz that's what time
glorious freedom to squeeze you for
profit monopoly glorious monopoly you
know I just don't I don't I don't think
companies in our hearts wanek what like
want to compete right I think you have
to Ronnie you think Mitt Romney will
keep those policies in place that are
letting them dominate yeah I mean I
think I think you already see it I call
you now Paul you're a mitt romney
supporter your thoughts in the next four
years I just think we're gonna run we're
gonna find out now that he's president
we're gonna you don't have any other
thoughts on that I'm gonna find out all
right well we've got to move on it was
an exciting election and I'm just a
little sad to my dad like the sweep
Romney no I don't think so give me that
I've you ever in the Boy Scout we've got
a lot of the news to talk about out of
other news a lot of other things yeah
it's a really festive surface let's move
along put these here like so um there's
other big news a lot going on Lucasfilm
you guys know about this Lucasfilm
selling to Disney and making more Star
Wars films yeah seven eight nine and
they and what I learned this today it's
the its earlier charge following the
story is Jar Jar Binks as he becomes a
Sith Lord say thanks sit sit sit baked
it goes very dark untold yeah very dark
constant this audience question what do
you feel more trepidation about your
candidate losing the presidency or
Disney making more Star Wars films
definitely the star wars like it stuff
like sometimes like everything more
worried about that like destroying the
United States ihop a big night or not
near Barack away are you you're more
worried about Disney making a Star Wars
yes that you're worried about George
Lucas making in other stores Lulu and
you not to do it you know no that's a
good that's like GW running for a third
term look
no but no not gonna do that all right
I'm not gonna all right but need more
you think he would have stopped yes he's
probably fright like you don't I'll do
this deal but you have to promise to
make more and here I eat like a thousand
page thing he pushed towards the music
here's the way I see it going yea big
focus on Jar Jar Binks Oh anyhow so
other in other news we celebrate our
first birthday yeah Virge one year we
yes thank you you can why might why my
squinting you ended up more tepid
applause yeah
that's the third one here there we go
you have a real problem on this show
getting my place is like a good website
yeah a year I didn't think we'd make it
a month to be honest with you so I'm
excited yeah and I feel like at any
moment it can be taken away from us
today much like much like the collection
was taken away from Barack or MIT
depending on which edit we use um what
are your favorite memories from the last
year give any favorite memories I think
it's fall quitting the internet for six
months that's right that happened I mean
that's a new Paul and I have to talk uh
well you know i think that's that's part
of my favorite memories we've had the
opportunity to do what look and feel
like crazy things they are they chase
kind of big ideas and paul leaving here
something one of them that's a big one
I'm yet yes we do this which is crazy
has been crazy released the surface we
released the surface after a meal I
developed on this baby I worked hard on
this touch cover we lied to people's
faces about who is currently the
president of you guys or did we or did
we uh but anyhow but rocker Romney I
have to say but i will say a lot of
disappointed last III i will do i would
just like to say about our first
birthday yeah that I when we started I
really didn't know if what we were
trying to do with work yeah you know and
I don't think we reinvented the wheel or
anything I think we were just trying to
make something really good that we were
proud of and that other people really
like and and i have to say that to have
done it for a year and had success and
to have seen our numbers grow and our
readership grow and people liking it and
loving it i was at the airport in in LA
a couple of weeks ago and somebody
randomly come out to me and they were
like hey you're the dude from The Verge
like I read the site every day and it
was insane and incredible to me that
like people out in the world or reading
what we do and so I just want to like
thank whoever's watching live and and
you guys in the audience here and
anybody else give give yourselves a
round of applause because you're
I mean without without you really you're
really applauded for yourselves longer
than anything else but without but
without the audience which is grown and
grown and is amazing like we would be
nothing and so like it's all thanks to
people who want to read this stuff and
you know what's really I think whenever
we try to do something that's very
different and crazy when we're like
let's let's let Trent take adderall for
a month well we tell him to take out or
I'll he was just doing we didn't tell
him yeah I mean him the bus but like and
let's write about that or let's post
that it's worry a lot too i'm voting for
and like we take it never like when we
do things that are way outside the box
there's a lot of feedback that's not
gonna like it they like they either i
will say that the one thing that's been
most exciting is that when we think to
do something and it's like this seems
weird and maybe people won't be into it
our audience is always like we love this
yeah we're we're doing or making a
website that we would want to read and
words just so awesome that other people
want to want to read it yeah so so there
but we have done a lot of like
straight-up news coverage read yes and
we should talk about on that as you know
like the surface just came out there's
been a ton of gadgets release recently
surface just came out the this is the
nexus 4 this is the nexus tens the new
google products this thing here which
somebody spilled water on is the ipad
was the ipad mini here's what used to be
the Lumia 920 which somebody also
somebody also spilled some kind of
liquid on Neil I I'm not naming names
there's nothing about this bright colors
that make something look waterproof even
if it's not uh yeah right well they're
not oh there's really this is really
soaked okay it's a review unit ah but um
but there's been it's more than this
like with the release of Windows 8
mm-hmm things have got like this is a
wacky form factor like we know tablets
and we know phones yeah they're kind of
familiar to us now this is getting a
little bit weird and we actually have a
bunch of new windows 8 devices that we
brought with us so we kind of want to
show how people are kind of pushing
their boundaries on design a little bit
so let's let's walk over do we have a
gadget table let's walk over to it let's
and yah and take a look yeah klopfer got
potato so these are these are all
they're all sleeping they're all sleep
they're all asleep well that tell us
about these gadgets Neela uh god I love
windows said yeah so these are all
windows 8 device they're always a and
here's the thing so all the stuff we saw
in the desk is their tablets and phones
they've been tablets and phones for a
while for five years some of them you
know now they come in colors right and
that's the crazy thing about them but
the crazy thing I got very exciting to
me well that maybe I'm crazy but we went
through I feel like we went through this
with the imac where somebody was like
you could put a collar on a computer did
you know you can just put if you want
yeah and then it was like hey colors
that's crazy yeah and now like we forgot
all about it everything was what we
forgot we definitely forgot about that
with pcs yeah pcs have been been our
kind of all got about it for a while to
their back into colors a little bit no
oh they have new oh they die pods but
you know whatever grab on sorry um but
the thing about pcs is that Windows 8
because they've actually grafted a touch
screen all the way to say for real
they're allowed to do crazy things so
obviously you have the surface there it
is it's got a type cover and we've seen
I think this is Microsoft saying like
here's what we think pc should look like
but the thing about Windows 8 is that
the other companies get to do where they
want to you so here's a sous that's true
right maybe sell the license together
anymore so here's the suits and they you
know they did did transformers with
Andrew I like so this is actually a this
is a Windows 8 is this a witness windows
8/rt or regular wait outside this is RT
so and it has you can just um you can
just break it any way you want yes you
can do it man look at how strong it is
is what I'm trying to show you any how
fast is right oh oh there's a latch okay
I actually think this is the winning
form factor for these things like it's a
tablet this is kind of like an iPad yeah
right and then it's got this thing which
you can throw in a bag which is its okay
its not this kid more is a key words a
little small if it's also a battery yeah
no no it's great a smaller yeah yeah I
need a little
like Sodom the thing about this and the
services of these are 69 right I think
yeah they're a little business really
silly for me and tabloid Wow but could
be a lot worse yes could be a lot worse
Neal I let me allow me to show you
what's ice cream is this this is like a
13-3 toshiba and this looks like a
tablet it's huge but it turns into a
laptop like that and then it does that
what just mean this is crazy I mean and
the amount of engineering they had to do
if you look at this hinge it's got like
I think my tracks it's got spike this is
the thing that's most exciting is that
people are finally innovating on hinges
yeah and and this is just good like a
you know I mean it's like I'm for that
you donated crazy on hinges and then and
there like hinges are a bad idea I'm
reading a book just comfortably read
one-handed reading and then I got an
incoming call after five years that guy
every day the huge up to your ear hello
it says you're not connected in giant
letters that is true that is true but
it's a touchscreen yeah you know Sean
reviewed this thing it's interesting I
mean this is like the explosion of ideas
of how computer should look I wish it
did more folding well the thing with
this other thing with all of these to me
is like you're supposed to touch them
but the hinge is here so it's like that
that didn't and that's not great okay
you're forcing out a little the thing
that scares me about this reminds me of
like the original tablet PC era like
Windows tablet edition sort of complaint
lightweight whenever just like doc
you've got a stylus and they're just a
little it's a little so I mean look this
thing is like this is a really great
movie problem you know it's like oh yeah
hello I've got a call hello it costs
idea that's what I Sheamus I but this is
your favorite this is my favorite did
you love this this love is a strong word
this is the yoga from Lenovo yoga so
it's a tablet but it has maybe the
smartest hinge we're just turns into a
laptop and then it is about it's better
when you show this just so you
understand what's happening with this
particular it's a 15 inch display to the
touch screen yeah it's a touchscreen and
then just it's just the one is that one
girl and then it does that right
right seems comfortable right and you've
got a keyboard and it's weird because
you're holding what is what come on guys
seriously like whoohoo here show of
hands yeah would use it like this
literally from two one guy was like just
kidding it was like the third guy I
don't think so so like here's what so
here's what school I think let me just
do this can i er um you just put this
like so these guys I think what's really
great is that people are innovating on
ya hinges and form factors right but I
just don't think like I don't know of
any human beings really want to do to do
that and that's that's the problem I'd
like Microsoft has the best thing I
think I actually think the surface is of
all well I think this kind of the asus
is getting there it's girls yeah where's
little small is closed this is what's
strange is that in operating system is
that's why these manufacturers are like
we can't ride or wildest idea yeah and
they send the designers like into a room
they do a sit there like will fold it
all the way back we know I mean I mean
as we know Microsoft they primed the
better they open their mind they prime
the pump with the surface yeah they did
you know and i will call it alright
that's our gadgets at her show we have a
video it all went to NASA and he became
an astronaut he went into outer space
and he found aliens and and we have it
on video so uh take a look at this we'll
be right back with Dennis Crowley from
foursquare Americans don't fly
spaceships anymore we catch a ride with
Russia commercial spaceflight is awesome
and it's doing really well and it might
get American humans in American vehicles
up soon but it might take NASA a decade
to build its own capsule and get
astronauts back in space so what what
happens now at NASA what is happening
now
I'm here at the Johnson Space Center in
Houston Texas opening the doors to shed
light on the future of human space
travel
this is Robonaut 2 he's a collaboration
between NASA GM there's a guy exactly
almost exactly like this up in space
right now this is in Houston and NASA's
tests out new routines new behaviors and
they ship them over to another lab where
they have an exact replica of Robonaut
that's on the space station where they
finalize routine then they beam that up
space and they do it for real well the
whole idea behind Robonaut is to provide
an assistant for crew a Robonaut could
work side by side with the crew like a
nurse to a doctor or you can also take
down all the tools and everything all
the infrastructure after a particular
task is completed I think it's important
to keep in mind that Robonaut is a tool
many people talk about science fiction
robots and how they can go and do things
on their own Robo Knight has been
designed specifically to be a tool for
people it only does we tell it to do and
it's been designed with the safety and
the reliability to be a useful tool
around people not to go off and do
anything on its own I'm just going to
show you a quick little scene from
national treasure 3 at the start of the
movie Nicholas Cage is sent to space
using one of the Russian vehicles that
currently takes astronauts to space
because the the Space Shuttle has been
decommissioned and he's looking for the
lost US Constitution and unknown to the
other astronauts since Robonaut outside
the space station to retrieve the the
Constitution and so Robonaut can fold
back thermal blanket that's hiding the
US Constitution and Nicolas Cage back
inside the space station because
Nicholas Cage doesn't know how to
spacewalk he's like oh thanks Robonaut i
will take the US Constitution to the
President of the United States and ask
him why did you hide this in the space
station well don't you look in the
envelope
look at the avila it's just not a
constitution it's just so this is called
the Robo glove an exoskeleton for your
hand it's basically designed to help you
grab things and make you stronger in the
glove itself here on the thumb we have
something called the four sense resistor
we actually actuate the tendons and we
pull them down and then release them
when you let go the f sr and that's what
gives you the extra power to lift an
object like a heavyweight or something
more so now I can I mean I can lift
heavy winter well I guess I want you
guys to know very capable of lifting
heavy weight sure i'm here with front of
the multi-mission multi-mission space
exploration vehicle and so this is a
capsule with a dead pot heat melted to
the outside noise so explain your ears
telling me this is like a modular system
so that that's where multi-mission comes
in the chassis is effectively a robot
this robot has wheels and that moves
around the payload is the cabin so can I
hey driver yeah let's hop in
before I do I'm the pilot now go to
pilot so pretty much push the stick in
the direction you want to travel and the
vehicle will do what it needs to do to
get there here we go
so you'll notice we're not just tipping
into it so right now if you were outside
you can see it forcing this right wheel
down into that hole
incredible
this world
it doesn't make any sense
it's just like a really need a weird
random direction at a floating and a bob
the cure itself won't allow you to to do
things that are gonna jeopardize the
safety of the robot
as you're going over the hill you're
starting to pick up more speed because
your vehicle weighs a lot but the wheels
notice that and say well I'm only
getting a command of one meter per
second and it's
so you maintain that speed man I just
feel like it's like just giving me out
of a pinch every time that it got a
little rescued basically by a robot we
can venture over to Mars if you want
that was good I'm sick of the moon can
we go through the wall at hand yeah yes
pretty girl's life down there I saw
dragonfly lot of people that's our star
c300 so sixteen thousand dollar camera
I'm gonna run over it I'm gonna close my
eyes and you're gonna tell me go
straight and you tell me what's that
okay ready yeah push you push your stick
forward my eyes a club stick us forward
we're doing it we're looking good oh my
god it's probably not quite center but I
loosen up I don't see anybody in the
cameras crying it's okay already trying
to back off just look at that we beat
Louisville rear-view camera
this is the space vehicle mock-up
facility where they have space vehicle
mock-up within the facility this is a
ryan this is NASA's next generation
space capsule so this is how we would
get back from the Moon or Mars or
wherever we go next this is how we land
back on earth but you could live in here
for a while for people could be in here
if they really liked each other to be in
here for 21 days basically this this
room is awesome and I'm gonna live here
NASA Johnson Space Center Visitor Miller
Paul Josiah inspires Wednesday October
stoop to over 70 that's today some say
space is the final frontier and you know
that's a final frontier that's a lot
it's like in Little House on the Prairie
when they you know they moved to the
little cabin in the Big Woods but that
wasn't far enough so they they move
further the
little house on the prairie and you know
and then one day we found the UH notion
to New an ocean on the whole other side
of the country there's an ocean this
whole time and Isaac spaces like that
the scientists that I met today in
Houston at NASA are they're working on
human spaceflight we are not there yet
but we're working on it that's cool
how I I have to say I am I am very
jealous of Paul for getting to go on
that trip it's very cool stuff and and
and Paul is a he's really good at that
he's really good at going and doing
things and I envy that all right we
shouldn't waste any more time I want to
bring out our first guest please welcome
the CEO foursquare Dennis Crowley
all right thank your company what you're
very careful it's like good we try to
make it kind of like a difficult for
people to get over we've got you gotta
step over that thing you've gotta step
up and that arm is broken yeah it's a
little mini of course officially brought
back the broken arm sofa just for you uh
Dennis thank you for coming yeah thanks
for having me in the zone psyched to be
here well uh you know it's it really is
our pleasure to have you and you're here
in New York you're based in New York
yeah we're down and uh we have offices
done so and now would you say now I want
to talk a little bit about I want to get
into the roots of foursquare but yeah
the first I want to talk about the East
Coast West Coast startup battle and you
know it's got very heated can you
trash-talked Silicon Valley at all there
r us right now and I'll talk about how
much better New York is for startups oh
I think I like the New York seen a lot
right because there's just a lot more
people here it's like 8 million people
here versus I don't how many people in
San Francisco 15 but considerably fewer
the right and then on top of that like
there I like about building a tech
startup in New York is that you know
tech is not the most important thing
here it's like fifth down in the list
we've got like you know fashion and
finance and media and publishing and
advertising and pretty much everything
else except for tech and tech is like
way down at the bottom and so when you
meet people out and you ask them to beta
tests of things you're building or get
excited about the stuff you're building
either just regular people yeah like
they're not early adopters and its
really i think it makes it much easier
to kind of build things in this and body
you're not like hey I'm doing foursquare
you can check in place you become mayor
place they're like oh I'm using a
different thing that does exactly I
don't start up the day yeah i know my
sharp is actually doing so i can't
really test it that is the thing that I
mean it is you don't have like a million
different startups all doing trying to
do similar things here it's like there's
a few I feel York startups and maybe you
know because we're we're sort of like a
publishing part of like a publishing
startup really I am biased but I think
there's something a little bit more like
the startups here are much more real if
they're real things like they involve
real world either real world activities
yeah are there things you
actually need for your life yeah its
verses like stuff like hey what if we
had Yelp for shoes yeah i mean that's
Yelp isn't it i don't really have well
there's like no there's like a smaller
pool of them here so like you look at
the big ones and you know where one of
the biggest ones here and then you've
got you know your your tumblers and your
etsy s and your Kickstarter's and your
meetups and it's just like a smaller
pool to compare yourself with and when
you look at like the big startups that
are out west you know it's like it's
just a big tech companies you've got
your Google's and your Facebook's and
your twitter is your apples it's just
like a different breed of big tech
company right no but I mean they've but
Facebook and Twitter they've kind of
graduated to a different sphere of their
not like a startup yeah but we think
upon your in that sphere too yeah I mean
like we're not really even start up
we're like 150 people right it's over 50
years old yeah exactly right so like how
Wes that's I think it's still considered
relatively small where one of the bigger
players in the and the new york tech
scene right and so it's just it's like a
different you know distinction of scale
I guess so to recap the west coast
startup scene lame East Coast art scene
awesome is that I'm hearing Sonia I
quote you on that I see I don't want to
I don't wanna poopoo the west coast cuz
we have an office out there yeah time
yeah uh so I actually talked about that
the the beginnings of foursquare
foursquare was not foursquare originally
fourth quarter was like you know if you
go way back in the day it's um you know
it's me building software from my
friends I've got laid off from my very
first calm job which was what well like
to my second job so I worked at a
company called Jupiter research which I
was the guy like making PowerPoint
slides and then I worked at that was
your job you were just like I was pretty
much awesome era pretty much like making
slides for other people to give during
presentations and things and I worked at
a mobile I product shop called Vindico
that was building city guides for Palm
Pilots and that was at this company
Vindico I really got bit by the bug of
hey you can make stuff during the day
and you go out at night and you see
people using the stuff that you you know
that you were working on during the day
and they're using it on their palm
pilots and like that was kind of a big
deal I know palm pilots like super old
school but but I mean I was like oh my
god I you build stuff during the day and
you see stuff you see people using at
night like that's incredibly rewarding
and so this idea of just building stuff
that my friends would use in building
stuff that I
I just got really kind of bit by that
bug right and you know so the first
version the dodge ball ended up coming
out of that we ended up can you explain
dodgeball hello sure who don't know what
it is yeah dodgeball is um you know we I
can remember how we used to pitch it
back in the day but it was just like a
basic friend finder for text messaging
and so you know this is before you a GPS
and phones or color screens or apps in
general but you know anywhere that my my
friends in New York would go out you
just send a text message to like NYC at
dodgeball calm and say I'm at the you
know the magician I'm at Tom and Jerry's
I'm at Central Park and then that
message will get rebroadcast I'll do all
of your friends right yeah we had like a
poor man's little social network built
into it and like it didn't work who's
SMS base it was SMS yeah but didn't work
because I no one really kind of knew
what social networks where there's back
my 2001 people to know what social
networks were like text messaging barely
worked and we kept trying to like
resurrect the idea we did it after
friendster kind of hit pseudo mass
market it's like oh now we can explain
it as it's like friendster for cell
phones and then we try to resurrect it
again when we're NYU and did it with
them you know then we ended up bringing
it to google and you know i feel like
now you know a couple years later some
of those ideas are a bit more in the
right time right place right the device
is a more mature like everyone here
knows about apps on your phone you all
know that you have gps like everyone
here has phones that can do these things
and so like we're just you know it's
just a much larger audience you've been
so you've been trying to do like I mean
you've essentially been trying to do
something like Foursquare or been trying
to do for us but for a very long time
for spare was that what is the year for
a force press started we started 2009
right and even so be way before that day
you were kind of trying to find a way to
say pan out of place yeah cuz I'll be
all about it yeah I say you could it
goes back to I 2001 or so right which
has which is insane yeah it mean but it
barely worked wait 15 people usually
really really want people to know where
you are well it's just like it makes
meeting up with people easier and more
fun and right so so so foursquare was a
few years ago everybody talked about
foursquare yeah it was like we're game
gamify everything we're gonna game if I
our lives like four squares one of these
things where it's like I get
achievements for doing stuff that I'm
doing anyhow yeah I can become them
or somewhere and get bad just for stuff
yeah I mean obviously that stuff is all
still baked into foursquare but it seems
like the last you know couple of years
certain the last year things have been
moving towards not just about hey I got
an achievement or I'm the mayor of
something but foursquare is going to be
an engine for finding things yeah for
discovery and for discovery and getting
recommendations yeah can you talk a
little bit about the shift or if there
is a shift and what what that means to
you you know I don't I don't really see
it so much as a shift right so you know
what we're trying to do like the kind of
essence of foursquare is how do you use
software to encourage people to go out
and have experiences that they haven't
had before right and a big part of that
is like the recommendation engine that
we've got you know a whole bunch of data
scientists working crunching the three
billion check-ins to make these
recommendations happen in real time and
there's another part of that the part we
weren't able to do that in the early
days we just didn't have the team of the
town or just we weren't sophisticated
enough to do that in the early days we
were using like basic game mechanics
like the badges that probably most of
the people in this room know about where
it's like can we use software to
encourage people to you know go to
places that they haven't been to before
like initially it was you know I live in
the east village and there's a bar that
I always go to called 7b and it was like
you know this is just my default place
like how do you make a piece of software
that encourages me to go to some place I
haven't been before to bring my friends
there to go to another borough to like
travel uptown to get a group two people
together and do something none of us
have done before and can you make a game
out of that and can act like you know if
you make the game if you design a game
well enough can it encourage people to
do those types of things right we're
finding that a lot of that stuff works
like the game mechanics have worked
pretty well on foursquare like if you
level up in coffee it's like am a level
6 coffee person because i've been to 30
different places in New York people feel
some kind of sense of accomplishment
over that right now aki I unlocked the
gym rat badge for going to the gym you
know ten times out of a 30 day period
like that's a it kind of works right do
you ever feel like I'm gonna get a
little bit deep on you here let's do you
ever feel like the idea of gamma fiying
for adults who like going to a bar is
very adult activity right yeah do you
ever feel that the and i'm sure you have
a wonderful responses did you ever feel
like in some way gamifying things we
normally do is a way of infantilizing us
like it kind of making us like I mean I
don't play
you know in my daily life I don't think
of the things I do is an achievement
that I need to unlock or yeah game that
I have to play is there something about
taking tasks or things that we do
recreationally and turning them into a
game that in some way diminishes their
their value or their importance or does
that was a big difference between like
trying to turn everything into a game
and try to make everything playful right
so I never I don't ever think of
foursquare as a game right there there's
game mechanics in there but I think of
it as like you know there's been all
these just utilities like things that
will help you do stuff on the internet
for a long time it's like we should make
those things more fun they should be fun
to use and fun to interact with and so
that's where a lot of the game mechanics
come from I want to make you know
everyday interactions if I going to the
same restaurant by commuting every day
traveling in between cities I want to
make that stuff feel playful and
rewarding doesn't have to be a game but
I think there's it's important to note
the distinction you you think that it's
do you think as people as humans like we
need to be rewarded for doing I mean is
that something that you think is baked
into our DNA that we want to be rewarded
or we need to be rewarded you know I
don't think rewards come in different
sizes and shapes like every time that
you get a like on Instagram like that's
like that's being rewarded that's like
the little bit of a dopamine hit right
and I feel like it's like you know
that's that's a multiplayer version of
it right because you post something and
then your friends interact with it
that's two players interacting you know
the Foursquare stuff was designed to be
more one player like you do something in
the real world and Foursquare rewards
you for doing that and so you know the
badge am Aaron walk you know you get a
tip that tells you about something you
should order at a restaurant like those
are all little dopamine hits in the same
type of way that make people feel good
like hey if I put data into the system
I'm it's enhancing my experience of the
real world and so you feel like and you
so you feel like there's a physiological
like that there is I mean obviously
there is you're right about the dopamine
hip yeah but you feel like that's
actually fundamental to what you're
doing that you want people to feel this
sense of hey I've you know this like
visceral sense of hey I've got some
dinner I accomplished something yeah it
doesn't need to be down to like the
chemical level of it but you know this
um you know I always think of foursquare
as like we should be able to make you
know these little guides that live in
your pocket like a guide to the city
that basically has all the knowledge
that your friends have about all the
places in the world and that wherever
you end up bringing your phone that
guide can come to life and say hey these
are the things that you need to
attention to and so it doesn't have to
be like one of those one player rewards
like a badge or mayor mayor mechanic
right those might happen all the time
but as long as you know I can be
someplace they haven't been before and
Foursquare can surface a little bit of
information for me that helps me
understand that place or make mine you
know my 15 or 20 minutes I spend in that
place a little bit more interesting
again that's really like no one's really
done stuff like that before right we're
showing that when you do it like it
works it works pretty well so you so you
talked about putting data into it kind
of it's sort of incentivizing people to
put data into foursquare yeah we have a
video and I don't know if we can cue
this up or not but it's you guys posted
this thing which is the map of guest
check-ins director hurricane do we have
this up so this is it you can see the
dates going by there and you can see all
this activity move literally move out of
the the lower part of actually I haven't
seen this yet this is gonna awesome you
haven't seen this it's really crazy cuz
you can see them migrate she kept up
late again play again we run that one
more time so you can see this a lot of
activity downtown and then that's rad
right how I mean it goes dark yeah well
the way though the power does in a way
and the way people's ability to get down
there so so this data is obviously very
valuable and I mean you're using it for
stuff that is like hey I love this bar
or this restaurant there was an article
in the believer kind of a little bit of
a mean-spirited foursquare article where
they said they're kind of making fun of
the idea that people say it's it's like
saying cigs that things like people talk
about mac and cheese in williamsburg it
is very surface information yeah do you
see that date is valuable I mean what
you just show what we just showed is
important that's like a lot you know
life-threatening situation you guys are
collecting all this information yeah are
there other uses for that data are there
other ways that you can utilize that
data that you can share that data I
think everything that you see going on
in foursquare now like an hour explore
recommendation engine that's that's like
the the you know that's the you know all
the magic that we're trying to deliver
to people like we we have all these
folks that give us you know a little bit
of information about what they do every
day with the types of coffee places they
go to the different places they go to in
williamsburg please they go to all over
the world and we take all those check-in
data points and we can really we can
start making these recommendation
engines that are personalized to people
like four for the history of local
search on the internet it's always been
like if everyone here goes to you know
Google or Yelp right now and we search
for sushi we all get the same results
like that is that's broken that's so
super broken because we all have
different tastes our friends have all
been in different places we all had
different experiences like it's just
it's very clear clear that that stuff is
going to change you want you want that
to be for a person not yeah just a
generalized yeah the big thing that
we're able to do that no one's been able
to do before is be able to have
personalized local search results for
every person for any person at any given
point in time right so Foursquare search
results are different depending on the
intersection you're standing on the the
day the day of the week it is the time
of the day it is like we can potentially
get into things where it's like you know
is it colder than it normally is is it
warmer than a no noise where would where
do people normally go around these times
and so you know you look at that those
check-in points there and you know
sometimes people look at Foursquare back
oh it's cute it's about points and
badges and stuff and like that's great
that like you know people get that part
of it but mean that was four days a data
up there and that just shows like how
Foursquare foursquare in New York is
like a living breathing type of organism
there's all sorts of interesting data
that's being teased out of that and it's
are responsible to take all those data
points and use it to help everyone in
this room and everyone in New York ever
in the world use that to make better
sense out of what's going on nearby
interesting so I we have to wrap up and
fortunately there's a lot more I want it
there's a bunch of questions that didn't
get to but tell me about do you see
Foursquare as a company that IPO is like
are you gonna are you if I mean are you
a facebook is this does this become a
public company is that your everyone
asked us this all the time like what
when you guys going to IPO how soon is
going to be a tight it's like one of the
last things that we think about right so
our job is just to build the best
products that we can right now we've got
just over 25 million users almost 3
billion check-ins and in order to
compete in the scale which we're
competing with like we're one of the
like we're the smallest of the big
companies right now right and so we've
got to grow our audience we've got to
grow the business we're going to figure
out how to work better as teams and
everything and so if we figure out all
that stuff than those are the questions
that we got to start thinking about but
for now it's just you know how do you
build stuff that's better than the stuff
we're launching today and how do you
build stuff that just people love using
every single day
well thank you very much for coming
everybody you got to come back there's a
lot more way to go to UM stick around
does you stick we don't go anywhere and
you guys don't go anywhere we have a
Paul went to maker faire another wild
trip with Paul take a look at this and
we right back with with paul young guys
it's copy a lowball time I'm in here at
maker faire which is kind of like a
Renaissance Fair for for nerds for no I
guess rid of thoughts fairs are for
nerds it's like a to renaissance fair
for makers I'm gonna see what a see what
I can see and maybe maybe learn how to
program a tithe on and build my own
robot I don't know whatever
so this is Tommy Wars is the official
name that was we came up with at the
beginning of the 72-hour build off so
everything in here was built in 72 hours
yeah we actually have two potentiometers
there's one in this thumb and one on
this thumb and there's an Arduino
program that's basically monitoring
those two potentiometers and determining
whether or not there's a pin based on
the threshold and the amount of time
that the thumbs are down so these are
the 12 unusually for I bear the pub or
yeah and then basically tell me nobody
says that uh-huh yeah are you really
that bad
it's so cool when I was covering it this
kid with his dad look I like I skated
past them and he's like whoa and I like
I was like wait for it wait for his like
he's got a skateboard I felt like just
like a superhero it's bright up just
before I'll do we got a straight okay I
can go all the way it'll do you like
four miles an hour yeah oh my gosh is
this like the primary expression of what
you do absolutely the blog there's
there's nothing better in the world and
taking something up here and then
transform you into reality and having
everyone enjoy it it's the best feeling
in the world can you power side in this
it's a blue sparks gone well you've
transformed relaxation into reality and
just kind of positions oh yeah I don't
have to go anywhere you know it's I've
gone to the relaxation town on the scale
stop so he's like gonna be about it's
about to be impaled this is vertical how
do you turn you figured out oh yeah
right of Portsmouth Virginia um yeah
totally schoo stirs we're right on the
ocean road this all the way up oh no you
can't handle top speed we took an
electric wheelchair basically cut it up
welded a bunch of stuff onto the chassis
modified a little bit and no now it has
a hammock that's suspended in this is
awesome
you said it could get up to five g's its
person has a Deadman switch whoever lets
go of the Deadman switch first losers
obviously but then it slides down anyone
died yet you have a barf bag ready dad
it was nice knowing him
oh my gosh totally fine the whole time
and then sooner to stop my eyes are like
yeah like getting my eyes kept going I'm
like shaking and I'm like woozy I
actually want a hot dog now I want to do
it again really bad I'm not really into
the spinning that's how goose died now
I'm having a lot of fun here but uh I
don't know maybe I'm having too much fun
you know America used to build things
he's the go places uh feel like I should
make something myself green LEDs I
really need soldering iron few days I
don't know how to solder I don't hold a
soldering gun I have some stores this is
the Raspberry Pi starter kit which I've
been told to get and I gonna fill with
this stuff but uh it looks really cool
so I'm gonna try to build something with
it and you know we'll see what we'll see
what happens it's gonna be an adventure
and I can fall on my face but that's
what this squirts all about its
discovery yeah
sad
the sad truth is that Paul discovered
that you need to go online to use the
Raspberry Pi kit and can't make anything
with it all right i want to bring out
our next guess they are editors from
polygon calm our new sister site that
covers video games i'm told so please
welcome Chris plant and Russ fresh dick
yeah have a seat be careful be very
careful oh my god I'm firefighter the
irony i'm telling you to be careful than
I trip that's what how do you imagine
can you imagine that happening I just
hadn't uh Chris and rush rush rush can
call you rush you can is that the dog
hey man I just how you hate your name
really hate the whole thing Ross rush
thick is the hardest name to say but
you're doing such a good job at oh but
it's I just feel like I gotta I gotta
try did you know fresh dick is German

right the obverse time I landed in
Germany every woman was like frost exact
I and I am hungry just thinking about
your name right boy so um anyhow so if
you guys don't know have you gone des
has everybody here gone to polygon have
you gotta fall back well everyone guys
here clapping icmp over here not
clapping do yourself a favor okay you're
abusing yourself by not going to polygon
and reading their news news it's new
cures that doing alright the things
we've got a few think of IDEO games and
actually so you hasn't been doing this
thing called press reset or press reset
you know I don't want to go out people
pronounce it okay I go with press reset
anyhow you've been they've been doing
this this multi-part kind of documentary
about building the site launching the
site and it is really cool it's very
cool and we actually have a clip from
the launch this is like the launch video
take a look at this you get a taste of
what they're doing which is very
interesting
the best thing about working with these
guys is I love competing with them and
they're my best friends the best start
performing with these two guys is that
keep me in line and it's a lot of time
describe our acting when we rid of her
hot
you
yes thank you budget towers I'm going to
take weeks or practice you had two great
movies we really weren't great great
preparation and uh no but but but and we
will look at some press reset but you
guys had this you let you you know you
you had this big launch yeah you've been
working on it for how long how long had
you been working uh since January it's
pretty much when we brought the team
together and brought everyone in and
talked about what we want to do did
anyone cry when you launch boy yeah they

yeah oh yeah what do you think uh I
think it looks great it's fun hmm but
you're we're talking back slate I played
it and you took issue with the fact that
much of halo 4 have you guys seen a lot
of these halo games Amelia within five
minutes you're shooting aliens what more
do you look at you looking for something
a little bit more you know raid
negotiate also have my crazy but are the
halo aliens like a little outdated now
they're pretty cartoonish cuz these
little guys boy shells and they like a
silent cartoon guarantee mortgage-free
had to like you immediately sat down at
the table and it was just a lengthy
conversation about how to work out your
problems you know what if instead of a
gun what if instead of a gun you had
like a I don't know a really advanced
smart phone bill you can find some bills
yeah yeah you have you carried around to
scroll with what it one-handed a quill
in the other the red team only wanted to
get 40 all right okay fine halo don't
buy it that's mine that's why Wow hey no
no I could have made it what did you
know wait do you review yet we did
review it what'd you get what'd you give
it what are we a 9.5 it was a very
pocket but I give it
a you know an eight yeah and eight Wow a
point 80 point uh new assassin's creed
buy it or don't buy it that's a bit of
bit of an issue there uh what do you
mean well apparently you need about 10
hours before you actually kill anyone in
the new assassins clear that sounds
great that's that's great Joe so you
love this Martin talking I just think
that can't we get somewhere in games I
know this is not your fault it is
actually my job you baby so cut
responsible how'd you think we get
somewhere in games where we're not where
the thing in your hand is not always a
gun there have been games were like the
thing in your hand is a flower perhaps
or like like what what game is that
flower yeah let's be fair you play as
the wind so okay there you go yeah this
is yeah but a game where there's this
fall okay fine civilization you can be
diplomatic oh don't give me the strategy
game stuff I'm just saying what about uh
what about what's your voice your
favorite game right now right now a big
fan of dishonored Oh dishonored I've
been playing good name right there's
parts that game read on to kill people
but there's a lot of part you don't even
have to kill people that's true there
you can make it Michael dishonored I'm
like the I'm like an old grumpy Andy
Rooney guy my word is all these games
our kids do you ever kill I don't know
what that voice is um so what is your
favorite game right now I think probably
Dishonored XCOM is also very good but
that's a strategy game and you don't
like tragic I do hate strategy and
there's no diplomacy I like need for
speed most wanted really yeah what
driving what youyou we're going right in
the joggers you're like I'm sorry
strategy out the door racing man maybe
not what is the job my favorite game
probably of the last I don't know ten
years is fallout 3 Oh excellent game
yeah you don't kill anyone better you
kill people yeah I don't get me wrong I
love killing people okay okay hi and I'd
like to do it in real nasty ways yeah I
mean just the other day dishonored I was
throwing people into the fireplace after
I killed them hey you didn't even happen
I just partly the Bob okay by the way I
recommend if you if you're anywhere
where there's a fireplace just stuff for
the bodies right in there talk but um
you know what but I like games where you
have to do a little bit of talking
before you kill people sure who's that
you know yeah get to know him get to
know him a little bit you do and then
merge
and give them a little nice out there oh
all right we have to wrap up fortunately
a very short amount of time but we do
have a real clip of press reset they
don't show you guys I want to thank you
for coming I'm sorry that we have such
limited time I promise in the future
that I will talk to you again not on the
show but I think maybe imperfect twitter
at the office perhaps or uh but take a
round of applause for Russ and Chris I
have no idea what happened I'll just be
bitching and take a look this is a clip
for press reset you guys should go check
out polygon and watch all this stuff
because it's awesome today is day one of
pgs only gaming convention with Wi-Fi is
banned I don't really understand how
that's possible being in Japan TGS is
definitely a different beast entirely
there are many cultural and language
barriers that Western members of the
press have to get over let me move this
up it's good here good bad
there's something that I love and I'd
read about video game shows for the
moment you get there you're exhausted
you're stressed out it's like a lot of
process to just get me here and then the
moment it's over you're like man I
really miss it okay yeah can we address
this though because say I had never been
in Japan before I think before I went I
was envisioning a very alien experience
it was more grounded than I was
expecting it to be what is it focus on
what that
in all seriousness I was that was I was
very abusive to our guests yeah I look
Paul O'Neill I are back but I was very
abusive to Russ and Chris and I'm sure
they'll never come back but they are
wonderful men and the site is really
awesome then you should go check it out
we've come almost to the end of the show
let's point out that i brought a flag an
american flag in a lumia 920 two things
that go right great day and i believe
that i am now immune to any sort of
criticism no I mean while you're holding
this as long as you put them down these
things our tokens is mindy i think when
i think of the Lumia i think of America
um okay so thick America so we're we're
any way to America we're America that
buys huge foreign companies without
actually buying I'm from Wisconsin I
just mean a weighty weighty American
guys outweigh just carry on okay Solly
we have a show to wrap up yeah okay

joke you want to know I want to know
