2014 the post samsung post samsung wrap
up i'm josh Topolsky I'm Ross Ross Ross
Miller's here and I'm I'm sorry I don't
know what's happening i'm still thinking
it well we're still recoiling really
from thing that just happened a moment
that will the will all never forget live
in infamy yeah in infamy michael bay had
a meltdown on stage during his he had a
little appearance at the samsung event
he apparently the teleprompter was
broken he had no idea what he was
actually supposed to talk about and
instead of winging it when she said he
would do he just bailed it was that was
winging it is extremely uncomfortable as
you know Michael Bay is a minimalist
that was as little as he wanted to do
yes our nation I don't want to block my
that's fine that's good what is
happening okay Oh Eddie yeah that's not
important what is important is Michael
Bay yes we hope he's okay Larry we wish
him well very uncomfortable why don't we
just watch it let's just watch it we
watch it let's just take a look at the
clip if you haven't seen it here's
Michael Bay having a very uncomfortable
time on stage of Samsung and just
bailing yeah take a look
Michael Bay how is everyone today ah my
job as a director is I get to dream for
a living Michael you know you're known
for such unbelievable action well what
inspires you out what how do you come up
with these unbelievable ideas I create
visual worlds that are so beyond
everyone's normal life experiences and
Hollywood is a place that creates a
viewer escape and what I try to do is I
as a director I try to the type is all
I'm sorry but I'll just witness tell us
what you think yeah we would just wing
it right now um god i taked i try to
take people on an emotional ride and um
the curve how does it how do you think
it's gonna impact uh how're you has
experienced your movies excuse me I'm
sorry I'm sorry okay Oh God oh I mean
part of me is laughing I'm like I feel
awkward and align part of use dying
inside a little bit to say like I feel I
feel kind of bad I i get i get ricotta
thought I do bay it sucks like his
teleprompter failed right and that's not
a great experience I mean he would have
had to basically just ad-lib hey maybe
very nervous on stage some people are
not using directories behind the cameras
now the guys although he has done
commercials and stuff but he wasn't like
it's not improvisational he's others a
script he's planned everything an event
I mean it just it just you know it just
is it's so delicious how bad how bad
it's see it's tabloid in the bed a
little it's a little tabloid but it's
just in my understanding is Michael
Bay's a pretty intense dude pretty
temperamental dude and this may have
only been a small a real small taste of
what he was he walked away before we
actually saw the
full blown yeah you gotta hand it to him
he leased just bailed right what's
happening something running into this
tent I don't okay good anyhow but but so
that weirdly became that we talk above
that we were not playing on talking
about Michael Bay but then what happened
is he did something amazing during the
Samsung event there's actually news
since I had real news right that wasn't
just a famous director was there's
there's no loss of his having we dinner
show this morning right after LG yeah
we've done that since then there's been
panasonic you were not on that show I
was not on the theater razon I was
dieter yeah I know we look much well
he's more blonde he's playing more
please get a bond way more attractive
laundry style more consistent that's
right yeah blonde beard though on beer
just always weird but yeah so we did an
LG after show and and then we were like
hey world in the Samsung after you know
little did we know we'd get this extra
treat of weird stuff happening on stage
but so they introduce actual products
let's talk about some of the products Oh
a bendable prototype 105 inch those is
another 5 inch ultra HD television bitch
Ultra HD I guess is their branding for
4k I mean there's some debate about what
ultra cookies about this yeah I've seen
what I think Vizio panasonic they're all
saying ultra HD are ya is this the same
will treaty everywhere same for can you
know i don't i don't i'm not sure that
we know the answer to that i think
there's some debate about whether altra
HD is a single resolution or a set of
resolutions and how they introduce this
ultra HD bendable display this this this
is a display that goes from curved to
flat and so let's be clear so the 105
inch is a real TV that's going to come
out that's right 50 120 x 2160
revolution resolution just like the LG
one right 85 inch pro it's an 85-inch
that's right 105 inches of real TV yes
which is just is curved is not current
it's it's curved that one's curved that
would be on sale it just a curve it
stays curve because that's not how many
language that's 105 inch ultra HD then
they showed a prototype of an 85-inch
which it goes from curved 2 flat 2 flat
yes and nobody knows why no one knows
why you won't curve in the first place
if michael bay hadn't gotten off stage
we would know why the TV can go
from curve too flat I mean he didn't
know ya know he
it was going to be revealed on his
teleprompter and now we'll never know we
will never know why the TV why don't you
let all right guys I'm cool no it's over
it happened what a Michael Bay by the
way he's close enough that he could just
roll in here right now and flip this
table and just rip our faces off you
really think he's gonna bring faces
you're saying this earlier too I think
that if Michael Bay attacked you he
would first you'd rip the flesh flesh
off of your face to face off then he'd
punch a hole through the skull okay and
then you'd be dead what did he do face
off no he didn't do face off that's uh
is that a John Woo movie might be John
Woo its face off John Woo that just
invent that that's definitely John will
because there's a scene with Doug's and
it's tell me yeah right the white doves
that's who I does that the classic John
will move anyhow but getting back to
Samsung CES announcements uh till he had
that there's yes so there's these team
new TVs up galaxy tab pro and note pro
tablets mm-hmm and you've got no three
here and you were talking about how much
you love no I wasn't I wasn't talking
about that I have I have a note 3 here
that I'm messing around with and dumb I
am I'm blown away I've not used it's
been a while since I've used the Samsung
stock and not stock Android but like a
samsung android stylish with i can i
spend an hour disabling applications on
this and it still has like all kinds of
things that are super annoying yeah like
their interface stuff is completely out
of control I don't know who's doing
their design I don't know who's
responsible for what's happened on this
phone but it just is really really
depressing yes look listen okay the
phone is good some of the stuff on here
is really interesting it's just like you
have to get through a thicket if you
will a forest of a tangled web of Wyrd
UI tweaks and customization that seems
completely arbitrary and rant and like
just meaningless but you can't put
here's a random one you can't put
widgets on your lock screen if you use a
pin or a pet or a swipe motion if you
lock your phone in any secure way you
can't have any widgets on your lock
screen because you can't decide that's
weird because every other android phone
lets you hang on the locks were
that's not a google thing android thinks
like oh sorry that's not a google thing
it's on android thing samsung thinks
there's a security issue which is weird
cuz all i want to look at the web I feel
like Samsung assumes their users are so
stupid that they're immediately going to
do something awful with the phone well
they do have what simple mode which is
actually great i think yeah I'm secure
yourself on here anyhow but this is a
we're done with the note 3 but but they
introduce these new tablets there's a
12.2 inch right he's at the tab pro no
that's the notice to the tab pro has ten
point four inch in a 12.2 inch version
oh there's okay I'm very confused our
nose right 10.1 inch that's right galaxy
tab pro has an 8.4 inch 10.1 inch 12.2
inch yo years no arrow next to it I feel
like I don't know call me crazy but I
feel like the lawsuit has had little
impact on the design of Samsung products
I guess did they have hardware issues do
they get they get slapped for the
hardware I can't remember exactly what
exactly the attack was I don't remember
either anymore but uh at any rate so
they got new big tablets 12 12 point to
yes 10.4 can you tell by the way that
we're already feeling the burn video so
I'm getting sick I'm losing my own was
there and said I'm extremely ill and
like little investment we have a riotous
already down like we've got one man down
yes he might go bad did that he piece
but he we think he has the flu yeah so
he's corn we hope you're okay you know
but the big thing here is for pain
multitasking which is basically saying
this version enjoys getting closer to
desktop varied you can now do way more
at the right time some new UI stuff on
it right obviously pen input and then
actually this UI the stuff they're
showing off here is definitely some of
the more handsome work that Samsung has
done oh yeah I'm still there when it
comes to their mobile products mm-hmm
because there's a lot of bad stuff but
this actually looks really nice I can't
say what it's like to use because I
haven't used them but you know not a
huge announcement but they're gonna be
certain people who are very excited
about this definitely like puts it I
mean when you think about a 12 point 2
inch tablet in a 16-9 aspect ratio right
is there early 1610 or 69
I think there's a 1610 it's little
doesn't look narrow enough to be my
crazy wait 16 10 / 16 10 is the narrow
yeah right doesn't look narrow enough
316 10 I just get me out at anyway so
careless me back to a normal place let's
say the thing that like these Pro models
use and I think the a sous is another
example that is this divergence a room
windows 8 first came out and they're
showing we're talking figure out this
tablet keyboard hi hybrid yeah with the
tab pro the note pro they're offering
bluetooth keyboard and mouse for
accessories they really do think this is
that be all computer i think it's why
the right this is multi-pane well yeah
yeah yeah now they're definitely trying
to turn android on tablet into basically
a laptop everything in replacement right
yeah and in some ways i mean with what
they're doing it can be mm-hmm we were
saying i think last night we were
talking about i can't remember now
because i'm so tired talking about the
idea of crumble it's a show flood-prone
on me know i know that's the crazy part
is that the official CES is not he's not
started yet but they were talking about
the idea of having you know a Chromebook
with android apps window to android apps
and I mean this is you know it's pure
Android but right you can see how if you
could talk you doc this with a keyboard
its utility goes right goes way i'll
just give up but they're saying they're
selling a bluetooth mouse with us to
like they're taking and what are the
price points on these do they announced
uh let me see we don't have price points
no I assume these are these are going to
be some of these gonna be carrier deals
probably I mean I'm sure there's a cell
glt sorry they do avail to you they're
gonna have both right alright what else
did they announce I can't something
about Michael Bay so it's hard to
concentrate yeah and I am losing my
voice well same thing we saw with LG and
we're seeing with other companies like
the other 4k streaming stuff the partner
here is Amazon Hastings came on for LG
yeah but netflix porque it seems is also
on samsung they're getting was a
Technicolor and go will stream 4k movies
Amazon's may be a 4k streaming partner
for here yeah I mean Samsung elves are
just pulling out all the stops it's like
bring that content I get it because the
cable companies haven't announced any 4k
options right now it's going to be
internet streaming yeah it's going to be
internet streaming but I don't see how I
don't see how they're going to be able
to do this except to the people with
just the most ridiculous bandwidth
right I mean offices with big fat pipes
like I don't know heading to a consumer
yeah maybe in Kansas City but to an
average consumer I don't know where
they're going to get the bandwidth
required to stream any of this content I
mean it's aspirational it's it's almost
like they're with a future per fitting
essentially because like no one is
buying an 105-inch curved TV right for
case well I mean if there are other 4k
options but there are still the point is
I mean this would be exclusive to
Samsung okay so there's a huge truck
outside right now we really got to get
thicker walls next year I mean I thought
we I thought we had hard walls this year
I really felt good about it I have a
hard time I gotta do something barrels
in the first place it's cloth yeah a
little bit cloth yeah a little bit it's
always been the chicken in the egg thing
because no one's gonna buy a 4k
television unless there's 4k content
even though new consoles aren't 4k
alright I mean I just really were so far
away from 4k being a thing right I think
we're at least five years away from any
kind of even beginning adoption a 4k
right you know I mean like I think we're
five years away from the first consumer
spending money on 4k TVs well how long
was it with 1080p here before I became a
thing I mean you know HD existed forever
in Europe and Asia right before I came
to America which actually is a great
example of how long the stuff can hang
around and other play even another place
again before gets to to our shores but
beyond that like we've got bandwidth
issues and contend with delivery issues
may contend with and the fact that
almost everybody is going out right now
I'm buying brand new 1080p televisions
right so you know we're at right now in
this like golden age of television TVs
have become wildly affordable in the
last I take 10 years right the kind of
price drops we've seen for really high
quality television is a little bit
insane so we've seen this decrease in
cost of TVs we've seen this increase in
quality of the stuff you watch on your
TV's better delivery for things like
movies we're getting rentals and
purchases faster because of streaming
and like so everybody's kind of like
yeah TV is a thing so they're out there
buying their buying Roku they're buying
apple TV they're buying consoles that
will play nice as a home entertainment
okay that's bad
I'm totally out of that job the plain
ice is a home entertainment option and
then you're gonna go like hey oh guess
what there's another thing it's been
better than this I just don't think that
consumers nearly ready for that not here
no I mean not when we've only had like
10 years of HD I don't even know if it's
been 10 I mean listen five years ago go
back to the game called the game console
thing five years ago yeah we were just
figured out blue ray HD DVD we didn't
know what a non 480p movie would look
like that I mean remember the we didn't
do HD it was in game where it was a 480
console and that was like the most
popular console in America I mean might
still be the its largest out there with
a playstation 2 yeah really close people
are still jamming on their weeds doesn't
sound right it's gonna wing it but at
any rate um so okay so so I just think
the 4k pushes the real exciting you can
roll it out it's yes and be like hey
look at this new thing we have but in
reality you're selling favor where but
also reality in the u.s. I think we were
talking about us content partners i'm
very curious international LG and
Samsung both Korean companies and
broadband Korea's already juicy story I
think you'll see it happen in Korea much
sooner right you still you have to have
the content you have to have the cameras
mm-hmm you know every TV studio has to
have the cameras every you know if
you're going to do a soap opera in 4k
like I need a room full of cameras
you're going to do a newscast a 4k need
a room for cameras you're going to shoot
a drama you need I mean I guess you can
shoot up there are four K devices out
there but most people aren't using them
right it's also you know as an example
like I know for a fact that a lot of
networks shoot at 720 mm-hmm you know so
if we're still shooting a 720 and we're
talking about trying to go to 4k I mean
people aren't even doing full HD but
this is again this is aspirational
technology depends on how far out are we
talking about while we're talking five
lugs an years this is the year Paul
Allen bias 4k next year and you know
maybe a CEO Qualcomm will get one year
after we'll start working away down the
executive chain who is yeah who is the
customer you think it's like a Paul
Allen well mark cuban what are they what
are they watching on it there's no
content
you know but they're not broadcasting
mavs game in 4k Mark Cuban might have
his own 4k camera set up somewhere in a
state like I'm in the original I guess
as possible but I which by the way I'm
sorry we're gonna go back to that for a
second he wore sweatpants and dress
shoes like we completely forgot about
this on stage samsung had a lot of like
a weird stuff celebrity gasps happening
I'm sure they expected like some kind of
chatter I mean whoo Mark Cuban though he
just kind of does what he wants all this
it's not kind of right like I'm
sorry now it's okay I've already sworn
completely completely like thrown all
sense of propriety to the wind here
right I drop an f-bomb in the Michael
Bay post you know what it's time to draw
people not children no time to swear for
no reason because challan dispelled
Adamas rigor has been has been like
yelling at me in the trailer that I that
he says that I swear I put spice
inserted swear words where they don't
need to exist and I disagree you
discipline crave come on all right so
what else is samsung announced I long
after my fork a rant I do think the 4k
size is annoying I think it's annoying
the way the 3d was annoying it's like
right you got to have it you get you
needed you want and it's like no
actually people don't need it or want it
you just need to show something off I
just feel like isn't there a better way
to focus your energy is there something
more interesting you could do than try
to sell a new television or a baker
television or a curved television am I
being curved is the biggest scam of all
time it's the wood it's like a gimmick
that's worse than 3d and worse than for
cam nice a 4k a gimmick cuz it's it's a
resolution but don't know in 3d there
are people who enjoy that feeling curve
I don't get cuz if you're straight ahead
curved makes sense if you are five feet
to the right five feet to the left the
hell are you looking at your vistas are
your straight ahead no I mean it's not
it's not like it's wrapping around you
know it's it's marketing foiled by
geometry simple mouth my guess is my
guess is that the argument will be you
can have an IMAX experience right in
your home but the problem is an I max
screen is gigantic it's really really
big it actually does
wrap around you yes where is 105 TV even
if it's really me that is very large
you're still going to be sitting like 12
feet away from it or something yeah the
thought is like we remember we're
looking at the oculus rift last year
like they were doing the curved a little
bit just to say like this is your
peripheral vision we're going to cover
it up yeah I don't think people are
shooting for curved I don't think their
students say this is your peripheral
vision just no think about that no it
demands and I don't see any cameras
every commands a bi and I kind of buying
that it's just not going to buddy's
going to provide right there's no
ecosystem for 4k I get we're building
ecosystem 3d be tried for can't make
sense because it's a natural evolution
right resolution goes up that's a real
thing you know cpus get faster screens
get higher resolution like those are
things that make sense and are real and
that we actually have found utility and
then useful right right we know that
like adding memory making faster chips
adding screen resolution like that has
positive benefits that people really
respond to write what we don't know is
you know will they respond to insane
gimmicks like your TV its curve and they
won't what's gonna happen is it's going
to be like 3d and next year they'll have
some other things like we made triangle
does it be fair 3d lasted a long time it
got close but all seekers your zero so
basically announced like 3ds dead yes is
it we're not they said we're not making
any more three details before k is the
thing 4k i can i can i can understand
the argument even if i don't fully agree
that it's going to happen really soon I
get the 4k is a thing that will happen I
believe the 4k will someday in the in
the distant future replace 1080 but if
we're a decade away we're decade away so
here's how many people will buy them
sooner than that but we're a decade away
from it replacing what exists or like
being I give it to change the impossibly
affordable even like a black friend
there's a match of the internet a decade
imagine the web in a decade imagine
streaming services of a decade can you
even I mean if we have them think about
the dial up in the air like we could not
have even like imagine an HD video back
to the straight assuming the humanity
exists at ten years of course we'll
probably all going to get wiped out by a
dirty bomb or something a prize orange
room at the drone with carrying a
dirty bomb but if that doesn't happen in
a decade will probably be watching for
Kate element and will be angry about
these 8k triangles like enough with it
8k
that's the attack in my day with 1080p
psyched about technology I love
technology what I don't like is
technology for the sake of new
technology for the sake of saying it's
new and I do feel like they're in
something to the 4k push that's like I
know you want us to want it but we don't
really need it it looks great I mean but
my TV looks amazing this is this is the
pixel density argument at some point the
screen size you have your far enough
away the screen in pixels don't matter
we don't have consoles that can do 4k
gaming in any level of detail or quality
but this is definitely a get off my lawn
kind of argument right now because in a
couple years not it's good on my lawn
get on your something I want okay how
the other thing I want talk about for
samsung s is early on pre BAE free BAE
this is a new service where you buy and
sell clips of Michael Bay FL be down
this is president CEO BK Yoon this is
returned with a smart home stuff which
was interesting imagine taking a call
from your refrigerator without picking
up your smartphone I love it can you
imagine so just like I'm like reaching
for a beer in the fridge also you might
all my water dispenser says you have a
phone call I feel like I'm talk tier 1
or dismiss here's the amazing thing
about mobile phones they go in your
pocket yeah you carry them around
anywhere they're small they're light
right it slide right into Bellamy not
the note but you know other ones are
small and tiny lights but why would you
want your refrigerator to receive a call
it's convenient it's glance and 11
majesty okay I'm going to just playing
devil's a cup maybe matter here for this
one because it's what's convenient that
you happen to be standing in front of
the refrigerator the business call comes
and you don't wanna reach into your
pocket cuz you have two bears in your
hand you know and you have Wis commands
why not just put something that's why
not just instead of having to replace my
refrigerator with the one that takes
calls why not just make a unit that sits
in the kitchen that can take calls well
eventually all they felt they can sell
for one hundred dollars let all cars not
come with like you know I'm steering
also a damn what if they could make like
an earpiece you could wear in your ear
and then when your phone would ring even
if you didn't have your phone in your
pocket you could answer a call using it
this is the Ray Kurzweil we're going to
inject
phones and tours no that's not
subscribing up bluetooth earpiece well
we're getting dinner but we're I know
but I'm just saying like that would be
more community to the refrigerator the
picks up phone calls this is also i
sound like a Luddite right now but like
again I'm all for a refrigerator tech
that's really useful like Samsung has
refrigerator to make seltzer yes that's
a cool refrigerator I want that remember
they also want you to have a galaxy gear
smartwatch and say I want seltzer if
you're wearing a goodnight refrigerator
for I'm again got two giant kegs they're
just dragging them around you like oh
yes I got these two liters I got like
this no the 3-liter remember the three
liter bottles they were like look we can
make bigger it's like I got my six
liters of coke right now I just don't
have my hands-free to answer my watches
on the world and do this because my
cocoa pour my glasses I don't want smart
classy and get up here now this is that
thing I'm chewing my mouth closed I
can't like boys I know but is there a
command for answering the call on the
refrigerator I'd probably leave me alone
oh wait no that was gay okay
refrigerator yeah okay fridge right
let's do this okay refrigerator answer
the call but I I mean there is an
element and this speaks more broadly to
this essay you wrote years ago this is
my next era the persistence idea where i
want my chapter assistants everywhere
does it look the continuous client this
is too extreme of it well well the
question about here's thing with the
continuous client idea is that first of
its great but the idea is a easier but
you want yours you're messing clients or
any kind of like while your calories to
follow you and be consistent but your
refrigerator is not a place where the
experience has to live because it's a
refrigerator our country has a
connection I understand that but then
why not just make units that go in the
house that have those things because
then you can put them in every room
refrigerator is a five-thousand-dollar
for the review their selling is probably
five thousand dollar investment right
you know you don't need a
five-thousand-dollar refrigerator to
answer a call on your kitchen maybe you
don't i just bought a refrigerator out
okay let me tell you what's does it have
internet does that mean it is a
connected refrigerator that knows when
I'm hungry okay and it has it has a
motorized arm that swings out and can
snake through my
it's like the inspector gadgets and you
just need snake through my house go go
gadget yeah and then it'll hand me food
wherever I am in the home how will that
get floor third floor it makes amazing
turkey sandwiches I don't eat turkey
sandwiches that's the problem with it
really that I only turkey and it keeps
preparing turkey sandwiches you would
think it learn I have an artificial
intelligence a little annoying so thanks
a lot samsung you made it you made a
refrigerator with a robot arm that
pretty produces sandwiches and delivers
them to me anywhere in the house and yet
the sandwiches are always wrong you just
had the buyer's remorse he wanted to
wait for the voice commands oh now you
it was twenty-five thousand dollars but
I feel like it was worth it you know but
seriously I all I'm saying is I just
want us to make technology that makes
sense I'm asking for a little bit of
sanity I know that things are a little
weird right now I know that the weather
patterns seem confusing you know there's
there's you know body parts falling from
the from the sky you know Michael Bay's
walking off stage you don't know if it's
going to be okay next week or next month
mm-hmm but when we think about making
new technology I just would like us to
say hey do we really need this is it
cool or does it suck this is a waste of
everybody's time or is it going to be
awesome and then if it's not awesome I
wouldn't make it clearly you never owned
a Tamagotchi Tamagotchi is the that's
the animal the that's a little guy you
had to keep alive right exactly
completely worthless but well I mean it
was it was it was like it was like it
was a candy crush right candy crush
Orson isn't any Russians like Oh can't
go wrong man oh it's a highly gentlemen
it's a highly addictive mobile video
game yes I think that's great if you
think that yes water a talking fridge
fridge is the guy I but I think haribol
idea candy crush people want to be
distracted by games they don't want to
be distracted by taking a call in the
refrigerator they want you know what
they want to do they want to get the
food out of the refrigerator they want
to put the food into their mouth all
this technology and constantly makes us
to tell their morbidly obese but his
hands get in and can fit into the i-road
we have almost technologies making us
anti-social this is a fridge that lets
you talk to your friend I can't believe
you
saying this to me with any kind of
straight face no this is nice travel
very you're playing devil's advocate bet
you know the truth I would never buy
that here's the thing yeah that's the
fridge is not cool yeah but I don't
think you need to be able to okay your
children or ballet barre just say your
children and children's children are
going to have talking fridges I mean
when you think about in 10 years what
the kids the kids who are born now right
what they're going to be like and what
they're going to know in 10 years it's
upsetting what are your grandchildren
going to bitch about on a hologram
triangle a bitch about their
invisibility suit you know it's like
malfunctioning in certain light their
clothes filters like their hover their
hovercraft is is doesn't reach light
speed fast enough what do you think your
grandkids will be bitching about think
you think I'll have grandkids that's
very nice oh no but if I know don't you
ask any I was asking you trying to be
polite I'm sorry if that's upsetting to
you it's very upsetting yeah well you're
hit end you're going to have grandkids
let's say they went what do you know
when you want to dress the kid topic
right now why not why don't you it's a
funny story I'd like to hear about it i
would like to hear about it too we'll
get to if you let's go deep dive right
yeah that's no I pathetically if you had
grandkids very high filtrable very
you're gonna walk off like Michael back
I'm just trying to wing it here all
right so you're so you have grandkids
this is like what in 30 years yes 30
think what are you fighting about
they'll be bitching about either beat
will there be a CES in 30 years don't
they see us it'll be and your grandkids
it'll be streamed to the brain Lily Lily
mad because the injected this the new
samsung touchwiz into their bloodstream
Oh God and oh my god it looked the
problem yeah touch boys will take on a
whole new meaning that one got a very
new meeting and but like one of the
friends jailbroken your body it really
is you really will be touch it this is
amit our grandchildren will have a snow
crash problem then I think snow crash
will bees will seem quaint and outdated
but maybe you're right maybe you saying
they're going to be their brains are
gonna get a crash by a by a virtual real
one of their friends which is being cool
trying to jailbreak their bloodstream
and then it just spread like it's
they're like they're like no HIV Oh
your friend Bobby I haven't seen him
around lately though he bricked himself
yeah trying to jailbreak try to trying
to try and do trying to unlock the
baseband in touch with it bloodstream
touch wit in fairness his fridge totem
was a good idea exactly correction so
let's let's move on there was a couple
things that happened before samsung yeah
I think people will talk about later in
the week to you have to talk about that
first I also happen there's temple steal
a su a pebble steel which is the 1st
molitor SmartWatch I could might
actually consider by right everybody in
the trailer bought one already yeah I
came back it was like he was going on
and I walked in iono was out for a
minute then I came back and everyone's
like yeah i just bought three pebblez
new pebbles Jesus I don't know what I
mean it's like why not wait check it out
we're going to get a review unit
probably one let's see what the review
says you think that you think that we
know better well he's a review everyone
I mean Christ i'm using a pebble right
now you are I like it you kind of sound
like a spokesperson at this point this
larry was happily married a pebble let
me tell you all about a job no it's a
but like we want the glanceable
information we're tired of being the
assholes that like pull phones out at
dinner table we want to look at a rib
dinner it is this better than doing this
I mean I don't see a huge this is
grateful if the I can hold my great for
a little bit of information but I just
feel like I don't know no it's still
looking down the convenience factor and
when you check your watch when you're
with somebody and you check your watch
right the first thing they think is like
do I need to wrap things up we were
talking right now just start talking
about something okay so get a day I was
talking to my friend what is that how
does that make you feel makes you feel
like I need you to finish because I have
to go do something more important yes
yeah so how is it better to do that
while you're talking to somebody than to
do this I think we're going to a
pointless almost as like we know like
okay he's checking his phone he might
get back to this conversation I mean yes
and no because I'm staring and well I'm
like Andy ruining it let's not forget
that I'm Romilly i'm a grumpy these are
gonna be rica notification so i'm
looking right at you came to like wave
with people right but the future is
you're really talking to me i'm gonna be
staring right at you and I'm just
checking my email right now it's I'm
checking email you check out your email
link google glass mark how are you
described yeah
you say it is Regis Twinkie to me for
sex reasons if the statute or to say
they're gonna say are you winking at me
to take a picture or you telling me you
want to have sex with me yes this will
be the like the more tasteful one like
no no no no I'm seriously just looking
at my view night you're not saying don't
have sex because they're not counting on
seriously just checking my email all
right so is there anything else about
Samsung when you talking about no no
that was say it that way way way I have
a lot he was going asus head he had one
interested in an Internet of Things oh
yes the other thing imagine samsung said
it's the Internet of Things last year
when Qualcomm did their keynote they
said it was the Internet it was the
Internet of Things goes the mobile
generation your enemy variable yeah
internet of things but they said they
had another term for it it was like not
generation mobile it was they'll know
but it was like not the internet of
things but it was like the internet of
stuff or the network of things it was
some variant of everything they're not
have everything the internet of every
other that's what it was yeah it's like
some minor variation that means exactly
the same thing and yeah go ahead this so
Samsung now said this is the year 2014
is the year of the Internet of Things
right which is they say every year but I
think what's happening is like let's
stop trying to define the year that the
thing the Internet of Things happens and
accept that the more things we make that
can be connected than where we're going
to connect them right and things are
going to be connected and it's not going
to happen in a year like a year is going
to be this is the time when it happened
unless Apple make something and then you
know then they'll have officially
started the internet of things right
Apple is going to make like a cube
that's just connect it but they don't
tell you what it does I do really black
cube and they're like this is a
connected in the home where hey like
what does it do it where has this live
show costume that's it you ready here
first so what happen it we're having a
real time we did a wrap a wrap up I mean
I guess we're just going to wing it
we're just we get to lose me okay so so
so we're going to skedaddle because
that's what we do here yeah but we do
have a lot to go because like the actual
nonsensical podcast that we do actual
