the new updates that Apple just
announced on stage for iOS and Mac OS
now one of the big things that up it
announced for iOS is called AR kit 2 now
that's an updated framework of its
augmented reality toolset for developers
the basically lets developers make even
more advanced augmented reality apps
using the smart phones cameras and inch
sensors now one of the new updates is
coming with a ARCA 2 is called
multiplayer AR games now essentially you
make an app an AR kit app and you're
allowed to bring everybody into one
share of the world that means multiple
people with multiple devices are all
seeing the same thing that's fixed in
space but it's made out of code and it
doesn't really exist now one of the
games that will develop just to show
this off it's called Swift shot it's a
multiplayer game a multiplier slingshot
game and it supports up to four players
at the same time now what we did was me
and dieter we're on the same team we're
facing two other attendees here at WWDC
we each had an iPad pro in 9.7 inch iPad
pro and we had a whole table full of
obstacles that we had to knock down
using a slingshot the goal of the game
was to knock down your opponent's three
flags and if your slingshot got knocked
down you had to move to another one and
use that one instead now for a game that
I have never played before we were
pretty good at it actually and we won
both of our games back to back where's
the what's up
now that said it is still quite
difficult you really have to move around
you have to get angles you have to
basically get lower higher you have to
really use the physical space to take
advantage of the full breadth of the
augmented reality features now we saw
something similar at Google i/o where
Google introduced cross-platform
augmented reality multiplayer games but
on iOS and especially with a Ark it's
sophistication you can expect to see a
little bit more polished experiences and
swift shot was definitely one of those
now it's just the first of what could be
many many many multiplayer a are apps
that developers I can make for the iOS
platform we won't see any of those
unfortunately until September when iOS
12 launches a Orca 2.0 is part of that
new iOS update and it's not coming to
the public until presumably the new
iPhones in September come out that said
developers are gonna be able to get
their hands on this stuff we're very
soon I'm gonna be able to start building
experiences that work in beta starting
basically this week so the WWDC keynote
is wrapped and now we're on the hunt for
more cool things to get on video you
want to read all the Apple news and
everything in announced period WDC check
out the verge calm sea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
