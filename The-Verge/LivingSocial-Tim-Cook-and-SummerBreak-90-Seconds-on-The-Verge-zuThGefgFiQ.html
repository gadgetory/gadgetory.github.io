if I'm related to wall I love that this
is 90 seconds on the verge brought to
you by virgin mobile daily deal site
livingsocial has suffered a vicious hack
and information on 50 million customers
was compromised in the process the
attack gave hackers access to user names
email addresses and birthdays passwords
were also compromised but fortunately
they were encrypted living socials not
taking any chances however requiring all
users to set up new passwords in the
wake of the attack this is just the
latest high-profile target with the
likes of twitter linkedin and evernote
also suffering recent attacks how much
is coffee with Apple CEO Tim Cook worth
at the moment almost six hundred
thousand dollars the site charitybuzz is
auctioning off a coffee date with cook
at apple headquarters the previous
charitybuzz record was two hundred and
fifty five thousand dollars for a day
with former President Bill Clinton
there's still 18 days of bidding left to
go proceeds for the auction will benefit
the robert f kennedy center for justice
and human rights and finally if you ever
wish there was a reality show that
played out solely on social media sites
you win variety reports that a new show
called app summer break is in production
it follows the lives of graduating high
school seniors in the weeks before they
head off to college but will consist of
a series of tweets with videos and
photos attached youtube instagram and
tumblr are the other sites that will be
involved summer break is scheduled to
debut this summer or you can just follow
a bunch of recent high school grads on
twitter and that's it for today's top
stories tune in next week when I show
