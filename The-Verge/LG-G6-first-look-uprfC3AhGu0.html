and this is LG's new flagship phone it's
the g6 and what you should know about
this phone is LG's stop trying to do
gimmicks and they've just made a really
really solid good reliable phone the g6
is all about nailing the basics this is
a very very straightforward sturdy
surprisingly little phone so the
centerpiece of this phone is the 5.7
inch display which goes very nearly
edge-to-edge and that's great because
the thing is actually not much different
in size from say a pixel it's actually a
little bit smaller yet it manages to fit
a bigger screen in there and LG's pull
that off with a couple of neat things so
you'll notice that the corners of the
screen are curved the screen itself is
actually curved and they do that to
protect it so that when it hits if you
drop it it's less likely to crack the
screen because there's not a you know a
square edge right up against the edge of
the bezel there the other thing you
should know about this screen is it is a
18 by 9 aspect ratio it's super tall or
super wide if you will and what that
does is it enables a bunch of really
clever tricks so if you were to say
multitask you can actually see more of
the two things on the screen because it
is a much taller screen to work with
LG's also made a really neat camera app
that they call square camera where you
take a picture on the top and it
immediately shows you what you've taken
a photo of on the bottom so you can see
if your Instagram shot is actually lined
up the way that you want which is really
clever other things that are really just
standard and straightforward about this
thing it is waterproof it's ip68
waterproof it has a bunch of different
kinds of Gorilla Glass actually on the
front it's Gorilla Glass 3 which makes
it pretty thin on the back you have
Gorilla Glass 4 over the lenses which
prevents it from scratching and then a
curved Gorilla Glass 5 back inside
there's a 3300 milliamp battery which is
actually a little bit smaller than LG
could have done but they wanted to make
this thing again reliable sturdy they
say you'll get more than a day out of it
you also notice that the power button
here is on the back and of course
there's a fingerprint sensor and there
are two cameras there's a wide-angle
lens at 125 degrees
Android lens at 71 degrees and what that
allows LG to do is have either toggle
the zoom mode here from white wide-angle
to telephoto or you can just zoom right
in and they say they've done a better
job of not having a balance between
those scrolls the other thing that's
neat here because they have this 18 by 9
screen when you take a photo
your previews are like in a little
carousel over here on the left rather
than a tiny thumbnail over there so you
can see what you're taking a picture of
right away inside this thing in terms of
specs it's a Snapdragon 820 one
processor which is not going to be
probably the latest and greatest this
year but it still is a very very good
processor it's got 4 gigs of RAM for
running apps and 32 gigs of storage and
then of course there's expandable
storage on side here so that's C LG G 6
it's coming to the US but we don't know
prices or release dates or carriers that
we do know that it's going to be
available in black and platinum but not
white the other thing to know about the
US version is it's not going to have a
DAC for high quality audio instead what
you're going to get is the two kinds of
wireless charging on there which
apparently American consumers care more
about for much more of everything that's
happening here at Mobile World Congress
you should check us out we are the verge
for much more about nailing the
subscribe plug there's a ton more news
happening at Mobile World Congress and
if you want to missing because you don't
have to use a quick cut I see it see
what's going on here we're getting some
we're getting some outros this is some
like jokes for the end of the video that
we're going to put in we do dance not
your monkey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
