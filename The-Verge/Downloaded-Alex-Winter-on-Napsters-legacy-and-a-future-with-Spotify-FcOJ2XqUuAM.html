the actor winter has become a
recognizable face for anyone who grew up
in the 80s but he's also spent decades
directing for TV film and a handful of
music videos but winter isn't just
interested in working in show business
he's interested in how show business
works and it all started in the very
early days of the internet you directed
a documentary on Napster all downloaded
which congratulations by the way it's
thirty one video on demand this year
mm-hmm
so just tell me how the hell you got
involved in you know it's kind of a tech
oriented person from like when you know
the matte classics came out in 83 got
online late 80s I was pretty entrenched
in that world in the early not by the
early 90s BBS world and all that kind of
stuff the early days of for regular
people not hackers they were online much
earlier but and and then as the internet
started to grow everyone was kind of
waiting for something to come along that
was just gonna blow the doors open we
all knew where the world was going but
hadn't gotten there and what was amazing
about Napster when it happened in 9899
was that overnight and the dial-up your
meaning the internet was was insanely
slow there was a service that suddenly
connected you know tens of millions of
people together in the same community at
once and there was nothing that had ever
existed like that before by a mile so I
was really taken with Napster it was
clear that the world was now like the
the dam had burst and the world was now
going to change a revocable forever then
all legal stuff happened and I became
and sort of more interested in the human
story what was happening with these two
kids who had winningly and unwittingly
unleashed this stuff Shawn Fanning and
Shawn Parker 17 18 years old
respectively I hunted them down and met
them I sold the idea of making a movie
to a major studio and I wrote it there
like 2003 2004 I was gonna make a movie
about the sort of the birth of the
digital revolution it didn't get made
there's a lot of movies don't we were
under the development hell I walked away
and then I came back to it no 9 because
you know the world had changed so much
in the intervening you know seven or
eight years since I'd first been
immersed in that story and but none of
the core issues that NASA had raised had
been solved in fact everything got worse
like
a worse like the whole and they gotten
bigger we knew the issues we're gonna
get bigger we knew that at the time I
think a lot of us online knew that
Napster wasn't about file-sharing and
music it was about global community and
transparency and you know these bigger
issues but now by oh nine we were
heading towards a world in which we were
gonna have revolutions and countries
around the internet like what happened
in that you know with the Arab Spring
WikiLeaks you know we had now the NSA
Snowden scandal you have like this these
big giant questions about global culture
and I thought well the Napster story is
a great way in to you know getting some
context around it and maybe helping add
to the conversation about this wacky ass
world that we live in today right and
there was actually another theatrical
narrative starring someone in the role
of Sean Parker oh yeah yeah so does that
work I mean that didn't put me off doing
a narrative at all you know the Facebook
story what makes the Facebook story
interesting is exactly the opposite of
what makes an after story interesting
the Facebook story is about a company
that wasn't a revolutionary company it
didn't enact global change or anything
like it came along after all of that
stuff it happened after MySpace and
Friendster and Napster and the world had
shifted
what makes Facebook interesting is the
little interpersonal politics between
Zuckerberg and everybody and that's
great it made a great movie whereas
Napster is all about the extra personal
it's all about global change and
revolution and it's not that interesting
on a personal no you did focus on some
of the internal struggle in Napster in
between the original team the founders
and then what became this kind of like
clunky business legal component that
yeah took over I think that when people
look at Napster and a lot of what
happened in the digital revolution they
get very black-and-white I think any big
global change is scary even to the
people who are on the side of the change
it's scary it's sort of intimidating
sort of like being thrown off a cliff
and you kind of go oh there's nothing
under my feet this is kind some people
scream bloody murderers are going down
and some people like wow this is rad but
I'm still really freaked out when that
happens you know we tend to respond
culturally to those things and we try to
paint them with as much of a clear-cut
black and white brush as possible and
the whole point
that I wanted to make McMasters that
there were no black and whites would
have sir it was all Gray's you can't
just side people still ask me was like
you know I tell them making the national
real like well what do you think I'm
like what do I think about was like was
it right or wrong I'm like that answer
would take nine hours you know that mean
it's like it's not there's no right or
wrong it's like it was a massive piece
of evolution that occurred in our
culture that was going to occur that did
occur and we have to live with it and we
have to work with it so to meet a lot of
the the internal politics that were
interesting in Napster that I did show
in the movie was this divide that
erupted even within the company between
the kids and the adults even within
their own company and that's really
emblematic I think of what's happened in
the in the digital revolution is you do
have a divide of sort of world
perception you know between people who
embrace and understand and grew up
online and people who didn't write all
of their recording executives that you
interviewed said I think a couple of
them said they felt like they were
ambushed you know the record industry
and and the the the industries that
fought and in general are surprised you
know you're dealing with people you know
the rock-and-roll business is not the
most stodgy end of the business world so
you're dealing with people who are
pretty radical themselves I think
everybody was kind of like what we
expected something to happen we didn't
expect you know the seventeen year old
kid and this 18 year old partner you
know with no education and no contact to
any industry and no sophistication to
come out of left field and just
completely revolutionized the world
overnight which is what was so what was
so shocking about Napster and weirdly
somehow fifteen years later I mean you
have a lot of companies trying to push
the edge of Spotify which Sean Parker's
involved in now still embroiled in in
royalty arguments and legal compliments
and all that stuff hasn't really been
solved did you get a sense from you know
Shawn Fanning and Parker and the others
who are involved you know what their how
they feel about where things have gone
yeah I mean I think the funny thing is
is how similar everybody thinks I think
that you know the Fanning and Parker the
record label has the tech people a lot
of the legal people I talk to all kind
of feel like it's all gone to a bad
place you know I sort of looked at the
downloaded story as a tragedy I feel
like everybody lost so it was ironic
that Parker basically had
go in and do for Spotify what he wasn't
ever ever able to do with Napster which
was actually make licensing deals with
the record industry for their content on
you know an online service and that was
ten years later it was wild to see you
know the same arguments going back and
forth you know in terms of our our
artists making money from this are they
being hurt by this and that there's a
big divide within the the music
community about that that still persists
today you know sides
releasing competing studies every few
months talking about that yeah you're
seeing studies every few months that
completely contradict each other
constantly I mean and they're so seems
to be so little data of any measurable
quantifiable kind that just guarantee
it's just says to any of us this is
actually what's happening on either side
I think that the wrong way to come at
this whole thing is to say well these
things are bad for artists or they're
bad for the public so we should scrap
them because they're not going away you
know it's like it's like howling at the
moon it makes no sense the the changes
are here a lot of people are resisting
them and want to go back to the old way
we're not we're its we are in it we're
way in it at this point you know we've
jumped into the swimming pool we can't
pretend we haven't jumped off the high
dive that being said I you know feel
like we should be supportive from an
innovation standpoint on companies like
Spotify whether we wholeheartedly agree
with their monetization system or not at
least are trying to drive us somewhere
because the alternative is is total
piracy which obviously isn't gonna work
well how did you come across Nasser I
know you said you were on the online
recognizing the BBS and
how did I find it yeah how did you find
it and what did you download well
everything to answer the second question
first I was working in London at the
time and I would go into my production
office there were like 25 computers in
there I'd run all of them all weekend I
would Jack everybody's computer in a
Napster and run it all weekend I never
you know used downloaded any infringing
copyright type material though it was
only fair use that's just a legal
disclaimer I think I found it because
like the people that I was communicating
with a line were like you
should go over to Napster and we should
meet over there and I was like well what
the hell is Napster and then you like
jacked into this thing and suddenly it's
really hard to explain even in the movie
to explain like what the experience was
like I mean because there's nothing like
it today you know took you 20 minutes to
get online he kept getting bumped off
and they they told me to go over an F
there whatever Napster there are all
these chat rooms all these all this
committee millions of people and then I
was like in their heart I was like
literally in their hard drive so you
were like it was really like something
out of a William Gibson novel you
literally kind of moved traversing
around through people's hard drives all
over the world in real time it was like
going scuba diving like you'd be like oh
okay and now I'm over in this second I'm
in the music and art section of the hard
drive now they've given me access to
this and I'm over in this section of the
hard drive and like this is I'm in
Russia and like some guys doing it and
they're like feeling around and I'm
watching them root around in my hard
drive it was like now I'm doing that's
like a thousand people at the same time
it was a trip you know so I think it
came to me through the social community
first and then I was like wow okay so I
can pull all this down and over to my
drive alright right thanks a lot yeah
thanks so much Alex yeah thank you and
good luck with the debt future release
and thanks and your next documentary
thank you yeah I hope people download it
stream it whatever whatever floats your
boat torrent it yeah hey whatever works</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
