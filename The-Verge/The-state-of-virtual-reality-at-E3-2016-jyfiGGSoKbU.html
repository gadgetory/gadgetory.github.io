virtual reality ever the oculus rift and
HTC vive just came out the spring and
PlayStation VR is just a few months away
so it's time for all these companies to
really get serious about putting out a
catalog that can get people excited
about the platform did that happen well
it wasn't a bad year but it's not one
that should convince anybody that
virtual reality is already here
well let's talk about the exciting stuff
first
oculus came to e3 with a slate of games
for touch promising will get more than
30 when it comes out later this year
Sony announced an official date for
PlayStation VR October 13th and HTC well
okay HTC didn't really do anything but
they had a neat mixed reality booth
oculus has hands down showing the most
polished interesting VR games at e3
every game there had some kind of cool
premise you're rock climbing you're in a
wizard duel you're playing tennis with
Tron disks the problem is nobody's gonna
get to play these games for a long time
oculus is still working through its
oculus rift back order and it didn't say
when touch is coming it suggested it
could be late this year
in any case PC gaming is a pretty
exclusive club already and then you add
virtual reality to that and it gets even
smaller oculus is the company whose
games I want everybody to be playing but
it's the most elusive platform in
existence sony says we'll get 50
PlayStation VR games before the end of
2016 and it's been the best at bringing
huge exciting franchises to virtual
reality it's going to have games from
Star Wars Battlefront the Batman Arkham
series Final Fantasy and Resident Evil
to name a few but when you actually try
them out they weren't as much fun as
they sound the Batman and Final Fantasy
games are basically short add-ons and
while Resident Evil is cool and totally
playable it's also pretty much the same
inside VR and outside it also
PlayStation VR as technical limitations
really start coming through everything
looks a little bit muddy compared to the
rift in vive on the bright side psvr is
definitely the most accessible platform
and the PlayStation neo while it wasn't
announced at e3 could give it a
graphical boost it's the only tethered
headset that stands a chance of being
more than a niche product and it has a
few titles with real potential including
the robot basketball game Riggs and
Robinson the journey a cool sci-fi
dinosaur game for Crytek HTC was at e3
but the only really notable announcement
was the fallout 4 is coming to vibe next
year that's a big deal but the demo we
saw just had one small area and not very
many features it's a proof of concept
just like almost everything else on the
vibe in the absolute best universe valve
would have shown up and introduced a new
half-life for virtual reality or
something but it hasn't made a big
announcement at e3 for years and 2016
was no exception yes there are other VR
headsets v3 but they're mostly for
special cases like theme parks and not
things people want to buy and take home
and nothing I saw offered a clearly
better experience than the rift vibe or
psvr
Microsoft is supposed to be getting into
the virtual reality game next year with
its Scorpio console but it didn't
actually say what headsets it's going to
support maybe the best sign for VR at e3
was that we got a new and pretty cool
game announced for all major VR
platforms that was Star Trek bridge crew
a cooperative game where you play four
members of a Starfleet ship's crew it's
part of a big beloved series it's
developed by a major publisher Ubisoft
and it's the kind of game that can
appeal to all kinds of people not just
hyper skilled players or fans of a
specific genre most of the things we saw
at e3 are in a pretty early stage and
we'll be hearing more soon at places
like quick con games comm and oculus is
big Developer Conference the very start
of the platforms like usually isn't the
best part of it just remember games like
rise for the Xbox and it can take years
to develop a really good game inside or
outside of VR we've got at least a few
more months until PlayStation VR and
Touch come out before the first
generation of VR hardware has started
but this year's show definitely didn't
give us enough to submit VR s future and
with headsets already going on sale the
clock is running down it's got a lot of
time this e3 of covering VR and
absolutely everything else games related
