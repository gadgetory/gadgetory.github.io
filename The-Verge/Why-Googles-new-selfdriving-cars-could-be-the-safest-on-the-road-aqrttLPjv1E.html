driverless cars for a few years now but
up until this week those vehicles always
used a human driver or two for backup
there was a steering wheel brakes and
gas just in case the computer conked out
where a person needed to take over in an
emergency but all that has changed with
the introduction of Google's new
completely autonomous vehicles the
prototype car doesn't have a steering
wheel or pedals and passengers are
buckled in Twitter essentially backseats
these cars aren't street-legal yet but
while regulators iron out the details of
when and where they can drive Google is
intent on showing that automobiles are
far safer without any input from us puny
humans Rob Medford Google's director of
safety on the driverless car project
says that more than 90 percent of
automobile accidents are caused by human
error that adds up to around 33,000
people killed every year the leading
cause of death for people between the
ages of four and thirty-four Google's
newest unit is purpose-built for safety
the form factor means it's cameras and
sensors have no blind spots and can
detect objects for 360 degrees and as
far as two hundred yards away the
all-electric vehicle tops out at 25
miles per hour and has a front-end built
of soft foam tweaks Google hopes will
cushion any pedestrians struck head-on
by the car the company acknowledges that
an accident is inevitable but says
collisions will be far less frequent and
less dangerous than with humans behind
the wheel google has been putting its
first generation of driverless car
systems through a series of tests on
city streets around Mountain View it's
the same system that's being used in
these fully autonomous models the system
can detect various obstacles and even
color codes accordingly cyclists are red
pedestrians yellow vehicles are either
green or pink the system so far can
detect cones construction zones railroad
crossings and yes it knows when a
bicyclist raises his hand to change
lanes and then changes his mind at the
last minute Google wants its cars to
drive as if a human were behind the
wheel to slow down going into a turn or
to inch up at a four-way stop as a way
to indicate it wants to go next for now
Google's totally autonomous cars are
operating just on a closed track with
plans to eventually expand a city
driving in Mountain View if and when
they become
illegal when that happens Google safety
systems will likely be tested not just
by chance but on purpose insurance fraud
is already common among tractor trailers
with scammers getting into accidents so
they can sue for damages if people are
willing to throw themselves in front of
a speeding semi imagine what they'll do
to a foam cushion car owned and operated
by one of the richest companies on earth
Google knows this is coming and it's
doing its best to play things cool every
driverless car is going to be equipped
with multiple cameras that will record
any accident meaning there'll be plenty
of evidence to show who's really at
fault as Sebastien through the original
inventor of Google's driverless cars
told the New York Times the big losers
are going to be the trial lawyers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
