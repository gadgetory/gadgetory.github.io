ces2014 everybody seems to be trying to
find the best way to track your body
your hands and even your eyeballs but up
to now this technology has been pretty
useless aside from the Xbox Kinect but I
saw some pretty cool stuff today that
might just make it into your next
smartphone Ian Kabra first I checked out
Toby an insanely accurate I tracking
technology that pinpoints where you're
looking down to the centimeter and I
asteroids anyway you look becomes victim
to a missile strike I felt like God's
summoning hellfire with every glance
Toby also lets you zoom in on maps using
your eyes and even lets you change the
radio station in the car without taking
your eyes off the road that feature
isn't quite ready for production yet I
also checked out soft kinetic crazy
oculus rift Xbox Kinect hybrid setup but
lets you view a virtual world in 3d but
also manipulate objects inside it you
can't feel the blocks you're stacking of
course but I felt one step closer to
being inside a holodeck for the first
time cameras and sensors are battery
killers though so elliptic labs
developed ultrasonic technology so your
phone and tablet can pinpoint your
location using only sound waves you can
gesture to switch songs scroll through
articles whack mobsters and answer phone
calls even if your hand is inches away
from your phone or tablet most
gesture-based interfaces are still a
pipe dream but Intel hopes to change
that with real sense a new Kinect like
sensor that it plans to ship in tons of
computers this year the company's
initial demos let you tug on psychedelic
harp strings play virtual piano and
screw around with the digital electric
guitar we haven't quite achieved the
brilliant gestural interfaces Tom Cruise
manipulates a minority report but we're
getting closer after slicing up melons
and fruit ninja with only my eyes I knew
these guys were on to something just
make sure to keep your eyes and hands
inside the ride
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
