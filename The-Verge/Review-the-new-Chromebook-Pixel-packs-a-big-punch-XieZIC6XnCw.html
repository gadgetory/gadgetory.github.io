looks just like the old Chromebook pixel
but it's better way better and you're
probably going to want one but you
probably shouldn't buy one two years ago
Google introduced a ridiculous laptop
the original pixel it had a gorgeous
screen incredible hardware mediocre
battery life and it only did one thing
ran the Chrome browser oh and the pixel
was also expensive crazy expensive this
time around Google is fixing most of
what was broken with the first model but
let's get that price out of the way
first
it starts at $999 that's still crazy
expensive for a Chromebook it's more
than twice as expensive as most other
Chromebooks and it's the same price as a
really good PC or Mac it's really hard
to justify spending this much on a
machine that only runs chrome and a
precious few Android apps the design is
almost completely unchanged from the
original and I'm totally fine with that
it's all boxy corners and clean lines
metal and glass like something out of a
high-concept sci-fi movie the pixel is
its own thing not a Mac clone not a PC
clone everything feels well built and
even dense at 3.3 pounds
most of all the design feels considered
the keyboard has been tweaked the
trackpad improved and you can even knock
on top of the laptop to check the
battery life which is a nice touch
Google is sticking with a three by two
aspect ratio on this 13 inch touchscreen
and it's a choice I'm fine with even
though I know a lot of people aren't
fond of it but it's still a great screen
with a slightly wider color gamut and
239 pixels per inch but if we're talking
hardware the biggest deal here are the
two little oval-shaped ports you'll find
where the power jack usually goes those
are USB type-c ports and they're a very
big deal yes just like Apple Google is
jumping on board with USB type-c these
fancy new ports can be used for
basically anything power display
connecting to a camera whatever the idea
of being able to use the same plug for
everything has been a crazy dream for
basically as long as people have been
making plugs Google uses it mainly for
charging and I should say that having a
power jack on both sides of your laptop
is surprisingly convenient and yes the
old-style USB plugs and SD card slot are
still here so you don't have to carry
around a rat's nest of adapters
battery life on the pixel is stupendous
Google rates it at 12 hours our battery
test clocked it at 14 real-world use
over a few days bears those numbers out
the thing just lasts and lasts google
says it wants you to charge the pixel at
night and just use it all day without
bothering to plug it in I don't know if
I really think anybody should do that
but the fact that it's not patently
ridiculous to suggest that you could do
that is pretty amazing and it's fast
really fast
stupid crazy why is it my laptop as fast
as this fast the only thing that comes
close is Safari on a top-of-the-line Mac
italo's pages fast it Scrolls fast heck
even pinch-to-zoom is fast the $999
model comes with a core i5 processor 8
gigs of ram and 32 gigs of storage you
can also spend $300 more to get an i7
processor and double the RAM and storage
Google calls that the pixel LS which
stands for ludicrous speed and no it
doesn't come in plaid if you haven't
used Chrome OS in a while you might not
know that it's come a long way in the
past year or so no most people shouldn't
use it as their only laptop and no it's
not to the point where you can really do
a ton of multimedia work easily but I
have a dozen or so ABS that I depend on
and all of them have either web or
Android versions that work great on the
pixel and you can work offline with most
of them open Microsoft Office and even
play a few games
look the Chromebook pixel is great but
at a thousand bucks it had better be and
Chrome OS has come a long way but it
still has a long way to go before it
makes sense as most people's primary
operating system so after all that I
don't think buying the Chromebook pixel
is a good idea unless you think $999
impulse purchase territory but I also
think that the speedy long lasting
beautiful machine is one of my favorite
laptops of the year Google should have
called it the Chromebook paradox</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
