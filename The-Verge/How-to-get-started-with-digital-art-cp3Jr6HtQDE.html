years ago and my style now is basically
unrecognizable from what it used to be I
drew with a ballpoint pen on paper
scanned it and it looked like this then
I started drawing digitally and it
changed everything
there's a ton of options out there and
with the right tools anyone can learn
how to do to draw so this is my main
setup and this is just a standard
entry-level Wacom Bamboo tablet that you
just plug into a laptop with a USB cable
and I've had this for a few years and
has never given me any issues
considering how badly I treat it
Wacom solves a ton of different models
ranging in price but the new $80 into us
should have more than enough features
for anyone just starting out I recently
got a nine point seven inch iPad pro and
Apple pencil mainly so I could work
while I'm traveling but really I just
use it to draw in bed I do wish I went
slightly bigger but it's not a
deal-breaker a lot of artists say the
ten point five inch is like the perfect
size because it makes all the toolbars
accessible but I think this works fine
for me and also the new $329 iPad works
with Apple pencil so it makes portable
drawing more affordable than ever if you
don't want to spend $99 on an Apple
pencil or your older iPad doesn't
support it keep in mind there are other
stylus options out there you just have
to look for features like pressure
sensitivity palm rejection tilt support
maybe it's some shortcut buttons and
this will make them move to digital feel
a lot more natural let's take a step
back and talk about the basics of
drawing to draw this bobblehead of will
or art director start with a rough
sketch laying out the proportions with
simple shapes his head is an oval his
body is more of a rectangular oval and
his arms and legs are like thick noodles
then I'll go back and add details like
his eyes connecting the ovals with more
precise lines now you can start the
inking layer this is basically going
over the rough sketch in a more precise
way and you have to be a little bit more
careful here as this is the final
version of the drawing that you'll color
in for me the biggest advantage of
digital art is the ability to work in
layers think of it like drawing on
tracing paper layers allow you to stack
them and
your image on different levels to form
the whole drawing which makes editing
the final image easier so once I have
the full outline of what I'm drawing
I just fill in the colors on another
layer underneath and for shading I'll
add a layer over that shading can be
daunting but it's pretty easy if you
think about light in the physical world
first decide where your light source is
coming from and use that as your guide
to determine which parts will be the
shadows and which parts will be the
highlights so for the shadows I take a
black brush with a lowered opacity
darken one side of the drawing and
highlight the other side and white where
the light is hitting the subject the end
result is this lovely drawing of will
drawn in four separate layers if you're
concerned about how drawing on glass
might affect you you can always look
into matte screen protectors that'll
mimic the feeling of drawing on paper I
tried though not from a company called
paper like and it really helped bring
some resistance to drawing on the iPad
so once you have all your tools we're
gonna move on to software on my macbook
I like to use software like Adobe
Photoshop but on the iPad I use clip
studio paint because it's most like a
desktop app there's all these other
drawing apps on the iPad like procreate
or adobe draw but these apps kind of
have like a learning curve because you
have to learn each apps gesture controls
like double tapping to undo if you're
not happy with any of these apps there's
always other options there software like
Astro pad or duet display that lets you
connect your iPad to a computer so you
can use it as a second display and if
you're in the market for a new laptop
all together there's always two and one
devices like the Microsoft Surface pro
so everything's on there you can use the
desktop version of Photoshop and there's
no transferring of files like you would
have with an iPad since I'm most
comfortable with the Mac OS interface
using a Wacom tablet just makes sense
for me if you're in a position where
you're trying to decide what's best for
you think more about the apps you want
to use in for what purpose but
ultimately making art is a personal
experience so play around and find your
favorite options thanks for watching
