this is the misfit Specter this is the
company's first attempt at making any
sort of headphones these are Bluetooth
wireless earbuds so there's really not
much to these you've got this little
part here that's got volume up volume
down and a play button and then you have
this clip here which houses the battery
the Bluetooth radio and the micro USB
charger and it's basically meant to be
something that's very out of the way you
can clip this inside your shirt so it
stays really hidden and then the earbuds
themselves actually tuck into your ears
really nicely and maybe the cool thing
about these is when you take these out
of your ears they actually snap together
with magnets and it's not just to help
it from getting tangled that there's
also a little bit of functionality here
to when they snap together it will play
pause whatever you're listening to so
you're not wasting battery life with the
headphones so it means you can just kind
of take them right out
let those magnets clip together and not
even worry about stopping what you're
listening to so other than that this is
pretty a pretty simple attempt at making
Bluetooth earbuds with a little bit of
fitness tracking but again nothing too
fancy like a heart rate monitor pulse
oximeter or anything like that this is
just basic gyroscopic activity tracking
along with some supposedly pretty good
sounding Bluetooth ear plugs so you can
expect to see these little later this
year mr. it says they'll be available in
the spring and they're not giving a
solid pricing on it yet but it'll be
under $200 so somewhere around the price
of other wireless Bluetooth earbuds that
you see on the market for more from
misfit and everything else here at CES
