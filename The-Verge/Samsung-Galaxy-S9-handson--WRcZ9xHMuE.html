is the new Galaxy S nine and the galaxy
s 9 plus from Samsung now if you're
looking at these you probably think they
look pretty familiar and that's because
they do they basically look exactly like
the Galaxy s8 from last year except for
one major difference we've been
complaining about the placement of the
fingerprint scanner on the galaxy s 8
since it came out so for the galaxy s 9
Samsung fixed it and moved it from next
to the camera to below the camera which
is way easier to reach even on the
larger model now otherwise they are very
similar designed you've got a 5.8 inch
display on the s9 6.2 inch display on
the s9 plus there's still Super AMOLED
screens there still have the same
high-res displays there's still have the
curved sides that Samsung calls this
infinity display that spills over the
edge and simply has actually made the
bezels to say that specials are the same
size but they're a little bit better
masked than last year's model so they
don't quite stand out as much you still
have the power button on the side you
got the volume rocker over here and then
of course there's the big speed button
that hasn't gone anywhere and on the
bottom there's still the headphone jack
which you get on both models and a lot
of the new things you can't actually see
but they are appreciated it's got stereo
speakers now so the earpiece speaker
works in conjunction with the bottom
speaker to produce stereo sound the
camera has been new and improved I don't
get into that in a minute it's got a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor inside
of it there's four gigabytes of RAM in
the small model there's six gigabytes of
RAM in the bigger model 3000 milliamp
hour battery here thirty five hundred
million power battery here both of them
a fast charging both of them FS wireless
charging both of them have ip68 water
and dust resistance both of them have 64
gigabytes of storage
both of them have microSD card slots and
both of them have gigabit LTE so a lot
of those things are familiar to s8
owners
but the big difference that Samsung is
touting this year is the cameras and you
can see on the s9 it has a single camera
and on the s9 plus it now has a dual
camera which is very similar to the
notates dual camera so it's got a
wide-angle lens and a telephoto lens
which lets you get closer to your
subject or do different types of
blurring what simpson calls live focus
affects on both models you do have a new
variable aperture lens which means that
the aperture on the camera it goes from
1.5 which is brighter than last year's
phone and one of the brightest lenses on
the market and you can close it down to
F 2.4 if you're in a very bright
environment if you're outdoors sunlight
and you've got too much light you can
shut down the aperture for better
quality photos there but you can do that
automatically through the Samsung's
camera app or if you go into the pro
mode you can actually switch between the
two which is pretty neat this is a first
phone we've seen with a mechanical
physically changing aperture which is
very interesting it is locked at 1.5 or
2.4 it doesn't do any values in between
but it still is more than pretty much
any other phone offers you in terms of
the camera quality itself it's still 12
megapixel sensor but Samsung has says it
now has next-generation dual pixel
autofocus so it's got faster more
reliable autofocus it does more
processing on chips so you get better
noise reduction than the prior
generation up to 30% so in certain
situations and then the other features
that are new are on the video side it
can shoot 240 frames per second slow
motion like it could do last year but
now I can do up to 960 frames per second
at 720p for short bursts for a super
slow-motion mode now Samsung says that
the s9 is gonna have better low-light
performance thanks to improved multi
frame noise reduction algorithms where
it combines multiple frames together to
reduce the amount of noise in the actual
image we're going to be testing this out
once we have a review in it but so far
the early impressions are pretty
promising
now the camera app has also been
redesigned so it's a little bit easier
to use you can switch between modes by
just swiping which is way easier than
Sampson's older user interface and you
can quickly switch there there is of
course the pro mode which gives you full
manual controls over white balance and
aperture and shutter speed and such so
the other thing that's new the camera is
Samsung's new AR emoji which is
basically its take on
iPhones an emoji feature it creates a 3d
animated image based on a hundred points
of your face when you look at the camera
and it then turns that into animated
gifts that you can share through the
camera app in various messaging apps you
can also customize the appearance um you
can change a hair color at glasses
change the outfit and do these other
things that you can't quite do with an
emoji it's not quite the exact same
thing but it provides a very similar
effect the Samsung is also improved and
upgraded its flagship features like
Bixby which has a new user interface
design it has a couple of new features
it can also take a picture of food and
estimate its calorie count that you can
then link to s elf as well Samsung's
also upgraded the Dex feature which lets
you use your phone as a full desktop
environment with various open apps and
things like that
it used to be using a docking station
with the galaxy s 8 now as a new
successor II called the Dex pad which is
basically a flat pad and lets you use
the phone as a trackpad or keyboard if
you don't happen to have an external
master keyboard with you now there's a
lot more in the galaxy s 9 and s 9 plus
we'll be diving into as we spend more
time with the devices but initially it's
gonna be available for pre-order on
March 2nd it'll be shipping on March
16th it's gonna come in three colors in
the US black purple and blue and the
pricing should be about the same as the
galaxy s 8 for more on the galaxy s 9
and the s 9 plus be sure to check out
