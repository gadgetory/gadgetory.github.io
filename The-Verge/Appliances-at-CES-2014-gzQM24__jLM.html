burj at CES 2014 we're just like every
other year there's been a whole range of
new home appliances to check out here on
the show floor LG Samsung and Haier have
come out with some new products some of
them are smart some of them are dumb and
some of them we never thought we'd see
before but we're gonna go see if we can
find the coolest ones not see a higher
impressed us with its innovative range
of environmentally-friendly washing
machines there's not so much like that
this year but we did find something cool
in the field of air conditioning so here
we have Haier smart air conditioner we
don't really know why it's huge I mean I
guess it's because it's a heater air
conditioner is pretty it's very pretty
this is the app that kind of acts like
the remote control for the Haier air
conditioner system you can change the
temperature just by tapping on the
number and moving it up or down and it
will change it on the actual unit
this thing is only available in China
right now it retails for about 20,000 um
which is about $3,000 let's say you're
running out to work you have to work
really early you throw your clothes in
the wash you know you can't turn it on
at that time or were you want it done
when you get home right you don't want
to start too early so you can go go to
work do whatever you have to do and at
the right time that you wanted to start
so it'll be done immediately when you
get home you can just text washer on and
the line will show you the cycle it's
gonna do and you can just tell it to
start I feel like the time-consuming
thing with washing machines is not like
telling it to wash your clothes it's
like putting the clothes in Shushan true
but it's just like a mobile way of doing
a wash we sound pretty convinced I mean
I'm convincing if I don't have to like
be armed a lot I start my washer then
that's what you know and he has no
clothes than me I probably do
so we're here with the samsung chef
collection of appliances there's a bunch
of things in this collection there's
refrigerator there's a dishwasher and
right here we're with the the chef
collection range what's really cool
about this is that it's an oven but it
can kind of be two ovens because it has
this loads right here that you can take
out and put in as as you like when you
put it in it kind of creates two
compartments so you can choose over here
upper or lower and you can essentially
cook two types of things two totally
different things like you know meats and
cookies at the same time because you can
control the temperature in the upper
compartment and the lower compartment
Maydan cookies sounds good and the top
yes that's an induction cell hub so it
doesn't get super hot until you actually
like to put a hot pan and weed on it so
yeah it doesn't there's no if there's no
smartphone app or I think you can't you
can't message it online to tell you to
cook your chicken I'm just excited to
have two ovens so a big thing for
Samsung at last year's shows with smart
fridges with tablet style screens and
hats like Twitter and Evernote this
year's show they're kind of thrown out
of the window and there aren't any
pictures like that on show right now and
there's more traditional designs like
this but they're still innovative
features so this one for example you can
open it like this and it looks like a
regular fridge with different storage
and compartment but you have the option
to open it in only like a different
section such as this so if you have a
most frequently accessed items like milk
you can open the door and access to the
milk or the food without exposing the
rest of the food to the warm air outside
so one of the few truly new appliances
at CES this year is a 3d systems booth
this is the chef jet and on the other
side of the chef jet Pro and the world's
first 3d printers for food so you can
actually print out chocolate or candy
from digital design so to be them it's
actually really good I'm gonna get this
chocolate who's actually at the texture
of chocolate
the texture is like very brittle the
taste is like chocolate it's definitely
out but yeah wow that's amazing so the
smallest chef jet will cost below five
thousand dollars when it launches from
the second half of this year and the
largest chef jet Pro which can produce
multicolored candy will be just below
ten thousand dollars and it'll come out
at around the same time second half of
this year</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
