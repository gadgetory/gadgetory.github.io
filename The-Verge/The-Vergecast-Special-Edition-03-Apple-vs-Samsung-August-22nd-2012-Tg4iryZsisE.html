edition battle vs samsung right at the
top of this I would like to apologize
for having dad hair I think when I think
I look I think I look like I've terrible
hair that's not a problem you know why
because we're talking about well your
stuff and I should look responsible so
this is a virtue at special edition
we're here to talk about apple vs
samsung the ongoing trial that is now
actually wrapped up the jury is
deliberating we don't know what's going
to happen and i'm joined by two people
from our team who are experts in
everything apple vs samsung madakari and
on the phone still at the court his nap
not gone home brian bishop o big o
thought on hey Matt how's it go man
that's good so you like it's just like
Brian judge Koh and one other reporter
yeah just Clea even hanging out I like
to call her Lucy is that allowed yeah
does anybody called her Lucy I feel like
McIlhenny would have called her losing
effort lucky who Lucky's good so it's
been a characterize us as a monumental
week in this case in in its way for the
entire tech industry and the on a monday
we had jury instructions um right so i
would happen on monday no monday they
argued about the jury instruction yeah
yeah exactly I Monday they argued about
what jury instructions they would give
to the jury done what happened what
happened on Tuesday something happened
on Tuesday right Tuesday basically the
Ravager instruction as a Carreta jury
instruction which took around three
hours or so which was oh it's Wednesday
that's what's wrong with me I thought it
was thursday because i'm usually in this
room on Thursdays that's I'm sorry Brian
look continue
yeah well basically I mean yesterday was
kind of not because they never got off
you know showed up super early I mean on
the very first day of the Father this
huge line like sneaking outside I mean
kind of a rekey that yesterday and
people were really really hyped for this
you know it's a big deal yeah lots of
being a you know you know satellite
bands they're like you know people
broadcasting this big deal and was
preceded by this most three how long
reading of jury instructions which was
epically mind-numbing and all the air
out of them people were just ready to
die by the end of the basic it was
pretty miserable people you know like
checking their email and just you know
doing whatever but after lunch it came
back we finally got us the Apple and
Samsung you know and just doing our
closing arguments which was awesome cuz
me oh you know ever faced piece last
week about how we lost the narrative red
you know in the last week this trial we
finally saw the return of dated
yesterday which is a big thing because
we should be a little bit in people that
have come in and I don't get really put
together as a whole for the jury and but
that happened yesterday so it was great
to see that kind of come together again
so let's talk about that a little bit um
I mean I will just go through the day
we're gonna spend a lot of time on
closing arguments but let's talk about
what happened sort of the beginning of
the week and then threw out yesterday
the Apple and Samsung have been and
people might not know this but the
backdrop to this case the entire time
has been Apple and Samsung arguing a lot
about what the jury instructions are
going to be whether the jury would be
instructed over whether Samsung
destroyed evidence whether Apple
destroyed evidence what the final
verdict form would look like how would
shape up you know Apple wanted to group
products into sort of representative
groups and they have been in the
background argue about this pretty
Vasily right we mean I definitely I mean
so can you characterize some of what
happened because this is now the qiyam
and the jury is in a room alone and all
they have to work with is what they've
heard in the court obviously the
exhibits they brought with them and
these instructions and this form and the
way they fill out that form is the way
the case is going to go so
he talked about a little bit back story
with with the jury instructions and the
verdict form yeah when one thing that
was implemented happened on Monday there
been months ago Apple had asked for his
magistrate that rule basically tells you
know whoever like you occasionally
happen or the jury began deliberating
how the jurors that Samsung a kind of
had a bad faith with regard to evidence
and they gotten worse having destroyed
some evidence and he granted apples
request to go and have the jurors told
they've done that because the cool to us
what this ain't gonna be said for Apple
because their sins it when Apple had
they currently hold on email because
there was gonna be potentially condemn
fight alright so let's go basically like
you know agreed with Samsung and was
going to go and tell the jurors that
both Apple and Samsung had kavya place
at this with evidence and Apple can
obviously are you mr. nicely against
that their paws that there was no edit
that they destroyed anything you know
steve jobs have been you know told to go
and preserve emails they had a yellow
in-house systems hold on to the kind of
stuff was direct evidence that from
samsung has been kind of missing by the
end of the day go Rilla said you know by
grace you guys we're going to go and
we'll be at your both side at that point
Apple and Samsung both said if you're
going to say we both did that let's just
say that just say nothing so nobody
thinks anybody did that yeah that was an
important thing because that's like a
really kind of you know labor you know
the jury's impression of sams from going
into this thing and kind of cruise could
have set a tone but i will didn't get
that which was definitely when I can't
answer yeah so basically they said okay
we're gonna we're gonna read both sides
did something wrong and if both sides
did something wrong we'll just say no we
won't we won't address it at all so that
finally happened that has been going on
in the back of the back of everything
for a while and then the jury form which
we're going to talk a little bit the
final one was given out yesterday I like
there was a there was a break in
proceedings while they literally made
copies of the form and my judge I went
back to her chamber
so that thing is 20 pages long it has 33
groups of questions on it and if you
individualize the groups of questions in
terms of claim against device and
there's no 20-odd devices 28 devices 21
devices and many many patents there's
actually seven hundred individual
questions I think something around the
area of 700 individual questions for the
jury to answer on this form so that was
handed out and then judge co-read was a
hundred nine page 84 item jury
instruction she's read it right Rancic
your live of that was she's just
hammering through it can you tell what
was that like well it was it was
impressive either this is a lot of legal
language is pretty dry and she does
kinda went through she's like terminator
I mean issues like did not stop there
was like one brief moment where there's
a spike catching her voice but she just
like you know went through it um but was
kind of funny she's like you know this
is going to be basically said this was
going to be miserable so she said let's
go make sure we have these little breaks
where you can stand up and stretch every
year 10 15 minutes or so and so we hit
the first one of those every step there
like all great this is miserable as he
promised let's stretch around a bit but
she always talks about ten seconds I'm
federally right back down and it's like
okay another little longer break please
and people got back outside and um but
she just jammed through it which it's
hard to read this kind of stuff and keep
people interested and fight again the
jury was kind of serving at I mean
Rihanna too hard not to be doing they
have copies of this best it's not like
they had remember everything she said it
would be impossible don't you remember
at all yeah but just in terms of like
powering through it it was a impressive
feat of stamina rehashes crank Bureau um
well let's talk about the end of it a
little bit because you know the top of
the jury instructions to me are kind of
interesting right there is there's you
know we're going to give you a bunch of
devices don't update them that's like to
me that's like the geeky stuff right
that's interesting it's like you're
going to go in this room we're going to
pull the sim cards out of the phone so
they don't get software updates you're
going to experience what they're like
you get to compare them blah blah blah
and at the end it's like the doctrine of
patent exhaustion is a doctrine and it's
like
were they even paying attention at all
during that stuff because that's the
stuff that they need to know the most
about I feel like the design patent
question the trade dress question it's
like pick up the phones and look at them
if you think people are confused you
know mark an X somewhere and then the
way wonky legal questions are how much
did Apple pay for Samsung's 3g patents
and it's like were they paying attention
when they were being informed how to
make those decisions I never pay
attention body was here women's know
necessarily that super into it and a
mechanical aunt but also I think then
these questions are so new option like
they're talking about legal concept in
specific detail it seems like at a
certain point of this campus just there
with like you know wish to mesmerize and
kind of go down the checklist and say
does it do I think it does this and do
this and just do that for you know every
single device think there's two more on
28 devices that Apple's accusing the
remote form or another and a two-bit
dispenser you know have it and you'll
have the disruptions in one hand and
have the device but they're just kind of
like a girl for a one by one which is
why this is going to be such a long wait
I think these are back to me yeah so hey
Matt let's ask I mean you've done a few
of these right i mean what do you think
the the jury is taking away from from
this part where they're being instructed
how to interpret the patents look at the
patents in terms of the devices
understand what they're supposed to do
and make decisions on a jury instruction
side is just incredibly antiquated
exercise it's really it's it's it's
ridiculous i mean they're not absorbing
anything i mean they have the sheet
there if they need it now the problem is
you have to you have to kind of make
sure they've heard it at least once or
else you know yeah or else they may
never look at that particular
instruction but still i mean they're not
paid attention so it's just a waste of
time but it has to be done so um but but
i think for the most part especially
with the infringement issues i mean they
kind of get it I mean without going
through all the elements of anticipation
and obvious pneus and whatever else
instruction they got whatever other
instruction they got there they're gonna
kind of get it I mean one thing about
this case that for the jury at least is
it you know
no matter how many devices you look at
at least on Apple side no matter how
many Samsung devices you look at it's
it's not that tough you know I mean yeah
infringement and you know look of it and
you could kill off some patents you can
find non-infringement whatever but it's
not it's not that much work though yeah
the real work is just trying to figure
out how to kind of memorialize that as
you're walking through the procedure on
that jury instruction on the the verdict
form right site so I mean it which
normally is like two or three pages long
in the regular case by the way rights
okay you know just to compare to the one
the last trial we covered which is
google and Oracle that verdict form was
like really straightforward right it was
was this patent valid was it infringed
and you should when town the line this
verdict form brian i mean i would say
it's like 10 times more complicated the
other one I'll absolutely i mean Elkins
and all these specific devices you know
to it's like you know each step answer
you know each question for each patent
on each device as you know well at times
three right and this is anthony's x 3 so
this I i think is the the layer of
complexity that we've we've never talked
about and if you're wondering why we're
spending a lot of time talking about
jury instructions and this stuff it's
because closing arguments are great but
the question that they're answering in
that room is not did Samsung copy Apple
it's 700 individual questions that add
up to did Samsung copy Apple did Apple
copy Samsung and that's crazy so without
knowing what they have been without
basically setting the stage for them
they won't be able to do it I mean they
literally won't have the tools to answer
these questions I was you know just
before we were starting we were saying
like where you look at the forum right
John our producers sitting and staring
at me I mean you look at the formula Kai
Reed tech news all day long and it's
like how do you answer the question did
I was this trade dress diluted in the
marketplace like I don't know and the
jury only has what they're given to
understand that so that's why I mean I
think it's really important that we kind
of understand what they're trying to do
before we go into what the emotional
um you know the emotional content the
closing arguments was and I to me what I
think is really crazy is they you know
there's like huge charts in the charts
say things like did samsung electronics
in Korea infringes patent did samsung
telecommunications America infringes
cotton or did samsung electronics
america infringe this patent and it's
like yeah who knows the difference
between those three companies and I like
to know if Brian Braun says he was there
every day I mean how much did they
really even explain the distinctions
between those companies to the jerk
summer yeah the most of it came from
Justin Denison who testified pretty
early on I believe Apple called him
actually but he's a samsung executive
now something that came up right in the
beginning but it was one of those things
where there wasn't necessarily a lot of
context and groundwork laid for when he
testified about it it was kind of like
you know details that were being thrown
of the jury and it was one of those
things you're like okay how is this
going to you know come into play later
you know and then you kind of see okay
here's why it's important later they
touched on the closing arguments of this
but its own yeah there was a long time
ago there's been a lot of information to
him since then and it is one of those
things where you kind of do have to look
that's where the jury instructions can
come into play and the verdict forms you
can specify you know you know why those
because are different you know how you
figure out which one is countered by
what you know there's you know is it
them it just did the Korean company
basically it will compel you know the
other companies so therefore they're
responsible as well known all those you
know those minor issues that weren't
really handled specifically in a
testimony apps mccauley get laid out for
the jury yeah but that's so dumb I mean
it's just a trick I mean it is it's a
trick it's it's apples getting away with
it because Samsung isn't one company
right so Samsung has all these
subsidiaries in United States Sam I mean
I know I know the difference i'm just
saying i don't think i think we think of
samsung is one company but it's not
right there's samsung in Korea there's
today I'm some telecommunications
America which sells everything basically
with a cell radio in it and there's
samsung electronics which tells the
other things which is crazy I mean that
is like classic insane samsung right i
mean that's like the galaxy tab
with Wi-Fi gets sold by Samsung
Electronics the galaxy tab 4G LTE gets
sold by samsung telecommunications
that's bonkers but like whatever but
it's Apple gets another crack at it
because they get to accuse Samsung Korea
of inducing its American subsidiaries to
infringe patents that's crazy I mean
that to me that's like I'd even know I
don't even know what that could possibly
be like that's like I like math give me
an example what why I can't but you like
you understand why I think this is so
dumb yeah well inducement matter of fact
when we were talking about this on
something we're working on the first
time I saw a doucement I mean when you
see inducement in a patent case it's
normally dealing with basically you're
trying to get a company put them on the
hook for something neighs sold to an end
user and the end user is infringing but
you're never going to sue the end user
you're going to sue the company that
actually whatever puts the method out
there and whatever it is that that's
infringed it's weird to kind of see it
in this in this regard where you're
using it to capture a party in the suit
it is one party I don't know I'm just
sewing after direct infringement yeah I
don't know it's I don't it just looks
like a one option it is a gotcha because
that's the way they structure their
business anyway so beyond I mean I'm
saying that's a level of complexity in
what the jury is doing right now that
goes well beyond did Samsung copy Apple
they literally have to decide on top of
everything else did Samsung's Hydra like
structure does that mean we have to
punish them more because of a
technicality because Samsung Korea made
a phone and designed a phone and then
gave it to samsung telecommunications
America which then sold it to AT&amp;amp;T
somewhere and there is there an
additional piece of liability and they
have to figure that out so to me what
it's very interesting to talk about and
we're trust me we're going to talk about
in great detail what happened in the
closings but what's almost to me more
fascinating is the incredible job the
jury has to do now in taking everything
they've learned over the past three
weeks and turning it into a
all of these decisions if it was just
did samsung copy Apple I feel like you
know that's like a 50-50 who knows who
knows where they will emotionally land
on that after all this but deed this
process now going through every mean
there's a line on the jury 22 or 23
question 22 or 23 is literally a dollar
sign horizontal line and then a question
that says how much should Samsung pay
apple and it's like you could write any
number they literally come up with any
number they want to put in there and
they have nine people have to decide and
agree and what number that is and that's
crazy um any other thoughts and jury
instructions guys need anything we need
to talk about before I move on why I
just go ahead right disagreement on the
verge cast and what do I think the thing
about all those questions it's also
about you know app trying to take as
many parts of the Apple that I mean okay
go back to that also terrible fun now
that takes video bites as it can because
this terms of the court of public
opinion apple just needs one count of
infringement kind of justice everything
is doing right right like he doesn't
know who you know who is from if
everything will be like Oh Samson did
copy apples by having all those
different options in there it's
definitely they want this going to a
play to their advantage I feel like this
game for confusing as it is it does
increase the likelihood that the jury
will you know come back with at least
something yeah okay well I was wondering
yesterday of apples ultimate strategy
with her and we've been saying that this
is kind of the weakness of their case
the complexity of the cases weakness
from the beginning but you have to
wonder if their strategy is just to
irritate the jury into like checking off
a bunch of boxes writing 2.5 billion
dollars and like getting the hell out of
it fabia it's hard for me to imagine
them completely wiping out all of
apple's claims whether it's serving
validity or non-infringement I can't
imagine Samsung's gonna walk away
without being on the hook for something
yeah um now you're right though I mean
after that it's kind of arbitrary I mean
what do you what's the damages and that
you know they talked in the closing
yesterday about his big last hurrah when
he was addressing the jury was you know
you know you a key
you kind of have this this window is
continuum between 0 and 2.5 billion
dollars you know make sure it's it's
it's it's high enough that it's that's
more than just a slap on the wrist yeah
to somehow alter their behavior and I
think that's important for Apple I think
I mean if they have if they got all of
their infringement claims and only
walked away with a minimal amount I got
to think that they would be seriously
worried about what the message that
sends to anybody else that wants to kind
of take this line you know developing
iphone light devices or iOS like
operating systems yeah there's a lot of
that outcomes for Apple and there's a
lot of bad outcomes for samsung in the
middle of walking away scot-free and
getting paid 2.5 billion dollars so
Brian let's let's let's shift gears and
talk about the closings yesterday I
think yesterday was it start you know
it's agree with you it started out with
this incredible anticipation that was
crushed by judge Koh reading the jury
instructions but they picked back up
again in the afternoon when closings
really did start so you want to walk us
through what happened there yeah I'm you
know Apple started basically and then
post I've had two hours and both sides
basically did like you know their
closing arguments may add you know
they're so kind of rebuttal section and
so you know Apple was you know really
really smart and they're almost
dispassionate about it they're caught
out of their whole know that push was
you know looking at the story we think
you'll figure it out though just you
know look at the document you know the
big push me a big push which one of kind
of truth look at this is for that all of
those you know comparison sheet don't
answer of course that looks so bad they
kind of basically back lace stuff out
basically like you know boom boom boom
here's the evidence we don't see how you
could think any other way and it was me
frankly was really affected us because
it was coming off book so much random
detail like to have them no brainer
thing together was really satisfying it
seemed like the jury was really engaged
yeah and it was just a return back to
you know everybody close is open really
strong and I can kind of saw that return
to that I'm you know you come away and
it is like okay they made some good
points are definitely scored there but
Samsung you know their shadows along the
way has you know going discredit
you know Apple experts up witnesses you
know belittle you know what changes
maybe I had spurted the industry back
hunting and they were really really
effective a kind of bringing that
strategy I think Oh Charles bear her
religious I just crystal he was there
was a sense of outrage about him he
delivered really what I cheated a little
bit too aggressive as I thought the most
part of a trick weho know we're a
company that just works really really
hard and paint framed it as a matter of
you know like a competition in America
you know apples against America was kind
of like the underlying you know subject
through there so I thought this was
really about Barry this stuff was really
fascinating that Sam samsung came out
angry and I thought I agree with you I
think they did a really good job I mean
they were on fire they were saying
there's nothing here you know they're
telling you to look at all this stuff
but none of it means anything you know
this is all stuff every company does
there's nothing wrong with what we're
doing we're just looking at the market
and trying to understand what's going on
there witnesses don't know anything I
thought he was particularly brutal with
Susan care who you know was apples
expert on weather icon screamed is on
one way or another and he was saying
that's their expert and she doesn't know
anything which is mean I mean flat out
mean I'm sure she was very it's also a
bit irrelevant actually I have surprised
a that Apple didn't kind of go back out
over that when they rebutted closing
well so what Matt's getting at is in
Bryan mean you were there so it may be
this focusing came through a little bit
differently but Samsung kept on saying
there's no actual confusion here no
one's really confused right there's they
never showed you any evidence of
confusion they never showed any surveys
that could there was confusion but
that's not actually the standard apple
has to meet the standard they have to
meet is for the trade dress stuff is a
likelihood of confusion which is
obviously very different than actual
confusion and for the design patent
stuff they have to say it was designed
what Matt it's a standard is whether it
has to be deceptive in the marketplace
right which is a very different standard
than actual confusion and so Samsung is
sitting there they're hammering away on
no one's ever actually been confused
when the law the jury
to apply is actually kind of different
is that the standard for design patents
Matt right it's deception it's a it's
also likely to confusion to the consumer
okay so ya mean standard basically I
mean for our purposes we can say the
standard for both is likelihood of
confusion an actual confusion is a
factor but it's one of like you know
seven or eight or however many more they
want to throw in there right and no
particular one has any more weight than
the other so it's a mean one of the
other factors is copying an intent to
copy so if I map well i would say i'd
point that out especially on rebuttal
after they discuss and saying you have
to have actual confusion no one's
confused right but i really didn't see
them address that very much during the
actual testimony or during the closing
well i have to say though well okay sure
so for me and maybe i've got this wrong
they both blew their rebuttals I think
we should we should save that for the
end but um to me they both completely
blew their opportunities on rebuttal um
but does catch all time it was it was
like here's a bunch of crap you've never
heard about before let's talk um so but
to me I you know I thought Samsung's you
know he had a line very van had a line
with this case you can change the nature
of competition in America which to me is
like a little bit ominous right I mean
apples not suing motorola for copying
its design right there they've got some
hat and stuff in the mix apples not
suing HTC they're not suing Microsoft
they should be suing google but they're
not it's just funny to hear you know
this company accused of directly copying
show up and say you can change the
nature of competition America on the
other side equally bad apples lawyer
goes you can affirm the united states
patent system with this case that's
eight which to me is like dude do you
want to lose like did you get paid to
throw this thing at the last minute you
can affirm the patent system part part
of this is because we're in this kind of
this world where pads are under constant
scrutiny so so that really hits us is
like come on it's a crazy thing to say
whether or not the jurors really feel
that way the guy with the
that there is somebody on the juror that
has multiple patents right um I maturer
yummy so but yeah when I heard that just
you know twitched I mean that's just why
would you ever I mean I counter but if
you're even if the jury like is out of
the tech world if they're sitting there
and they've just gone through three
weeks of we have a patent on scrolling
that bounces and Samsung we have a
patent on playing mp3 while you look at
your email I'm thinking well do you
maybe you should throw out the patent
system Brian what was what was your
reaction to that stuff well I took the
whole the whole devil this country was
built on competition thing that samsung
LED with was so strong compelling I took
willingly went back with that you know
from the patent it was Leigh that be
referring the patent sister thing but it
felt like a response to that you know
initial you know attack because it was
so effective it it is being necessarily
very thought out because I don't feel
like a normal person even necessarily
know what that means or how real feel
for that other than some sort of you
know you know Michael Bay flag-waving
you know gay if you know good a thing
burgers / for the overall picture yeah
I'm very very wealthy you say like you
know the country's open competition
everybody understands that that
resonates a very very core level for
every one of those jurors right look I
mean you know things seem like a test
account of it didn't really play and I
felt like that's you're going for and it
didn't really work yeah well you know
you count your counter to that is to
know let us compete is we will let you
compete we just won't let you copy i
mean that's that's really their story I
don't know why you didn't have to get
off of that I mean that's that's just as
compelling so there's really no need to
kind of go off this pro patent route it
made no sense yeah I mean look what rock
so it's a Brian you know at the sense
that i'm getting is it Matt and I
watched this stuff as at a distance a
little bit and I got the sense that
Apple's case again you know it in kind
of an exemplary Apple way was very
simple very like here it is like you're
going to stand in line and buy one of
these kind of like you know Apple moment
right
here's what we think it's very simple
you have four options to compute the
damages pick one let's get this over
with god bless america right and then
Samsung showed up and they're like look
at all this stuff like here's this
razzle-dazzle presentation like I'm
pissed off I'm worried about the future
of America his damages presentation I
thought was really off like what kind of
wild because he I think at one point he
said allocated operating costs in his
closing argument right and it's like why
did you say those words to the jury like
why did you see at any time saying those
words and your closing argument and like
this giant trial it was is that sense is
that kind of mean again we're at a
distance so is that is that sense
accurate that Samsung was passionate and
fiery but a little less organized Apple
was a little down but you know very like
succinct you're definitely correct an
apple I think fans done you know they
were aggressive they were very snarky
and actually to meet a play best if you
think about you know Apple lab and
Samsung's ads recently it actually play
to the perfect you know analogy to md
there's a moment where their home was
talking about the susan care testimony
he was kind of reading her testimony
back in this weird like he took on a
voice this kind of like is like I'm you
know using my lady voice now to play
when it was it was really I didn't see
the jury respond i believe negatively to
it but it's felt really condescending
and his whole take on Apple was this
very you know murky and snarky you know
who buys provides an apple of whether
another product by this it felt like
well you know and I've had Adams
watching that that rock and roll a damn
some Crowder the you know those tabs of
entropy will go up to the people in the
apples for lyin there like oh hey here's
my notice awesome felt a lot like that I
do that all the tonic by the way here's
my note but what now it's awesome yeah
but but she was engaged and I think
there was definitely a thing to that and
I'm you know jury would know they were
leaning for they were really interested
what was weird about the one close is
that he had about 14 minutes left and he
spent it all on you know
defending the FB friend Pat what's up
she really will draw in a weird way to
close the bottle just like a strainer
aim at you call it out them all weird
 in the face right that's just
bizarre waiting for you know anything
doesn't after you made these passionate
principal point going to badness you
know what you can leave you in the week
yeah look yeah I mean okay we should
talk about these rebuttals I want to
spend a little bit more time on the
substance of the talk a little bit right
um because I thought apple made some
points that kind of bear repeating and I
thought Samsung made some point so kind
of bear repeating before we we talk
about how they blew these rebuttals
because I mean to me that's a whole
story unto itself but so Apple came and
they said 11 line that I think is really
interesting and I want to get your sense
of how important you think this is going
to be to the jury I think as William Lee
said it took Apple five years to create
this revolution and it took samsung
three months to copy it that's the truth
and that's simple it's clear and it's
undisputed and he's making reference to
Samsung saying our sales are faltering
we have a crisis design they put out the
galaxy s inner sales why not do you
think do you think that was as in pitts
impactful on the page you know we have
it on our in the wrap-up article the
brinded we have it you know we pulled it
out and bright orange it's very
impactful was it as impactful in in the
courtroom it's a great line the problem
is that it was basically I'm all packed
here Lee nikon designers test when we
talk about it from the last her last
verge cast their the actually I months
no I got no sleep believe my baby all
this kind of stuff and there one day
they'll have that but at tetra and a
half of a meal and a nap of the
cross-examination it wasn't a big focus
on it being this no oh there is this
rush job you know the basically there is
like you know Samson was in crisis and
had to respond and like to scream lump
sprint to go and get this thing going
that wasn't really framed as clearly as
it could have been yeah as an argument
during testimony and I so it felt a
little bit i mean it's a great line but
it also felt like it was when they're
trying to go and put together the last
night obviously the
the push for chronology was a big part
of their cooking ordinance overall that
line in the room even though it sounded
great it didn't feel like it was
powerful as it you know could have been
because it wasn't enough backing it up
can I can I say my favorite oh go ahead
man well that's a great point I mean I
think some of these things often people
come up with them when they're working
on the closings because it's got to be
kind of his compelling presentation to
the jury um and I think something like
that somebody had a light bulb go off
and unfortunately they didn't have that
light bulb go off when they're
presenting all that testimony because it
could have easily it could have easily
worked that into the theme yeah but it'd
been it would it would have been pretty
powerful there's another line I can't
remember it was oh I in it was it
sounded like one that they probably
wrote down and they never said out loud
and it came off super awkward it was
you're gonna have to decide who lived by
the rules and who didn't live by the
rules and I can just see him just being
like and those who didn't live by the
rules were samsung and it's like it
starts out like cruising towards the
impact and I just like like just
explodes into nothing like it just falls
apart into awkwardness you know that on
so they thought it was really one of
those worries like all this buzz rules
and I the rosin and who didn't play by
the rules is done I think like even like
looking down I looked away toward that's
a nose for something so it's not like
blah just fell flat all right so let's
talk about these are so I think the
sense you need to get from the closing
arguments if you've been paying
attention to this is they both started
off with different types of kind of
emotional pleas right one is you know we
may you know Apple started right off
with Steve Jobs I mean they I think it
was within the first sentence they had
said Steve Jobs worked on the iphone
four five years right like they're
they're they're making the emotional
connection between we worked hard and
you know as matt has been saying this is
their narrative the entire time where
Apple we spent all the money we made the
phone samsung copied it very dry very
look at the pictures you can see what
damage has been done here samsung came
out and said this is basically
right i mean i think i had a tweet
yesterday characterized it as Apple's
entire game plan and closing was just
look at this and Samsung's entire thing
was yes but let's look at it an
exhaustive painful detail and that's
that's I think what we get it came away
from it but then these two happen to
call them Joker's then these two jokers
had the chance to offer rebuttals and i
want to say they both utterly blew it
you know they they delivered some lines
at the very end of their rebuttals they
got into some zingers but they kind of
just wasted their time man I know you
definitely got that sense you want to
talk about that a little bit yeah I got
it I got it with apples although I will
that Apple started tying it back in at
the end of the rebuttal um whereas
Samsung just took the whole 14 minutes
minus five seconds at the very end and
just pound it on these these these
issues and this is the last impression
you have before this jury goes back it
looks at the nightmare verdict form
you've handed them and and this is and
you've just completely bored the hell
out of them the eyes are glazed over and
I it was insane because I figured okay
I'm gonna be a smartass I'm gonna say
yeah this is terrible way to waste your
14 minutes and I figured four minutes
into it they're gonna shift gears and
get back to their theme but no they just
they just kept going yes okay Brian what
was the vibe there I mean to me that was
like nuts like just the fact that you're
gonna bring up they're gonna say in your
last 14 minutes in front of your you get
the last 14 minutes in front of the jury
and you're gonna spend it on I you know
we didn't break etsy rules because we
timely disclosed our innovations to the
patent board and our licenses under
frandor it's like I no one cares about
this right and you did it so that you
sleep at exhauster doesn't apply because
we sold to China yeah right well there's
a problem to with then I think we
touched on this in the live blog you
know Samsung had some time management
issues they have some throughout the
trial they have some in closing
yesterday when a variable is bring a
sting a couple times V Sampson attorneys
at much some kind of whisper hear it
felt like he was you know they like okay
you know morning nevada's time basically
a certain point very hella start getting
really really rushed this is before
rebuttal is an argument these are
getting really really rushed and lots of
thread and then making of the other
teams and afterwards or heavens like
you're welcome take a break right now
regroup per second they came back much
stronger my team there's just a lot of
stuff they didn't get that well you know
in the rebuttal just through the same
stuff out there and it's weird to have
been stood and not been a focus in trial
really I mean it was in fact it hadn't
been a mission anyway hamartoma wasn't a
be static point for anyone there's just
information that was 78 and it's been
that last bit doing it it's really weak
because given the apple had clunkers
they did you know they have it on their
their larger you know narrative points
you know and they're in their rebuttal
basically you know don't thing about you
know compromising our damages you know
the affirmative is now they talked about
overall impression being important
visual icons which is in a way the
samsung's try to go and tear down the
comparison between the product they kind
of you know they have other points out
where snacks understand get out the
point where their obsession he was like
thank you know I said Jerry thank you
very much and for walking back and just
was like well you gotta put more minute
she's like oh okay I shall sustain a
large you no longer for thought out
thank you none penetration and he still
have more time and he's like okay I was
the Galibier it was very very weird no
that was an attention going they can see
more gracious I know getting nothing to
mall security after this very
disorganized at the Andy yeah it wasn't
great you know I mean you gotta think
about this in terms of how things are
normally done if you have a patent case
to run of the mill pad case on a
doorknob or you know some some kind of
one patent maybe a handful of products
that are alleged to infringe that trial
can go on for a week that full week of
testimony and and and you need to come
out with
much simpler jury instruction in much
simpler verdict form but if that kind of
trial goes for a week it's insane to
think about how much was compressed into
this case over three half weeks yeah i
mean it's it's it's it's I'm not sure
that they went into it I mean they knew
I mean any new 24 hours was nothing
really and a whole scheme of things
considering the complexity of the case
but it just so much you know ah some of
the odd things that happened when this
during his time crunch is when you have
witnesses jumping up saying you know
talking for five minutes and getting off
the stand me that never happens I mean
it's it just never happens in a regular
case because I mean my guess is you're
really trying to actually get the
information embed it in there the jurors
brain and I don't I don't know when it
happens with this juror let's get it out
of that jury instruction sheet which I
doubt it I mean they're just gonna have
to do a lot of work on their own when I
get back to that jury room so let's talk
about what is happening in that jury
room right now so Brian did you see them
when they came in this morning roads
drugs i didn't i didn't see them
unfortunately i would love to see them
when they left today because i don't i
don't think they saw the verdict Foreman
Blacula for room yesterday and made us
have to be miserable unhappy people i
saw that yeah i mean it's it's an insane
document um so they go in what's to go
in well actually real quick Ryan Matt
let me ask you this who had the better
closing yesterday neither one of you is
going to go out there I'm just Apple
just because I felt like they did pull
it back around at the very end yeah Ryan
I think it was pretty close actually I
would probably give a small edge to
apple just because you know the easiest
issue to discuss you know all the ones
that they're presenting you know the
left and there's so many opportunities
for people to go and find information
with what they're doing and their
narrative ultimately I feel is more
compelling just from a dramatic
standpoint now because you know Samsung
defense over all this video we had copy
stuff you know
form follows function and so you can't
really get mad at it they brought an
example of using the best he's looking
for same as an example what smartphones
are like and that's true but there's so
many Pacific yeah you know what I didn't
get about that mean it's now open season
on samsung's TV design because you know
they do like touch of color they've got
the really thin bezels like can algae
just go in there now and be like look
you said all tvs look the same but it's
yeah there's a lot of like dancing on
pinheads there um as for me but i don't
think it looks just like that's on TV
that would be amazing active album puts
out a TV that looks just like a samsung
like touch of color TV and that would be
terrific um and then i could see each
other and they good leader just like
switch binders like the two sides we beg
here's here's what we said the last time
okay cool um so for me I think I thought
Sam Sun came out of the gate way
stronger yesterday just because they
they had the fire they had the passion
and they I mean that rebuttal to me was
you know the time is she dead time
issues from the get-go right i mean
three even the first part of the closing
that tie my shoes so to me they just
kind of they got caught up in losing
time and instead of instead of making
sure that they delivered the emotionally
impactful argument which is the only
thing thats you know really important i
think they made sure to check all the
boxes of the legal arguments and that to
me that that was completely manifested
in their rebuttal where they spent 14
minutes talking at friend and it's they
should have spent 14 minutes talking
about anything else so yeah i'll give
i'm with you i give the slight edge to
apple just 44 at least keeping the plot
at the very end and kind of like making
the impact but i thought seems like
started out very strong good definitely
i may have the opportunity to close may
have the time and i think there was just
one or two lines about you know that
samsung compete freely in the
marketplace instead of apple try to
quote based off that is awesome stuff
they should have effort on that like
they did in the beginning it just kind
of let the fran stuff alone but you
better like the juror
already were just kind of her kind of
whatever about that and really in face
of all the others happening it's kind of
a consequential I don't think I don't
think thinking that you know Samsung was
a you know after the basket he confirms
a brand is going to tip the scale the
time pass anybody like I feel like
because left it alone that's hammered on
there England know ah right how
impressed would you have been if knowing
that the only thing you really want to
talk about is friend you just say screw
it and get up there to say we don't have
any rebuttal no just kind of you know
it's we're confident we're gonna sit
down at me sometimes it's better just to
shut up and sit down I mean there's
there's no reason to use every minute of
your time if you're not really gonna
contribute to anything so I'm yeah I
really it was I think I i agree Apple
did a lot of the same thing I just don't
think was all packaged at the end on
that last impression which is really
kind of what I mean Indiana I'm not
confident jury's not going back there
and say god I hate those bastards for
doing that 14 minutes so I'm gonna screw
up over on all these claims but but I do
is you know everything kind of builds on
itself and you get this kind of overall
feeling and you know when he gets to the
friend issues you meet the stuffs you
know they don't know any more than they
did before that 14 minutes yeah so you
really got nowhere except kind of
annoying them and mostly just boring him
yeah so well and us I mean I will say
that I got to dish out a couple
hilarious tweets because they spent that
was it and you know I'm just calling my
own tweets hilarious that's where Matt
in life that's what kind of ego monster
I've become um so let's talk about it's
going on in this room we've got a few
minutes here we can kind of wrap this up
um they're in there they're picked they
they have to vote on a foreman I think
that'll be kind of interesting to see
who they pick at the end they've got all
these devices I think it's hilarious
that they have an overhead projector so
they can put their bonders full of
evidence up in like like my fourth-grade
classroom i'll look at the same piece of
paper what do you think they're going to
start with i mean do you think they're
going to go in order do you think
they're going to skip around do you
think they're going to set the form
aside and just talk about the case at
hole where do you
would you do I i would start in the
beginning go ahead boyfriend yeah
positive way my friend is why i would
probably look at all the invalidity
stuff first because so much is a nation
so fun and printing other patents be
invalid l you know at the same time but
i would just kind of just professed mess
with Reverend where I would kind of
started the lesson worth chapter
there I imagine they'll probably just
you know start in the order right it is
high stuff that's most engaging stuff
that's except you want to talk about
right do you think they're gonna
actually like hold up the phone I mean
you know they've got all the phones in
there and they one of the instructions
is if you believe these design patents
adequately describe a real device you
can use the real device and not the
patent to make the comparison so they
can hold up an iphone and say does this
look the same I mean do you think
they're doing a lot of that to me the
idea of being on the story is insane
like the idea that you're alone in this
room with like you know eight other
strangers basically and you've got to
decide whether one giant company copied
another giant company to me is beyond
beyond comprehension I mean but I
guarantee there's at least one or two
ringers sitting in that jury room that
are gonna pull out every product yeah
any little the same ones that you know
held their hands up and answered every
question in class they're gonna go
they're gonna go through and they're
going to at least for a while until they
realize the futility of it all and then
but I think for a while they're gonna
built be pretty diligent and and that
bodes well for Apple because if you
start from the beginning and in the
beginning is where it requires the most
diligence because of those crazy charts
yeah then I think I think that could
benefit them cuz then by the time you
get to Fran you're just disgusted that
bottom of the jury for him so I mean I
mean it's all kind of any it's hugely
speculative but but I think it mostly
people are gonna kind of just start from
beginning because you know what else
they don't really know where else to go
so they're gonna kind of start driving
through all these questions I was
showing some of the charts to chris
sigler today and he was like this is my
dream I need to be able to get on this
jury the idea that
that any somewhere in the world right
now there are nine people in a room
sitting on a table like discussing the
Samsung gym in extreme detail is
literally my dream he was very easy
heard happy that he's not on the tree I
saw that the idea you know he meant it
too I'm sure how he did mean it now
without questioning so let's the the one
last thing that I think we need to
really address with a jury in the
process now is how long do you think
this is going to take and and I mean
pretty much with every day that goes by
do you think the lawyers begin to freak
out more and move towards settlement
dead sorry yeah Eduardo keypad not
Brian's I was trying not to oh my money
you go first go for it well I it's gonna
last a whole I mean a long long time I
don't I mean this is impossible to come
out of the jury room if you've done I
mean you can't get nine people do that
bad of a job yeah that they would come
out of that jury room in like you know a
day yeah but a week or two easily I mean
and as far as um whether or not you know
dapple and Samsung are kind of seen this
is getting scary now you know we're
starting to realize what we've just done
and who you know this is these night
people are going to decide our fate or
at least you know a big chunk of our
bank account I I I have hope I mean just
like you Neil I think that they're gonna
you know somebody's got to start
thinking about that if they haven't
already I just don't see it happening is
really I think the I think I think
they're rolling the dice I mean I just
do it's such an irresponsible crazy dice
roll I mean I've to say if you are if
you are apple in your or your Samsung
and you're saying we're gonna let these
nine people who have barely any
understanding of this law we we tried to
teach them out friend in literally the
last 14 minutes we're gonna let them go
in there with a sheet of paper that says
did Samsung violate section 2 of the
Sherman Antitrust Act and trust them to
know what the hell they're doing where
we could get or we could spend our time
I'm actually competing by talking to
apple and getting our incredibly
sophisticated lawyers and business
people on the phone and saying how do we
make a deal that works I it's obvious
which one to pick like I don't even know
how you end up in this situation I think
with every day that goes by they're
gonna realize more and more what a
gamble that they're making a nuisance
yeah now I just saying like it'sit's
there's a meeting with Tim Cook as
general counsel and he's like so uh you
think the nine guys will figure it out
and give us a 2.5 billion yeah you know
I did definitely it's like what meet
like did that happen did that had to
have happened right and that's that's
how you allow this to happen Oh exactly
i mean these I mean I've been in cases
where you know I'm positive that the
other side the other side's attorney is
just feeding a lot of of to the
others the opposing party and it's like
nothing you can do about it right but
you know this is this is a huge
corporate entity with shareholders to
answer to and presumably a lot of smart
people involved in a decision making
even on the even the ones that are
talking to the litigation counsel so to
me it's bizarre it's a reason 91st what
is it 90 some percent of cases patent
cases settle right before ever getting
to the jury I mean it's it's it's the
crazy gamble and in this case it's one
of the biggest ever you know really so
Brian what do you what you're the one
you've been seeing the lawyers I mean
are they just having been showing up in
new cars every day and do they have
giant BMW brochures like at the desk
with them like what's the vibe you know
everybody was super super fried yeah
they like everybody like clearly nobody
slept like the last grouper days it
seemed like after the end of things
yesterday team at all seemed to be in a
very very good mood team Samsung into
being a very they didn't seem excited
they weren't laughing they were just
there right to get out yeah because
somebody probably walked up to vera and
was like dude you just spend 14 minutes
talking on friended on the castle yeah
its mate on the and Freddie you know so
like in terms of at
seem good but at the same time you know
after you know oracle Google Michael
Jacob seemed to be in a great mood after
then as well and I obviously did not go
their way either right um so I mean for
me in terms of the jury like I have
august 31st the back of my head of the
day because this jury has been through
so much you know so much information so
many long hours as the day before a
holiday weekend you not want to come
back on Tuesday and resume this thing so
if we hear anything back from them i'm
guessing and i'm not putting it now i'm
seeing the 31st as my only likely
prediction but nothing this week at all
I think every day that goes along
furthering me I'm stream that I think is
bad for apples i think the downsides
rattle here far worse my fam something I
mean bathroom can be found to San first
two surveys laid out like whatever like
they're like they're such a huge company
who cares Apple getting a bunch of its
pounce that Pattinson validated at the
much bigger problem for them right well
yeah I mean I again I'm saying in
between 0 and 2.5 billion dollars are a
lot a lot I mean let's say the jury says
you infringed all the apples pens how
much is that worth ten dollars you know
like that oh you can imagine a lot crazy
but that's in there that's in the range
of possible outcomes and it could happen
on that's a bad outcome there's a lot of
steps all the way up to all the way up
to 2.5 billion dollars and there's a lot
of places where I think a company would
say well samsung got dinged for it they
got billed or find in a couple million
dollars but their products are call
early better and they made you know
they're down in the marketplace look
fine let's put the money like put the
money under the bed we're going to copy
the iphone and we'll pay the money when
it comes out and that's a terrible
precedent for apple for samsung there's
all kinds of bad you know there's you
infringe this patent but not this patent
you get nothing for your fran patents
you violated the ante you violated the
sherman act like there's a whole range
of ways that samsung's business can be
thoroughly disrupted especially because
of sort of the multiple businesses at
play here and again there's a lot of
like ego at play here i understand
there's a lot of history about both
these companies wanting to prove
particularly I think Samsung wants to
prove that it's as innovative is Apple
which is great but at some point you
know Apple and Microsoft they signed the
deal they settled the litigation in the
90s and they moved on and they're both
doing well and i think that's that's
really key here I believe we'll see I
not with every day that goes by my my
belief is it settlement becomes more
likely as opposed to a natural verdict
being delivered becomes more likely but
that's just me I would agree with that
and I and I and I also qualify with I'm
hopeful as well like I said last week I
think it's a win-win if they settle but
um I just don't know I mean it's just
been so I could just picture how it's
going with these guys when they meet
yeah you know you give me money no you
give me money screw you they walk away
it seems like it's probably a pretty
childish conversation but easy so Brian
are you gonna be you're going to do the
court every day until they come back
that's your yeah I may be here every day
at the there's a court filing systems we
get basically email alerts if there's a
note from the jury or a verdict and
there's about a 15 minute notice so you
know just going to be you know here in
San Jose with phone and computer nearby
and then we hear anything we're after
the courtroom and I at the latest it
though Brian's me in Santa's I just
hammered like three in the afternoon I
do there's a verdict I've been doing
nothing for three weeks he's a huge
beard amazing I mean you are going miss
me when you're not sleeping at the court
are you only a couple times or those a
dire circumstance yeah only only the
time I thought of sleeping bag it was
cool nice there's a broom closet all
right anything else we've been at this
for an hour anything else we need to
touch on there's a mosquito in here as
well so I'm eager to now I'm kidding
girl there is a mosquito but I don't
want to end because of the mosquito
because I'm not a coward awesome from
Wisconsin I've been bitten by mosquito
anything else we need to touch on
anything major Before we jump off the
phone here now I think that's I mean
it's gonna be interesting I you know one
thing I'd like to sit on the coracle
case well it was annoying at least there
was a lot a lot of times during that
deliberation we're ready the you know
the kind of a little bit excitement
would pop up with the jury notes
ask a question at first it was kind of
cool then he realized most of the
questions were the same question over
its rewarded um but so I'm hoping for
some of that again the issues are
different I mean those those pads were
terribly wonky and I mean the copyright
claims everything was more technical and
more complicated even though the smaller
yeah um I don't know how much we're
going to get maybe because of that jury
form we might get more questions than we
think but yeah there are literally going
to be like what is trademark dilution
nobody ever exert red dress solution
nobody ever sees a black boxes in this
chart for understanding what is samsung
telecommunications America that's a fine
question asked yeah yeah pretty much I'm
crazy well look I think we've got
another week or so this to go we'll
probably do another show next week
hopefully hopefully we'll have something
to talk about in terms of settlement or
news of settlement or maybe even a
verdict but it's always gentlemen it's a
delight to have you on the verge has
special edition any Brian anything you
want to what's what what's the weather
like a court today I feel like we've got
we've got to extract all the information
about the ambience of the court from you
right now we're not in court judge cuz
she isnt working on some other cases now
criminal cases level is I'm in tension
around the court not in tho bad day it's
a it's a nice 70 degrees there is a
there's a movie theater down the street
maybe things they really saw hit that up
but uh no it's just it's generally chill
yesterday was awesome though because you
had a bunch of journalists that had been
basically living together you know day
in and day out for about three weeks at
the other things yesterday was like it
was like summer vacation everyone was
like really really happy like phone
numbers like you know you know BFF you
know um wha dis emotionally was actually
really really interesting me anything
thing happened with local to it's like
you spend so much time following this
closely you do have developers extended
family any week for you're talking about
you know every week every day we're
talking about it the same kind of bond
there was a tinge of sadness actually
that this gave the case was over
yesterday there's like I'm you know
there's only like four or five
journalists around here today just a
much different thing but we'll probably
a bunch of people leak your more stuff
the one thing I'm hoping for that we saw
with a couple of those questions in Bora
chol we saw things start to fall apart
we saw this time that it was a jury with
Naya I'm just wanna precision and you
know I'm hoping we see some towels in
that regard because that can go and set
the stage and also drive settlement talk
really really rapidly defending what we
hear back from them it's very true so
yeah we'll see I mean notes from the dry
Avenue and thought about that notes from
the jury that should be that is that
about the book that's definitely got to
be like a room like a like a lady's
romance book yes on the jury so yeah
it's like them yes to look at nicholas
sparks on the phone right now there you
go do it Brendan's pretending to dial
for my bed it knows but you have
Nicholas Berg all right we got it right
this up gentlemen always a pleasure
we'll talk next week that is a verge has
special edition apple vs samsung
