we're looking at Windows 10 running on
tablets so officially notice is you've
got the full sort Start screen start
menu whatever you want to call it now
and there's no option so that resize it
like you would see on the desktop
version so basically you've got all your
apps you can switch like you would have
done in Windows 8 but you still seeing
those you've got the virtual desktops
here so it's all kind of very similar
sort of the PC version and it's kind of
acts very like pretty much the same way
you can switch between the apps tear
kill off apps you've also got Cortana in
here and same as the desktop version you
say what's the weather like today so
that works well show us there we go
most of you trying to unify it and
they're saying it's windows turn on on
everything and that's pretty apparent
here and all that all the apps privacy
running full screen as you would expect
on this tablet because they've got the
ability its ability to then turn off the
tablet mode and kind of use it as a
desktop computer so everything will pop
back into these these apps that you
really expect on a desktop machine now
you could hook this up to a monitor use
it as your main desktop PC if you wanted
to but obviously it's preferable to have
it in this tablet mode where things
running fullscreen for sort of device
like this so that's a quick look at
Windows 10 on a tablet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
