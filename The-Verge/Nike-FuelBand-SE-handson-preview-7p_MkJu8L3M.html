are looking at the new Nike Plus
FuelBand se which is an update of glass
fuel band it now comes in four different
colors this one is yellow but it's
called volts and there's also total
crimson pink foil and an all black
version and is pretty much very similar
to last year's except it is a bit more
durable nike says so one notable
addition to the bracelet is going to be
a new double tap to show the time you
just tap twice on the button and it'll
medially show you what time it is which
it was kind of difficult to tap through
and see the time last time the display
is going to be exactly the same and it
shows everything like that the biggest
improvements are going to be with the
new app and the old version will work
with the new application but a few of
the new features will not be available
with the new band you can also you can
now have something called sessions which
allows you to track individual
activities to be activated from the band
or on the app by pressing this button
and what it allows you to do is login
what type of session you're going to be
doing and then start it and it'll show
you in real time how many fuel points
you're earning as well as it has a color
indicator to show basically how much of
fuel points you are earning during each
of your activities so you can watch this
in real time if you're running or have
it run in the background all of your
different sessions are going to be saved
so once you stop this you can go back
through and view all of your sessions
you can add pictures you can send these
to your friends share them with your
friends and it will let you visualize
which activities get you closer to
bringing up your total fuel points the
application is still iOS only so there's
no Android app there's no Windows Phone
8 although it does also sync with their
website and you can use that to track it
all in all if you like to the old fuel
band you're going to like this new one
and the sessions ability is very cool
because you can also use it to track
sleep which the last FuelBand couldn't
do it's going to be available on
November 6th and the app and the new
band are going to be released on the
same day and the new band is going to
cost 149</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
