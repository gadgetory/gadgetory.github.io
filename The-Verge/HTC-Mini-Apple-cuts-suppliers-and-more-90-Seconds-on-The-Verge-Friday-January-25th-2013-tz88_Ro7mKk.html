presented by Ford smartphones have been
getting pretty big in recent years but
HTC's finally figured out a reasonable
solution during a second phone the
company's begun bundling one of its
smartphones in China with the HTC mini a
candy bar style phone that syncs with
its big brother via bluetooth and NFC
can't even trigger an alarm on the
bigger phone and serve as a remote
control clearly making it the best of
both worlds that's assuming the best of
both worlds means having two phones in
two pockets with two chargers apple has
released its latest supplier report and
it includes some disturbing findings
Apple revealed that 11 different
overseas facilities had employed
underage workers over the past year one
supplier committed 74 different
violations Apple's now stop working with
that company altogether it could be just
the beginning Foxconn is rumored to be
bringing mac mini production in the
United States in the near future want to
unlock your phone or tablet legally I
want to get started a ruling made by the
u.s. librarian of Congress goes into

subsidized by carrier without getting
explicit permission first one
interesting tidbit the changes don't
apply to use phones or devices purchase
before tomorrow check out my eBay page
for some devices that can make your
unlocking dreams come true and that's it
for today's top stories but join us next
time when i'll show you how to make a
