chance using the same password over and
over again and I'm here to tell you that
is not a good idea let me tell you what
happened to me a few years ago
definitely headed nowhere and sit in my
password let you know how long this
wasn't it Zappala snapped I don't even
know what even act because I use the
same password to get in again buddy that
was countless more of it it was my
Instagram account Facebook account and
so if we end up with a password exposed
hey girl thanks get another security
breach I'm gonna show you how to start
secure here accounts the most important
thing we can do is use different
passwords for different services it
sounds really complicated at heart
remember but it's not we needed to nap
hold a password manager something that
can remember all of your usernames and
passwords and automatically plug in
straight as websites they're really
really handy and pretty easy to use once
they get set up there are a bunch of
options out there like one password and
dashlane but for this video we're gonna
talk about LastPass because it's
completely free and it works on
basically every platform Windows Mac iOS
Android even Chrome OS so you'll be able
to use it no matter where you are you
sign up the first thing you'll be asked
to do is create a master password this
is what you'll type to log into LastPass
and basically it's the only password
you'll ever have to remember so you
better make it a gateway now another
thing being the probably character
letter a number they make that oh into a
zero
don't forget all of that what you want
something that's long but you need to
remember so instead of a password think
passphrase something like excitable
wizard tomato-based machine you're not
gonna forget that but it's gonna be
really hard for a hacker who's guessing
password after pastor after password to
figure out okay so what are the hacker
is actually doing here we asked Russell
Brandon before the cyber security
reporter to find out so imagine a big
breach like the one that hit Yahoo in
2013 hackers got log ins and hashed
passwords for a billion accounts now
that's a lot of people and it's a huge
problem for everybody even outside of
Yahoo suppose you've got a scam going
and you need to hack a bunch of Facebook
accounts if you can by unhatched Yahoo
passwords on a criminal marketplace you
can use a tool like century MBA to run
all 1 billion
those passwords against Facebook and see
which of them work if you're lucky you
get wanting a thousand before a breach
as big as Yahoo that's a million
password of course Facebook will get
suspicious if one computer is putting in
millions of passwords a second so the
program's get clever using botnets to
spread the logins out over millions of
IP addresses using different profiles
and different browser fingerprints so
each one looks like a different user
it's an arms race between hackers trying
to use the passwords and services trying
to stop but at the end of the day the
ones that work for legitimate passwords
back services can only do so much to
keep hackers out and that's why you want
to use different passwords with each
account because even if we end up in a
big breach like yahoo your other
accounts will still be safe alright so
now you need to go about changing all of
your passwords I Spence can actually
help you out a bit by automatically
importing any passwords you already have
saved you browser and even as a button
they'll automatically change some of
those passwords but it doesn't always
work and you're probably gonna have to
enter some of these manually which can
take a little bit of time say you're
ready to secure your Facebook account
you'll find the change password screen
and then LastPass of all this little
button up here with corner of the box
you just click on that and LastPass will
be able to generate and fill in a big
long complicated password for you that's
ok because you're never gonna have to
remember it wants to save the LastPass
it'll be there forever and that's it
fortunately you don't have to do this
all at once and honestly I'd recommend
waiting a few days before you add you
know your bank account or your email
address just to make sure you have a
hang of it just you know it's gonna be a
little bit more work on mobile because
even have to copy your password as the
last best app and into whatever you're
signing into but it's worth the effort
ok so that'll actually make you more
secure than most but there's one more
step you can do to make your accounts
even safer it's called 2-step
authorization and you should set that up
too usually what this means is that when
you go to log into a website the website
will text a shortcode to your phone and
you have to enter that code as well as
your password to get logged in the idea
is that even if a hacker has your
password
they'll also need to steal your phone in
order to break into your account which
is gonna be a lot more work yes this
will make logging in to take a few
seconds longer but it's much more secure
and you'll feel a little bit like a
secret agent every time you get a
special code sent to you
at least that's how I feel some quick
words are warning about all of this
first of all never forget your master
password seriously if you do you're
gonna be locked out of everything some
accounts will give you a backup code
make sure you hang on to it and on even
if you do take both of these steps
you're never gonna be 100% impossible to
hack it's just not gonna happen
even two-factor systems can and are
being breached but if you take these
steps you're still gonna make it much
harder for somebody to get into your
account where they're not supposed to
and with more and more of our lives
moving online that's increasingly
important and it's definitely worth the
effort so you guys my facebook account
your my Instagram account and</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
