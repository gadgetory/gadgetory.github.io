really couldn't have an idea of what
Call of Duty Elite was going to be yeah
when you guys were talking there's a lot
of confusion people thought halo
waypoint or they thought it was gonna
just be like Maps or replays but there
is like so much content that you guys
are doing and so you guys have been
rolling out plant operations we found
that the way that people have the most
fun playing call of duty is with their
friends right the people who they get
online and getting a party you go ahead
and play with we wanted to do with clan
ops cuz we wanted to figure out a way to
make it such that they could create
those groups within called really bring
them into the game and then have a way
of competing in statistical challenges
over a specific amount of time for
digital and real prizes within the first
30 seconds of turning on the clans
feature we had something or it was like
a minute I think we have 40 clans
created meant that people were sort of
still pressing that button just a couple
of days ago the total count of clans
created on elite was over six hundred
and seventy thousand so a lot of clans
created right and in that first
operation we had around 25,000 clans
participating which was up over 200,000
people enlisted 640,000 clans is a lot
more people yeah yeah yeah yeahs clans
can have up to 100 people in right so
you were talking about i had asked about
earlier was the idea of having may be
looking at tryouts or looking at ways
where you can automatically sort of say
you need to hit this level before you're
gonna purchase oh yeah there's there's
there's a lot of stuff that like the
clan audience is the most passionate
amongst our even already really
passionate audience right and they tell
us on a daily basis in very vocal ways
this is great this is great but this is
not and we want this to be added and so
there's a whole range of features that
people have asked for everything from
you know lieutenants in their individual
clan to the ability to create a draft
book of people that they're looking at
that they want to be part of their clans
or like you said the tryouts and so we
have communications via our community
management sort of system to be able to
talk to individual clans and say hey
what's important to you because as we
build this feature and we continue to
evolve it over the next year and with
subsequent games we want to make sure
we're doing what the community wants
it's not just something you look at on
the console it's not just web you're
also doing mobile yep a tablet you kind
of give us a quick update
you have looking at that yeah there's a
tremendous amount of focus on mobile as
this evolving platform for us there's so
many interesting things that are
happening both from a form factor and a
processing power standpoint on the
tablet front that's defining kind of
what features we put on what features we
put on the tablet and also sort of how
they interact directly with the game and
I wish I could say more than that but it
really is sort of defining kind of our
approach and our roadmap over the next
couple of years do you think that elite
will have a significant change with any
new new game or is it something that
will just be constantly evolving well so
there there will be sort of these kind
of big it's almost like step functions
in terms of functionality that we do
with each release of each subsequent
game right but the one thing I wanted to
make sure that people knew out there is
that you know in terms of evolution
we're adding new features all the time
one of the things I'm excited to talk
about now is spec ops leaderboards are
gonna be coming online our next DLC drop
but for Ali sort of two point oh if you
want to think of it that way we're
focusing on increasing that level of
in-game integration that we've already
done with modern warfare 3 we're on take
it to even the next level for whatever
we do with the next game great well
thank you very much no problem there
pertain to you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
