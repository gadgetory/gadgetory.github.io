the collector and vintage market is
exploding these days but the cars are
often underpowered they break down and
they're dirty if you love VW's old VW
bugs and things and this particular
vehicle which is the microbus very cool
but you don't want to be broken down by
the side of the road the subtle electric
has an answer for you how about making
them all-electric because you're
actually using or of a certain vintage
what are they they're all Volkswagens
and their own collectibles there's a
sweet spot in both white and beetles
between 1958 and 66 we source well
maintained little cared for cars then
they take the gas bits out and put in
the electric stuff so we have double
horsepower right all electric you just
plug in 8:00 at night in the morning
it's ready what's the range potentially
on it just depends how much you can
afford with the bus because we have room
for a lot of batteries in here but the
way we have it set up right now it's a
solid 60 mile range in this bus and the
beetle it's about 80 to 100 miles this
is truly a great design
you've got your surfboard back here it's
got a sunroof this whole thing opens up
to basically every window pops outer and
cooling the front windows
so in a sense it is the quintessential
California machine you start this
company because your green fiend right
you're mad about all things green really
it was to make a car more dependable
I've grew up with these cars I've had
them for the last 30 years and every
couple of months something you know
something breaks something physically
falls off going electorate it makes them
super dependable and that's a lot of fun
you can shift if you want to if you want
to have more fun or you can just leave
it in third gear and cruise around like
a automatic so if you you probably
didn't realize we've been in second gear
the whole time from when I took off
reckon I can stop now in second gear and
vans are and start off so it's pretty
much just like a non ematic this car can
be coming at you you know 50 miles an
hour and residential neighborhood it
literally does not come up on your
audible radar I have never driven an
all-electric beetle
come on baby god yeah this is fast
here's the thing that so many people
don't realize about electric motors as
you get 100% of torque on demand so
there really I mean it may not be fast
to 100 but to 30 or 35 miles an hour
from off the line we're really quick
you've actually made 1960s VW bugs fast
and interesting yes I know nobody
believes me but they go 100 miles an
hour no problem hi
very close this one's a 59 it's all
electric no seriously we have it's all
electric I'm gonna beat you offline
let's race by and there were up to
almost 50 miles an hour
we totally blasted the Lexus how many
cars do you guys expect to sell a year
we can handle about 10 right now how
much how much for the different now we
are in this is a microbus would be the
around 130 130 130 thousand dollars
we're in all Volkswagen bus at some time
probably sold for 25 bucks to somebody
but I mean it's gorgeous it's
collectible - interesting now the VW
Beetle start at what the sedan starts at
68 and if you put a big hole in the roof
it's 78 for their rag cot and if you
take the roof off it's about 88 we can
we played thank your David because it
turns out the cars are a blast they are
sort of the shape of the future in the
form of the past super charming really
fun and totally clean</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
