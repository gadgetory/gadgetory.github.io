that's cool they're actually pretty neat
now and they can save you from pulling
your phone on your pocket as much most
smartwatches are good at giving you
notifications they're good at
controlling your music counting your
steps and giving you little snippets of
information like the weather a smart
watch still won't replace your phone and
I should tell you that most of the apps
are going to be slow and kind of
annoying and a lot of them are actually
not that great at just showing you what
time it is
but hey you're sold you want a
SmartWatch well you should get the best
one the one that gets all the basics
right and has a pretty good chance of
getting the advanced stuff right - plus
oh yeah it should look good and it
should work really well with your phone
that last part is a tricky one that's
why if you have an iPhone you should get
an Apple watch and if you have an
Android phone you should get the new
Moto 360
let's talk I phone first there are
actually a lot of different smart
launches that work with the iPhone but
the one that Apple makes is the best it
looks good it lasts a full day and it
has a lot of different choices for watch
faces and style since Apple makes it
it's able to hook into all those
applicants like iMessage Maps and
calendar really well it's especially
improved since Apple updated the
software more and more apps are
available now for the Apple watch which
means that you can get custom
information like the weather or whatever
on your watch face and you can get
custom widgets and apps when you need
them most people should just go for the
cheapest Apple watch the sport it does
all the same stuff that the more
expensive ones do and if you want you
can find a nice band on Amazon to spruce
it up on Android is a similar story you
want to watch it runs the same software
as your phone knows there are a ton of
Android wear watches out there and most
of them are basically the same so you
can just pick one that looks the best to
you it doesn't cost too much of them all
the one that I think will feel to the
most people is the new Moto 360 it comes
in two sizes and it can easily customize
with different bodies and watch bands
yes it does have a weird little flat
tire on the display but it's not as
chunky or as slow as the other options
and there are a lot of options basically
anything that's made in 2015 will be
fine except the Zen watch - which is
really slow and pretty cheap looking
but what you're really buying with the
Apple watch and the Moto 360 isn't what
they can do today but what they're more
likely to be able to do in the future
both Google and Apple are trying really
hard to make sure their phones work
really well with these watches they also
have much better voice input support so
you can make reminders and search for
stuff and more importantly they're
pushing developers to release apps that
you actually might want to use on them
but the truth is very few third-party
apps on either watch are any good now
both of these two watches last about a
day but if you think you need more
battery life than that take a look at
the pebble smartwatch pebbles handle the
basics they work really well on both
Android and iOS and they last several
days in a charge they also have some
apps but overall it's a much more
bare-bones SmartWatch than the other
ones and here's another thing to think
about using a SmartWatch can actually be
kind of hard to figure out the Apple
watch is like five different new
interactions and a button to learn and
Android wear can get a little confusing
with its taps and swipes and long
presses if you want something simple but
still full-featured Samsung's gear s2
has a really nice dial on the top that
you can just rotate it's great but it
only works with Android and I don't
think it's going to get as much
third-party support as the other watches
but here's the bottom line
get the watch that looks good on your
wrist and accept that you're going to
have to spend a few hundred dollars to
make that happen you'll get
notifications you'll be able to count
your steps and maybe get directions to
the local coffee shop but if you want
all that and you want to watch that
still has a pretty good chance of being
supportive in a year or two go with the
watch that has the right software for
the iPhone that's the Apple watch
Android users it's the Moto 360</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
