an effort to get cell phone service does
putting our arms up actually help us get
bars you might think putting your arm up
will get your phone closer to the cell
tower or improve your chances of picking
up a signal in reality cell signals are
more or less homogeneous and surround us
if you don't have signal now the length
of your arm won't be enough to get it I
talked to Lu Zhang a professor in the
Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering at Rice University about
this behavior I think generally things
say yeah it doesn't help that much you
may think that the cellphone signal is
like spotlight when you're on a stage
it's not it's already become a few safe
therefore when you change raise your
hand or change your orientation effects
versus mode in general I don't I don't
think it helps a lot with that said
walking a half block or so can help
especially if you're in a city because
if you're in a city you're receiving
signals as they bounce off buildings so
walking around a bit could change how
the signal gets to you as for the actual
phones themselves there isn't much you
can do to change the service you get the
manufacturers already do rigorous
testing around cell signal and barring
fluke situations like antenna gate with
iPhone 4 they do a good job of
maintaining calls of course the service
provider you have can also affect your
service because now all providers are
created equal but if you're in a dire
situation and you need a cell phone
service Lin recommends getting on your
feet and walking look there situation if
you don't have good quality is because a
lot of people on your value like the
crowded concert walking a few meters
wouldn't solve the problem but if you
happen to be in a urban Canyon like in
downtown area with other buildings right
it could potentially help our cause or
your indoor that there's some location
that you don't have good reception maybe
walk a little bit the more you what
maybe the better chance you have a
solution you heard the man get out there
maybe you'll wander into service
