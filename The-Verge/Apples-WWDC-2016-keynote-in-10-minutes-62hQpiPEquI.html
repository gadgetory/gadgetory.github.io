really big and jam-packed morning

quickly scroll through them with the
watch face now we've added control
center you just swipe up from the bottom
just like on iOS and very familiar so
now we receive a message you can see the
ways to respond right there we scribble
you have a new way to respond just by
writing what you like on the screen you
can just quickly draw the letters for
your message right there like writing
something like Starbucks you can see the
letters go right on top of each other
and we're adding a new watch space
specifically for that called activity
we've also added a really simple new
face that we call numerals you can now
just swipe to switch the face you'd like
to use and we're going to be able to
help with that with SOS on the watch

new feature in watch OS so we know that

have over 6000 native apps in just seven
months and so we're making a new version
of the remote app this is what it looks
like it's got a beautiful now playing
screen with playback controls but most
importantly all the features of the Siri
remote Siri changed the way we interact
with our television and we're making it
even better because now you can search
movies by topics find highschool
comedies from the 80s now Siri actually
searches over six hundred and fifty
thousand movies and TV shows now but
what about YouTube search YouTube for
Steph Curry's three-pointers we've got a
great new feature called live tune in

in Universal clipboard but what if when
you're on even your iPhone and you found
some text and you just went to copy it
that when you then went to your Mac well

other Macs as well and have those files
be available to us on the go on our
iPhones

you make room for the files that your
new files by keeping your older ones up
in the cloud but we also want make it
easy for you to get rid of files you'll
never use again I'll turned on all the
switches for optimized storage and we

these systems pleased to introduce iOS
10 in iOS 10 we've redesigned the
experience of the lockscreen we I just
raised my wrist and my phone
wakes up just like that this is
especially great with messages let's 3d
touch into that one and here you see I
see the message that was sent to me I
can respond right here control centers
available from the bottom of the screen
as well but if I swipe over you see we
have a special area for our music we've
made it easier than ever to get it your
camera from the lock screen so I can
just slide over from the right and
there's my camera and we've made it
easier than ever to get it your widgets
just slide over the other way and if I
want that widget available to me at all
times on my today view I can just add
that widget like that I tap in live
action carried it Siri because we're
opening up Siri to developers send a
WeChat to nancy saying i'll be five
minutes late quick type well now we're
using deep learning and so it can
extract information from a message that
maybe says oh you're talking about dim
sum at 11:00 a.m. on sunday well when
you go to automatically create a
calendar event siri can pre-fill it for
you photos the big news and photos this
year is advanced computer vision facial
recognition to object and scene
recognition as well we can bring forward
things like trips we can figure out that
you might want to see photos of a
highlight reel of the last weekend or we
can bring forward memories of people
that are special to you and topics most
important we pull
together into a intuitive user interface
let's get started with maps it's more
proactive so you slide up from the
bottom and you can see suggestions maps
knows that usually at this time I
usually go to work
well now we're applying all of these new
designs to navigation as well and we
give you quick controls to let you see
route details so now you can even look
and see on your route where food or gas
stations are and maps will tell you how
much longer it'll take if you go to any
one of those music so today we've got an
all new Apple music redesigned from the
ground up and now their lyrics come out
let's talk about news it starts with an
all-new design that's why we're
introducing subscriptions now onto
number eight and it's home kit we're
building on the home kit framework with
a great new app we call home when you
launch the home app you get to see your
own personalized wallpaper and all of
your accessories no matter who they're
made by and you can control them so
easily
number nine phone so now you can
actually get voicemail transcription of
your number ten and this one's a doozy
it's messages because now we have rich
links it's especially awesome when you
get shared with things like video

know people really love emoji and now
we've made them three times bigger and
to help you always reach for the right
emoji we're providing emoji predictions
as you tie when you tap on the emoji
button we'll highlight all the emotive
liable words there and you can just tap
tap tap tap and emulsify we have bubble
effects so if you want to say it loud
you can say it loud you know sometimes
you want to get across something
personal an invisible ain't gives you
the way to do that you can just slide
your finger across the bubble and clear
away and so now with smart handwritten
messages like handwriting bubbles you
see when it comes across the care there
is the ink just settles in and
course we support digital touch as well
