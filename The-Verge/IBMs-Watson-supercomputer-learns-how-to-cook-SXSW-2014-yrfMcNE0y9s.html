and not just because it's made with raw
snapper and plantains remember what's in
the IBM supercomputer that won jeopardy
two years ago yeah
well Watson is a chef now we started
this project about two years ago we
wanted to see if computers could be
creative if they could not only reason
about the world as it is but try to
create new new products things that I've
never seen before that I've never been
seen before and that are also valuable
this is really a collaboration between
the human and the computer there's that
constant interaction with the system you
know you you choose you choose what you
want to make because you have to kind of
direct the computer in a certain
direction and then the computer gives
you suggestions it tells you oh you
chose chicken chicken is used a lot in
maybe Singaporean cuisine do you want to
make it Singaporean dish and then it's
going to give you a list of dishes that
you find in Singaporean cuisine so
that's that's that interaction that
happens all the time then the system
about what makes the system creative is
that it's able also to assess the
products that it creates so once it
generates combinations of ingredients it
can tell you what combinations are going
to be novel and surprising by comparing
them to existing recipes and you can
also predict the pleasantness of the
dishes it can predict how pleasant the
dish will smell and taste
when you when you start combining
ingredients the number of possible
combinations grows exponentially if you
have a recipe with maybe 10 ingredients
it's not rare to have something like a
trillion or a quadrillion of possible
recipes using those 10 types of
ingredients of course this is way more
than any human could possibly think of
who are not even true not even to
mention try
what makes transitive computing
different is that the computers are able
to to learn new things and reason about
the world as it is and also now we see
that they're able to create new products
that have never been seen before we have
a lot of ideas about what we could do
with this technology we're here at South
by Southwest precisely to learn what
people expect from a cognitive system
from cognitive computing and figure out
then what we can do next to help them in
their daily lives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
