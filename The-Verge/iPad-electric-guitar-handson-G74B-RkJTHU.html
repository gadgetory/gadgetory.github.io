guitar apprentice it's actually coming
out in July got the hardware and
software of about nine nine dollars this
is not the final software this just
apples GarageBand so a lot of
functionality have here it's just not
here yet so for example we can't do open
strings these drums are just what's in
the garage band tutorial when you do get
to that point though each of these
buttons will serve as a friend you can
hold it down like a real guitar and
pluck at the string of course we don't
have any videos of that right now we're
gonna be done with a show so I can say
right now it's a very comfortable piece
of hardware it's very similar to the
rock band three row guitar that came out
a couple years ago and the Fred saw a
pretty easy but again like you can't do
basic functions just in this demo knows
yet
that touched it so we're gonna go ahead
and check out drum master this is also
coming out until the summer and
basically the same idea it's a plastic
piece of hardware six piece for Toms to
symbols the lost a sensitive doesn't
pick up every little beat some probably
ever you know a few milliseconds a
little bit of delay between hits works
instantly well but remember this is a
this is definitely for 4k trying to
learn drums so we just we just checked
out ions guitar apprentice and drum
master / drummer printed software which
is supposed to really kind of teach your
kids how to play the instruments the
drum master was pretty good at work
decently well the one thing remember
that's you know they're going for a
price point that it's kind of cheap
hardware there's really no way I'd run
it the guitar princess is a great idea
but at $99 close the iPad the figuration
really just just get you care to real
guitar</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
