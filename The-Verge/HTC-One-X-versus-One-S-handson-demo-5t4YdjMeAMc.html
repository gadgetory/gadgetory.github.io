to give you a quick comparison here
between the two major phones just an
ounce of the HTC One series we've got
the HTC One X right here 4.7 inch 720p
HD display and the HTC one s q HD Super
AMOLED display so this is super LCD
Super AMOLED 4.7 4.3 inches both of them
have unibody designs both of them run
android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich wits ends
for on top both have these capacitive
keys of the bottom both have micro drill
speaker grills at the top front facing
cameras both of the same evening
megapixel camera so it's very evident
that they're part of the same family as
HTC wants to make clear is a one-family
but would you give you a comparison the
major distinction between them they are
both also very thin the major seizure
between them really is the fear on the
hands this is made out of a unibody
polycarbonate shell whereas this uses a
unibody aluminum shell this one has been
treated with micro oxidation which is a
really cool name and a really cool
process in fact for making it tough and
resistant to scratches whereas this is
you know a softer more of plastic
feeling surface probably because it is a
classic but yeah we just give you a
quick look at the tops and the sides and
the bottom
both of these will be available in early
April or should be around Europe the HTC
One X should be available on AT&amp;amp;T with
LTE in the united states around the same
time around april it will come with the
geocode Snapdragon s4 on AT&amp;amp;T whereas it
will be with tegra free in Europe and
the rest of the world also with the
Snapdragon s4 is the one s is coming to
t-mobile in the US with hspa+ around the
same time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
