here at CES with Toyota's autonomous car
concept so this isn't a self-driving car
what it is is essentially a system that
detects objects can tell where other
cars are people are and then it's
supposed to be able to use this to warn
people when something is going to happen
so up here you have a lidar sensor
that's laser and radar and it's going to
sort of Bradley detect what's in the
surroundings and then underneath it
there are gyroscopes and accelerometers
that are going to narrow that down
they're saying from you know about three
meters to three millimeters below that
you have two white discs which are GPS
sensors so that's going to be able to
tell you both where the car is and
they're staggered so you can tell what
direction it's turning under that there
are radar sensors and some cameras the
radar is for hard objects and the
cameras are for quote fleshy objects
some cars already have these camera
systems they're in safety and automatic
pedestrian detection systems but this
basically is the next step in that so
you've got some up there at the top
looking straight ahead and then two down
there that looked out to either side
left and right right now what this is
doing is being used essentially on a
test course to gather information so
then it can tell what goes in the next
step in safety systems when we talk to
people here they really don't think that
cars are going to be driverless they've
said that this is supposed to be a
co-pilot system</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
