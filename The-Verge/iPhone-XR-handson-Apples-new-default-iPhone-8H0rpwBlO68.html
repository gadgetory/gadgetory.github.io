the new iPhone 10 R this is a super
strange phone I think it's really
interesting
design-wise is a hybrid of like the
iPhone 8 with this glass back in the
iPhone 10 with this non screen edge to
edge it's got a bunch of the specs the
iPhone 10s it's missing a whole bunch of
sub - so let's go through it real quick
the iPhone 10 R has at last bat an
aluminum frame 7000 series aluminum on
the front is a 6.1 inch LCD display with
326 pixels per inch it looks a lot like
the iPhone 10 display the curved curved
corners and a notch to the top but that
is an LCD to get close and see some of
the anti-aliasing they're doing it has
the same age 12 Bionic chip is the new
iPhone 10 F it has the same wide-angle
camera on the back as a penance it's
only a single camera on the front it's
got the same true dat face detection
system and selfie camera as a fan so
really what you're looking at is like a
lot of the design of the old iPhone 8
like the grass backs the aluminum frame
with the front design in the I contend
with the not screen and a bunch of the
features of the iPhone expected so it's
a really strange hybrid of the phone I
think it's really interesting it comes
in all these colors you got yellow coral
blue there's a black one a white one
and a product red one as well I'm not a
big fan of the yellow it's the product
red one though that I think is
absolutely best isn't a mob scene around
it the entire time we've been here it's
just a really striking front and then
obviously you've got black and white the
same as ever
I think these colors are going to sell
the phone over the iPhone 10s for a lot
of people camera on the new iPhone 10 R
is 12 megapixel single lens back seven
megapixel selfie camera with the true
death system on the front this is pretty
awful they can do portrait mode with a
single lens last year only two plus
phones and the 10 into portrait mode
with dual cameras obviously Google to do
portrait mode or the simple lines per
pixel to apples figured out how to do
with a single end so that's NR this
camera is also faster you're doing
something called smart HDR which takes
four frames a number of inter frames and
a long exposure do better HDR
photography using this camera system
that sounds very interesting obviously
we've got a tester laughs most notably
about the LCD screen is the lack of 3d
touch so every iPhone since the 6s has
had 3d touch where you squeeze the
display that is simply not here we don't
know why Apple took it out we're gonna
ask them got some 10s test 3d touch yep
and seven is 3d touch the iPhone 8 has
to touch those are all still on sale but
the 10 are absolutely does not have it
that is the biggest omission from this
phone from here
I just like holding these phones and
then the color is absolutely beautiful
obviously the question everybody always
has some phones like this is battery
life
Apple says at 90 minutes more than the
iPhone 8 busted everybody also always
wants to know about price these are
gonna start at 749 which is kind of a
remarkable price then they're going to
go up to 256 gigs of storage the pricing
will go up accordingly from there this
thing is it's making sounds to me they
really got way more from the iPhone
event today dieter played with the
iPhone 10s and the Apple watch series
for that's an easy page and there's ton
more coverage on the version oncology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
