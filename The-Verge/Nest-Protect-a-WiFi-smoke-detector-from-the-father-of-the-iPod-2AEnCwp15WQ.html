cool the Nest Learning Thermostat built
by iPod creator Tony Fadell and a team
of engineers he recruited from Apple
Google and the rest of the industry
added real smarts to a product that most
people never thought about and brought
the idea of a connected home into
relatively affordable reality now nest
is introducing its next reinvention of
an unloved home device the smoke
detector it's called the nest protect
and it's a rounded square with a big
butt in the middle surrounded by a ring
of LEDs when it detects smoke it tells
you emergency there's smoke in the
living room and you shut it off just by
waving it no more climbing up ladders
deal with false alarms no more wondering
which room the beeping is coming from
you can just look at the nest app on
your phone we think that this is a
product that if we talk to the family's
other families they need this because
they are has turned about Co they're
concerned about smoke they don't want to
be woken up they hate the product but
they know they have to have so let's try
to make it enjoyable let's try to make
sure it's not annoying the nest protect
is designed to stand out I mean it's a
square not a circle like most other
smoke detectors that's a big departure
for Fidel and his team who are famous
for other circles like the original iPod
click wheel and the nest thermostat
itself we don't want to just be known
for run products they actually a lot of
smoke alarm that I around and we were to
differentiate ourselves from from all
the ones and I think that one thing you
can tell by this product is nobody would
mistake it for any other smoke alone but
smarts and clever design come at a price
the protector cost $129 for about $100
more than the average smoke detectors
sold in your local hardware store the
protect is packed with sensors there's a
light sensor and ultrasonic motion
detector and activity sensor a heat
sensor and of course a carbon monoxide
detector and a smoke sensor the smoke
sensor is actually custom nest designed
its own smoke chamber so the protect
could sense a wider range of smoke than
other products and if you have a nest
thermostat it'll collect data from the
activity sensors and then protect so
more accurately figure out when you're
away and adjust your heating and cooling
accordingly and if there's a carbon
monoxide alert the protect will instruct
your thermostat to shut off the furnace
a common source of those problems once
the protect gathers all this information
from its sensors the focus is on
communication the protect constantly
checks itself every 10 minutes
if something goes wrong it speaks out
loud and sends an alert to your phone
that could be a smoke or carbon monoxide
alert or it could just be a low battery
warning what we've had to do with
engineer we're using incredibly
low-power microprocessor the first time
they probably ever been used so 6ss lost
multiple years yes Wow yes how many
years the regulations are not allowed me
to tell you what our claim is because we
can't make a claim they have to test for
multiple years before we can make it
really but we've designed it for
multiple years on six dollars on six
double-a lithium Wow
all of that is controlled by not one but
two processors there's a first simpler
system that controls just the smoke and
carbon monoxide detectors and there's a
second more complicated system that
controls all the in connected features
like the Wi-Fi radio the voice interface
and the motion sensors so beyond the
safety how are you kind of getting that
that first experience at that ongoing
experience of having an S product it
like is delightful nicely promised it's
the ability for nest protect to actually
detect that you're flipping a switch and
the light is shutting off when you do
that is gonna glow either green when
everything's fine meaning the sensors
are okay the battery is fine the
connection is fine and you know you're
being protected what is gonna blow
yellow and then at that point you can
weigh that it and you can actually tell
you what's going on do you need to
replace the batteries it will tell you
so as well the other emotional thing is
we wanted you to be safe not just when
there's emergency but all the time so
today when you walk down the hallway to
go to the bathroom in the night you
either turn on the lights or you step on
your kids toy that's in the hallway so
instead as you walk under the nest
protect it will turn on path like to
glow and light your way as you go
through it just like the nest thermostat
does but you can't just release a new
smoke detector out of the market various
agencies around the world have to
certify that it's actually safe here in
the US that process is handled by the
underwriters laboratories or ul and
that's spent nearly a year testing and
refining to protect to make sure it
passed all the tests so we can't just
rush it out to market and say oh yeah
trust us it's stacks and stacks of tests
that need to be run and you were in the
final final throes of certification
right
what is paying an extra hundred dollars
for smoke detector really worth it after
all every other smoke detector on the
market is vast the same tests and I'm
like the nest thermostat there's no
promise the protect will save you money
or energy overtime it also feels like
there should be more communication
between nest products once you've got
all these sensors in your home you
should be able to do something with it
just like we did with the iPod you know
you started with just music and they
added all kinds of things over time with
a thermostat we started with a
thermostat we added all kinds of
features over time you don't strike me
as the kind of guy who quotes you strike
me as the kind of guy who knows what the
next move is we're starting where we
start who knows what else can be added
over time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
