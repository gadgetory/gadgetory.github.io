modern processors and a slightly newer
keyboard and true tone displays but
here's a question is what's here
actually enough to make professionals
trust these machines you know what
before we get into all of that we should
honestly just start with the basics this
MacBook Pro looks exactly like the last
MacBook Pro it has the same 4
Thunderbolt ports it has the same touch
bar it has basically the same Retina
display the only external thing that has
changed is the keyboard Apple says they
redesigned it to make it quieter and in
our testing it is in fact just a little
bit quieter the other thing that's new
here is they've added true tone to the
display which we've mostly turned off
because we care about color accuracy we
were all set to really get into that
issue of trust and talk a little bit
about the stuff that's eroded over the
years for pros but then we got a
curveball last night which is a week
before you're watching this now this
happened problem though is that this
chassis the MacBook Pro cannot cool the
i9 properly when you look at renders and
I'm using Adobe Premiere after a few
seconds we're starting to see some very
serious throttling so Ryker sitting it's
Tuesday July 24th and Apple has just
admitted that there is in fact thermal
throttling at every single model of the
new MacBook Pros they've released a
statement which I'm going to read and
they've released a software fix that's
available right now so here's their
statement following extensive
performance testing under numerous
workloads we've identified that there is
a missing digital key in the firmware
that impacts the thermal management
system and could drive clock speeds down
under heavy thermal loads on the macbook
pro a book fix is included in today's
Mac OS hi Sierra
yadda we apologize to any customer who's
experienced less than optimal
performance on their new systems ok key
takeaways here apples not changing their
performance results they say it's still
the same we are going to retest all of
that we're gonna redo all of our tests
so stay tuned for that later in this
video to really get into it we actually
need to talk to one of those
professionals who does professional
stuff with it and hey look over there it
severe and havoc he's one of those he
had its videos and directs videos and
does photography we should talk to him
thank you
all right so in front of me we have the
new laptop the Vita we're just talking
about and to my left or your right is my
personal laptop the 2016 MacBook Pro
with the touch Bart the one that kicked
off the entire redesign of this line the
20th team built is thoroughly modern
with super-powerful specs it's on par
with the Windows laptops that came out
earlier this year and Apple is getting
better at updating processor for the
MacBook Pro line but a better way to ask
theatre's question about trust is this
does the power of this thing offset the
hassles for the past few days I
literally locked myself inside one of
the conference room in our office in
order to compare these two machines I
benchmark Premiere Pro Final Cut 10 and
just use it for my every day test but
there are a couple of areas I really
want to focus on now hey very actually
you know what can we just talk about the
specs for another minute because there's
a lot going on here
hey dieter hey buddy how's it going okay
so there's the t2 which handles a bunch
of the like internal mechanisms of the
computer there's faster ddr4 Ram and
there's this new faster SSD which does
file operations like stupid quickly
there's also the fact that you can get a
six core processor on this which is
actually more than a standard iMac yeah
and you can get this I 9 processor as
well which is really powerful scrubbing
through footage work really well
rendering files work well as you expect
them to realistically you'll probably
want to do a couple of things at the
same time so let's spread out that Ram
power 32 gigabytes of it in this case so
I open up Spotify Lightroom
after-effects and I screen recorded my
entire process which might have been an
overkill I noticed the laptop struggling
a bit that most versa were just kind of
Jaggi
Jaggi that's not a word so I just
decided to stop the screen recording
anyway once the video was done I started
exporting them on both machines at the
same time so I was going to show you the
results of my macbook pro compared to
the new MacBook Pro but at this point it
seems like old news so instead let's
talk about the performance of the i9
MacBook Pro before and after the south
that Apple released earlier this week
all right let's start with Premiere Pro
first in both of the test before and
after the patch the export times were
basically the same 11 minutes and 35
seconds once I switched the Final Cut
Pro I noticed some improvement what used
to be a four minute and 35 second export
that was down to 2 minutes and 26
seconds so yeah
thermal throttling was an issue Apple
released an update and looks like they
fixed it
as for Premiere Pro we still need to run
a few more tests to have more conclusive
results to be blunt though it wasn't
that much faster than my two-year old
MacBook the improvement was as little as
10% for now the only thing that we can
assume is that Premiere Pro isn't
optimized for this machine yet ok back
to our regularly scheduled programming
a lot of the time we work out in the
field covering events which require us
to shoot edit and deliver videos in a
matter of hours more often than not I
just found myself leaving the 2016
MacBook Pro behind because the 2015
version had better battery life also I
didn't want to deal with dongles but
that's another topic dongles
I heard dongles I'm always here to talk
about dog of life you heard correctly
okay but the jokes aside it is a genuine
source of angst for people with these
computers yeah the point is that there
was kind of like the one-two punch here
I didn't trust the battery they don't
deal with the dongles so just bring my
old MacBook with me okay so what do you
feel about it now with this new MacBook
well the speed helps to make up for some
of that but you still have to deal with
dongles and for me personally there
isn't a perfect portable dongle doc that
I can use I need SD card readers super
you know fast USB ports but also
Thunderbolt 2 which nobody supports for
me the big one is like can i really
trust this keyboard long term right and
the speed did improve as well as the
keyboard not only the sound but there's
like nice resistant to it although this
is a new machine so that might change
over time ok and then I guess the last
thing on our list is the battery how's
that oh yeah the thing I was talking
about before you interrupted me sorry
there it's ok anyways so what we know
about battery in this machine that it's
slightly bigger than before but that's
meant to offset the more powerful
processors and I really don't care for
my battery lasts longer for you know
reading surfing the web watching movies
I want it to last long for more intense
video editing the 2016 MacBook Pro
lasts about 3 hours maybe less and as
far as I can tell this one is about the
same not saying it's worse but it's
definitely not better now at the top of
the video I asked can you trust this
machine that's sitting in front of your
enemy
and I asked if all the extra power can
offset the hassles that come with it and
yeah this laptop finally proved that it
can perform as expected too close to
what I was expecting it to right but the
question is what were you really
expected well I was expecting a little
bit more noticeable bump in performance
and a better battery
I didn't get that bump in performance
and I definitely didn't get a better
battery yeah but the question here
honestly is maybe your maybe everybody's
expectations we're just too high
everybody's frustrations about the Mac
got laid on top of this you know unibody
frame the same frame thing really can't
handle thermals although apparently they
got fixed though you know yeah but also
they've been really squirrely about the
keyboard they say it's only there to be
quieter but we also kind of know is
redesigned to be more reliable it's like
with this Mac Apple just keeps walking
ace first into controversies people who
buy these machines they don't really
care about controversies that much they
buy it because of the way it looks and
the way it's built and this build kind
of backfire at this time this thing is
not gonna eliminate a heat as much as
like a bigger more chunkier laptop would
that's okay as long as you know what
you're getting yourself into
yeah I mean for my question about trust
do I trust this thing yeah I guess it
feels like when we ended up with here is
this same laptop that a lot of people
genuinely loved and a lot of people are
genuinely frustrated with only now it's
faster maybe it's not as fast as deep
down we know a pro laptop could be but
maybe that was just too much to expect
all right I guess it's time for the end
card so all you but okay well thanks
everybody for watching let me know in
the comments where you think viren just
ran off to and also watch Virg science
videos they're great last week they did
one about wildfires and this week they
did one about weathering storms it's
like they've been sub tweeting Apple
