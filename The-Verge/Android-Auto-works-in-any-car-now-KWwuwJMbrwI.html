Verge and we are looking at Android auto
but it's not running on a dashboard it's
running on a phone coming very soon
Android auto is going to work just on a
phone if you don't have it built into
your car so let me show you a little bit
about how it works so basically you can
launch Android auto on your phone just
by tapping the icon the other thing
that's really neat is you can also
launch it by pairing it to your car's
bluetooth so it'll just automatically
launch when you get into your car and as
you can see this is a very simple
straightforward Android auto layout
they've reduced the buttons on the
bottom so it's just navigation music and
phone but as you can see you jump right
into navigation and they've made these
buttons on the bottom really really big
so they're much easier to tap when you
are driving so home will just take you
back to the Android auto home instead of
back to your actual home screen you can
tap on music here and of course you can
tap on recent calls you can also of
course use OK Google or tap the
microphone to give it voice commands
which maybe won't work outside here and
there's a whole bunch of other settings
and feedback and stuff so this is a
preview of Android auto and they expect
that it will run on N and it will run on
devices down to Android 5 and it should
be available relatively soon and there
you go it's Android auto on a phone even
if you don't have it in your dashboard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
