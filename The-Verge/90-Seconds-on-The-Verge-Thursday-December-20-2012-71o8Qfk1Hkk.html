thousand twelve on ross miller and this
is 90 seconds on the verge of the end of
time as we know it the european
commission will charge samsung quote
very soon first use of injunctions
against apple and europe the commission
has been investigating samsung for a
possible breach of antitrust rules since
january there's a good chance samsung
has already seen these charges in
private as it has already dropped those
injunction charges against apple this
week and if you didn't have enough
reason to despise facebook this week
along comes a new method for random
strangers to pay facebook to message you
facebook is testing the feature with a
very small portion of american users
those people can pay good money for
their messages to hit someone else's
inbox even without mutual friends no
word yet and how much you can pay
facebook to not let this happen to you
under any circumstances finally with the
rise of drone surveillance comes the
logistical hurdle of watching and
analyzing staggering amounts of footage
q es bien according to reports from USA
Today the US Air Force is working with
the Sports Network and other video
analysis experts to find new ways of
managing the video in 2001 air force
received about 4,800 hours of drone
footage last year that number jumped
over three hundred and twenty-seven
thousand hours the Air Force hopes it
can find a software solution but until
then it will continue to rely on sheer
manpower for obvious reasons
crowdsourcing is not an option that's it
for today's top stories tune in tomorrow
