life and I get to report on it every day
but all my work is done from Earth
well mostly given the chance I'd love to
go to space even to live there but what
would it take to do that and what would
it be like living on another planet
well we think about what is a day in the
life of an astronaut gonna look like
what it takes to keep them alive as well
as what work they're gonna do in science
they're gonna perform while they're
there you really have to be careful with
your footing if you have an acute
episode and it's 20 minutes to wait for
a response from the flight surgeon on
the ground you don't have a lot of
punches answers now you get to do it
okay so especially when we go to Mars
we're gonna have to figure out if we
want to use the Martian regular as a
medium to grow plants in we're gonna
have to convert that regular into a soil
a usable soil this season follow along
as I investigate some of the ways people
are preparing to live in space from
testing out habitats and growing food to
learning about the psychological
challenges and medical trainings
necessary to survive
mr. Java always requires me to get into
weird bodysuits I'm Lauren grush and
this is spacecraft</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
