verge and we're looking at the acer w
free 8-inch tablet here and this is
running on windows 8.1 and so you can
see we've got it in portrait mode here
and mike's learn a few improvements here
just to make it a little bit easier to
use these sort of tablets and so you'll
get the sort single application view
here and then if you did want to use it
horizontally you could then snap apps
side-by-side basically the older limit
has been removed and which used to be a
resolution limit and now you can
literally just use apps alongside each
other and and change the actual snap in
there and in terms of portrait mode it
doesn't always seem to to rotate
automatically if you've got apps open it
seems like you need to like move the
apps back into the full screen to get
out to change i dint us a bug with 8.1
in the moment but much has changed to
stall so it's working in portrait mode
and was previously with for shooting
tourism tool mode so all of their apps
will now fully support this portrait
experience other than that's not too
much to say I mean it's standard sort of
eight point one but it you know it's
obviously running on these small devices
that are going to come to markets or
late this year on the opposite end of
the scale and we've got the toshiba
kirabook here which has a resolution of
2560 x 1440 and michael basically done a
few DPI changes here and just till it
sort of the UI controls minimally little
bit easier to grab with your finger now
it basically does it automatically
depending on the screen resolution and
screen size and you can change it
independently and you can scale up to
two hundred percent or hundred fifty
percent but I d 4 is going to be
automatic now what this really means is
we can click into sort stuff like
Windows Explorer and you find like
folders are a lot easier to tap on the
ribbon a little bit easier to manage and
sort of hitting the
the X in the corner day is just a lot
easier even in applications so some of
the windows applications you'll see that
all the elements are slightly enlarged
just a little bit easier to just sort of
use on a touchscreen now the this is
obviously going to be dependent on app
developers actually updating their apps
but Mike's doing some sort scaling there
to improve things and the final scenario
is an 11-inch devices so we got an Acer
Aspire s7 and this is running at 1920 x
1080 and basically before and it was
really unusable basically on the desktop
unless unless you had it set a specific
scale resolution and obviously might
ship the surface pro better DPI and
scaling but now it's obviously scaling
correctly and by itself so again the
elements are easy to click on and a
final improvement with all these desktop
changes is the on-screen keyboard in a
desktop mode will actually be a lot
bigger on depending on what device
you're using so it depends on the screen
size and OEMs can sort set that and but
much less tells us that it will
basically be up to the computer makers
to make the screen that to make the
keyboard a lot bigger and and obviously
this is running at 1920 x 1080 and
before it would be sort of all the way
down here and kind of unusable it's a
look a lot better here and that was a
quick look at the 8-inch devices all the
way up to high res displays on a Windows
8.1
