the new HTC u 11 this is HCC's true
flagship phone for 2017 it's the second
phone they've released this year we saw
the u ultra come out earlier this year
but that one was a little bit less
mainstream this is rest-assured the full
flagship phone experience from HTC it's
got a 5.5 inch display it's quad HD
resolution Super LCD very similar to HTC
devices in the past it's powered by
qualcomm snapdragon 835 processor it's
got 4 gigabytes of RAM 64 gigabytes of
storage 3000 milliamp hour battery over
all the hardware is actually really
really nice really well put together
this is one of the colors that they're
they're calling it silver there's also a
blue sapphire blue that's really vibrant
as well as a nice deep black so the
colors are really poppin phone really
does look great I one thing that you may
have noticed is that there's no
headphone jack here just as a USB C port
agency is a few reasons for this one of
them is that it can provide a better in
box headphone experience so in the box
with the HTC u 11 is a set of noise
cancelling headphones that are powered
by USB C so that's a new thing and it
allows it to add a louder speaker a
couple other things that it couldn't do
if it had a regular headphone jack on
there now what's unique and different
here are these sides you can't actually
see it because the sides look exactly
the same as any other phone but we Shh
CC is added is this squeeze function
they're actually pressure sensitive so I
can crush them and launch the camera I
can press them again and take a photo
she's gonna take a selfie here or I can
long press them and turn the flashlight
on or long press them again turn the
flashlight off you can customize all
these things so you can launch a
different app if you want you can launch
a voice assistant kind of a different
experience and we've seen before makes
it a little bit easier to use the phone
in one hand especially when you have a
bigger screen the other thing that
there's new for this HTC u 11 is a
partnership with Amazon HTC's adding
alexa services to the phone so that you
can say Alexa to the phone and it will
do various things that you'd expect an
echo to do like you can check the
weather and play music turn lights on
and off and it will do that even when
the screen is off you don't have to open
an app or do anything special to
launching Alexa services it also has
Google Assistant which you can wake up
with okay Google
it has HTC Sense Companion which does
things like remind you to charge your
battery or tells you about nearby
restaurants and stuff so it has a bunch
of different virtual assistants on here
and you can kind of pick and choose
which one you want to use for software
it's running Android 7.1.1 nougat it's
got HTC Sense software on top which
pretty much looks like stock Android at
this point pretty simple and clean
interface and pretty easy to navigate
now the phone is really really nice I
think it's put together really well it's
built really well obviously HTC kind of
has its unique design characteristics
the refinements over the HTC u ultra are
definitely appreciated the camera bump
is a lot less than it was before it's
easier to hold it's just kind of refined
over all HTC is gonna be releasing this
real soon or announcing it here in an
event in Taiwan right now they say it's
gonna be on sale really soon as can be
priced around the same as other flagship
phones in this price range so that's the
HTC u 11 for more on this phone and
plenty of other things be sure to check

squatters okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
