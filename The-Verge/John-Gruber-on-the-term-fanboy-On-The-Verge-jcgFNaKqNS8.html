relationship when it comes to Apple you
are considered kind of a fanboy an Apple
fanboy would you say that's accurate not
saying that the term is is fair but
people do consider you to be a bit of a
fanboy yeah but I think that that's I
honestly and I I don't use that word to
describe anybody who is a fan of
anything I might what's my quip on that
it's that you have a prepared statement
and I forget it had a good oh I know
what it was it was when Mark Cuban's
switched to a Mac and this was a while
back maybe like 2004-2005 but he wrote a
blog post about it Mark Cuban the owner
of the Dallas Mavericks
billionaire sold some piece of junk to
Yahoo in the 90s mark I think people
know also a great guest star on
Entourage
yes yeah but really weren't Cuban had
this thing about switching to a Mac and
that man this is great
I can't believe it this is so great I
know I'm no Mac fan I'm no Apple fanboy
but you know this is the way to go now
and then I realized that what what Apple
fanboy meant was somebody who began
using Apple products before you did yeah
so it means something else so you think
well I think there are people who you
know the accusation is that I blindly
say good things about Apple products and
figure out ways that actions Apple takes
are good ideas or smart or whatever
because I'm rooting for them like
they're my sports team yeah not blindly
but I think you do well but I think
that's what the word fanboy implying
right that you do but you are rooting
for Apple only in the sense that I
appreciate I appreciate that what
they're trying to do and I'm glad that
somebody is doing it and if it were not
for Apple the industry would be in a far
different state</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
