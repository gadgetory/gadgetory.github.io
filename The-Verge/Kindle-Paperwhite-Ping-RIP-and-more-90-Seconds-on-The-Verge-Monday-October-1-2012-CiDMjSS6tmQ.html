Amazon's Kindle paperwhite is now
shipping the company's latest ereader
has a high-resolution eeing display
that's front lit for nighttime reading
in our review of the device we found it
to be one of the best readers we've ever
used although the 3g option can be a
little pricey the kindle paperwhite
starts at $119 and goes as high as 100
$99 with 3G and no ads Barnes &amp;amp; Noble
meanwhile has dropped the price of its
competing nook simple touch with
glowlight that's known $119 with no ads
both good devices in their own right but
in the end it really comes down to who
you want to buy your books from akia's
LED crusade begins in earnest the
Swedish furniture company has announced
that by 2016 it plans to phase out sales
of all traditional lighting equipment
opting exclusively for LED lights while
the high cost of non-traditional

the lowest price on the market I Kia's
cheapest LED bulb starts at nine
ninety-nine and is a great excuse to go
have meatballs with lingonberry in the
cafeteria Apple's ping has been laid to

users the company is now mercifully shut
down paying for good I move it for told
just a few weeks ago good night sweet
prince and flights of angels sing thee
to thy rest that's it for today's top
stories coming tomorrow how
bioluminescence and genetic modification
are changing the culture of pumpkin
