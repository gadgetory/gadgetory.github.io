hope you like what you see better tell
you about everything that this this
truck can do starting with performance
so ever an acronym we came up with
that I think really really describes the
performance well
the Tesla semi will go zero to 60 in
five seconds
now at 80,000 pounds max gross vehicle
weight but that's the most amount of
weight you can carry on a US Highway
this is the real-time acceleration of a
Tesla semi that on the left the thing
that looks like it's not moving is a
diesel truck the best diesel trucks can
only do 45 miles an hour up a five
percent grade desert Sam I could do 65
miles an hour up to five percent grade
now one of the biggest questions we've
been asked about electric trucks is well
how far can they go because well let's
find out to 500 mile range and by the
way it's 500 miles at maximum weight at
highway speed we also have four
independent motors on citizen visit the
motor on each of the rear wheels and
independent front suspension so it's
incredibly comfortable to drive this
truck what about you know fueling today
if you're feeling a diesel truck you've
got fumes spills toxic environment
prices change all the time and what a
lot of people don't realize is it
actually it takes up to 15 minutes or
more to actually fill it a truck get to
sit there for 15 minutes well the tank
gets full as compared to charging a
teaser truck you can charge at your
origin or destination so while you're
unloading your cargo
in charge
every truck we sell will have enhanced
autopilot as standard okay but the truck
will automatically brake alright good
yeah you can read it too or it'll
automatically break but it will actually
automatically Lane keep as well so even
if even if image from in the truck and
you have a medical emergency
the truck will stay in lane and
gradually come to a halt and put on the
Emergencies if it doesn't hear a
response from you I'll actually call
emergency services and get an ambulance
it's gonna take care of you it's gonna
take care of other cars can take care of
pedestrians this is a massive increase
in safety with that central position
you're in a very safe position even if
you were to slide with with it another
semi you have a low center of gravity
that gives you really good handling
means the probability of a rollover is
massively reduced because the battery
pack is in the floor pan and and
rollover risk is Durant produced and
perhaps most importantly jackknifing is
is usually the worst nightmare of a
trucker how do you stop your your
vehicle from jackknifing and if you're
in difficult conditions the truck will
automatically from stop Jack and I think
because it's got independent motors on
each wheel and it will dynamically
adjust the torque on each wheel so that
jackknifing is impossible reliability is
incredibly important we're 20 massive
attention it's making this truck be
friendly reliable and that's why we are
guaranteeing that this truck will not
break down for a million miles
then what it has you know as a few other
benefits as well
brakes brakes are a big deal for trucks
you got to stop 80,000 pounds it's not
easy that's a lot of brake it's for a
lot of brake wear but because the with
an electric motor you can turn the
breaks into generators so every time you
break that kinetic energy of braking
goes right straight back into the
battery pack instead of heat instead of
wearing down a brake pad it's the brake
pads basically lasts forever but if
you'd ever need to replace brake pads
ever ever and this is the feature I like
best film Oh nuclear explosion proof
class
so standard glass now why is this
important cuz agency it looks nothing
survived to nuclear explosion as
incredible the reason this is important
is because truck windshields are huge
and they cracked about once a year and
if the truck windshield is cracked
you're not allowed to try it so it
actually it struck or froze if you have
a practicar inch field and that and that
means lost driving you just pointed
customers
it's a terrible it's terrible day and
you if you're stuck in building nowhere
take ages to get it to get a new
windshield so actually this this this
detail this detail matters a lot to to
someone who really understands trucking
we have the tesla app that gives you
full information about your truck this
is sort of normal it's like we take it
for granted with if you've got a Model S
or more Lexus like that but this is not
normal
actually for trucks you have full access
to all your truck information you go to
remote diagnostics you can you can see
what's going on preventative maintenance
the truck will actually anticipate when
it needs to be made when it needs
maintenance and inform you ahead of time
you're probably wondering how much is
this gonna cost because Tesla stuff is
expensive when you take everything into
account take the least cost the
insurance cost maintenance all of the
factors the fully accounted for true
cost of trucking a diesel truck will be
20% more expensive than it Benitez's
semi per mile
on retail this is from day one it from
day one having a Tesla semi will be a
diesel truck on economics day one and
this is at this is a worst-case scenario
so it gets better than this this is the
this is the wood this is worst-case
scenario comparison this is taking max
vehicle gross it's going at 60 miles an
hour and it's assuming to $50 gasoline
price we're guaranteeing a sevenths and
kilowatt wholesale price production
begins 2019 so if you order now get part
the truck in two years
so turns out there was some cargo in the
truck
there's some cargo in the truck we threw
it bring it out if he'll have asked us
for a long time when you're gonna make a
new roadster we are making it now the
new Tesla Roadster will be the fastest
car production car ever made
period it'll do the quarter-mile in
eight point nine seconds
I wouldn't say what the actual top speed
is but it's above 250 miles an hour this
is gonna have a two hundred kilowatt
hour battery pack 606 this is these
numbers sound not even for their real
600 620 mile range that's not a thousand
kilometres be the first time an electric
vehicle brakes a thousand kilometres a
production electric vehicle will travel
more than a thousand kilometres in a
single charge at highway speed this
thing will have three motors so it's
all-wheel drive one motor in front turn
two on the rear it'll do torque steering
I said turn come out we put our battery
pack 10,000 Newton meters of torque so
you know what that means it's stupid
it's also a four-seater so it's a two
plus two two plus two okay
you can't put giant people in the rear
seat but you will to put okay the giant
person is squashed or a small small
person fit in the bed so but it's a
four-seater it's not like it's this is
four seats
it's convertible so it's a roof or roof
it's and it has tons of storage so you
like actually travel somewhere bring
bring luggage bring whatever you want
and have plenty of storage carry for
people like it's a real car it's not
just crammed in so it has all that
functionality with four seats expecting
this to be available in 2020 the hell of
Mario's touch jump over the barriers
jump over
thank you for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
