VI it is a means to an end
we are not developing we are for its own
sake but in order to do better science
now that you have this interface where
you can work with your data in a much
more natural fashion you're not just
doing a science faster but you're doing
in a completely different way I am
Oliver Carlos I'm a researcher at the
University of California Davis I am
specifically in the caves project which
is an interdisciplinary research project
between computer scientists like myself
and earth scientists on the other side
with the overarching goal to develop
virtual reality as a tool to enable
scientific research at the time when VR
really got noticed by the mainstream for
the first time in the late 80s early 90s
a head-mounted displays were the display
modality of choice the problem was that
had not the displays have two inherent
issues that make them very difficult to
deal with one of them is latency they
require a very low response time between
you moving and the system reacting to it
the second part is they also are very
sensitive to calibration you need to
input the positions of your is relative
to the very small screen very precisely
in order to get a convincing image and
so those were both things that couldn't
really be done with the technology at
the time which is one of the reasons why
we are ultimately failed people ran out
the video world instead of having two
tiny little screens that amounted right
in front of your eyes why not just use
big screens that are far away from you
and they are not attached to your face
and hence the cave was born which is
essentially a combination of three very
big screens and a big floor which are
projected by big projectors and then the
user does not wear this pair on the face
they just wear stereo glasses the same
ones you would wear in a 3d movie
theater that was really the first time
that the VI environment was working to
the point where you could really do
things in it
so the cave by design is a one-person
environment due to the way it works it
can only create a very convincing view
of your virtual objects for the person
who is wearing the head track glasses
everybody else in the cave gets a
secondary somewhat distorted view but in
practice we found that our scientists
are using the cave in smaller groups and
that is when sort of the light bulb went
off when we realize that science is
collaborative not just because people
work together in writing papers but
really they they develop the knowledge
of the extracted knowledge from their
data in a collaborative fashion very
naturally from that observation came
then the question how can we support
collaborative work that is not done in
the same environment but across
different environments we are trying to
replicate precisely the way how people
work together when they are in the same
physical space but then we are trying to
allow them to do it separately each one
of these is a is a capturespace so to
speak here in this space I'm capturing
the user using 1 2 3 first generation
Kinect cameras so that we get a
full-body low resolution 3d scan of the
person and then the same thing is true
for the 3d TV only that we have only two
connects one to the left one to the
right because the TV is supposed to be
used sitting down in front of it like
this and so now I'm captured from here
and from there anybody who is using this
environment to a sitting here or
standing here with the rift gets
transported virtually into that shared
space and the same for whoever sits in
front of that it doesn't really make a
difference if this is here or in another
room on campus or somewhere across town
or we've even tried it between here and
Germany where latency was let's say does
the problem but it still worked so this
is a long-distance communication system
what looks like very disparate elements
is if you look at it from underlying
level in mysticism a technical level is
actually really one thing on the one
hand we have all these different things
and hardware that make VR app there's
the cave and the 3d TV and the oculus
rift and the project Morpheus and
whatever you have in any of all these
input devices from the game controller
to keyboard and mouse to the kind of
track one that we have in the cave and
stems and Razer Hydra Zinj motion
capture suit and all that so these very
disparate elements those are the things
that any good we our software has to
unify what I am personally working on is
to write that infrastructure that
middleware that allows us to write
software completely independently of any
of those issues and while there is work
in progress and I've been working for 16
years now
it works really well what I'm trying to
work towards is a essentially treating
VR treating the VR environment like you
would treat a normal computer meaning
that there is some VR operating system
that is running on the bottom of it but
which really supports exchanging data
between applications
accessing your files in some form so in
other words some kind of free DVR
version of the kind of things you do
normal operating system the main
skepticism is that the virtual reality
or 3d doesn't really add anything to the
functionality of the system that
anything we can do in VR you can also do
using a normal computer but of course at
much much much lower cost
and that we found out is simply not true
by shifting field work out of the field
where you are not connected to the
Internet but you don't have power where
you have to wear H each day in the field
costs a lot of money we can now do those
things in our offices in comfort and
over a much longer period of time we can
just attempt to get data that we didn't
even consider doing before for example
we can send a team of students to scan
an area after an earthquake at a very
very high resolution using lidar and
then spend months in the cave cleaning
up our data to get not dozens but
hundreds of measurements which not only
give us a much more detailed view of
what is happening along this fault
during the earthquake but it also gives
us information we simply didn't have
before
