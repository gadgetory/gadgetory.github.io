guys thanks so much for joining us um
all right let's talk word story how do
you guys meet
Wow which one which origin story do you
want I was hanging around in a lab and I
was bitten by a radioactive Edgar yes
how did you come home we met in the
gamma ray blast you tell the story you
you you were formerly a scientist called
like Richard Renner
yeah it's gotta be it's gonna be to like
the same letter and acknowledging Rena
caught in a blast of gamma radiation in
dilemna cross he was pinched by a
radioactive peg became friends right
yeah I was hanging up some washing and I
picked up a ready I tooth take and I
came out I fell out your bomb how did
you three work start working together
was it space did you guys work before
that - these guys aren't you guys
intention for 20 years
yeah we made a lot of really rubbish
little films to go didn't we we did we
met because Nick was a waiter I wasn't
and we I met through my girlfriend was
working with Nick and it said there's a
very funny man at work and he wants to
have a double with stand up I was a
stand-up comedian at the time so we
hooked up over that not hooked up no
like oh yeah it wasn't like at a sector
was it and and then we just started
hanging out and so when I eventually met
Edgar in 96 I mean 80 on the night watch
on the Night Watch on the Nights Watch
we we we've formed a relationship work
together a little bit and then when it
came to for space to happen which is our
sitcom I suggested that we use this guy
I knew called Nick Frost hello a very
accomplished young actor hey America
whoo I felt could bring something
special to the television program so you
guys you guys it's basically I was the
big impact it seems to be even bigger
now than it has been in a while is this
something you guys do you guys been
asked about this special star the role
baby try me I think it's because it just
keeps doing the rounds I think the
latest thing is it's been on Netflix so
I think a lot of people in this country
who had previously seen it are just
watching it but it's the gift that keeps
on giving
I think
the thing is that you know we've always
really wanted to appeal to people in
such a way that you know they absolutely
love it rather than just think is pretty
good
I'd much rather one person go that is
the best thing I've ever seen in my life
than a million people say bring in so
yeah let's talk that the children as
it's now known as the trilogy what I
love about the films is that there's a
human story that the drama itself is not
the reason but kind of the conduit to
tell the scenes yeah when you were
writing these and developing stories
what came first was the genre or the
story you want to tell in the case of
showing the dead it was the genre first
and but then our take on it we thought
we want to make a zombie film but then
for a while we didn't know exactly what
that would be and then the idea came
about about making a film with in
Georgia Merida universe where we could
insert people like us specifically Brits
with no guns and no access to guns and
with a hangover and and that was that
was the idea and that kind of then
blossomed into something which then
became like the idea of like oh maybe
it's a romantic comedy which just
happens to have zombies in it in Hot
Fuzz the central idea was like contrast
the British police with like American
movies but then in this one I think
actually the the the story and the genre
went hand in hand because the sci-fi
invasion aspect of it is an
amplification of a feeling it's like
when you go back home you feel alienated
pun intended from your hometown and so
it was a natural extension of that so I
think with this one actually was the
genre was very organic I think some
people assume that when you write the
first half an hour of the movie and then
pick the genre have a hat when you guys
like get together and talk I know you've
mentioned the word discipline a lot of
these interviews when you do you talk
about the writing process and what is it
like safe word is wasabi that
disciplinary just oh sorry yes and not
the DNP DSM but no anyway I see oh is
that what it is no it's oh it's your
safe word no you're safe where this
gladder which i think is very concise i
footage that hurts my cock
when you go to the worst safeword of all
time would be harder it's like no that's
a bad safe word don't do that no one
what's happening is I'm fine oh yeah
Sinclair just start over list no when
you guys start doing the new I do the
writing process like what what is that
like when you guys get in a room and
like start working out these ideas
together well it was in the case of this
one me and Simon actually had the idea
when we were doing the Presto for Hot
Fuzz six years ago and we had the idea
pretty fully formed like it was always
going to be could the worlds end the
world end was always going to be the
last bar and it was about like a pub
crawl which literally all pub crawls are
like exercise and self-destruction and
so it's the idea of like do a film that
sort of about um again but really it's
about one man's self-destruction and so
we had this idea it was always gonna be
about returning home it was always gonna
be about like some kind of quiet
invasion but then we sort of sat on it
because part of it was that we we wanted
to go off and do separate movies and
come back and also I think we needed to
get older to write the script so it's
got slightly different concerns because
like six years later these guys are
husbands and fathers and 24 and I've
just turned 24 and the safe word is were
serving you know these are things I've
learned in the last 60s not only we did
we definitely couldn't have written this
film six years ago when Nick and I have
turned 40 now at goose edge in it and
you know it's very much about being this
age and looking back to a time when you
were younger and more sort of or
seemingly more vibrant or you know for
Gary King my character in the movie it's
like he he could only exist in that time
because that was the last time he was
kind of happy so the film kind of deals
with nostalgia and as an incredibly
nostalgic soundtrack which Edgar and I
you know we had this playlist of about
200 tracks we listen to during our
writing process so the worlds in you
know it's it was a bigger budget Hot
Fuzz but relatively small like most
films yeah
Scott Pilgrim definitely star trek-like
was adventure ah no you come on
it was an artistic choice at a budget
decision early I think it's because it's
a British movie I think that's the thing
is this or because the British movie the
British cast if you're trying to get
more money that's when you have to cast
an American in the film so it's like so
you know to kind of maintain its um
because those bitches sell yeah it's so
you have Scotty and double-bagging stuff
yeah but there's still a thing is it's
like it's a it's a British movie so that
there's a limit of how much it can cost
so I think this is like the the biggest
we could ever get with a film like this
so but that's good you know like I mean
I am absolutely I'm actually not just
happy with the movie but in terms of the
visuals actually exceeded what I thought
we could do with the money which is
which is great so I was very very
pleased how it looks and there's no in
fact star trek into darkness cost five
million dollars to make and UK so it's
all up on the screens on the screen is
above the lines very low last question
do we have our on borrowed time here um
I was doing what happened this do you
guys do know this is a cancer thing oh
come on I just hope we live long enough
to see the end of Breaking Bad
after that he might else he's a ghost is
it you guys know it's obviously gone
very well on UK international ready
because we're about to open the u.s.
does success in the u.s. matter to you
guys is that something you absolutely
and they're not worried about just like
we you know we're very proud of the
movie it's a British movie so the fact
that it gets a wide release in the u k--
us is like amazing for us because it's
like when we do Q&amp;amp;A s around the country
do screenings it
the novelty never ever wears off of us
seeing our home country on a foreign
screen like so that's amazing and so
it's like so we just a very feel very
fortunate that we get to make these
movies and you know people over here in
North America see them it's great
this is like so well analyze three it's
a Cornetto trilogy but an ice cream what
do you guys call this we call the three
flavours Cornetto trilogy it's very much
an unofficial title inside as a joke
stuck but you guys have embraced at this
point as a trilogy yeah yeah it's kind
of in a way it's the simplest wedding
that it's the simplest it's the most
sort of obvious way to bind three
together there are lots of things which
connect them I think there are you know
it's not just the defense gag or or or
the people in it there are lots of
themes and things which are quite
complex which knit it together nicely
but the obvious overriding thing became
this ice cream snack which we put into
shaun of the dead as a joke what's
hilarious is that when we use the
companies to sneak in and watch bits of
shaun of the dead in front of the u.s.
crowd the Cornetto line from surely they
would never get anything it'll be
silence like a like wind rushing through
a tunnel yeah we don't know but and then
it kind of you know people started to
get it a little bit more with Hot Fuzz
and now in this film if and when the
appearance of that particular
confectionary appears this is a big wolf
and it's like hey we taught America
something about ice cream
or our ice creams so what we're saying
essentially is the Cornetto is better
than King Karen I'm sorry I'm sorry you
had to hear it from us that's why I'm AB
injuries and gonna have to argue then
that one oh no no I'm bending Ben &amp;amp;
Jerry's is difficult in at Target oh I
think you can't get it in the waffle
coming what a bench oh yeah yeah you can
clip up any scoop two three four scoops
you know I've been in Jerry's flavour
with you cool to do your mentor what
would it be call meta mortals it's cool
that's good
meta morsels I think we're the children
there's there's three in it it's this
act of your life is over
um what's next I'm gonna you know that
bit at the end of the Shawshank
Redemption when Tim Robbins is mend in
that boat I mean that's after he does
the walk to the pile of shit yeah yeah
well 300 miles from our shoes that's why
we're there from march of the Penguins
yeah and then when Nick finishes is
pressed for keeping fury and he'll walk
along the beach of his birthday and see
me on top and the camera just move away
so what's what's next for you guys after
that when are you guys getting back
together for a project I don't know we
started talking about little bits and
bobs cuz of course we will do something
again we won't have to abide by the
little set of rules we wrote for
ourselves with these films and we can
were freed up a little bit come on
that's good yeah maybe Nick could write
some Wiggles River the writers together
that'd be fun be nice with it if he
doesn't my cancer is cured ah there you
