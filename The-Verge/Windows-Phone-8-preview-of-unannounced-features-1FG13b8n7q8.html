verge we're just looking at the windows
phone 8 emulator today and so the first
thing you'll notice is obviously the new
start screen tiles that might have been
introduced at the windows phone summit
in June now you can move the tiles
around as normal but you can actually
shrink the size of them now so this is
the small tile which you can then
obviously move it back to the normal
tile and some of the additional tiles
like the messaging or the calendar or
the mail title here you can actually
edit this one so that you've got the
really large tile or the medium one and
obviously the small one as well so it's
quite easy to edit the tiles there and
if we move into the settings and there's
the settings are very similar to the
existing Windows Phone but we've
actually gotten notifications saying
here on the lock screen that allows you
just to to set any app to to provide
notifications on the lock screen so
that's that's a change from windows
phone 7.5 you've also got the NFC tap
and send sharing here which you can talk
all enough and the next thing that's
really knew that microsoft hasn't really
detailed is the backup settings so you
can see here you've got an app list and
settings which will store your internet
explorer favorites or your list of apps
in the cloud so you just simply sign
into your Microsoft account for that and
text messages will also be stored in the
cloud here and so you can turn that on
and off and Microsoft is also adding
options for to control video and photos
uploading to SkyDrive next up there's a
new data sentence feature and this
allows you to basically track your data
usage so you can see here you can set it
up for one time month for your unlimited
and the specific day of the month that
that data reset so say you've got 512
Meg from your carrier you can track to
see how much you're actually using and
when your limits going to reset you can
also pin data since the start screen and
has a live tile that warn you when your
date is finished my purse also has he
done some work on the start screen to
improve it and they've also improved the
themes as well so you can see here
there's a color picker
that allows you to pick a variety of
colors and if you pick one it obviously
changes the color throughout the whole
operating system so also expecting
Microsoft in previous mobile Internet
Explorer and some signs are there are
here in the SDK so we've got an address
bar a sitting here that allows us to
swap the buttons from tabs to refresh
and favorites and what you'll notice if
we go back and in the bottom left is a
tab button now and that allows us to
control the tabs rather than the refresh
button that's typically there and you
can also change that obviously back to
favorites so you can have the favorites
there to access to your mobile favorites
on the go the SDK am also gives us a
look at some of the camera functions
that might supply to integrate here and
so you'll notice as an apps button which
immediately gives us access to Bing
vision within the actual camera
application and if we get back there's
option to find more lenses which are
basically app extensions for the camera
alongside some camera improvements much
sauce also adding some functionality to
its Photos app so you can see here
there's a select button down the bottom
which allows you to multi-select photos
which you can then favor it delete or
you can also share so we're hoping to
see more share options is there fairly
limited right now but it's a good
science seen you can actually multi
select photos in the app now and there's
also some edit features that have been
added as well so you can go into a
single photo and in hit the edit option
and there's some cropping rotating and
ill see the standard auto fix you also
get an aspect ratio option here so you
can pick and whatever aspect ratio you
want for the crop and we've also got the
ability to control it yourself in
Microsoft's Bing application the company
is also adding filter information top
videos and top headlines that you can
swipe to reveal there's also some
changes to the built in exports
application here and now these changes
are mainly visual and they appear to
resemble the Xbox SmartGlass that we saw
a free this year most are also changing
its music and videos up now this looks
like almost identical to the Xbox hub
now and there's even access to the Xbox
music store from riv in here and it
closely
symbols a zune experience as you can see
you can go in and play songs or
obviously downloads and purchase them
most of the store isn't functional
through the emulator and we can
obviously see that it's very similar to
the windows phone marketplace okay so
that was a quick look at Windows Phone 8
running on the Windows Phone 8 SDK
emulator and which we are expecting to
be available in preview soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
