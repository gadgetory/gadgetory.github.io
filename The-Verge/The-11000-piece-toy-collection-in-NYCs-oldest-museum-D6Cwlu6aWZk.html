more toys than you could ever fit under
a Christmas tree its journey collection
which consists of over 11,000 toys from
1840 to 1960 but why do these toys
belong in a museum we met with Mike
Thornton and curator to learn why toys
are sometimes more than just toys if you
want to academically understand this
collection you know yes they're toys but
if you're really looking at toys you're
looking at maybe toys are made by adults
for children and so therefore they
reflect adult values of the times that
they were made and this was a
steam-powered industrial world that the
adults were working and living in and
that their children were gonna grow up
in and so in many ways toys are about
preparing kids to be adults and so
trains were a great way to teach the
lessons of industry and steam power and
that's how the fascination sort of
started I want to ask about getting kids
into the idea of like a museum culture a
lot of it is a vital part of our mission
when I come in and I see kids but you
know they're little hands on the glass
just in awe I just feel like we're
planting the seeds to make future you
know it's not necessarily if they all
grow up and become curators or
historians but that they grow up you
know and that they're fascinated that
there is this interest in the past kids
need to understand the past to be
citizens you know and what better way
than to create inroads through play
things so this holiday take a moment to
consider any toys you purchase for loved
ones think that they may one day be
sitting on a pristine display under the
scrutiny of school kids from the year
2100 these toys curator might say were
made during the Internet age decades
before the holodeck wars of 2262
