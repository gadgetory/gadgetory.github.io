another echo smart speaker that you can
use your voice to command and control it
and talk to Amazon's Alexa voice
assistant now what sets is 130 dollar
spot apart is its circular touchscreen
which can display a clock information
lists video and more just like the
larger echo show from earlier this year
you can also use that screen and the
spots integrated camera to make video
calls with other echo devices and phones
basically the spa is a smaller cuter
less expensive version of the show with
many of the same capabilities it is to
the show what the echo dot is to the
full-size echo that means it does echo
stuff it plays music it answers
questions and control smartphone gadgets
it can set timers and alarms you know
all of the other stuff that other echo
devices do Alexa send an alarm for 12:45
p.m. to Drake
alarm set for 12:45 p.m. to Drake on
Spotify
you can get it in white or black and I
definitely prefer the white model and
the spots display measures 2.5 inches
across and it's 480 pixels wide which
makes it a bit too small to comfortably
watch video on you can do it if you want
but since Amazon and Google are in a big
fight right now YouTube doesn't work so
the options for videos is pretty limited
mostly it's just movie trailers and
Amazon Prime video content but the
screen is great for displaying a clock
and there's 16 different faces to choose
from they both have analog and digital
designs and four of them are
customizable with your own photos in
addition it displays album art to-do
lists shopping lists and weather
information right at a glance now on top
of the spot are buttons for controlling
the volume and muting the mic and camera
there's also for far-field microphones
which in my tests were able to hear my
voice just about as well as the 7
microphone arrays on other echo devices
the spot has a 1.4 inch speaker that
sounds way better than the echo dots
tinny speaker when Alexa talks it also
sounds fine for casual music listening
but it's obviously not going to work as
well for that as a larger echo or as
son√≠s one if you do want better sound
you can link the spot to a larger
speaker with a cable or Bluetooth which
is a nice convenience to have
now just like the echo show you can use
the spot to make video calls to other
echo devices with the screen or to a
phone using Amazon's Alexa app now in
practice this works pretty well the
image is clear the sound is good and you
can easily see the person you're calling
and your own image right in the spots
display now you can also enable that
creepy drop in feature that lets you
connect to another echo spot or show
directly without anyone answering the
call but video calling definitely seems
like a feature that's better suited for
the larger show than the smaller spot
for example the spot is a perfect device
to replace an alarm clock on your
nightstand but I can't ever imagine
wanting to make video calls while I'm in
my bedroom the top button will disable
both the camera and the microphones for
voice control but you can disable the
camera independently in the spot
settings menu now admittedly that's not
the most reassuring thing so you might
be tempted to put a piece of tape over
the spots camera like you might do on
your laptop's webcam but amazon says
that the spot uses the camera for the
displays auto brightness so you might
end up with a screen that's way too
bright or way too dim if you do that I
kind of just wish that Amazon would sell
a version of this without a camera which
would alleviate a lot of these privacy
concerns but if you don't have a problem
with the camera and you're not concerned
about the privacy the spot is actually a
great alarm clock for your bedroom you
can set alarms with your voice you can
even ask Alexa to wake you up to a
specific artists song or playlist and
then you can snooze the alarm with your
voice in the morning or you can just
silently dismiss it by touching the
screen the spot will even display the
current weather conditions when your
alarm goes off so you know how to dress
for the day when you wake up it's
basically the perfect smart alarm clock
if it didn't have an anxiety inducing
camera built into the front of it
amazon says that the spot can work in
other parts of your home too but it's
probably not the best echo for most
other uses the larger show is better if
you want a voice control display in your
kitchen for recipes and background video
watching while you're cooking or doing
dishes and the audio only echo devices
are better for a living room or an
office where you probably already have
other screens like a TV or computer all
of that makes a spot kind of a tough
sell it's not particularly inexpensive
and it has a pesky camera that you might
not want in your bedroom but despite
that I personally really like it it
looks cool it doesn't take up a lot of
space on my nightstand and it has the
ability to replace both the echo dot and
the Sony alarm clock I have in my
bedroom right now just Amazon please
give me one without a camera
Alexa subscribe to the verge at
youtube.com slash The Verge Amazon music
unlimited lets you play tens of millions
of songs on this device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
