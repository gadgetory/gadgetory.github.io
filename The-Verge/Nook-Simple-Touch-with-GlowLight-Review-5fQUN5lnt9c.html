the barnes and noble nook simple touch
with glowlight the names kind of a
mouthful but it's mostly the same device
as the Nook Simple Touch from last year
it's slightly lighter it weighs about 7
ounces instead of last year 7.5 and it
has a slightly lighter grey stripe
around the edges but otherwise they're
literally exactly the same Hardware they
even have the same screen the 800 x 600
pixel eating display and that's
basically the same as every other you
book reader out there but the only
problem with this devices screen is that
there's a screen protector built in over
top of it which is nice it used to be an
extra accessory but it makes the screen
feel a little lower contrast and makes
text appear not as sharp otherwise the
hardware is still really good it has a
soft touch plastic and hardware buttons
for changing the pages which is really
nice in addition to the touchscreen
interface the big difference here
obviously is the glow light there are 8
LED lights at the top of the display
buried underneath the bezel and then
barnes noble uses software to spread the
light uniformly over the display it
works for the most part it's not totally
uniform you get a really bright stripe
at the top and then it gets dark and
then brighter again but for the most
part it works well and it definitely
makes the device readable in the dark
you turn it on by pressing and holding
the end button at the bottom for two or
three seconds or there's a menu item for
doing it it's really easy and you can
toggle the levels of brightness I wound
up using it mostly at the darkest
setting or just slightly above and if
you're reading in the dark or in bed
it's still totally readable even at
really low brightness otherwise again
it's pretty much just the same as the
last generation no it's a really
intuitive really good touchscreen
experience definitely better than the
kindle touch which had some problems
with lag and it's still not as good even
after some software updates the battery
life is still really long you get two
months of battery life without the light
on which is the same as the last
generation and even with the light on it
barnes noble says you'll get a month of
battery life with 30 minutes of reading
with the light on every day which is
still really long and you certainly
won't need to charge very often the nook
with glowlight is 139 dollars and it
comes with a screen protector built-in
plus powered after both of which kind of
insanely used to be separate accessories
and would cost up to twenty dollars more
but mostly this is just last year's nook
with a light added to it that's a pretty
great combination especially for reading
in the darker in bed it's better than
having a bright LCD blaring at you or
having to have
a separate light source it's hard to
switch ecosystems if you've already
bought a kindle but if you're in the
market for a first ebook this is
definitely a great option</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
