really build a lineage and so what we've
done is created phone that from a
distance is going to be clearly
identifiable as a one product so it's an
icon that's been established in the
market and we want to continue that but
if you come up close to it you're going
to notice all the subtle details that
we've evolved this is obviously a good
franchise working out where you have you
taken icon and you keep refining the
things that need to be refined you don't
overhaul the basic gesture the
fundamental expression of the phone if
you don't have to if it's really really
good and so what we've done is to look
at a lot of different aspects of the
phones areas that could be improved so
the m7 got a lot of accolades for its
precision aesthetics and then the m8 got
a lot of accolades for being really
comfortable in the hand but people tend
to lose it a little bit too easily
including myself I dropped mine too many
times and so what we did with m9 is
really to combine the best of both
worlds we were able to take the sort of
crisp edge of m7 and left precision look
and then also add the softness of m8 and
create a product that really is going to
feel great in the hand scooters a little
bit about the manufacturing process and
that how that has changed between the
one I made in the one in mine yeah the
manufacturing has evolved quite a bit
actually we're not making things easier
on ourselves you can see our just a pure
machining time for instance for our main
unibody has gone from 150 minutes on the
original m7 all the way to 300 minutes
on their line and that's because we're
doing a much more complex process this
is a kind of an industry first if we're
doing a dual anodized a
on the main housing so we wanted to show
of different qualities of the metal but
we also didn't want to introduce
multiple parts on the phone because of
course we're well known for our unibody
and so what we've done is the whole
process gets done twice over the
anodization the machining and then the
finishing so we see the iphone 6 the new
galaxy s6 and you need advice all have
cameras that protrude slightly from the
body do you think that's a new trend
that's about it well a lot of being a
designer is about making trade off
especially in the smartphone space
because we have a limited real estate
that we can work with and so every item
has to be considered very very carefully
as you go bigger sensors everybody wants
to have a great camera on their phone so
I feel bigger with the sensors you
inevitably come up to certain
limitations and and I think we're
willing to make that sacrifice right now
is a little bit of a bump I would say
our bump is minimal and it's elegant and
there's sort of a limits to how much we
would be willing to to grow over the
rest of the product everything is driven
by the same design philosophy you know
we have a global design team we're not
sort of separated into this insular
organizations and so everything is
driven by a dedication to to simplicity
you know moving removing elements it
could be between you and Technology and
then also as an honesty to the material
and and you know a dedication to the
craft so I think a product like grip
it's not an all metal unibody product it
wouldn't make any sense there so we
really picked the right kind of high
quality plastics that are going to feel
great on you on your wrist and then
don't compete with your watch if you
want no I think it's really important
that we keep our heritage we keep our
lineage but we every time you start a
new design process we forget about all
of it and we
way outside of it and so I can tell
you're going to be seeing some really
exciting things coming and some
unexpected things as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
