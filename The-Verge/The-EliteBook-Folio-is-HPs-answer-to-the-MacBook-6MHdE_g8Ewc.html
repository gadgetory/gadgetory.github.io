take a look at HP's new leak book folio
it's impressively thin new notebook the
folio has a twelve and a half inch
touchscreen display and what's really
nice is that it's a 4k display that
looks very vibrant and gorgeous this
plays a touchscreen it can fold all the
way down so that it's basically flat
with this desk I don't exactly know why
you'd want or need to do that the lea
book folio is running on Intel's newest
skylake core M processors that means
this isn't going to be a hugely powerful
machine it'll be great for writing and
I'll be great for browsing the web but
that's about it bigger thing to be
concerned about is that if you have a 4k
display on this being pushed by the low
power poor end processors a lot of their
work is going to go to supporting that
display which means that things could
get slow if you're running something
heavy you watched a YouTube video and
came over just fine but you're
definitely not going able to edit videos
or play powerful games there are only a
few ports on the laptop there are two
USB seaports over here with Thunderbolt
three support and there's a headphone
jack on this side there's no USB 3 port
and if you want anything else you're
going to have to buy an adapter for it
in business laptop means that there is
some extra security features built in
one of the key ones that HP points to is
having an extra copy of its BIOS inside
that the computer is constantly checking
against to make sure that the core
copied has been used hasn't been
maliciously altered in any way one of
the other things that HP's own to make
this laptop suited for business users is
- and it's hardware for voice calls
there's actually a range of buttons up
on the top row that let you control
voice calls like hanging up or muting
yourself the sound system is also tuned
for voice rather than music so if your
listen to music it might not sound quite
as good but if you're on a Skype call
people's boys are supposed to come
through loud and clear the real standout
of course is the folios hardware which
is really light and really nice as far
as Windows goes it reminds you a lot of
Dells XPS 13 with these super slim
bezels and the black surrounding it's 4k
display it also has a really full
keyboard and a wide trackpad it's
probably the nicest laptop we've seen
out of HP the folio is gonna be
available this March starting at $9.99
but is worth noting $9.99 won't get you
the full 4k display or the touchscreen
if he doesn't have full pricing worked
out just yet or if you're getting this
laptop you're definitely going to want
to spend the extra money</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
