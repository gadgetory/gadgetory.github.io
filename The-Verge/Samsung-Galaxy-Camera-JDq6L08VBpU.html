in Berlin and I'm taking a look at the
brand new Samsung Galaxy camera the
sounds they just announced the name
pretty much tells you everything you
need to know the galaxy part till it's
an android device it runs 4.1 jelly bean
and the camera part tells you it's a
camera has a 16 megapixel backside
illuminated sensor and has the shape of
a compact camera very much like one of
those mirrorless devices that you might
have seen from Sony Sony's next series
or samsung NX series the only difference
is that the sensor is obviously is not
as big as not an aps-c sensor but it
kind of compromises balances the two
things it's very much like any other
smartphone in the shape of a camera so
what that means is you have your power
button you have your usual Android
software keys actually they're not that
usual because most most companies
Samsung included are still doing
capacitive keys but in this case is
Android 4.1 jelly bean and you have
software and your menu buttons on here
so there's basically no bezel round
sides the back is essentially one giant
4.8 each HD display that you can use
which is probably facilitated by the
fact that it's significantly chunkier
than your regular smartphone but we
don't mind that it's good and it's
useful and other sides you'll notice
there's a flash button there's a power
button which functions very much like
usual power button on android phone you
have micro USB connection and it takes a
micro SD and a micro sim card because it
also has free g + 4g connectivity it's a
bit regret about it uses micro SD rather
than a full-size SD card but that's just
what you're getting here it also has
Wi-Fi there's a whole heap of software
features of Samsung is added to automate
the processes of taking sharing editing
pictures so Samsung is we tried to think
of absolutely everything and splice the
camera and Android phone and this thing
should be coming out in quota for 2012
with free g + 4g connectivity for a lot
of things that we're talking about here
d phi me know if you think about the new
galaxy note 2 or what we're doing here
with the galaxy camera it's about taking
the best of technologies and putting
them together so if you look at
something like the galaxy camera where
we've got kind of we have great optics
we've got great camera technology but
then there's this ability to with the
android ecosystem and kind
the Android jelly bean operating system
the ability to take advantage of a lot
of these features and do a lot more with
a camera they can do before so if you
think about I mean kind of how we
approach markets is what a consumers
want to do with them what you want to do
how do you take photos lots and lots of
people are very comfortable taking
photos with their smartphones but
basically this kind of takes that
shooting experience and extends it now
kind of to the experience that we do
with a really good point shoot I would
think of the market for this the same
way I think of a lot of our markets
their consumers kind of every price band
who are interested in doing different
things so for camera consumers it's
going to be exactly the same thing this
is a high end point and shoot camera
because of the connectivity features
it's going to be marketed in unique way
with carriers I mean we haven't
announced specifically how we're going
to bring it to market yet but because
we're going to be working with our
carrier partners for connectivity and
some of those things to maybe a unique
way for you to get into the camera
markets and perhaps if you think about
the US market subsidized or something
like that so I think it kind of exists
coexists with the rest of the point and
shoots its kind of being at the high end
and the rest kind of cascading down from
there this is absolutely a camera first
I mean basically it's let's leverage the
best of our camera technology and extend
that with the power of android</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
