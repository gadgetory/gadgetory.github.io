so, the story of Tesla
has been all about the Model
3 and understandably so.
Elon Musk basically staked
the entire viability
of his company on being able to make
as many of these cars as possible,
and there were times where
that bet looked pretty risky.
- Temporarily shutting down production.
- Way behind on the production.
- Production problems.
- See which production issues to sort out.
- Welcome to production hell.
- But now Tesla is, more or less,
beyond a lot of those challenges.
So we came out to the desert
to see the most important
thing that Tesla makes,
what Elon Musk calls.
- Giant machine that builds a machine.
- This is Tesla's Gigafactory.
(upbeat funk piano music)
It's ideal for him.
It makes everything that Tesla sells:
batteries, home storage, solar panels,
and of course electric cars.
That size is truly massive too.
When it's finished, the first Gigafactory
will be the biggest building
in the world by footprint,
and the second biggest by volume.
It's large enough to house
107 NFL football fields
or 93 Boeing 747s,
and currently makes about 3.5
million battery cells per day.
- [Chris] As you can see,
never a dull moment here,
always a flurry of activity.
- [Sean] That's Chris Lister,
the vice president of the Gigafactory.
- We designed this Factory
with first principles in mind,
making as few of moves as possible,
positioning lines as close to
the loading docks as possible,
using automation to our advantage,
using gravity to our advantage.
We built this with the end in mind
of being a net-zero facility.
We'll have over 200,000
solar panels on the roof
when this is all completed.
It'd be the largest array
of solar panels anywhere.
If you look at the parking lot,
that will all eventually be
production space for something,
whether that's growth of Model 3,
whether that's future products,
whether that's more cell production,
whether that's energy products.
There's a ton of different
options that we have
but we have the land to do it,
and we have the products to support that.
- Tesla has clear goals
for a complete Gigafactory
but it's still very
much under construction.
And while the company has said
it wants to finish the
factory in the early 2020s,
it's easy to see that there's
a lot more work to do.
You see, while Gigafactory
1 is all about the Model 3,
Tesla doesn't actually
build that car here.
The building is essentially
split into two parts,
part of the Gigafactory
is leased to Panasonic,
who, if you didn't know,
makes the cells that Tesla
uses in its battery packs.
The rest of the Gigafactory
is used to build the drive
unit for the Model 3.
That's the battery pack,
the electric motor,
and a few other things, like the inverter.
That all gets packaged up
and shipped to California
where the cars are actually built.
(upbeat funk music)
Tesla still leans really
heavily on this factory
here in Fremont California
to make the Model X, S,
and assemble the 3.
In fact, every Tesla
that's on the road today
comes out of this factory.
If Tesla ever wants to
reach that ultimate goal
of full vertical integration,
it basically needs to move
everything that happens here
into the Gigafactory.
And, frankly, there are a
lot of elements of that idea
of vertical integration
already happening here.
Tesla does everything from cut
metal from rolls of aluminum
to stamp out pieces for the
cars to making the seats,
basically everything that
goes into making a car,
other than some parts of the battery,
happen inside these walls.
- [Jat] These are the batteries
coming from Gigafactory.
- Oh, yeah.
- Right?
They come in on a rack that
is designed for automation,
and it gets placed onto this
and gets transferred over
through the FlexDecks.
- [Sean] That's Jat Dhillon,
who's the head of
manufacturing for the Model 3.
- So automation, we're
looking for everything.
We obviously want to improve
efficiencies across the board.
We take, in fact, ergonomics as well.
Any of the areas where you
have a lot of complexity
around getting to certain fasteners,
we want to be able to automate those cells
because that does create ergo challenges
for the production staff.
For Model 3, we chose
to go highly automated
but when you go with advanced
automation like this,
it can be really good
benefit if it works out
but there are times when you can overdo it
and have too much automation.
(upbeat music)
- [Sean] Tesla didn't
have the right balance
when it first started making the Model 3,
and that turned into one
of the biggest challenges
the company faced when
it was building that car.
In theory, building the
Gigafactory from the ground up
was supposed to give Tesla the freedom
to draw the perfect factory from scratch
but the delays in Model 3 production show
that even Tesla doesn't
get everything right
in the first draft.
that's potentially concerning
considering the company needs
to make many more Gigafactories
if it wants to fulfill its mission:
accelerating the world's
transition to sustainable energy.
- We can declare victory
when every single car
on the road is a Tesla,
and we can declare victory when every home
has Powerwalls and a solar
roof that we've made.
We'll continue to build out.
We'll continue to expand
into other markets,
whether that be Asia,
whether that be Europe,
whether that be just
different parts of the world
that we've not been able
to touch up to this point.
- Tesla's going to need
way more Gigafactories,
and it's already working on that.
Gigafactory 2 is in Buffalo, New York,
and is completely dedicated to
the company's solar products.
The real expansion starts in China.
Musk and Tesla recently signed a lease
to build a third Gigafactory
outside of Shanghai.
China is the world's biggest
market for electric cars
on pace to sell around one
million of them in 2018 alone.
And while Tesla already has some success
in China selling its cars there,
building them and selling them locally
will help them work around problems,
like soaring tariffs as a
result of the ongoing trade war.
The same ideas apply to Europe
where Tesla's fourth Gigafactory
is likely to wind up.
And beyond, Musk has said he wants
a dozen or more Gigafactories
around the world.
These are all very high ambitions
but Tesla still has a long way to go
and there are definite growing pains
as the company scales
towards Musk's grand vision.
(upbeat guitar music)
The Gigafactory is many things:
It's impressive.
It's kind of awe-inspiring.
It's definitely enormous.
But there's only a couple
things happening there.
Tesla's only making a few of its products
in that gigantic building.
That said, maybe that
doesn't matter right now,
Tesla has bought itself
some breathing room
by getting Model 3 production
onto relatively solid ground,
but there are many other
products in the Tesla pipeline,
like the Model Y SUV, the
Tesla Pickup, the semi truck,
and the second-generation Roadster,
so the idea of the Gigafactory
is crucial to the company
in a much bigger way than any
of those individual products.
(upbeat funk pop music)
Thanks for watching.
We spent a couple days in the Gigafactory,

or what's going on with Tesla,
