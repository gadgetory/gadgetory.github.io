always a here's the thing so all the
stuff we saw in the desk is their
tablets and phones they've been tablets
and phones for a while for five years
some of them you know now they come in
colors right and that's the crazy thing
about them but the crazy thing I cuts
very exciting to me that maybe I'm crazy
but we went through I feel like we went
through this with the imac where
somebody was like you could put a collar
on a computer did you know you can just
put if you want yeah and then it is like
hey colors that's crazy yeah and now
like we forgot all about it everything
was but we forgot ready we definitely
forgot about that with pcs yeah pcs have
been bailed out Wall got about it for a
while to their back in the colors a
little bit no oh they have new are they
dye pots but you know whatever grab on
sir um but the thing about pcs is that
Windows 8 because they've actually
grafted a touchscreen on Wednesday for
real they're allowed to do crazy things
so obviously you have the surface there
it is it's got a type cover then we've
seen I think this is Microsoft saying
like here's what we think pc should look
like but the thing about Windows 8 is
that the other companies get to do where
they want to you so here's a sous that's
true right maybe sell the license
together anymore so here's the suits and
they you know they did did transformers
of Android all right so this is actually
a this is a Windows 8 is this a witness
windows 8/rt or regular wait outside
this is RT so and it has you can just
you can just break it any way you want
just you can do it man look at how
strong it is is what I'm trying to show
you any how fast is right oh oh there's
a latch okay I actually think this is
the winning form factor for these things
like it's a tablet this is kind of like
an iPad yeah right and then it's got
this thing which you can throw in a bag
which is its okay its not this kid board
is a keyboard a little small if it's
also a battery yeah yeah no it's great a
smaller I need a little but it's like
room sorry I'm the thing about this and
the services of these are 69 right I
think yeah they're little business
really silly for me and tablet Wow but
could be a lot worse yes could be a lot
worse Neil I let me allow me to show you
what's I screen is this this is like a
13-3 toshiba and this looks like a
tablet it's huge but it turns into a
laptop like that and then it does that
what just mean this is crazy I mean and
the amount of engineering they had to do
if you look at this hinge it's got like
I think my tracks it's got spiked this
is the thing that's most exciting is
that people are finally innovating on
hinges yeah and and this is just great
it's like a you know I mean it's like
I'm for that you donated crazy on hinges
and then they're like hinges are a bad
idea I'm reading a book just comfortably
read one handed meeting and then I got
an incoming call after five years that
gags every day the huge up to your ear
hello it says you're not connected in
giant love it that is true that is true
but it's a touchscreen yeah you know
Sean reviewed this thing it's
interesting I mean this is like the
explosion of ideas of how computer
should look I wish it did more folding
well the thing with this other thing
with all of these to me is like you're
supposed to touch them but the hinge is
here so it's like that that didn't and
that's not great okay you're forcing
that a little the thing that scares me
what this reminds me of like the
original tablet PC era like Windows
tablet edition sort of complete
lightweight whenever just like doc
you've got a stylus and they're just a
little it's a little so I mean look this
thing is like this is a really great
movie problem you know it's like yeah
hello I've got a call hello a cop coming
dear that's associated but this is your
favorite this is my favorite did you
love this this love is a strong word
this is the yoga from Lenovo yoga ha so
it's a tablet but it has maybe the
smartest hinge we're just turns into a
laptop and then it is around it's better
when you show this just so you
understand what's happening with this
particular if all the 15 inch display to
touch screen yeah it's a touchscreen and
then just the word is that one world and
then it does that right right seems
comfortable right and you've got a
keyboard and it's weird cuz you're
holding what is what come on guys
seriously like who here show of hands
yeah would use it like this
literally for two one guy was like just
kidding it was like the third guy I
don't think so so like here's what
here's what school I think let me just
do this can I there we are and um you
just put this like so these guys I think
what's really great is that people are
innovating on ya hinges and form factors
right but I just don't think like I
don't know of any human beings really
want to do to do that and that's that's
the problem I thought Microsoft has the
best thing I think I actually think the
surface is of all well I think this kind
of the asus is getting there it's girls
keyboards little small is closed this is
what's strange is that in operating
system is that's why these manufacturers
are like we can't ride or why all this
idea yeah and they send the designers
like into a room that you a sit there
like will fold it all the way back we
know I mean I mean as we know Microsoft
they primed the better they open their
mind they prime the pump with the
surface yeah they did you know and i
will call it all right that's our
gadgets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
