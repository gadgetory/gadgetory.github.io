this is the Sony Tablet P it's available
from AT&amp;amp;T for $399 with a two-year
contract or 549 without one when it's
closed it kind of looks like a glasses
case it's nice looking it's a little
creaky the plastic on the front will you
gave a little if you press it but for
the most part it's well built it'll
slide into a jacket pocket or even jeans
if you wear baggy jeans and when you
open it up there's two 5.5 inch displays
inside each one is 1024 by 480 which is
kind of an odd resolution and leads to
some issues with software and apps
they'll run with bezels on each side
so you don't actually fill the screen
even with videos which is a little fun
the screens are good otherwise they're
the blacks are super dark sony uses true
black technology which works pretty well
here it makes the screens look good the
viewing angles are really bad though
whites start to get really yellow as
soon as you get off access and colors
just don't look good it's got a really
sturdy hinge which is nice and you can
actually prop it up at almost any angle
but it's got these enormous bezels on
both sides it's actually over an inch on
each side and it makes the device really
hard to hold especially if you're trying
to get at the top screen it's just kind
of awkward to reach around all the time
there's also a big bezel between the two
screens so any app that you use that
will go from one to the other it gets
really broken up as you move between the
two the bottoms of the device are also
really sharp which means as you hold
them as you hold the device it actually
digs into your palms to the point where
if you use it for more than a few
minutes as you're reaching around it
actually starts to hurt your hand there
are ports on the right side there's a
power button an AC adapter it actually
won't charge by the USB port which is a
shame so it has its own pretty big power
adapter so there are two cameras on the
tablet p5 megapixel shooter on the back
which takes you know functional pictures
in a pinch but it's not something you're
gonna really want to use it also shoots
720p video and it's pretty much the same
story it's decent if you really need to
use it and it's all you have with you
but this certainly isn't gonna replace
your digital camera the front-facing
camera on the other hand is really bad
even by our low front facing camera
standards the tablet P is running
Android 3.2 point 1 and it has a lot of
the same problems that every other
honeycomb tablet does it's sluggish it
points and there are some definite bugs
Sony also customized basically
everything about the operating system
largely because they had to to get it to
work on the 2
and some of the apps that they
redesigned they'll actually work really
well so since there's the two screens
what they what Sony did a lot was put
the app on the top screen and the
keyboard on the bottom which is nice
because it gives you a full screen for
the keyboard without taking up a lot of
what you'd want to see from the app they
also designed it to fit with the screen
resolution so you do get more of a full
screen look from it so for some things
where Sony managed to actually do some
work in changing the apps it works
really well in the two screens but with
a lot of other things like Angry Birds
where Sony doesn't really have any
effect
it just defaults it to the top screen
and the bottom screen becomes basically
useless for some apps you can expand
them to show on both screens and but
that's both as you can see really buggy
and just looks pretty bad you'll get the
catapult for Angry Birds like right here
in the middle where it just becomes
impossible to use for a couple of the
games that they've been able to change
like Crash Bandicoot which is part of
Sony's PlayStation Store this is a
PlayStation Certified device now you
actually get the controls down in the
bottom screen in the game up here again
it's a weird resolution for the game so
you get a lot of blank space but it's
cool to be able to use these controls to
run around here in general the
performance on the tablet is pretty
solid it has a Tegra 2 processor which
is a little outdated now but still works
pretty well and for the most part it
moves around quickly apps launch fast
and there wasn't much delay other than
the stuff we're used to from normal
honeycomb devices the browser in
particular is pretty solid
most the Android browser typically has
trouble with full sites like ours
they're really image heavy but in this
case it works relatively well pinching
and zooming is a little buggy but
smoother here than on most devices we've
seen and the browser performance is
definitely a strength despite the fact
that it's really hard to see what's
actually happening on a web page it
connects to ATT HSPA+ network
unfortunately not LTE but reception was
pretty good the lack of LTE much like
the Tegra 2 processor makes the tablet P
feel like a device that was designed a
year ago and then really hasn't been
changed between then and now when it's
finally being released the tablet P also
has other problems there's a huge issue
with the two displays Sony did as much
as it could to optimize Android for two
displays but a lot of things that just
can't touch them a lot of apps just
don't work well if you really want a
portable gaming console you can get the
Xperia Play or
the PlayStation Vita both also on AT&amp;amp;T
for cheaper than the tablet P and if you
really just want a tablet that does
games well you can get the iPad 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
