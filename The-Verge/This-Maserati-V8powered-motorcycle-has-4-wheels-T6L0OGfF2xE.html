Geneva Motor Show 2016 and we are
interrupting our usual coverage of cause
to bring you a bike and as you can see
it's not any bike this is one of the
craziest designs we're taking a look
it's a concept design but you can
actually buy it it's available to 200000
euros and it does actually have four
wheels so it's kind of like a car
also reminiscent of cars if the fact
that has this massive engine which is
built around this is a 4.7 liter v8
engine taken out of a Maserati
Quattroporte which is a huge car and
then you essentially have a bike built
around it and it looks like some sort of
mix between a Tron light-cycle or
Batman's Dark Knights thing the only
difference is that this isn't a cinema
prop this is a real bike you can write
it you can't drive it it tilts up to 30
degrees it reaches the speed of 150
kilometers an hour
I only has one gear as a hydraulic
clutch you just step on the accelerator
and go that's all really there is to it
there's a whole bunch of carbon fibre
everything just looks intense it looks
armoured up and ready to go to war it's
designed by Ludovic lazarette and the
name he says that once is able to sell
the first one which is this particular
black and gold and carbon fiber piece
you will build another tooth if you want
one you'll build your one with two
wheels if you prefer if you want to make
customizations but for us you know the
sport wheel version with it's extremely
aggressive look and design and the split
windshield at the front is pretty
kick-ass as it is so it's supposed to
appeal to people with money basically
like if you want a truly unique thing
which there isn't going to be a
duplicate of there's not going to be
another one of these crazy saying four
wheel bikes with a Maserati engine quite
like this then here it is stay tuned to
the versa phone and youtube.com slash
average for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
