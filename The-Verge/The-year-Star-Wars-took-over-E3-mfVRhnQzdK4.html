2015 you seen a new assassin's creed the
new fallout the new black ops and a new
tomb raider and that's what's getting
started but here's the original
blockbuster movie franchise has stood
out above them all star wars the two
main titles getting attention we r star
wars battlefront and Disney infinity 3.0
which is folding the franchise Andrews
collection of Disney Marvel and picks
our characters there is also Knights of
the Fallen Empire an expansion pack to
the MMO the old republic and a mobile
collectible card game called galaxy of
heroes now that's not even counting the
secret project at Visceral Games has
been working on it's part of a concerted
effort marketing multimedia Hyperwave
all designed to crest around the force
awakens later this year how long is this
kind of a wave cresting right how long
was this in the work does this thing
that was planned to coincide with the
film's is it happens dancer oh no no
this is definitely part of our plan and
I'm really excited because you know our
two biggest console beats gaming beats
this year leading up to the film are
right here at e3 and we plan
for them to come out in advance of the
theatrical launch to engage all of our
star wars fans both kids and families
and our core gaming fans to generate
sort of engage our fans and generate
excitement leading up into the release
of the film at the end of this year from
what we've seen it's working fans waited
for hours to check out Battlefront well
it's easy to say yeah of course they did
because it's Star Wars that's not
necessarily the case ten years ago when
the prequel trilogy wrapped up people
were burned out also the movies were
terrible what do you think is it about
like you know this title star wars
battlefront particular has had people so
and because they are going crazy in the
good works well it stars bafta for this
of course a star wars game and I think
that has a big part of you know who
doesn't want greats our escape so from
that perspective you know we've been
really trying to make it star wars so if
you look at it you know at a glance it's
you know like the movements it sounds
like movies it looks like the movies and
you know it actually to some extent
place like the movies because the
fantasy of the movies is there I think
people could tends to be more worried
about can you create accessibility in
the game for Star Wars fans and that's
why here III we're trying to kind of
prove that you know yes it's a game
where everyone can be a part of it and
everyone can enjoy it and both from a
multiple perspective you know because
the game is at its core in multiplayer
game but also with the missions where
you can you know have a couch fun and
just enjoy this amazing Star Wars
universe it's all heading towards the
world with there's a star wars game in
every possible sub genre including VR
and while Lucasfilm is coordinating it
all burn out still looms because we
still got a new film trilogy coming and
the santalune anthology movies and a TV
show and a whole world of complex and
novels
