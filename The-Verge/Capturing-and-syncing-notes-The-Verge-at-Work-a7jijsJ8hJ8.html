with ideas and in writing about them
which is kind of my job but I never
really know what I'm gonna get an idea I
can be a coffee shop or it could be I
know I could be in the park even so I
use an app called simple note on my
iPhone to capture my ideas and they're
all sick to the cloud it's really easy
to use and I have you know hundreds of
notes but where do I go from there
that's where notational velocity comes
in notational velocity is an app for the
Mac it's really simple it's gonna look
it's gonna look too simple to you at
first but I think it's very powerful
there's just two panes right here a list
of text documents and the actual text
document that's currently selected and
up here there's a search so I want to
find that note that I just took so I'm
gonna search for Park as you can see
it's sorted by date so apparently I use
the word Park in paper is the Instagram
of drawing which is a feature I just put
up on the site but here's Verge at work
and I have that note that excellent know
that I just took in the park and it says
what if I pretend to have an idea in the
park and it's like that is a good idea
so I could just keep adding editing it
right here so mmm this is a good idea
this is a lot of my typing as well
saying hmm and huh and also you can just
use this as a view over here and then
open this up and I a writer or the text
editor of your choice and continue to
edit editing editing
oh and as you can see it's sinking right
here all this shows up over a notational
velocity and it synchronizes with
Simplenote automatically it's built into
the app really easy rotational velocity
by default puts everything in a database
that can be actually really encrypted if
you want to put some really sensitive
information in there I have all of my
notes stored as text files in a folder
in my Dropbox so it's just a folder
called notes on my Dropbox and so that
means not only are all of these
synchronized to simple note but they're
also saved Dropbox but nice thing about
the Dropbox is not only is there
redundant backup but there's tons of
apps that work with Dropbox and so any
app that syncs with Dropbox and can edit
text files can be part of my awesome
note-taking ecosystem and one thing I
like to do you know I might start at the
phone I might get some serious writing
done it on my Mac but sometimes I like
to lean back with my ideas
Here I am with my iPad and look how
comfortable I am as Nilay Patel once
said I look rested ly relaxed it's a
good time to review what you've done
with your notes now that you've ingested
them and process them in a corporate
setting one of my favorite apps to use
is plain text it syncs with Dropbox has
a really simple way to search through
your notes which is very important ayah
writer has an iPad app that's very good
but I don't like the way it searches
simple note also has an app it's not so
pretty but obviously it works very well
with syncing with simple note and I do a
little bit of light text editing what I
really want to read I like to lean back
with plain text sometimes put on a
little bit of a little bit of chill
chill music now if you've been watching
this video you know that I use an iPhone
I use an iPad and a Mac and that makes
me a bad person but I want you to know
that you can actually synchronize these
notes with all sorts of apps and
platforms on Windows there's an app
called Reese off notes and it looks a
lot like notational velocity it works
basically exactly like notational
velocity and syncs was simple now
there's a app for Android called flick
notes that works great there's an app
for Symbian there's a web less you can
for your BlackBerry PlayBook you can
synchronize those simple notes and of
course anything that works with Dropbox
isn't going to work great now I have a
single continuous note-taking experience
which flows effortlessly into my actual
writing process which is right here an
ia writer notational velocity the cloud
I'm ready to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
