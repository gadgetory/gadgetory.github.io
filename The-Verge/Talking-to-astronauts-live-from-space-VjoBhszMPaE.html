peake jeff williams and tim kopra
aboard the international space station
to find out what life is like in lower
Earth orbit please stand by for a voice
check from The Verge station this is the
verge how do you hear me we hear you
loud and clear first off I would love to
have you describe your day-to-day
routine on the station you know what are
your hours like is it a typical
nine-to-five gig and what do you spend
most your time working on you know it's
a great question you know and it's an
interesting place to both work and live
because some aspects of our job are sort
of like at home we have a list of events
we have to perform every day but when
you wake up and you get out of your
sleeping bag in your crew quarters you
float out usually float out to the place
where we have on our food stowed and get
some coffee and some breakfast and then
do some cleanup originally coffee came
in a freeze-dried bag but recently
astronauts were treated to a
microgravity espresso machine which
pours coffee into a special zero-g
coffee cup and then the rest of the day
is really filled with science
experiments with maintenance so that we
can maintain the quality of life that we
have up here the microgravity
environment of the space station offers
up a lot of opportunity for research and
the astronauts are responsible for
making sure those experiments run
smoothly that can involve growing human
tissues and protein crystals starting
fires or cultivating producing plants in
the veggie plant growth area there are
very specific skills that we all have to
have even just be assigned be able to
apply the robotic arm because we have
vehicle to come here that we capture and
then the ground dock sit on to the space
station we have spacewalks and it's a
very challenging task we have to be
proficient in that of course space isn't
always the easiest place to live and
work what have been the biggest
adjustments both physically and mentally
to living in microgravity
it took about 24 hours before I felt
actually comfortable because for the
first 24 hours there's a lot of
dizziness and disorientation just as
your vestibular system needs to really
shut down
and I think your brain tends to then
rely just on information coming from the
eyes that you don't feel nausea along
with this space adaptation syndrome
astronauts often experience a lot of
other health changes while in orbit
people lose bone and muscle mass because
they don't have to work against gravity
astronauts must exercise such as weight
lifting or running on a treadmill for
two and a half hours each day to
counteract this problem and the space
environment has some other frustrating
side effects too you know living as your
gravity is some of the best things about
living and some of the most frustrating
things about living because you know you
can't just step put your things out on a
table and and expect it to be there you
have to be very meticulous about all the
things that you have it has to be in a
certain place and you have to remember
where you put it because no longer is it
just a flat surface in which something
can be so it can be stowed on any
surface either with tape or with velcro
and so that becomes a little bit of a
challenge until you get used to living
in this very unusual environment once
you get the hang of microgravity makes
for a great place to show off your
skills as for general human upkeep the
astronauts are deprived of one key earth
comfort obviously we don't have a shower
and that's probably one of the things
that most of us most miss while we're up
here and look forward to when we get
back in the ground but we're we still
are able to keep very clean essentially
taking sponge baths we have a toilet
that you would you would recognize as a
toilet it works very well
wonder how that toilet works the answer
is suction astronauts use leg restraints
to position themselves over the toilet
and then a fan draws out waste and
liquid each astronaut has their own
personal funnel for going number one but
don't worry the space environment is
kept super clean
what's the air like up there is there a
distinct difference between the
environment on the space station and the
air here on earth you know we we get to
enjoy pretty good air up here it's
recycled it's scrubbed from carbon
dioxide and other harmful gases it's a
fairly constant humidity and temperature
the one thing that's very different from
planet Earth is we we have about ten
times the co2 level up here but other
than that is that it's a pretty good
atmosphere often people ask about the
smell of space and the smell of the
space station I remember it being almost
like a clinical smell when I came on
board and I know you know Jeff having
just arrived couple of days ago said our
that that's very familiar smell is quite
hard to describe at the space station
the workday starts to wind down around
7:00 or 7:30 p.m. after that the
astronauts can enjoy some free time such
as watching a movie reading a book or
talking with loved ones back on earth we
also have great communications onboard
the space station with our families we
can use voice over IP telephones and
effectively we can call anywhere in upon
the planet so we can keep in touch with
friends and families in the evenings
once these are finished our working day
then it's time for bed
the astronauts crawl back into their
sleeping bags and get some shut-eye
before they do it all again the next day
and that's how life continues on the
station well until the astronauts hurdle
back to earth and a capsule at more than
500 miles per hour
thank you your verge station we are now
resuming operational audio
communications oh my god I love this
they're doing flips all right did we
kill it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
