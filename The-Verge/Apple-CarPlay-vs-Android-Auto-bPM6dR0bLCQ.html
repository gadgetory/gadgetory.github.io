car I thought you were driving a Chevy
Malibu okay it's not an Apple car but it
does have Apple car play which means I
can plug my iPhone into the dashboard
and get access to all of my apps and
iMessages and Siri and it's all powered
by the phone it's funny that you say
that because the Honda Civic that I'm
driving has both apple carplay and
android auto except I'm like you I'm
using Android auto which is similar and
that I plug my Android phone into the
dashboard and I have access to all kinds
of Android functions but I think there's
still some differences we should
probably tell people about they said my
experience so far using alpha carplay is
basically like having a giant iPhone on
your dashboard the app icons looked
exactly the same
the only difference is this status bar
on the side here which shows you time of
day has a home button and it shows you
your cell signal strength so Android
auto doesn't have that grid-like app
format instead what you're going to see
are a bunch of notifications or if
you're familiar with Android cards that
pop up as you need them and then below
that there are some action icons for
things that you would want quick access
to in your car but to be clear it's not
like you download apps directly to your
car dashboard right you're still
downloading apps onto your smartphone
and then that's what's powering the
dashboard also not all of the apps there
on your iPhone are going to show up on
carplay so there are some third-party
audio apps you can access like Spotify
or Pandora or a podcasting app but it's
not like you're going to run a third
party photo app from your car play
dashboard same with Android auto there
are some third-party apps that you can
access through this but it's not like
you're going to be able to access all of
the apps on your smartphone let's talk
about Macs
yes let's talk about Mac's one of the
more obvious benefits of having
something like a car play or an Android
auto is having your smartphone's Maps
app directly on your dashboard instead
of using your car's navigation system
which in some cases might not get live
updates yeah but with apple carplay you
have to use Apple Maps
whereas with Android auto you get to use
Google Maps and it's a pretty standard
Google Maps interface also with Google
Maps Android auto you can pinch to zoom
whereas with Apple Maps you have to use
zoom buttons in order to zoom in on the
map you know Apple Maps has gotten a lot
better I don't appreciate the shade yeah
here Apple absolutely better when the
next version of iOS comes out also apple
carplay has iMessage whoops which will
be read aloud to you and you can respond
with your voice yeah but you can't reply
to third-party apps with apple carplay
whereas with Android auto messages from
third-party apps like Skype and kik and
whatsapp will be read aloud to you and
then you can actually reply with your
voice as well
another benefit to apple carplay is
having siri directly in your car
dashboard so you just long press a
button on your steering wheel and then
you can ask Siri for directions or to
open certain apps and she'll do it for
you yeah Android auto has voice control
too in fact a lot of the interactions
are through voice control in theory this
is all supposed to be less distracting
another small difference between the two
is that you can still interact with your
iPhone when it's plugged in and powering
carplay but you can't interact with your
Android phone while you have it plugged
in using Android auto yeah this goes
back to the distraction thing you can't
do that now but maybe in a future update
you'll be able to interact with your
Android phone while it's plugged in and
I bet it might be less buggy to yeah I
bet that update will be less buggy for
you too because in our experience
Android auto has crashed a little bit
more than carplay has well maybe that's
the cars fault I mean even when you give
your entire dashboard over to the phone
it doesn't mean the car maker can't
still screw things up the bottom line is
that carplay and android auto or
we'll let you do some of the things that
you do on your smartphone but directly
on your car dashboard and offer a more
familiar interface at the same time also
another added benefit is that you get
updates to these dashboards when your
smartphone gets updated as opposed to
waiting around for car manufacturer
updates all right that was fun but what
do you need to have this kind of
experience in your car well first off
you need a car that actually supports
apple carplay or Android auto because
it's not like you can just plug your
smartphone into any vehicle right I mean
overall are these plug-and-play
solutions better than a lot of the car
manufacturer designed smart interfaces I
would say yes based on my experience and
I really liked apple carplay but also
keep in mind that some of the
frustrations you have with apps on your
smartphone are also going to translate
to the car dashboard I mean apps crash
serious and perfect and stuff like that
also we still don't know exactly how
distracting it's going to be when people
have notifications and a bunch of other
stuff popping up on their car dashboard
so stay safe out there kids stay safe
Siri I can turn on the air conditioner
because audio is high I'm so hot I like
I can't even tell you how much I'm
sweating right now it's so gross I think
you're gonna be the drippy sweat
interesting but I have Siri so that's
good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
