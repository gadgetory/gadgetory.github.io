up the laptop world with the XPS 13 and
showed that you can have a full-size
laptop display in a really compact
footprint so it's time for a proper
update to the design and this is the new
Dell XPS 13 now the new model doesn't
look hugely different from the prior
version at first glance but Dell has
made a number of tweaks and refinements
some of them are good some of them are
bad that freshen up the appearance and
functionality of the laptop let's start
with the good things the most impressive
thing about the old XPS 13 was how small
the border around the display was and
the new models even tinier making it the
smallest 13-inch laptop you can buy it's
also slightly lighter which is a good
thing because last model was
considerably heavier than many of its
more modern competitors and it's also
slightly thinner it comes in two colors
standard black and silver version or
this very pretty rose gold and white
model that I have here and despite the
smaller profile the new model is not a
crippled machine like last year's
two-in-one version was as full power 8th
generation Intel Core processor up to 16
gigabytes of RAM and plenty of power for
most any productivity task you do now
you can't game on it but it does support
Thunderbolt 3 so you can plug in an
external GPU and game that way if you
want the new display is really a stunner
it comes in either a 1080p non-touch
version or a fork a touchscreen option
and thanks to those even smaller bezels
it really pops
it's bright colorful and just plain
great to look at now I'd much prefer if
it was a three by two aspect ratio
instead of this sixteen by nine and it's
disappointing the only touchscreen
option is on the 4k panel which pushes
the price of the XPS 13 up to over 1600
bucks but otherwise it's a really nice
display
Bill's also kept some other niceties
like this battery gauge on this left
side lets you check the status of the
battery without having to open the
laptop the keyboard is also slightly
less mushy with great travel and the
trackpad is fast and smooth too so
what's not so great about this well for
starters the webcam is still awful now
don't move it from the lower left corner
of the display to the center and added
Windows hello I our login features but
it still is an awful unflattering up the
nose viewing angle and it still gets
blocked by my fingers if I'm typing
while on a conference call it's really
kind of frustrating that Dell hasn't
figured out a better way to do this by
now the other big issue is the port
selection on the XPS 13 and now comes
with three USB seaports two of them are
Thunderbolt 3 and then it's also got a
headphone jack and a micro SD card slot
now I love that I can charge the laptop
by at any of the USB C ports but it's
still frustrating that there isn't a
single USB a port for all of those
accessories that's still required that
means that yes you'll be living the
dongle life and at least Dell is kind
enough to throw in and adapter in the
box for you but I promptly and
unfortunately lost it it's also kind of
a bummer that the full-size SD card slot
has been traded for that far less useful
micro SD slot
it's either give me a full sized slot or
don't even bother the micro SD port is
kind of a crummy compromise now the
other disappoint I've been having with
the new model is that it has a smaller
battery than the prior version and I've
been averaging just 6 hours of use
between charges with a fork a touch
screen version that's a bit less than a
full workday and it's lower than I'd
really like from this level of computer
so that's a new XPS 13 it's a couple of
steps forward and a couple of steps back
which is overall kind of a bit of a
bummer I'd have loved to see him del
rethink the placement of that webcam and
maintain some of the port options the
prior model while still shrinking the
overall footprint it also would have
been nice if the battery hadn't gotten
smaller in the process either
but if you don't care about any of those
things the new XPS 13 is one of the
smallest nicest looking most portable
full power laptops you can buy
