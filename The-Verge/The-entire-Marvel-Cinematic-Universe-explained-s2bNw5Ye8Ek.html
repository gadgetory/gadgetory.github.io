movies from the start have been about
one famous me
doesn't matter which movie we're talking
about each one in their way
examines war real or fantastical the
Warriors involved and the power it takes
to create them since Tony Stark first
exited the cave in 2008 as Iron Man the
stakes in this battle between good and
evil have only gotten higher and
blurrier of course the Marvel mythos
began long before Ironman here's a
history of Marvel's Ultra confusing
ultra explosive war beginning at the
dawn of the universe leading all the way
up to Avengers age of Ultron so let's go
way way back all the way to antiquity
before the university even began before
the universe began there were six
singularities after the Big Bang
those singularities were concentrated
into six powerful ingots known as the
Infinity stones they're extremely
important have power over creation
itself and influence events throughout
history for instance five thousand years
ago the Dark Elves of svartalfheim
planned on using the ether of the
Infinity stones to destroy the nine
realms during an event known as the
convergence why because the nine realms
are planets in the universe linked by
the cosmic tree yussle
Asgard is the ruling realm but Earth or
Midgard is pretty important to seeing is
that's where most of the action that
matters to you and me happens during
that conflict the father of Odin Bor
defeats the Dark Elves and nearly wipes
them out save for Malekith and his
minions so then thousands of years later
Odin defeats the frost giants of
Jotunheim on earth and adopts Loki
however the tesseract another of the
Infinity stones lands on earth in Norway
because we need that to link to Norse
mythology if the 20th century was the
American Century it was also a period
where humanity at least in the Marvel
Cinematic Universe started to strive
toward a higher form of war the world
wars presented the kind of existential
threats Midgard had never really seen to
fend off those threats the world saw the
birth of the Super Soldier which meant
great and terrible things for everyone
around 1935 German scientist dr. Abraham
Erskine developed Super Soldier Serum
and is forced to use it on Nazi officer
Johann Schmidt and this is how he
becomes Agent Smith no wait hold on
the red skull after the war breaks out
Red Skull rediscovers the tesseract in
Norway using it to power Hydra the Nazis
mystical research wing back in the
States
Steve Rogers enlists in the Army
alongside his buddy Bucky and meets
Chester Phillips Peggy Carter and later
Howard Stark Tony Stark's father thanks
to arcsin Rogers becomes Captain America
he'd go on to lead the Howling Commandos
which you could argue are the avengers
wartime forerunners later behind enemy
lines caps friend Bucky is captured
freed and falls to as a parent
demolished in a climactic battle captive
eats red skull and crashes into the
Arctic the tesseract is lost in remain
so for nearly 70 years
so while cap sleeps Chester Philips
Peggy Carter and Howard Stark eventually
co-found shields start up however the
remnant of Hydra left behind after red
skulls defeat quietly infiltrates shield
as shield slowly becomes a global
superpower during this time Bucky is
found and is brainwashed by shield
becoming the Winter Soldier a super
soldier who assassinates global leaders
over the course of decades meanwhile
Howard Stark works on arc reactor
technology the tech that would
eventually power in Iron Man suits he
does this with Anton Vanko
but steals credit from Benko because
he's a bit of a jerk at this point the
Soviets begin work on their own super
soldiers creating the Red Room and Black
Widow program you guess who's a product
of that program years pass and things
start to quiet down
President Reagan is elected into office
Michael Jackson releases thriller and a
young boy named Peter Quayle is abducted
by aliens by the end of the Clinton
years it's one big party in the Marvel
Universe but things are just on the
horizon at a New Year's Eve party in
1999 Tony Stark meets Maya Hansen the
inventor of extremists and one ugly
aldrich killian he'll be important later
after 9/11 America found it needed new
super soldiers as it faced threats it
could not control but as the years wore
on it became clear that some threats
were out of this world get it out of
this in a bid to recreate arcsine Super
Soldier Serum general fattiest Ross
enlists Bruce Banner and his daughter
Betty Ross to work on a new version of
the serum at Culver University this time
they're using gamma radiation which is
probably a bad idea lens fly because
banner becomes the Hulk and destroys
everything in the lab it escapes
meanwhile Tony Stark becomes an arms
dealer because we wouldn't want to cash
in on their genius during wartime he's
aided by Pepper Potts his personal
assistant and happy hope his driver
stark winds up getting captured by the
ten rings a terrorist organization in
the Middle East in order to escape he
and fellow captive yinsen create a mini
arc reactor this is similar to the one
his father first designed this powers a
suit of armor that helps him escape
after unearthing corruption in Stark
Industries linked to his capture Stark
and his brand-new Iron Man suit of armor
fights and wins his first battle after
announcing himself as Iron Man Tony
Stark is approached by Nick Fury about
the Avengers initiative elsewhere
Hulk is attacked in Rio by Thunderbolt
Ross and super soldier candidate Emil
Blonsky banner manages to escape and
makes his way back up to the state
the big week so this is where things
really heat up and then marvel jumps
into a giant pile of money three
different movies happen in the span of
one week Iron Man 2 incredible Hall
Church and Thor some time passes and
Tony Stark upgrades his suit he's at the
top of his game he's looking great but
soon discovers the arc reactor in his
chest is killing him Natasha Romanov aka
Black Widow is hired at Stark Industries
so then Ivan Vanko Anton Vanko son
attacks Tony Stark at the Monaco Grand
Prix after that we get reduced to
Colonel James Rhodey Rhodes an Air Force
pilot and good friend of Tony's he then
becomes war machine get out after
beating down a drunken volatile Stark
meanwhile back on Asgard Thor is about
to be crowned king however his
coronation comes to an abrupt end when
the frost giants invade after some
soul-searching and reviewing his
father's old notes
Tony creates a new type of ray of light
just kidding it's a new element that's
cool still though right that element
powers his new arc reactor saving his
life in the process Thor and his friends
namely adoptive brother Loki SIF in the
Warriors 3 voltage Fandral and Hogan
invade Jotunheim to take down the frost
giants they fail odin eventually saves
Thor but banishes him to earth stripping
him of his powers

out to rule Asgard in Thor's place
meanwhile Emil Blonsky becomes a super
soldier using a modified banner serum

melee unfortunately he fails in that
attempt he's still unworthy banner just

sake Thor's powers return he then
