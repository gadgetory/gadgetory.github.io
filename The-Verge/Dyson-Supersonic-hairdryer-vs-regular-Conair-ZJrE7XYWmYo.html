probably don't know what it's like to
have to blow-dry long hair on a regular
basis but I can tell you from experience
that it can take a ridiculously long
time yeah that's something we actually
agree on yeah so that's why I was really
excited to try out Dyson's new
supersonic hair dryer Dyson of course is
known for its excellent vacuum cleaners
but in this case it took the digital
motor technology from its vacuums and
put it into this pool futuristic $400
hair dryer shut the front door
$400 yeah this this is expensive but
good products tend to cost a lot stop it
okay this hair dryer that I got in my
local pharmacy the Conair 1875 watt
turbo styler cost twenty one dollars
yeah but this one looks way cooler and
the motor isn't a handle unlike that
hair dryer really any other hair dryer I
think I've used before so what does that
do over one it means the head can be
designed like this which is super sleek
unlike that long nozzle you've got there
but more importantly it means that the
weight is more evenly distributed as
you're using it I am still not sold okay
well maybe this will impress you the
supersonic hair dryer has a glass feed
thermistor you mean a thermometer yeah
basically but what it's supposed to do
is regulate the temperature of the air
as it is coming out of the supersonic
dryer so that in Siri even if you
haven't popped up to the highest heat
level you won't totally fry your hair
I mean blow-dry your hair every day is
going to damage it eventually whether
you have a special glass speed
thermistor or not true but also the
motor in the supersonic dryer spins at a
hundred and ten thousand revolutions per
minute or rpm the conventional hairdryer
has a motor that's around twenty to
thirty thousand rpm okay this this is a
lot of technical jargon when what I
really want to know is how well this is
that dry my hair
for $400 okay so why don't we have a
little contest like a dry off or
whatever you want to call it just basic
drying no elaborate styling yeah I'm
game I'm game let's test this all right
 wait till you hear how quiet see my
$21 Connor didn't take all that much
longer than your fancy Dyson hmm I don't
know I think my hair looks smoother mmm
does it yeah oh and this does come with
a diffuser for people with curly hair
yeah I mean mine comes with a diffuser -
not only a diffuser also a styling
concentrator
okay well this comes with a diffuser and
a styling concentrator and a smoother
and the cool thing is that they're
magnetized so when you put them on like
this so let me get this straight
both of us had our hair dried in around
five to seven minutes but your Dyson
looks way cooler has some temperature
control features it's a really powerful
motor and has some magnetic attachments
and you are willing to pay $400 for that
okay the point is not that this is going
to do something radically different from
what yours does it's a hair dryer it
dries hair it doesn't make you look like
a supermodel however I can appreciate
that this is a cool new piece of
technology in a market that really has
been the same for a long time I mean
Dyson is known for bringing cool stuff
into its vacuum and its home environment
line of products and this time it
decided to tackle the hairdryer so while
I personally probably wouldn't spend
$400 on this hairdryer I can appreciate
that it's a cool piece of technology
that hopefully will someday be maybe a
little bit less expensive
okay well until that happens I'm just
gonna stick with my $21 hairdryer
because it's fine it works just fine
she's such a killjoy well maybe this
will impress to you this has a glass
feed thermistor thermistor there in a
store key right bag just going to the
thermistor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
