cycrin and I'm pretty sure there's a
mole at the verge I just don't know who
it is but I me to figure it out this is
90 seconds on the verge starting april
first electric car maker Tesla will be
banned from selling its vehicles
directly to customers in New Jersey
unlike other automakers Tesla sells its
Model S through company-owned retail
stores claiming it does sort of properly
educate customers about going electric
as you might guess Tesla's expressing
outrage saying Governor Chris Christie's
administration went back on their words
just 24 hours before the decision was
made and saying the amendment is quote
in affront to the very concept of a free
market yesterday saw the release of
titanfall easily one of the most
anticipated games of the year and let's
just say that Titans weren't the only
thing crashing Xbox Live went down last
night making titanfall well unplayable
the game is a multiplayer only game
that's dependent on xbox live you can't
even play the tutorial without a
connection service has since been
restored and Microsoft is investigating
the issue and finally my dream of
scoring points in Scrabble with the word
forget about it may soon become a
reality hasbro is allowing players to
submit words they'd like to see added to
the scrabble dictionary and one of them
will be chosen for the books update this
year current suggestions include twerk
do and just more words with the letter Z
in them the updated official scrabble
players dictionary will be released in
August and that's it for today's top
stories coming up tomorrow sir I've
never seen you before but there's a mole
around here could you only find him</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
