Verge and I'm holding in my hand and all
new iPhone 6s plus and it's in the the
rose gold color which is really quite
nice so the big deal with the 6s plus in
terms of works are going to deal with
every day is the camera and so if we
open up the camera it's a 12 megapixel
camera and I can take a shot here and
you know this is very good lighting so
presumably it's pretty good
but one of the cool things is it's a
live shot so if I force touch on the
screen it shows the moment before and
after I took the photo which leads me to
the second thing that is new about the
iPhone 6s and 6s plus which is 3d touch
if you press ultra hard just a little
bit harder than a normal tap it brings
up context menus and so you can do
things like peek into messages peek into
webpages on having to change apps or you
know jump right into sub menus from the
home screen so I'm going to take a
selfie here and in fact I'm going to
make sure the flash is on when I do that
you see that the screen actually flashed
that you have a two-tone flash from the
retina display itself on the retina cam
so the front-facing camera is 5
megapixels again on the back it's 12
megapixels which is really good and it's
also you know it's not as many
megapixels or other things but Apple
generally takes a little longer to add
the megapixels but they make sure it
works really well in low light and
assuming we can believe Apple sample
photos it will be really good in the
light other things to know it has an a 9
processor which as usual Apple claims is
incredibly fast and incredibly good and
pricing is going to work out to be about
the same as last year's iPhone so if you
can find a contract it's $1.99 to start
otherwise you're paying installment
plans around 27 bucks a month for the
base model and by the way last thing the
base model is only 16 gigabytes
it is not 32 so there you go that is the
iPhone 6s plus and also the 6s they
should be available very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
