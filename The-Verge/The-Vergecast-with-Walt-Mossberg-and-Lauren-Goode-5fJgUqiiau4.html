took Mossberg 4 seconds to start
trolling me on there for this verge cast
hello everybody and welcome to the
broadcast I want to stay today is June
25th it's a very special episode of The
Verge cast we are joined by our new
colleagues one mr. walter Mossberg who
you're supposed to say hello oh hello
there I am the delightful miss Lauren
good hello everybody um so dieter I've
got I've got I just tabs playing audio
everywhere um so Lauren and Walt are
joining the verge as part of boxing
these acquisition of recode which is
very exciting right they're gonna be
around they're in town this week to meet
everyone literally it's just been three
days of introductions it's been awesome
things new endless meetings I did we had
a good dinner
that was great we had a stew eater yeah
our friends eater hooked us up yeah and
we thought we'd have known for chest
this week and then later on I'm going to
somehow swindle Walt into doing a
podcast of his own and that's been great
and then over what the hell are you
doing drinking this hydrater no
distilled I'm just reusing
you chef isn't hype see this is call
hype on the giant yeah water yeah so
this is how okay you don't call hi
here's how this works
okay it's very close to God but if I got
myself into
so this is the verge cast let's start
with started start this is the verge
cast were discuss all things verge for
the week I am we usually stick to
technology we have the we have formats
where sometimes we you know get deep
into entertainment we get deep in a
culture we you know Liz will be on we
talk about science and then sometimes we
have what we call hard Tech verge cast
we're just get really nerdy about
technology but the main format here is
it basically it's chaos over here and
Sam sits in the hype desk over there and
as we discuss various topics you can ask
Sam to hype check those topics so we can
Sam hype check the iPhone it peaked a
while ago it's out like it's six or
seven now like it's ubiquitous and the
idea is for Sam to provide a number but
that the fortunately some flavor there
the formula that generates that number
is subject to much discussion because I
think it should change over time
I think the hype level of things changes
over time you're totally right yeah so
that's the first agreement I've gotten
from all a week so I feel really good
about that so just for the audience we
have been in meetings and literally just
like introducing people and hanging out
and seeing how things work so we've been
a little off of a new cycle and these
guys haven't been on the show before so
I thought what we might do is sort of
introduce them everybody with kind of
state of the union and just talk about
the big players and tech what they're up
to how they're doing you know where
they're where they're where they're hype
levels are coming and going you got to
stop drinking out a two liter or a two
gallon jug of water no one going to one
that's one go okay well it's still crazy
what you doing click I check your jug of
water 10 I
so this Walton Lauren is the verge chest
Peter Kafka is live watching oh yeah
he's our biggest fan and he has already
told us well that we need to speak into
the microphone you guys you know really
thanks Peter yeah you guys you know
that's the first time Peters ever told
us to do something
that Peter has watched a podcast
streaming classism yeah Rob so that's
our show no one lets him on them have
you noticed that
oh just really interested Peter here in
the hype seat next week buddy
that would be great Peter lives nice yes
yes no he was in deep Brooklyn Wow roof
shape throughout at Brooklyn yeah heroic
story yeah so look that up so the the
frame of this we were talking just
before the show started is who is Eric
Schmidt at Google was that right a
conference with Walt on stage with Walt
yeah their conference was a deer code it
was D it was the D conference when I was
in the 2011 and he referred to it as the
Gang of Four which is Apple Google
Facebook Amazon right correct
I'm notably leaving out Microsoft right
and I said why did you leave out
Microsoft and his answer was something
on the order of they don't have a modern
platform and then he went on make a
point which was I mean and I interpreted
that as just he's hated Microsoft since
he ran Novell which one person listening
to this knows what Nobel is but it was a
networking enterprise kind of company
and he competed with Microsoft but he
left them out and he had a rash now but
and and we had Microsoft on stage the
next morning and they fired back scoffs
key it was Steven Sinofsky yeah who is
an important executive there at the time
and for had been for many years and he
was actually showing for the first time
ever I think Windows 8 which went out to
as you know knuckle the world and most
Burroughs
what was the hype on Windows 8 I mean
when it at the time the fanboys were
rabid for it right and yeah it uh people
are looking forward to Windows 10 now
let's just leave yeah that's right so
Sinofsky made the point correctly
because snaps key is a smart guys a
student of history lived in China for a
while and that the Gang of Four was also
a term that referred to the kind of
clique of dictators that ran China for a
while yeah and so he was happy for
Microsoft
to be that was his point but but Eric
actually putting aside the Microsoft
jealousy thing he had an interesting
point to make which is still true today
I think which is he claimed there had
never been a time in tech history where
you had four companies that were
platforms that yeah so powerful and
growing so fast simultaneously and that
it was just sort of an amazing time for
developers and consumers of the products
they developed and that was that was
sort of the way his thought process that
what I think is fascinating is how
all-encompassing those platforms have
become right now you can't you literally
everything I wrote a piece last week two
weeks ago where the entire media
industry the whole revenue of the media
industry or the music industry is less
than Apple's profit over three quarters
and they're totally dependent on Apple's
platform to succeed and be the
gatekeeper of everything they do and
Google wants the same thing in slightly
different way and Amazon wants the same
thing in a slightly different right and
Facebook is literally just subsuming the
media industry and instant articles and
it's amazing how big these platforms
have become and Microsoft is trying to
reinvent its platform with Windows 10 I
get yet again the 15th time right and I
think the I thing the interesting thing
is that all these guys and most the more
guys had had a particular thing they
were good at or that the sat at the
center of their their formula you know
Google it was originally searched than
in you know then Android Apple it was
and still is I think basically making
hardware with software that kind of ties
in vertically to the hardware with
Facebook social obviously and with
Amazon it was selling things but they're
actually all now impinging on each other
right like you know you could draw these
Venn diagrams and show all the overlaps
of all this stuff so it's it's like a
giant four-sided or including Microsoft
a five-sided war yeah I think we should
include because Microsoft's on
we actually morning there are costs for
trying in but I think if we're doing
this a year ago when Windows 8 was like
in full throat I would say maybe you
could leave them out like that that
didn't work now I wouldn't have laid
that look there still are hundreds of
millions of yeah and they're all
Lizzie's hot running Windows and that's
what they do every day so that is the
legitimate platform that a lot of things
a lot of work a lot of of browsing and
other things is done on every day all
around the world right Lauren yeah yeah
so let's get into it and I'll just ask
Lauren so we're in an apple moment right
now which I'm just gonna go analyst
Apple Google Facebook Amazon Microsoft
and let's do State of the Union all of
them somewhere in there I'm going to
read read some ads and why do you think
we're in an Apple moment right now
biggest they're both are huge they're
about to roll at Apple music hmm right
they showed off the next versions of all
of their platforms OS 10 iOS 9 the
iPhone continues to be a monster
they got Taylor Swift to put her album
on Apple you know like that they have
the cultural weight that I don't think
anybody else has and I think when Google
you know we look at I look at it when
Google had i/o a couple weeks ago there
wasn't just the wall-to-wall saturation
of Google's like we did in our Sun
because we covered Google but the rest
of the world wasn't like paying
attention to Google Apple is like has
one little tweet with Taylor Swift and
like the world explodes right and I
think that moment is still very strong
and so you tell me what do you think is
going on with operator Oh Apple music
specifically I mean there's so much
Apple watch I mean we'll know the heart
so the watch I think he's like
fascinating please stop talking about to
watch you're not wearing one I'm
actually not one Walt's wing while it's
wearing one and I've noticed a bunch of
people at the verge actually are wearing
theirs as well but I'm testing something
different right now and yeah we it is
definitely a moment for Apple right I
mean they revolutionized the way that
everybody pays for consumes music over a
decade ago now they're now trying to do
it again they're sort of you know
they've taken this wait-and-see approach
everyone now knows that streaming music
is a thing
right and so I think you know this is
going to be a really pivotal moment for
them in terms of their music services
and actually what happens to iTunes as
it exists now
they just like they're doing with music
they took a wait-and-see approach with
wearables and now they've just come in
with with a SmartWatch but you know I
think the response to Apple watch has
been a little bit mixed actually and I
think the early reviews were all sort of
like polite and acknowledging it as a
beautifully designed piece of hardware
of course like you know we were viewed
at graph and then Walt reviewed it you
know early on as well there weren't a
third party apps at the time so we
couldn't really judge it you know
totally accurately or entirely at the
time but now like even we've seen lots
of apps come out and people are still
like yeah you know we're still gauging
the value of this so it's a fine Apple
moment but it's like there's still so
much wait and see and we hate saying
that is journalists like which is the
whole time will tell but it that's sort
of I all right now so I think I think
you're right but I would remind you that
if we could get in a time machine and go
back to two months into the iPod the
iPhone if you look at the reviews the
iPad got weird bad reviews in the
beginning like no one's going to buy
this and it became the fastest-selling
piece of consumer electronics ever even
faster than the PC I actually think the
bad I've had reviews and people getting
those wrong is the best thing that could
have possibly happen the Apple watch
because I don't I thought everybody was
wrong those bad reviews about the iPad
were wrong like off the bat so but I
think the the mixed reviews of the watch
are dead-on yes of course they should be
everyone's afraid to like really say it
because they might be as wrong as nobody
lie they should be mixed because the
whole package isn't out there yeah I
agree well because they just thanks
general one thank you first of all the
hardware is Jim one but it isn't that
the hardware is fine for Gen one yeah
it's they just as you know very well
they just released what you might call
the first real SDK for it right where
where
a third-party developer can write to the
watch as a device what I said in my
piece which was based on wearing it for
a month was that I had the feeling and I
did have some apps to to talk about that
were finished but they were these apps
that you know basically are little stubs
of iPhone apps because they didn't
weren't allowed to write directly the
watch and I and so I wrote it just feels
like a lot of the developers don't know
what to make of this right right
that's not going to be true in the fall
and we also wanted a rush it out or tour
I don't think they rushed it out they
took years to do it the question is why
did they do it in these two stages yeah
because it was probably faster to get a
bunch of apps out through the iPhone it
may have been a mistake
no it's also the total learning curve
with these types of devices right like I
was just talking to the Fitbit CEO
yesterday we ran a story about that and
recode and even he pointed out and
they've been around for eight years
we're still in very early stages of
consumer awareness around these types of
products too so on the flip side of that
I guess the Apple had rolled everything
out and saying like ok and here are
thousand apps you can run immediately on
this watch and and you know a lot of the
app load experiences have been really
slow or in some cases you're swiping and
you're like what is this do here it
could have been too overwhelming for a
certain segment apples Apple you got to
remember two things about Apple and it
goes through all these products and one
is they you you guys mentioned this but
this is a truism with Apple they always
wait they always wait to see what people
are fun pummelling around in a category
they decide it's interesting to them and
that and they figure out can we do this
better or more holistically or whatever
and then they try and that's what's
going on they usually really succeed and
dominate the market they do they have
historically secondly um uh Apple plays
the long game yeah and they can afford
to mm-hmm but it but to be fair when
Jobs did not have this kind of money he
still played the long game I mean I in
in I had lots of conversations with him
over the years I can't ever remember him
talking about quarterly or anything yeah
yeah it just couldn't have mattered less
to him he never went on the analyst
phone calls I think he did want
he wants to burn Android tablets to the
ground right but the point is basically
eating care so I mean what though I did
see him super excited one time when the
sales of one of the Pixar the box office
for one of the Pixar movies came in
because he was so happy about it but so
they're in it for the long game if you
look at the iPhone it was dead in the
water for the first three or four months
I mean dead in the water and they had to
cut the price yeah add to cut the price
and he had cut the price again and it
did not if you looked at the sales chart
on that it did not there was eventually
kind of a hockey stick thing but it was
like a year was like after they had
opened an app store and all that other
stuff same with the iPod and so it's way
too early the reason I have a watch is
it's a platform device from the company
that as the hype desk has just clear has
eventually succeeded within all these
things however out these two people
together will it will it either is going
to be a huge flop or it's going to
actually become a platform where people
are going to deuce let's talk about
Apple music I really do but there's like
there's so much Apple this what I mean
by oh man we did a whole show on the
watch we do the whole show on using
Taylor Swift's next album should be
called Apple moments hey Tay you heard
it here yeah
soundcheck Taylor Swift she's at Queen
of hype she is I really is like I got
good music well we talked about Apple
music on a show I think every single
week it's been like two months it's been
dominating what we talk cuz it's such an
important thing it is and then Spotify
it's music in general right now is
upside down Emily and I were having a
conversation and for the past year year
and a half all we've talked about in
terms of entertainment and technology
has been television over and over again
we talk about TV are they gonna get the
deals and make TV what's Netflix going
to do amazon's making shows and I just
sort of figured itself out and now we're
just moving on we reinvent music again
and we're all we talk about when we talk
about technology and culture right now
is music it's just strange just flipped
like that
like we just stop talking about
television in the way that we did for
each of the past agents you're saying
this is all just one big head fake no I
maybe Apple orator or you're really
interested music no I could be I just
think that the TV stuff has proven to be
so hard for so long yeah no you're right
you're right that it is slowly sort of
sort of so we were actually talking
about this in one of our meetings this
week how there are a lot of smart TVs
but people are still hooking Roku's yeah
these are still using over-the-top yeah
whatever on here's a one thing I find
really interesting about Apple music
which by the way they did an
uncharacteristically terrible job of
presenting as you rose it was the
opposite of simplicity that they and I
personally I mean I think it's because
they had this part of their effort to
integrate beats
yeah it's Apple which are different
cultures I mean I was thinking about
what you said actually you go through it
because it's really interesting well gee
well has a perspective so so Jimmy I've
ein and dr. Dre who you know created
beats and ran beats and got three
billion dollars for it from Tim Cook
which for Tim Cook is couch cushion
change right nothing he came out on
stage he had a lot to do with I think
the design of Apple music and I happen
to like him a lot yeah I think he's
great he's a great guy but he's a record
industry guy he happens to have a it's
almost a purity of vision about music he
cares he really does care about human
curation since that's an Apple thing
also if there is a fit there but in
terms of him coming out and doing a
presentation with Eddy Cue who has
become his pal um it was it just was
very muddy it was very unclear what
they're doing and it's really not
unclear when you break it down but the
way they presented it was hey I remember
people were leaving and saying oh so
beats one is now the new iTunes radio
but it's actually Apple music radio and
beats one is a channel yeah
radio is staying the same with a
different name it's algorithmic radio
right and beats one is an old-fashioned
it might as well be 1957 except that its
global and it's a linear radio station
it's so weird
which focuses on the taste of the DJ's
yet but I'm not so sure I'm no expert on
this but I'm not so sure that
Millennials won't find that interesting
I don't know even just the idea of if
multiple people tuning into the same
stream or the same thing write read
write or they may find address Gracie I
think one eel here for a reason I think
this is going to be one of the most
compelling things about Apple music I
think even like my generation we are
also connected you know we have whatsapp
and FaceTime you just it's you press a
button and you're talking to someone on
the other side of the world your time at
the greatest generation your time that's
debatable
definitely debatable you won world war
two right I mean we could do an entire
show of walnut and trolling yeah I'd be
really clear it's going to be I think
your old really special where you know
you can be listening to the same music
as someone that's in a different time
zone er literally on the other side of
the world
yeah and it's Apple and everyone knows
Apple and yeah I think it's going to be
it's Apple and everyone knows Apple
explains a lot of things
he explains a lot of things so my
question is also around human curation
not just this not just the idea of the
limit linear terrestrial style radio
being streamed but do people really care
about human curation when it comes to
trying music I do you listen to a
playlist you're like this was made by a
human instead of a bottle those humans
are icons also like arguably known
around the world to in the case of Apple
Museum but I guess for streaming in
general do you think people care about
curation what Emily did you see em I
tweeted a picture if like Beyonce's like
festival hits playlist on title
yesterday it was just so bad it's just
like we all said Yonsei like did she do
this robot do this did like but knee
like where did this come from nothing
against Beyonce personally but I mean
that's a quote of the virtuosity gimmick
that's a celebrity but the point is
when when Jimmy and Dre and the and Ian
Rogers who most people don't know who he
is but he's been in the music business a
long time the digital music business and
he's a very smart guy when they started
beats music and the DNA of de beats
music is in Apple music clearly even
even some of the UI is in there their
idea was not to get celebrities they did
they do have some that was not their
idea their idea was to get the the best
country music magazine I can't remember
the name but what is it the does anybody
here know no or if it's wrong it was
really it's rock and roll country music
is the last music the world to have
actual guitars in it and I keep trying
to get into it because I'd like one of
us think it's our songs and then it's
awful and I thought this is a hey Monty
cyclope anyway that so that so whatever
that whatever that is they had them
curate a bunch of playlists they had
Rolling Stone curate rock and roll play
but Spotify has a statue hitch fork do
that so yeah but they did it they did it
first and Spotify then also did it and
you know maybe it'll all work out that
it's all the same remember when Spotify
launched apps this is like a crazy idea
they had a desktop and the one app that
was awesome then remains awesome but
nobody it's really update anymore is the
pitchfork app okay but pitchfork is in
was in beats and it's in up Ivan checked
but I'll bet it's an apple music we can
read pitchfork and listen nobody can't
read it right so it is Spotify desktop
app used to be able to read pitchfork
and it would play the songs of the nice
early units so not compelling but that's
like that's my Sunday afternoon with and
I actually really like to do that when
I'm lost I miss Spotify in the car right
I'm just kidding yeah you can't read
what remember like the idea so I used to
read you used to I used for his head
amazing need to know what cutting that
coming wrong recode I think the lowered
a little bit
you know what's happening what do I
think about the price what's ten dollars
a month I want to bring this up yeah cuz
here is complete but it's not just the
price that you're going to pay but the
model of it I mean how it like Mossberg
has a theory that we've talked about so
here's the theory it's more than a
theory it's condemnation I know it's
more than a theory because you let the
insane for the aside I'm really excited
right this shows you get boring and now
it's getting excited there's gonna be
blood because every waters our friend
Peter Kafka who knows everyone in the
music industry that you know wrote for a
while about this this and will continue
to write about it so basically what's
happening for those of you out there who
just want to listen to music and didn't
really care or confused about why is
Apple finally doing this when they
wouldn't do it when Steve Jobs is alive
and whatever what's really going on is
the labels who were saved once by Apple
when they started iTunes the labels hate
Spotify because there's no money
essentially it might as well be no money
made from the ad-supported free tea
right or Spotify so they wanted is
everything to be a subscription they
don't mind a trial period but basically
they want a subscription so they went to
Apple an apple also at the same time
iTunes sales began plummeting so they
needed to do some different so there was
a mutuality of mutuality of interest
there but I am I know for a fact that
there were discussions about okay if we
want to get everybody to subscribe and
we want to defeat the free streaming
ad-supported streaming music which by
the way not just the sort of you know
evil Titans under the music industry but
even the artists and the songwriters all
hate that because so little money is
generated from it my curious or my
question is why didn't they let Apple
charge less than Spotify less super-luxe
and they actually had serious
conversations about it
they have conversations about six bucks
seven bucks 80 bucks you know and
whatever number just so it was just the
differentiator just everything just was
a stereo Spotify to kill Spotify to
achieve their goals
mm-hmm apples goals but also the
industry's goals how would how would
they achieve their goals if they're
charging less because they they'll get
more people as they wait because what
still be better than the ad dad base
they would get people behind paywalls
let's ask our resident millennial by the
way I'm on the cusp so I'm with you here
in terms of millennialism sort of Fulani
ilysm is sort of a worldwide does it
matter to you if you're paying $8 a
month for your favorite streaming
service or $10 a month it's negligible
right and so what ultimately is going to
be the driving whichever ones that are
and whoever has two lon
screaming music because I have yet to
find a streaming service at his tool
right it's the one I mean let's whatever
has the most music so I'm sorry actual
they could charge you 15 bucks and it
would be all right
what I pay premium for tool maybe my
point is is that I the catalog needs to
go deep
well no but now the same catalog does
need to go deep because there and
everyone's going to tweet at me about
Google music this is what happens
everybody is uh but Apple Scout does
need to go deep because you can just buy
the tool record and then you'll have it
it'll be over right I mean uh starts
checking its Apple watch I know really
excitedly showed me at Peter Kafka who's
listening to this pinging the Apple oh
 or no Peter pissah first on the oh
we don't like it so Teeter just tweeted
that in fact Apple wanted five bucks and
thought at one point they had settled a
date yeah and he had a link because of
course he wrote it of course
Lauren to answer your question I'm going
I pay I've been paying for Spotify since
the day came out in the US and when on
June 30 if I'm going to sign up for an
Apple music subscription and after a
month a month and a half
whichever one serves me better I'm gonna
pick that one but I serves you better
with you that's purely based on
catalogue not about the UI it's about
it's it's about the UI the experience
like Spotify there was one version of
Spotify that I was able to
at the icon and it would be up in like
two seconds now there's like a six to
eight second buffer and if I miss that
when I have service and I hop onto the
subway like it's so it's over yes Sam
and I also argue on the show every week
about Spotify about Spotify I think
spies garbage a bad user this see this
is where it's great that it takes just a
while I don't know if it's bad I usually
let me just say let me just say I've
been yeah like I like Daniel Eck I don't
I like music I like the idea of
streaming music I think you could put a
little more effort into making a good
interface I will see what Apple is Apple
well well cast again in a month and
we'll really well section I mean I think
Spotify is you guys garbage like agency
it's not good I use it it's the one I
use the most do you use Google Play all
access and sweet it's just the tweets
and the tweet of the angry email like
yeah we'll play specifically yeah
because we there's we have a lot of
listeners to use it and I have it I pay
for that one - yeah the thing I use that
one the for the most is it doesn't I not
to watch ads on YouTube when I watch
music videos on YouTube that's great
that is a excellent reason to pay for
that service ad then apps on the iPhone
are garbage like they're not good in
their app on Android is a little bit
crashy like none of these things are
good and the reason I have been these
listeners have heard this from me so
many times I'm excited for apples
because I think they write the best
software sometimes yeah yeah not all the
time now sometimes they have a history
of running great song for him because
they paired compared with their artists
so but one of the things that Walt said
to me which was like mind-blowing
because I know it never occurred to me
to think about anything this way was he
said well look you're trying to
integrate recode the this recode group
into the verge and you're taking it slow
and you're being respectable everybody's
feelings
that's what Apple was doing with Beats
so they're letting the beats people do
the stuff their way because Tim Cook
knows he said Tim Cook knows what he
doesn't know when he's letting Jimmy and
Dre like do the beats thing and I'm
thinking that's why this sucks like what
I'm looking at is a product that is this
a series of compromise yet you don't
actually know it sucks yet you know it
just feels like a lot like it feels
interview
people artists connect having the radio
but then also a flagship channel within
the radio and I'm in people's iTunes
also being integrated directly
ice-creams it gets a little bit lacks
focus it lacks focus but it could be
awesome and one of those things where
you say yes decide for maybe artists
connect like I see where this all makes
sense once we start using it what you
haven't swung on this I don't know sorry
to be clear I don't mean a product sucks
I met I mean the the keynote the mess
yes oh that was neat idea we all agreed
on that you know but you wrote a nice
piece saying it sucked I get it but in
this legislation here if you're gonna
check me line right now just it's like a
zero strong dangerous levels how small
to burn but it's not it's not a puddle
of brown okay can we talk about what a
shame shuttle of burn what Apple is bad
at yeah now don't say cloud connected
services that's just every
whatever whenever someone got Sanaa
Kapil they're like they can't do clouds
because it's like yes they can
I wrote a vo script on my Mac on
TextEdit and I just popped it up right
on my phone boom interconnectivity super
quick okay I'll say one thing that way I
come what you guys what the the audio
listener is not experiencing right now
is just Walt just daring it's Sam like
Sam descended from the sky I'm like a
plane marked like idiot jet sorry
welcome ticket Apple needs to get a lot
better services and it has to get better
at that for people to can't write a vo
script right it has to you know that
that the like whether it's iCloud
file drive is that what they call it or
iCloud a car drive yeah um whether it's
the fact that they it took them months
to get my music right on match they
still haven't finished uploading a photo
iCloud photo library what is you had
thirty thousand but they have a lot of
people with much bigger libraries than
that
they they are not as good and that's and
I personally also think that's why their
Maps
thing wasn't what it should have been
part of that is I like their stance on
privacy and on device things but it does
cut them off from some tools that Google
can use even while it's so that's a good
we should we have five of these to get
through yeah we've done a lot anyway
that's there so we talked about their
strengths and their weenie that's Italy
and so this is it excellent transition I
think into Google Facebook Amazon right
because those are all their platforms
are all in the cloud right that Google
has Android as its one hardware platform
where software I don't make oh if they
don't make hardware actually even the
Nexus stuff then I'll make as you know
right but it's the one tangible
expression of their software running on
a local device is Android
maybe it's somebody else's device that
was a beautiful way to describe that
thank you I'm I'm not going to show you
my poetry oh geez what that's great
real MFA works at high a machinist I
thought was Lauren's way of asking for a
10% raise yeah that was Lauren's way of
trying to build my ego up after it's
been a thoroughly decimated okay learn
we'll start with you again tell us about
Google what's going on what's good
what's bad what's going on with Google
Oh God by where I don't even know where
to start
the pick pick an area and we'll go with
the phones phones okay well I mean I
think you know Google is Android is very
much the dominant platform in a variety
of markets and that strategy has clearly
worked for Google I use an Android phone
fairly regularly because I have to as
part of my job but I have to say like
the platform I most go to is my iPhone
and iOS and that sort of thing
what else I mean I think it's
interesting what Google has done to an
extent with Nexus trying to introduce
that into the market um I don't feel
like I kind of don't know like what to
say but I like don't have anything
really I see right now about I think my
iPhone is a vessel for Google services
that's what is it for yeah I buy an
iPhone and I load up the Gmail app and I
use Google search and Google Photos is
wonderful it's just funny like my in it
again
it's why work at a company we all work
now at a company that it runs and Google
services mm-hmm so it
is very that connects a lot of threads
and I think maybe if you work at an
Outlook shop or something like it's not
quite as dominant but I literally my
iPhone runs provides me a window into
Google yes a Google Life all the time
Gmail yeah Google Docs Gmail search
everything everything all Google I think
Google has done a really great job with
Google now it's virtual assistant I
think right now like that there's a lot
of talk of virtual assistants with Apple
claiming that series getting much better
obviously we're going to see new
iterations of Cortana with Windows 10
there was a lecture and Alexa news today
from Amazon and everyone's like this is
this is becoming a very hot area and I
think that Google has done a really
great job with Google now but you know
Apple will of course argue that the way
that they're approaching things with in
terms of all the information being local
to the device is much more private
now maybe Google's approach let me ask
this privacy I think it's a that's all a
hedge on Apple's part because they're
not as good in software yeah I think
they got caught that could be it to an
extent like looking in the wrong
direction and it's partly a hedge yeah I
get what you're saying but I honestly
believe they deeply believe it yeah and
I agree it comes from Steve and it's
still there and if Tim Cook would Tim
Cook has taken the lead in you know even
challenging the government over
encryption this phone this I'm holding
up for those who are now watching I'm
holding up an iPhone which is pretty
common but it's encrypted right um
Google ascetic that's going to encrypt
it or maybe they have an option in the
phone in the latest version of Android
to encrypt it but it's not the same
thing Apple is a hardware company they
just decided to go in and crypt the
phone you know right and they did I
think Google is obviously has won the
war over the share of self of
smartphones they so are so far losing
the war over the profits made by the
smartphones but they're not a band that
may that's not money doesn't matter to
them right but there is a big threat to
Google there's two in my opinion one is
they're spread very thin and that's why
Larry Page has begun to pare back
a bunch of their products that aren't
generating either generating revenue or
he doesn't think they're leading or
they're not interesting or whatever and
secondly and this is the bigger threat
by far is the open source the conflict
between wanting to get Google services
on Android that's how they make money
writing Android is free but you get this
big Google search bar and you get Google
Maps and you get Gmail and you get all
these things and they then can collect
information on you target ads sell you
know place ads all that stuff that
they're in advertise the advertising
company in the sense of that's how they
make their money but a rising share over
twenty percent the last time I checked
on this of Android distribution in the
world has no Google services on it right
it's open-source Android I mean the
example most Americans know about is the
Amazon devices but it is extraordinarily
common in China it's extraordinarily
common in other parts of Asia they're
trying to fight back with a thing called
Android one which they say allows for
sub $100 devices but well inna free to
our colleague at recode just wrote a
story about how they've struggled quite
a lot with that
or maybe well maybe was mark burg one of
them wrote I think it was Maya's mark
which is about the oneplus and emerging
markets but the point is that's that's a
huge threat to Google is the ironically
the growth of Android yeah without
Google right research why why can't
Google just manufacture their own iPhone
their own iPhone or their own Flags your
own flagship right they could they could
I think Andy Rubin who invented Android
and who whose company got bought right
and the Android group there for a long
while before sundar Pichai took over
Andy Andy liked the idea of hardware you
will remember the famous incident of the
thing called the Q no home and or device
yeah we had on earlier at the doorstop
yeah it was amazing yes very very super
effective doorstop they were very they
made it me you they were going to make
the USS was made of high quality
materials all the stuff and they they
never put it on the market um you know I
think Yandy had some tendencies to
liking the idea of the at least the idea
of Martin were but um you don't have the
margins and hardware that you do in in
software or in advertising and it's not
like Google's broke at all yeah Google
could do it but I but just like it's
just like it's not as easy as people
think for Apple to do the kind of job
online that Google does it's not as easy
as people think for Google to do the
kind of job that Apple does with hard
work people just like humans companies
have things they're really good at and
thinks they're not as good at and you
know they could go to they could go to
Foxconn I think they could buy Motorola
yeah yeah I spray actually they did a
phone they did many phones now but they
did a phone that was intended to take on
the iPhone and which one gallery to the
Moto X that was uh but it's not it's you
you've got the Google shrug but right no
Google owned that company right Google
helped Motorola immensely there were
Google engineers all over motor I just
don't think they were punching as high
as they could be punching right if
they're gonna do it just do it and do it
right this is the Google and I am I I
completely greatly but we've been saying
is Microsoft and laptops for 10 years -
it's like it I I think it was what Walt
is saying is it's not as it's not that
easy and faced with the choice between
we're gonna piss off Samsung and they're
going to continue for Android and
they're the hardware maker that has the
better carrier relationships in the
distribution Japanese only the
margeurite banker that is global and
profitable although less and less I'm
saying when Google had that choice
between we can do this on our own we can
learn how to do it or we can give up and
let Samsung do it and Samsung will play
nicer with us they just like offloaded
motor so then that that begs the
question what is the next Nexus phone
are we going to see a Nexus phone that's
you know this year
what is the Nexus program even mean to
Google right now well there
there have been rumors they're going to
drop it they I think they've denied them
so I summarized that naturally but the
Nexus phone is a is a as we all know is
sort of a reference design right it's
like an enthusiast it's the Android
phone I choose right and it's the
Android phone motion wait actually most
people is actually pretty nice phone
I mean it's enormous would you have a
Nexus 6 you have an Android Pentium
where do you swap I have a nexus is
sitting excuse me Nexus 6 loaner at home
and I have a nexus 4 I think that was
given to us and so in some code quad is
fun no I haven't bought it right but I
mean I appreciate having unlocked phones
around its really the Nexus 5 but I find
that favorite phone Nexus 6 was a little
big for me the Nexus 5 had a not garbage
camera I would probably say as my main
phone we've talked about this a lot too
like when you did your review of the
Asus zenfone 2 last week for recoded and
this idea that there's always going to
be you know the premium for the iPhone
the Samsung Galaxy s6 or Samsung Galaxy
Note that people like aspire to they're
sort of aspirational devices right but
you go to other countries and you see
that like not everyone can afford those
types of phones and there are a lot of
handset makers now that are coming in at
the low end of the market making
actually pretty decent phones and it's
really starting to put pressure on
things and I think at the Nexus 6 is
something like that or I mean I know
it's not as know that it's not is
expensive it's not as inexpensive
roughly it's rough that the price price
right but you look at you know different
devices like that and I don't I think
there's you know they're starting to put
some pressure so so anyway to me the
danger for Google is they might be
losing control of Android let's just say
that right might be losing control of
Android and and they would say well we
never controlled in yeah but they do you
have to give you a contract and it's
supposed to be about you know faster
updates and not for King and all that's
great but it's also has in it you have
to use these Google services you can't
just pick and choose you have to use
this whole suite of Google services this
search bar has to appear on this home
screen and finally at once in my life I
can say that was my scoop instead of
every kids are you guys person to
publish up that and gadget that's
fantast what you guys know what to say
no has to stand up no it is a good scoop
you know I've gotta actually stand up
now to watch don't know I'm waiting for
cosmetics pop gonna text me and tell me
that what that that they had a person
but I so is so that to me that's your
Google that's that's the go so what
about the rest of the Google suite
because we at we should go to Facebook
enamel because I think Amazon is really
interesting because I think everyone
thought they were going to be a big
platform company they were in that gang
and then the fire stuff at least in my
estimation is not a great but I think
Facebook is very but let's let's let's
go through Amazon because we can do that
pretty quickly
yeah okay so Amazon is obviously
enormous ly successful in two very
important vectors one is commerce I mean
there's a lot of other commerce
companies some of what you're doing very
nicely but Amazon is still like the
gorilla there and they continue to
innovate they don't they disrupt
themselves which is the key to
everything I think in if you're going to
be successful but Amazon I think in the
device area which which to be honest
they don't even need they just do it
they have the Kindle e-readers yeah the
Motiti derp dee derp bond just eat your
deer just did a review on a Kindle paper
doesn't keep Kindle paperwhite mom my
wife uh has an iPad but she just walks
around with that with a with a with a
Kindle and she loves it and she's a
voracious she have a surface just like I
have so that's how you end that's how
what will I have a surface surface
amazing we'll get there highly but um so
so but my point about Amazon is okay so
there's the Ian's Kindle reader
everything else they've tried even
though they don't ever announce sales
yeah I mean we know the fire was the
phone the fire phone was a flame out but
I think the fire tablets has pretty good
have so no I stole that from you I think
that was in your headline yeah we loud
money uh I think the fire tablets have
been if this was an apple and app
was reporting numbers the way Apple does
which is pretty transparent they would
be terrible numbers I don't think the
fire tablets could be considered a big
success what about the echo while we're
talking about devices the echo is a
fascinating device but it's brand-new
and we just don't know so I love the
echo
I bought one a couple weeks ago yeah I
think it's great and I think it will go
it will die as soon as Apple builds that
feature into a speaker or lets other
speaker manufacturers tie it into an
Apple TV you know like apples got this
homekit thing happening the idea that
you could buy an Apple TV and would sit
there and be the brains of Apple and the
one of it needed actually they have a
new that Alexa would be the brains of a
no no no I'm saying he's crushing
Alexa's great like say he loved and ran
the next clause he said it's gonna be
dead but yeah I was like the idea is so
good write it and then Apple and Amazon
ecosystem is so limited that you can
just see how Apple can swoop in and take
the idea and that's assuming that they
got the virtual assistant in tartar
sauce part right too because part of the
appeal of the echo is this Alexa
artificial intelligence software yeah
actually actually a few demo is just
that it is there and it is so much
easier to talk to a computer for some
things and type it in here right but
what you're saying that part I mean so
it's a piece of hardware it looks kind
of like an elongated speaker essentially
and anybody anybody can do that yeah
talking to it part that you're you in
gestation what artificial intelligence
right but I'm saying that like Google do
to it that the backend assistant part is
commodity smart it's like tables alexis
table stakes tables date right you can
ask her the weather you can tell her to
play some units not really it's not a
bit a giant legal now right we're Google
now is like it like the Alexa never
wakes up and says get the hell out of
here you going to miss your flight the
way Google now could do but what is
amazing is having a speaker that's
sitting there always you have to push a
button on your phone and you I just say
Alexa what's the weather like every
morning now by habit I just want to
speak to this I think this would make a
great like holiday gift for normals the
same way that I feel like Roku is
so successful because a lot of normal
and I say normals is like you guys know
a normals that's like not us not people
like us that do this for a living but
like you go to amazon.com you see an ad
for the echo and then you like Google
echo and you know watching videos and
read Surat I had no idea this thing
existed let me let me say the right
number what is it 200 it's once it's
once or not if you're prime so so but my
point is Apple could make a Siri echo
right or but or and I think this is the
move because basically Amazon announced
this today right that other hardware
makers correctly their API right right
there's no reason Apple can't say to
other speaker makers you can plug into
our API and get access to society
through homekit lauren am I wrong about
this but and you were there actually
just both it because you were sitting
right behind me you were sitting no no
no next to me in the at the Apple event
did they say something about the
developers finally being would tap into
Siri in some way on the phone oh ml okay
but that's that's a step at least look
can we get to my bad my bad name is on I
don't it if the echo is a breakthrough
and a big deal and they follow through
in today's announcements show they're
serious so that could change everything
that could be it could be the next
device other than the ink Kindle readers
in which they're successful I'm only
saying that right now as we sit here all
the devices between the E and Kindle and
maybe the echo not have not been and
then the phone is a disaster yeah and I
actually remember I saw that phone a
little awhile before it it hit the
market and I thought and they and you
know they have serious people who have
been at other companies doing hardware
for a while they thought they were very
serious about not just selling stuff
through it yeah but actually being a
phone power and the problem was in its
Microsoft's problem to me it's a funny
thing in that business you start late
and it's very hard to get people to
think you've got the gimmick or the you
know the that in their case it was you
you kind of flip that his real done and
a demoed great in Seattle when I was
there I saw it and then I got my review
unit and like my risk got tougher and it
worked okay going right but not going
live in my case and you know that I you
could dig up the review I wrote I wrote
about that but so they may not need the
device business because they've got the
other vector that I need mentioned that
we all know about but average people who
use Amazon don't necessarily know about
is that this whole back-end you know
they there they are the what they are
the servers for everybody else so it was
it's a WS what's interesting about that
is those are those are other companies
right they're a platform provider but
they don't get any they don't get any
intelligence across all those companies
no they don't but they make money but
they make money but it's interesting
that that would be that's like no but
they are in a way that's kind of being a
platform right notes I know it is being
a platform so there's a platform there
and they're a commerce platform and
those are that both pretty powerful
right all right so we should do and
while I know you have a hard out but we
should do five or ten on Microsoft if we
have if you have time because I think
Microsoft if we're if if we're in an
Apple moment there is a Microsoft moment
coming with Windows 10 but in my
estimation that moment is coming
sort of it's like careening towards us
it does not feel like in orderly and by
design right they've done a lot of
Windows 10 out in the open there's a lot
of walk back on the new start screen and
versus the desktop they're kind of it's
kind of like back to the future what
they mean they've made this Tom Warren
knows the exact count I don't but I
think they've made at least three
revisions of Windows 8 yeah
and now with Windows 10 there's going to
be another one that are basically
backpedaling from the original concept
of Windows 8 here's the here's the short
my short point of view on Windows 10
which is not about the quality of
Windows 10 Windows 10 is designed much
more for reviving their phone than for
uh improving pcs although and that I'm
not saying won't improve PCs but pcs are
not a market that's growing nearly as
fast as phones and so the phones is
really crucial them they have a
universal app format so if you are a
developer Lauren and you decide to make
a Windows a Windows 10 right and the
windows developer you are worst user
story you are that's what I do my
Saturday
I know many developers who listen is not
your real activity is way down cuz of
the cat huh but anyway so yeah here's
their idea mm-hmm get everybody to
upgrade to Windows 10 on the PC of which
there are hundreds of millions in there
install base I don't know the exact
number actually I think they promised a
billion devices right yeah billion and
once you upgrade on the PC then there
exists a Windows 10 app that can also
run on the phone right thing that all of
a sudden the Windows Phones it's the
same Excel bunch of code right right
have a whole bunch of apps and that's
been one of their big problems with
phones here's the interesting thing
historically Microsoft has never cared
about upgrading to new versions of
Windows it's been about 10% of their
windows business it's been difficult
because the hardware didn't support the
new version of Windows we've all tried
it we all know this
it's a usually a good column for
reviewers will probably do it again and
uh but this time they and so they
they've just not cared about it plus
their partner Intel and their om
partners like Dell they wanted an HP
they wanted you to go out buy a new PC
anyway this time microsoft's interests
in the phone which are such a strategic
product requires them to get all these
hundreds of millions of people with pcs
to upgrade to Windows 10
so that developers will say ok there's a
huge market for my right Windows 10 app
I'm going to be really interested to see
how many people are going to want to do
that is it going to be easy all that so
this is like
yeah tell us why you sure about your
surface which one do you have I have the
original surface such a troll that was
built on our arm and I bought it because
it was the first computer not counting
the Xbox I mean the first standard
computer that Microsoft had ever made
and I think they did a good job on the
hardware on it they did and not the
software but they did a good job on the
hardware and I also thought it was smart
to do it on arm I thought it was dumb to
call Artie and I thought it was dumb to
put a Windows desktop on it they should
have taken those office apps and let
them be full screen like they are used
to with the tablet and by not having the
desktop they wouldn't have had the
problem of people thinking they could
just put regular Windows wraps on there
I mean I I think they should our
listeners totally note I think but I
think they should have called it Metro
and it should have been basically their
answer the iPod or the iPad you and I
completely 100% reimburse we should send
the show I don't know if like that is
the worst jeez any Microsoft products
line I've been using the Microsoft
Surface 3 being in a relatively
inexpensive one that they put out a
short while ago that runs on an atom
processor and it's really it's really
very slow is my observation so far so
I'm not I don't love it it's not the
kind of product you're gonna like you
know run heavy apps like Photoshop off
of and do all your heavy multimedia work
on I think this desktop apps thing to
drive the phone is is a when while said
this to me yesterday it's the most
counterintuitive thing to think about
Microsoft ever that they're going to use
their desktop install base to court
developers and a writing phone apps is I
mean that is a like a jujitsu move no
but that's absolutely I'm not making
that up but what is crazy to me is I
don't know that mobile developers are
racing the right test top apps I think
they're going to say just open a browser
just let it render me necessarily mobile
dabei so in other words they want a
better I mean maybe I'm wrong about this
example but let's say they want a better
Facebook app so Facebook which typically
I guess doesn't have absence
say yeah open your browser like do
better job of html5 years old so maybe
this will be a spectacular fail maybe
that's a strategies think strategies
take their strengths which is the kind
of moribund PC market but still with a
large installed base and use that to to
let to do this jiu-jitsu to leverage it
over to phones that's I mean it and
we're gonna watch that drama and see
what happened and I would actually love
I mean I you know it's funny I have this
like MacBook Pro sitting here mostly
it's running with us right i Walt I both
use mail plane mail plane is basically
Safari with some stuff I just started
using mail plane right I've got slack
open slack as a web app it's an app but
it's definitely running a web view in
the background and then it's just chrome
tabs for days and that's what's like
what's open on this computer right now
and I it's it's a really fancy
Chromebook it's very good it's Beauty
way from Highgate but do you do you use
any oh oh we say one more thing do the
wrap-up meet your rep I know I you guys
gone but I'm gonna leave time is it and
then five and on Twitter it'll be walk
walked out on Nilay hey you know what
here's the thing I know about great
television and great radio you got a
stage some stunts you gotta get the
people talking you gotta give them
something good
well we do have one thing to mention
that we yeah get to a train which is
that recode has been working on its own
radio show
yes a while now and so on July 8th we
are going to be launching recode radio
which we're very excited about and we're
