verge these are under armours first
connected sneakers they're the speedform
Gemini 2 and they're connected sneakers
they have sensors in them these are not
the world's first connected sneakers you
might remember the days of Nike shoe
pods maybe you've used one of those but
this is similar to that idea there is an
accelerometer in the right shoe and that
will measure your steps and to an extent
distance although they aren't GPS in
them or anything the shoe will store up
to five runs and then a sixth run it
will override one of the earlier runs
and then he's actually connect with
Under Armour's Matt might run app and
share all of your run data to that app
so these cross $150 they're shipping in
late February I've been wearing them
actually for the past couple weeks I
just say they're pretty comfortable
they're light they're the first Under
Armor sneakers that I've worn and I
think I like them more just for how they
feel than I do for the tracking
capabilities there you have it Under
Armour connected sneakers</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
