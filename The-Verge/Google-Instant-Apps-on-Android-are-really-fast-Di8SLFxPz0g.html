Google i/o the beautiful shoreline
amphitheater were outside and one of the
things that Google announced today that
I'm most excited about is something
called instant apps it means that you
could have an app without having to go
through the rigmarole of installing it
let's go take a look imagine you need up
an app for a parking meter you don't
want to install it that's a hassle
you're never going to use it again but
imagine there's an NFC chip thing here
you tap the NFC and it instantly loads
the entire app complete with Android pay
fully supported you just pay for your
parking go on your way and you don't
have an app cluttering up your drawer
later so here's another example it's an
app called jumper and so you click on
this you might expect a webpage but
instead what happens is it loads up the
jumper app and it's really really
responsive so this is only the part of
the app that you need and it's full
Android so for example I can click view
on map and you get a Google map
experience but with jumpers overlay on
top of it and it's actually really
impressive now the one thing you can do
is if you really do like the app you
will be able to pull down a notification
and install it but for right now if you
don't want it back you just hit the back
button and the app is gone so instant
apps are only working with a very select
few app developers right now but other
app developers can try it out learn how
to use it and when it eventually rolls
out officially a lot of people are gonna
be able to use it now Google actually
serves these apps directly from their
own servers which is interesting the
other like just really exciting thing
about instant apps is it kind of changes
the nature of a URL usually when you go
to a web app doing it in the browser
it's kind of slow it doesn't have access
to the entire device but an instant app
is almost as fast as a webpage if not
faster you're in a web page and it gives
you a whole lot of app stuff that you
couldn't otherwise do so I'm really
excited to see how it works and I'm
really excited to see whether or not a
lot of people are going to get on board
and start using</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
