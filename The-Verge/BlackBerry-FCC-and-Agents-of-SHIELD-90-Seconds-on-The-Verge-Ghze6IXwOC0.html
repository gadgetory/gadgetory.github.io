Robertson and although Katy Perry might
have the most Twitter followers she has
nothing on the Foursquare ambassador of
RVs this is 90 seconds on the verge
blackberry CEO thorsten heins is out the
company has raised 1 billion dollars
from a group of investors including
Fairfax Financial who was originally
supposed to buy the company outright
this is no longer the case Heinz will be
replaced by interim CEO John Chen Chen
says that despite us growing losses he
has no intention of shutting down
BlackBerry's handset division and he
believes the company can stay to turn
around Sean isn't the only new leader in
town Tom Wheeler was sworn in this
morning as the new chair of the FCC he
replaces interim chair mignon Clyburn
who had a small but ridiculously
productive six months to Clarence signed
off on sprint buying clearwire and
Softbank buying sprint but don't worry
about Clyburn she'll stay on the FCC's
board as a commissioner until 2017 and
finally you better see the new Thor
movie if you want to understand exactly
what's going on in Marvel's TV show the
november nineteenth episode of abc's
agents of shield is set to take place in
the aftermath of thor the dark world
which will hit us theaters this Friday
the move is similar to Marvel strategy
of using one film to set up or promote
another but unlike the film it doesn't
appear that Chris Hemsworth or Natalie
Portman will be making cameos on the
small screen meanwhile al roker will not
be making a today show crossover
appearance in the upcoming Hunger Games
movie that's it for today's top stories
coming up tomorrow I continue to try to
get monster mash out of my head November
