in a two-hour keynote at the worldwide
developers conference here's a quick
recap I'm Nathan side and this is 90
seconds on the verge the next OS 10 has
a name and it's Yosemite coming out this
fall as a free upgrade as expected the
design language is more in line with the
new iOS with flatter icons and sharper
corners the OS 10 and iOS integration is
also deeper than ever handoff syncs your
work across devices while airdrop now
works across OS 10 and iOS there's also
iCloud Drive an online file storage
system similar to Dropbox one of the
biggest surprises coming is the
integration of SMS and even phone calls
in OS 10 hey doctor you're on
speakerphone with real my Mac so now
let's talk iOS 8 the visuals remain the
same but functionally with interactive
notifications you can now reply to
messages without switching apps quick
type is Apple's new keyboard but if you
don't like it iOS finally allows for
third-party keyboards like swype then
there's the aptly named help kit and
home kit Apple has a lot of partners
here for both we imagine it'll get more
interesting later this year for
developers apples now letting apps talk
to one another imagine applying visco
filters right into the new Photos app or
letting Bing translate a website in
safari but the biggest announcement is
probably the least consumer friendly
Swift is Apple's brand new programming
language and it's a lot faster than
objective-c while many may not
understand the full extent of that
announcement it was the one that easily
got the biggest cheer of the keynote
there's a lot more on WWDC and for that
check out the verge coming up I unveil
Freud all the new programming language
you can use with your invisible friend I
really need human interaction</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
