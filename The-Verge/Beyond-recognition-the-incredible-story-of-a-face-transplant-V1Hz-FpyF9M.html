all day my name is Karthik on 44 I'll be
45 the last day in May I was a
registered nurse up until 2007
I had two children two daughters Lysa
I was just shocked
I guess shocked the word shocked that it
was happening when he ended up squirting
lie on me I didn't know that it was lie
at the time so I didn't know what it was
and the threat Nisar I cast out the last
time I actually thought was the only
time I saw the death you did I actually
thought he'd put something on me he's
gonna let me on fire that was the only
thing I could think of otherwise he was
flirting something on me which to light
me on fire so that's the only known that
that was really heavy in my heart cuz I
thought oh I knock until to see night
change again so when I woke up that last
time when I heard the police and yell I
was so happy inside because I didn't die
he didn't put me on fire I was still
here so ii knew I was gonna live and the
thought of death never occurred to me
again
sooo it all together occurred to me that
I'd die
what happens with deep chemical burns is
that unfortunately lie more than acid
tends to penetrate into the tissues as
it sort of liquifies along the way and
it damaged
Carmen's skin of the entire face and
most of the scalp but more importantly
it damaged the deeper structures of the
face as well she had something like 55
operations just to get through the acute
phase of the injury from the burn to
being essentially healed but then
multiple reconstructive operations as
well to loosen up some of the tightness
especially on the neck where she had
numerous operations I was calling him
adult 9s an adult I got other things and
that's what he mentioned to need a dog
to see if I was interested in being a
candidate for the face transplants well
the first thing I considered I said to
you is there any way simulus Ernie that
you can turn the face all the way down
to replace my neck because that was my
biggest thing I wouldn't go through it
if I was just gonna have the same stars
and same tone and my neck so he said he
thought he could he could do it all the
way back tonight Razia which you can see
he did and that would get rid of all the
scars at night act the second thing was
how much snow her function would I had
in nine days because at the time before
the face transplant I didn't have that
much function I get had eyelids
I couldn't blink I just had a hole in
this I feel you could just feel a hole
where I could look out and see you
we had the Karman listed since I believe
it was the early December of 2011
and actually a couple of weeks after her
listing we got a potential donor but
ultimately failed for other reasons but
then there was essentially entire year
of no offers meaning that there was not
even a reasonably feasible match for her
and that period of time was obviously
very long for Carmen and and somewhat
frustrating I can imagine
so 14 months from her time of listing we
finally got a call about a donor that
wasn't perfect but was the best we have
seen in 14 months
my mom's name is Cheryl dinelli writer
that's her smile that's a big smile
we had a very unique relationship I feel
I didn't really know anybody else who
had one like us we I lost my father when
I was very young when she lost the love
of her life to a drunk driver and I was
2 years old and she was 27 so since then
there was this we're very attached
she took really good care of her body
and unfortunately had high blood
pressure within the last few years and
wasn't on Western medication she was
seeing a Vietnamese doctor he was
growing her teas and I've seen him too
and he's worked miracles for me and for
her but this time it wasn't cutting it
so she died of a stroke three months ago
almost of the day dr. Tony Hawk called
me I went on a Wednesday afternoon and
right before I went to piano lessons
instead we had a potential donor she's a
little older than what I said I wanted
somebody live in five years of my age
especially on the higher end
da-dum he said she's a little older
she's 56 and he said night I wanted to
ask you with that so teri because I
really think she might be a good enough
night and I said okay then 56 is song if
you think that that's a real potential
that this could happen and he said yes
so then he called me again at 11:30 that
night and said the family said yes her
face looks great or do you want to do it
and then I said yes so he said busier
title r8m Wow well bats or a endless
Valentine's Day the day of love
did they have give in to get yes so to
me that was nice gift
so I I knew it and I heard it would work
out so I just quickly back
the face is recovered by essentially
going through steps of surgical steps in
a sequence that allow us to get the
proper nerves muscles cartilage bone
whatever is needed to replace on the
recipient and the tricky part of the
recovery is that the unit ultimately has
to stay alive from vessels that cannot
be injured and they are fairly small and
they branch extensively so it's a
somewhat tedious but also high-stake
part of the operation if you make a bad
cut you can lose everything
after surgery you know I was in the
hospital for six weeks
and I really didn't I didn't know the
donors man I didn't know her name I
didn't know anything about her other
than the fact that she was 56 you know I
didn't know anything about her and I
really wanted to know because I talked
to her and I you know it's hard I didn't
know what to call her
so you know those kinds of thing that I
really wanted to know a lot about her
you know who she was what what she
you know what she's lived in you know
what what made her happy like me to cry
those kinds of things I was really
interested that I respect the family you
know the family's rights and the
family's grief that they were going
through so I just put it in the back of
my mind and I said well I hope and the
next year or two I get to meet the
family third I was coming down teased a
certain I appointments and then staying
older for the press conference on
Wednesday so they they gave me a 24-hour
notice or she wants to meet you and I
was thrilled I was nervous I didn't I
didn't know what to expect I'm you know
I get told what to say I could tell how
to act so I just sort of all you just
sort of go with the flow you don't worry
about it and then as soon as I met her
it was just so easy she was just so
beautiful and so accepting and and just
so peaceful that she made it it was
really easy to talk to her I looked at
her face and and Carman know and she's
and I said can I touch it and she said
you can do whatever you want to my face
my first thought was well I'm gonna
smooch you on the lips so at some point
we didn't do it then but she gave me a
couple of pictures another and and she
told me a lot of doubter
and it just it just made me feel even
better you know it made me feel like you
know she's still she's still here
because I've got her face so certain
Orinda I
that's just really nice third Narenda to
have that in her life it was more like a
sci-fi novel at that point I was like
wow you can actually do that and I have
many questions one being you know I know
this might be a stupid question but is
her face going to maybe sit gonna look
like my mother and they said they said
no they said everyone has different bone
structures and so in muscle structure so
it was gonna mold to her face it
definitely looked like her and I guess
this it was good to hear that at the
time
I don't know how it would have felt to
have known that there's like a mom clone
walking around but even if I did I maybe
I would feel the same way just lucky I
have to see like it to see her again I
had forgotten what it was like to look
not normal and the first time I would
into the grocery store nobody looked at
me and and that that was I noticed no
that he looked at me and it was like
well that's sort of really nice so then
I asked her I got the face transplant
did I really noticed about looking nor
nor know and having people say oh your
God you look great your diesel so on I
and I hadn't heard that in years so that
was that really sort of caught me by
surprise she said I wasn't thinking
about the physical looks anymore
I'd sort of you know lived on from that
so that was actually a pleasant surprise
well I started taking piano lessons in
December and he was my piano teacher
down at the local dude out music well I
was I was impressed with her condition
in which she's been through and what she
wanted to do that she wanted to move on
with a life and live and live like she
means it I wasn't thinking they're not
having a relationship now I felt I was
ready for one because I've done all this
work I'd come so far I was ready to
share my life again I wanted to be happy
like everybody else regardless under
what I look like I never felt I got a
new and I never contemplated not looking
like that again
after all the seeking and searching I
did was in to find out for myself why I
was here as a human and a lot life is
really adult to me I realized that all
these events negative and positive are
all meant to to tell us to a new place
are all knit to tell us to do the Chito
looking really want to be so cerny not
to forgive is only hurting me it's not
hurting him he's already hurt in his own
way he's already created his own life
nothing I can I do is gonna change him
it's easy to blame someone like him that
it doesn't help
you
why so long
a hard-line
there's always
it brings me joy to see Carmen sharing
her story with many people and she's
inspiring many people that's what my mom
always wanted to do I don't have any big
plans or you know so much because I
never know what's gonna happen because
look at the turn my life has taken I
knew one another than he does to guess
that the only thing I want to do is to
share my story meet people a lot of you
know a lot of people and help down the
desk I can that's what I want to do I
want to pay it forward for all the good
that people had given me she's my friend
and I fell in love with her and I told
her I'm a hundred percent behind you I
have been and I will be
yeah
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
