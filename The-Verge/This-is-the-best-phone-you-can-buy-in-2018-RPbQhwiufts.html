gadget in your life is your phone it's
everything it's communication
information and payment gaming
navigation it's really hard to think
about life without a phone in at this
point so picking the right phone is all
that much more important because this is
the thing that you're gonna be looking
at the most over the next one two maybe
even three years now here's the brutal
honest truth even though the phones have
been a thing for over a decade there
still isn't a perfect smartphone there
isn't even a phone that I could say will
be perfect for everyone's needs there
will always be something about whatever
phone you buy that annoys you or doesn't
work or you don't like but there is a
recommendation I can make for most
people who want a good phone with a
great camera a great display great
performance easy and simple to use
software and a great support structure
and if that doesn't work for you you've
got a bunch of alternatives to talk
about too so let's roll those graphics
the best phone for most people looking
to buy something that will still be
modern and fresh a couple of years from
now is Apple's iPhone 10 as a great
display great camera wicked fast
performance a great support structure
from Apple and it has forward-looking
features and design that won't feel
stale next year now the iPhone 10 is not
the best phone in a bunch of specific
categories and it's definitely not
perfect as an all-glass design that will
definitely break when you drop it it's
face ID login system is not as fast or
convenient as a fingerprint scanner and
it doesn't have a headphone jack which
is still pain-in-the-ass to live with
and oh yeah it starts at a thousand
freaking bucks which basically means
it's going to be the most expensive
phone you've ever purchased
now you can soften the blow of that
price if you buy the phone on a payment
plan from Apple or your carrier but that
doesn't change the fact that the iPhone
10 is really pricey but that price is
worth it because you get a big
edge-to-edge display that still fits in
one hand as a gesture control system
that's by far the most fun way to
navigate a smartphone and it has fast
performance with a reliable battery life
overall the iPhone 10 has the best
complete package for most people so what
about the iPhone II or iPhone II plus if
you must have an iPhone and you don't
want to pony up for the 10 the eight or
eight plus are cheaper but they don't
have the tens new design or display and
they're gonna feel old and dated far
quicker but what if you don't want to
spend a grand on a phone
or you don't want an iPhone or maybe you
do want a headphone jack for the best
Android phone for most people a
recommendation is Samsung's Galaxy S 9
or s 9 Plus which sells for between 720
and 840 bucks
the Samsung's have great design great
performance great cameras they're
available at every carrier and they have
a strong ecosystem of accessories
available and yeah they've got a
headphone jack which lots of phones
don't have anymore now they're not the
overall best phones because Apple still
has a far better support network and the
iPhone 10 edges out the Samsung's in a
number of areas especially when it comes
to software but there's still great
devices that I really have no hesitation
recommending so at this point you're
probably wondering why I'm not
recommending that Google pixel to excel
or the one plus six or whatever your
favorite phone at the moment is so let's
talk about them now the pixel 2 and 2 XL
have the best software you can get any
Android phone they're made by Google
they've the best cameras on any phone
period and they get updates direct from
Google so they're always fresh but
they're only available to purchase from
one carrier Verizon they don't have the
support system of Apple or even Samsung
and they have other hardware issues like
a lower quality screen that makes them a
bit tough to recommend without
reservations but if none of those things
are a problem for you then go nuts
you'll love a pixel and oneplus is new
one plus six is the current value King
and smartphone so you simply can't get a
better deal for performance it's
literally half the price of an iPhone 10
but you do give up a lot for that
it's cameras are nowhere near as good it
doesn't work on half the carrier's here
in the US and one plus the support is
definitely inferior to in stablish
makers like Apple or Samsung then
there's lots of other phones with
specific niches like LG's g7 which gives
you a lot of screen in a relatively
small package or HD sees you 12 that has
four cameras or Huawei's p20 pro that
has an equally ridiculous camera system
that can take really stunning shots
Samsung's Note II it has a whole legion
of fans that swear by its extra large
screen and s-pen capability but none of
those phones are the best overall
because they might have bad software
weak battery life and two big design or
just weird design things like these fake
buttons on the HTC so while you'll never
hear me say that this is the perfect
phone what I will say is that if you're
looking to buy a phone now that's
last two or three years then you should
buy the Apple iPhone 10 hey thanks for
