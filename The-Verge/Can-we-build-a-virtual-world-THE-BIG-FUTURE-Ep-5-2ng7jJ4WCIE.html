as futuristic as we hoped we don't just
want data we want to hang out in an
actual alternate universe Metaverse
cyberspace whatever so now the virtual
reality is coming back people have
started wondering again what would it
take to make you really feel like you
were in a place not just looking at it
how could you create an imaginary world
as good as the real one so let's forget
about virtual food surround sound
smellivision since the sixties VR
headsets you know like the ones in the
lawnmower man have been the most popular
way to hijack your eyes when you put
something on like the oculus rift you're
looking at a flat screen through
magnifying glasses but what you see is a
3d image that fills up almost your
entire field of view and moves when your
head does it's pretty bulky right now
but ideally the same thing could be
projected under regular glasses or even
straight onto your retina for touch
you've got all kinds of options from
electrical fields that trick your skin
into feeling different textures - motor
powered gloves that push back on your
fingers to make it seem like you're
holding something people who spent a lot
of time I'm just making VR that's not
obviously distractingly unrealistic and
it's not clear we actually can make
something that's literally
indistinguishable from real life
unfortunately it doesn't take a perfect
imitation to fool your brain even if the
world doesn't look perfect if it
responds well enough when you move we
can start feeling like we're actually in
it
granted we still have basically no idea
what moving around naturally in virtual
space looks like I mean do you use a
controller do you wave your arms do you
strap yourself into a treadmill or a
giant hamster ball it's easier to create
specific situations like learning how to
fly a plane or sitting in a room full of
spiders which is something people can do
right now if you want to get over a
phobia if you find a way to manipulate
our sense of balance and motion the way
that we manipulate our eyes right now
we'll be a lot closer to our dream in
the actual virtual world so then there's
the question of what a populated
Metaverse would look like it's easy to
see just a cruller version of second
life and minecraft but it could go
further than that you've ever watched
somebody do something
stupid and kind of awesome on YouTube
imagine becoming them and then stringing
your own crazy stunt just like the
Internet hasn't replaced our offline
lives okay it hasn't completely replaced
them the virtual world could end up
being a place we go to make the real one
better all corporations could trap us
there while they harvest our organs who
knows it's a wide-open field</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
