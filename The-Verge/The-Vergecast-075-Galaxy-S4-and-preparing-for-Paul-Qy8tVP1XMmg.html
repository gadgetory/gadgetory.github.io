I mean what what is what is that what do
you think the first thing you'll do when
you have access to the Internet will be
like like literally the very first thing
will you check your email no you check
Twitter I mean I've got to kind of
planned out but I don't I don't want to
ruin the surprise okay I've got like you
know people have asked me that enough
now and like started formulate a plan
yeah like I think it's gonna get
improvisational pretty quick yeah it's
probably gonna be a lot of Twitter
you're kind of an improv expert that's
right you sure
of a guy who thinks on his feet yeah you
know you put you in a put you in front
of a group of people right you never
know what's gonna happen next
juggling body I like to play Wallace to
tell me a story using a variety of props
body shots I'd you know I did something
I did some body shot acting classes in
in high school where each like you like
you are like a birthday present so I
could convey that can you through motion
about some of that not really right now
is that exactly you're a box so you do
know like like I mean like what you're
trying to convey is linear on what it is
what is to be a gift you know you know
it it's I feel like I know what it's
like for you to be a gift
no everyday hmm thank you yeah yeah so I
took that for me it's like you're like a
tie and a pair of socks
and like man I really wanted a new
Nintendo me for me you're the you're the
diamond ring from Zales that I've been
with from K ok every can we get to Z
we've been a hell of a week last week
look at we have a lot of phone system
every time every time like some sort of
a notification hits Neil I I know
because like this whole table starts
vibrating was actually free I'm in the
middle of a period of great in this
except for this GS 400 she's just here
so you can play with it but I'm in the
middle of a period of great indecision
there should be no indecision well we
can talk about it we should start
however with Apple this week because W
DC was yes so we had this you know we
had this tech news is slowed down yeah
we knew then we're about to fire right
back up and we had this couple of weeks
obviously the last week was dominated by
the Boston bombing news and and you knew
that your IO is coming and WDC yeah now
we got the WWC invite June what's the
date June 10th June 10th
did I say that right yeah it's the 10th
well so let's but the week started I
think this is what the week started with
apples earnings right you do that yes I
just just did a high-level the week
started apples earnings
yeah like hotly-anticipated earnings
yeah
you know there's a lot of rumors that
iPhone demand was low yeah that Tim Cook
was not gonna you know they every we had
a joke that every quarter of raffle was
always a record quarter right like I
mean I've never up ten years like 10
years like I'm rewriting the headline
out of the post rival good quarter yeah
and this one was decidedly not right and
that just the top line out of it is okay
it did okay they made billions of
dollars in profit but the top line based
on can you turn down my my earpiece a
little bit just a little bit loud the
top line is basically iPhone demand has
slowed down they only went up 6.5% they
only sold six point five percent more
iPhones and last time yes like a problem
for them yeah and they basically if not
clap it but not flat but at flattening
the a year ago iPhone demand was up
eighty eight percent right right and the
iPad curve is still up this year sixty
five where this quarter it's sixty five
percent right so this like massive
staggering growth that everyone's used
to from Apple has like definitely slowed
for the iPhone there's obviously a lot
of phone competition going on there's a
lot of questions and then so the call
then the an analyst call Tim Cook opened
it by saying we know everyone's very
frustrated with our share price we know
investors are unhappy we're unhappy too
we've got great new products coming in
the fall and throughout 2014 next year
he said something about categories and
then and then he said twice and this was
actually pretty funny at the very top of
the call he said we have we're very
excited about our range of products we
have now an exciting new product
categories for it for us to go into yeah
which is could be anything and then
there's a Q&amp;amp;A period and jean monster's
been fomenting for an Apple TV for like
decade he's like you could hear like a
quiver in his voice she was like Tim
might did you did you say exciting new
product categories and Cook was like yes
yes Jean that's all I'm saying
Jean was like well I well and then I see
oh TV ad monster so the whole thing here
is it basically and I was I was been
trying to write something about this but
it's hard to it's hard to convey such a
weird feeling but it was basically Tim
Cook who's making promise
we'll find another category of explosive
growth and that good times will come
again right and he's saying we're I know
you're frustrated but don't worry it but
then they're delaying I mean they very
explicitly asked him do you mean there
are no new products coming out until the
fall and he was like well I don't want
to get into timelines but we were very
excited about atomic launches in the
fall yeah which is for I think for Apple
very strange and then the next day they
put out the WWC invite mmm they
explicitly say which is rare we're
excited to have developers here new
versions of iOS and OS 10
you know and then the invite has this
wire design I thought this was the thing
that was notable and people say like
you're they're like oh their designs are
always crazier than the invites you know
the the design of the WDC invite was
typographically very unique and I think
visually I think meant to convey a
Petain playful cleanliness yeah you know
and I think that and they're sort of the
the graphic on it is sort of apps shape
and I don't want to read too much into
because we don't really know if it means
anything or not I thought the typography
typically Apple will do like a Color
Splash or something and then it'll be
Apple typography that you're right
familiar with
I thought the typography and even the
fact that they were using Roman numerals
as opposed to yeah a date you know it's
like this is out of apples brand yeah I
mean I they not in the sense that it's
like very stunning yeah this to me looks
like this to me looks like something
from like a fashion house or you know
something from like a young brand and
we've been here like H&amp;amp;M and we've been
hearing all the stuff about I've is
taking over the software interfacing the
design is getting rid of all the junk so
maybe it doesn't mean anything but maybe
it does maybe I've fired up InDesign
yeah and put together a little oh yeah
the weekend
yeah Johnny I have at home with
Photoshop he's got though he's got the
InDesign trial right and by gum I'm
gonna use it right right and he said by
gum I'm sure by gum but I do think I do
think it's it's you know it could be
indicative of a change I think that we
know that they are at a point now you
know it's tough to argue that whether
you think they need it or not the public
perception is and the user I think many
you
users at least in the in a certain
bucket of users yeah there's a
perception a vocal bucket a bucket that
is like the kind of the forward-thinking
group there's a perception they need to
show something that looks really fresh I
just I wish this wasn't so and I I don't
know what it's like to be a public
company I've never been a public company
but I wish Paul Miller is not traded
I've been buying stalking you for years
I've been thinking about IPO but I just
don't know if I'm ready for it yeah
but this is so investor centered and
like they're so concerned about their
stock price and I know it like hurts
when you lose half of your you know
value but wait I think they need to be
telling users that there's something
cool to come right and give users
something to anticipate and regular
people something they anticipate
especially as people are getting more
clued into these you know upgrade cycles
and as you know Samsung keeps on having
these messages I mean I don't even know
like is the iPhone slowing growth is
that part of like a market saturation
for smart I think I think that's a big
problem in general for the market right
I think people are smartphones and I
think what was really interesting about
the call was he kept on cook kept on
going back to the iPhone 4 he brought
the iPhone 4 more times not called in
the iPhone 5 with a new iPad and he kept
on saying in China and other places
we've made the iPhone 4 cheaper to build
so he can sell it at a lower cost we can
you know maintain our margin and we can
get into the low end of the market which
you know everyone's reading that is like
a sign that Apple will actually build
this cheaper plastic iPhone people yeah
it was weird that he brought it out
several several times I think but I
think the long I sure but there's all
been all this chatter you know you see
that the finance blogs and you know
starting to say oh there's rumors that
people want to ask cook and you know I
think that Apple's problems are not as
severe as they're painted sometimes in
the press but I do think you know they
kind of a painted themselves into this
core I mean and you're bound to do it as
an innovator where they paint and
particularly the way Apple is innovated
in the way they talk about their
innovations and sell their innovations
you know when we interviewed Andy Rubin
we were doing a
when we did the piece on the Nexus 4 and
the Nexus 10 and sort of what was going
on with their program he said something
to me about how it was a hits business
yeah that software design and sort of
creating those products was it was a
hits business and it was all about
what's the next thing you can wow
consumers with like what's next like an
awesome feature they didn't see coming
and you see with Samsung well I know
we're gonna get to the s4 they added all
of these like you know and HTC did the
same thing that's like blinkfeed and
boom sound and all of a sudden you're
supposed to be like whoa the crazy
innovative feature but you know Apple to
their credit did real innovation big
innovation that changed industries and
they paid them you know it's not by
their fault not their fault but they
paying themselves into this corner now
where the consumer is so expectant of
innovation right and so it's so expected
that at these events they will announce
this game-changing thing and the market
has has Ria's react to that you know and
the market is now saying well you
created these incredible products
there's a great something in The
Washington Post that great analysis of
this but the gist is you know you
created these great products you created
an enormous consumer demand competitors
had to spend years playing catch-up to
you right the whole time you were just
making money hand over fist and now
you've got this situation where you
haven't done that in a while well
competitors have caught up right almost
all respects what's interesting is at
2007 Jobs is on stage interesting first
iPhone he says we think we're five years
ahead of everybody right it's six years
later yeah are you still five years
ahead of everybody
and I think the answer is very
conclusively no yeah right and I think
it depends what they come out with in
the fall and in 2014 they could have
some products that might take like one
or two years for people I mean think
they could have a product that we don't
know about the current society I think
that's where I think that's where you
know they have to but yeah that's what
we've always expected from Apple but at
the same time like I feel like they've
been getting trashed for a while that
they can't compete with Android which is
overtaking the market especially you
know outside the US in terms of
profitability right like but now they're
like thrashing on Apple for for these
low profit margins because I have had
many has less profit margins and these
cheap iPhones have less
and by the way and the iPad Mini could
be seen I think rightfully so and
clearly as a response to the demand for
smaller tablets that did not come from
China to do without Apple does not
typically have to do and I think we were
all a little bit surprised that you did
see Apple sort of respond to the market
and the same with the the longer iPhone
no the taller iPhone I mean they
basically were like we made a larger
screen iPhone without sacrificing what
they were doing on the iPhone you know
Cook addressed very gut asked a very
direct question on this call you know
what do you think of the competition the
5-inch screen size is landed it's here
and the answer his answer was so it's an
answer it's like he pulled it out of the
Steve Jobs playbook but unless you're
Steve Jobs you don't get to deliver this
answer he's like there's a lot of
trade-offs there you know we think some
people want the size that's great for
them but we think other things like
white balance and color accuracy and
yeah reflectivity
that's what Arkham and it's no they're
not do you know they're they're looking
at the giant screen on the subway yeah
and they're thinking man I wish my phone
had a bigger stream I'm you know and I
think that that probably is an
indication that they're they'll do
something larger at some point I mean
you know it's one of those that I think
a pelagic it's part of their playbook
that they're going to say we don't do
that then they go and do it because
that's what jobs did so well yeah maybe
but I think Steve Jobs does that he says
you know these larger screens you gotta
have a crazy hand to hold that no normal
you know like he sells it yeah and
cooked just like right off this list of
like other qualities that screens yeah
it's like dude HTC is making a LCD
screen with a higher pixel density than
you that's very very good
right it is bigger but I think like
those exists I want to say something
else about the screens to be bigger I
don't know what you're talking like to
say now is about what Apple's been doing
and talk about the state of the industry
right now and and and one of the things
that I feel like you know a few years
ago particularly at the start of when
the iPhone launched and when we really
started to see the app ecosystem come
together and you saw this huge inter
this interplay of all of these parts of
their ecosystem you know music and video
and apps and it's all like the hub is
it's so obvious what the hub is and how
it all gets pulled together in your
different devices and I feel like as
competitors have caught up to that
they've some I mean I think in some ways
Google has done
a better job in terms of management of
applications they now all off you know
Microsoft offers music and video Google
offers music and video there are more
competitors in the music space than ever
with things like our do and Spotify
right and people's habits are changing
where they're using more streaming
service I think Amazon's up to 30
percent right amazon has their app store
and their devices and their their music
store and video store in Prime and
Netflix and HBO Samsung so there are
five years ahead of every right well but
everybody's like there but also but but
but what's happened in that in that
intervening five years is not only have
people caught up but they've and I won't
say leapfrog but they've altered some of
the ways that we communicated the way
that we think about that stuff and so
it's really interesting now is you look
at the landscape of of you know what is
special about Apple's offering right
because I think you could argue that
their cloud services have yet to be no
it's not sorry I think yes if to their
end user or to their developers their
cloud services are somehow superior to
what the competition is offering you
know and I mean Microsoft and and Google
in this in this aspect but then it's
also you know the App Store is there the
music store is there so it's like in
that sense the services side the
ecosystem side still is excellent well
the cloud it's not like fully modern
yeah it's not fully modern and you have
to think about Apple's aptitude in that
the service on the services side and I
think that it has been slower to develop
and worse in some ways than the
competition and so they have to not only
have this hit of a product but then they
have to also keep explaining and showing
how their ecosystem and how it works is
superior and it's tougher to do that now
that it's but it because it's not
superior I think there's a illustration
my brother adds not much of an
illustration the way the military thinks
about like competitive advantage is you
can be competitive with a country like
if you are if they're one step below you
and technology if they have a lot of
planes and your planes are higher tech
but you have fewer of them you know
you're still competitive right that's a
that's a more you might be able to
outrun them but they can out done you
right you sort of like if you're if
you're two steps above and technology
you just destroy them right
and I think what's happened now is Apple
is about one step behind in technology
but they still have like the mass force
yeah and and I they're just there and I
also think that kind of might be they've
got the numbers but not that right and
so there's just slowly fading and and
but if other people take another step
forward apples really screwed and the
thing is that I think yeah Apple has
still has theoretically
all of the talent no actually really
disagree a lot of the talent that has
put them where they are
right at the top they have senior senior
management is right but I keep hearing
from like Valley companies like
basically why I keep hearing is it's a
little too easy to recruit from Apple
right now really well because what I
what I assume is that those people that
were you know let's say the people that
are still there that we're capable of
creating what we've seen yeah they might
not be able to create what's next and
what I hope is that they have another
good five or ten years in them of cool
new products that I'm gonna be excited
about maybe as an Apple fanboy yeah but
they might not be as wildly successful
as I think that to that point like you
can't and we've been over this before
and I don't think we need to belabor the
point but but you can't you can't
analyze who Apple is right now and what
they do without saying you know it
cannot be overstated how important Steve
Jobs was to the what has what happened
to that company right in the last you
know 10 years in the last you know for
that for up until his death you know
what when he came back the change that
was effected that carried that went all
the way through the AH you know iPod and
iTunes and in into like refining the Mac
line and refining the Mac books and
doing the iPhone in the iPad and and the
App Store I mean that stuff is all you
know it was led by somebody and it was
clearly led by yeah I mean I think we
know was clearly led by Steve Jobs and
you can have the best people in the
world but you need the you really need
the leadership in some ways a leadership
think about all right or and I might
just but you need a second-in-command is
the Trulie Lobby to cook
you know people saying he might be out
be like what a subtle burn might be on
his way out my point is you can't
discount that and you might have the
best people in the world and you might
hope that that that they have the the
next thing but but it's gonna be really
I think it's really really gonna have to
come down to it you know an incredible
mixture of luck and skill right to
duplicate but also the kinds of things
that happen under jobs also those ideas
were kind of pre-internet ideas yeah
well no not the iTunes Store not the App
Store well not iCloud as well think
about iTunes was to rip CDs and sync
them for a long time your iPhone was
still syncing back and forth with iTunes
kind of like your ID I did in Walters
for the iPhone came out with edge
accredited like right no actually speaks
to Paul's point when you think about it
like you know I you know that it was
anyway and it came out without app and
you didn't say you did sync over a cable
and right there but it is true that as
an Internet company they seem much less
agile no I completely agree with that
but I'm saying that stuff right like
they were they believed in internet
delivery before the internet was ready
for now that's true they built the
infrastructure they were first they were
first to that so yeah you know we're not
question this week I've been doing we've
you know had this partnership strike a
Film Festival do you guys know and I did
a bunch of panels this week and one of
the things that came up and one of the
panel's was was their avoidance of
blu-ray as a kind of part of their
strategy to embrace digital downloads
into this go backwards you had blu-ray
music I use a red box yeah and I can get
a blu-ray for like a buck third buddies
red box two blu-rays yeah
and a lot more now and blu-ray still
higher quality than in almost all day
all night streams he didn't get it's
like it's like three dollars cheaper
yeah yeah we I by the way on one of
these panels we talked a lot about this
tecnique the technology and we talked a
lot about 4k we actually had a guy from
Sony who runs their kind of systems you
know the guys who
build the 4k cameras and the TVs they
put his try to put it in the market and
they were talking about delivery and and
and what what they were saying and some
other people in the panel is that the
delivery yes that's right blu-ray still
looks better there's no you know the
artifacting isn't there the kind of like
terrible quality you can get over
streaming yeah but they're saying the
the apparently amongst like film and
video people though common wisdom now is
or conventional wisdom now is that that
compression is the answer it's not that
better compression 1865 yeah and HVAC I
think is the other one yeah we're gonna
have these massive massive amounts of
date the massive amounts of data but
it's all about the compression on the
Netflix had yesterday that was like we
hit it and basically the line there was
we're gonna stream 4k years decades
ahead of the broadcaster so yeah I will
I will switch to that the instant it's
available it's a compression but you're
right now
Redbox has been a superior what I'd like
on Zune stream I mean watch it watch it
dark like a literally dark film like
Blade Runner and over streaming 1080
streaming even on your in the white
house killed yeah and you're just asked
in your best shows in Aereo versus the
blu-ray yeah it's like in not even in
the same I mean I have to say I never
watch blu-rays and I bought I've bought
a few movies recently and I really love
that I want to watch and when you put
them on you kind of like wait my TV can
look like this yeah now so you can
streaming like and on our team it's like
a criterion blu-ray guy like that's what
he watches yeah and it's like you're
right you buy a TV it's like maybe it's
expensive maybe it's not and then you
like put the worst yeah no not just you
want a large acting it's got better
colored right now Halsey and and and by
the way I think that uh you know I have
to say I would never thought I would
become an advocate for blu-ray or
physical but I was talking to a friend
the other day and he was saying that
somebody said to him you know you should
buy the movies that you love on blu-ray
because it's probably the last physical
yeah medium will have of these and it's
like the highest quality they'll be as a
physical I think blue is
a lot like my final yeah I think
eventually CDs will die out cuz you know
get the bit so when you give a higher
quality 1080 it'll be it'll be
completely obsolete right you know once
you go to work I think there we talked
to CS time about 4k blu-rays I think
they will that technology will continue
to expand but I think that they will end
up well it's kind of their nature fork
an itch product you have the fort 4k
blu-rays that are just like my master
you know but or downscaled and then
upscale thank you but there's there's
another like we did talk about this
budgets yes there's another level to the
blu-ray standard can hold more data and
they can be right but still yes but
that's still being that's it they're
arguing it I'm cute in 4k they downscale
it and that's now that's so that's what
the current right right so they're
remastering so that the upscale is
better but they're gonna make a native
blu-ray and they may have native a new
form format what it
the point is phrase at the point is if
you pay more if you want to get the best
version of Blade Runner you can get
right now it's it's on a blu-ray and
it's not anywhere else and so I do I got
I just watched the the final cut of
blu-ray yeah and then the other day I
watched the US theatrical version that's
my is that from what 92 or from original
the original 82 the original 82 yeah
and they re-released at 92 the
director's I've mostly seen the 92
direct which doesn't really neither does
the final I see I'm one of the few that
prefers the narration yeah I'm a sick
person it was a interesting is a very
different film with the narration III I
bought the blu-ray of the the most
recently like the happy ending so the in
the original version it ends with I
don't spoiler alert we're about to ruin
Blair's two endings that don't really
spoil it
yeah there's driving in the desert yeah
and there's getting an elevator down the
desert dry forest rising driving in the
forest and getting into an elevator the
getting to the elevator is considered
the not happy ending right that's the
too bad she won't live
Echo's that's not a spoiler he says it
in the movie right that no but we do you
spoil the ending whenever it if you
don't see Blade Runner why you lose what
are you doing I can tell this is a good
formula right I I think
God prefers the sad ending yeah of
course now do you think do you think all
directors prefer the sadder do you think
he's a replica don't think of the other
because the final cut has really Scott
has said that that he is right for a
dream and the reflective eye and then
the the unicorn origami yeah right right
which is like saying so you think he's a
report is almost as character whose name
now escapes me for some reason knows
that he's a replicant right well have
you read the book I just actually read
the book is totally different and crazy
right right like like there's a part it
has a half way through that book that
that a completely flips its trip it has
like a I would almost say directly
contrary moral to it yes yes yes that's
great I would say sitting in this chair
is a lot like being on crossfire yeah I
know I know by the way way off of Apple
we can there's no debate there so let's
let's move on because you have to here's
the thing here's apples big problem I'm
holding in my hand Oh big no it's a big
big big here again next big problem so
this is a galaxy s4 I'm gonna add just
hand this to Paul because I played with
it a lot and like David reviewed it this
week a lot of other people reviewed it
this week everything about that that's
me no David's David's final word what
does it have to do this thing where it's
inspired by nature dude don't worry
about a church um don't you love
dimensionality David's line was this is
a great phone millions people will buy
it whatever the HTC one is better and
that was a line he did say whatever
whatever I will say that Walt Mossberg
basically said whatever the HTC reviews
you I urge you to look at the HTC One in
the service yeah listen this phone is
it's a it's a very oh what there's a
thing on the side yes just in case you
want more crap do you think you need so
you can hover your finger over and like
in flip what you can't look at that in a
couple days I'll show you some cool
stuff my finger over I think this is a
fine high-end Android device that does
everything you could possibly want an
Android phone to do if you have to buy
the galaxy s4 I don't think there's any
problem so maybe it's not gonna be a
horrible experience
judge you know I got you in fact many
people will buy this phone because
Samsung has just staked out
I think the gallery app just crashed by
the Oh didn't know that nothing crashes
all it's got problems but it's not like
a piece of junk
okay but let's just say this can by
comparison I've been using the one the
FCC won and and I have been you know I
have struggled and and and had
incredible hardship with trying to find
an Android phone yeah that is on 18 T
that has LTE that I'm not basically
disgusted by right and and you know I'm
very sensitive about skinny I've wanted
a stock phone and I you're running apex
though right I have Apex launch right
here because I just don't like their
launcher right but but you know I think
basically everything else there's a few
annoyances on here I think this is the
finest phone may be the finest
smartphone I've ever used no I think a
lot of people agree and I feel that
here's what the camera is it may not be
I will say this I think the iPhone 5 the
camera takes better-looking photos but I
think this takes excellent photos it
works very well in low light yeah and
I've been able to capture some things
that on other phones it's a complete
like no go yeah and and even on the
iPhone in some cases yeah
and it's incredibly fast the screen is
unbelievable and I have so this is a
point of controversy maybe ever except
for my the Droid I have a Droid RAZR Bax
HD kind of that phone is so ugly encoder
max HD which I have let die and not turn
on for the last week that's out yeah
that's has I've been using the one
because it's just like I don't need it
so I have two three responses yes one we
shot for the screen I will say that my
new metric for how good a phone is is
whether or not I let it die
and the phone that I am using most that
I remember to charge the most is it a
first so I'm like I have a warm using
the first I have a one I have an iPhone
I have a first and the first is the
phone I don't like that what are you
looking at he's just did a picture that
let me just you can put yourself in a
heart can you guys see this I mean I was
I was trying to just take a picture of
Josh but it put this heart of me in
there they was testing dual camera so
here's everyone so I agree with you that
I think overall the one as far as like
flagship phones go is
best young I think it's really
interesting that I think HTC is has made
two of the best phones yeah I think the
first is the first I would say saying
but I'll say this about the first I've
become very accustomed to a larger
screen at this point the first seems
smaller the first is basically in a Dave
and I talked about this a bunch on top
shelf which is next this is basically an
Android iPhone that's what if it's it's
no I think it's designed to look like an
I feel like an I first had a great
camera which it does it absolute
miserable if it had a deck and that is a
great camera I would very seriously
consider yeah that as my main fun thing
no but everybody just thinks there's
like zero money and making a small
high-end phone I think they I think well
I think people want larger devices I'll
tell you I said walk but I saw I saw
somebody a director who was on one of my
panels mm-hmm who had a note yeah and
that's really popular say I was like
this is you know here's a cool director
guy John Dalli would you nobody uses the
pen as far as I can tell you I don't
think so maybe sometimes anyhow cool
Hollywood director type smart guy
stylish Qaeda uses an antic phone you
didn't know and yeah he wasn't a big guy
he wasn't like it you know yeah John or
anything I just think it's interesting
how often I see that now yeah I saw
somebody I think they were really in the
big screen and that's so you get back to
your point so my voice lesson is play
David gave the display a ten which had
some controversy because it is like an
AMOLED display I think it should have
been its default its default setting the
colors are really inaccurate like
they're super bright red it's like yes
hyper saturated Samsung it's pentile
everything about this display is
designed for me to hate it and I think
our readers know that I am very against
Penn tile displays I'm not a big fan of
amyloid but if you put that thing in
movie mode where it like the colors get
more accurate yeah and you put it
side-by-side in right now I don't
remember
tonight's Toby and you put it
side-by-side with the one it is
basically impossible to tell them apart
and there's like some slight difference
in color very I mean you have to be like
a color scientist
different so my opinion you should have
to put something in a mode and that's
what that's what David said to me he's
like no one's ever gonna find this menu
III just calibrator them it does above
them yeah and I think people really like
that screen and I I'm some people I'm
the last person is say a pentile AMOLED
screen is really good but that screen is
really good man I have to say Sam
software's Tara we talked about and we
holding this in your hand is off can we
on that something and get into that can
we just talk for a second about
Samsung's software design it sucks your
designers are terrible I'm sorry I'm
sorry I like you know your phone
hardware is fine it's okay whatever
it's very capable but just hire some
designers who have eyes eyeballs was
running a first step I'm sorry like I
like I think this phone is a solid phone
but how am I saying I'm sorry I'm not
sorry our designers are doing a terrible
job of making good looking software you
know really and we deserve better people
deserve better look at what HTC is doing
they stepped up their game they had
pretty bad looking software sorry drew
Bamford yeah your stuff looked kind of
lame in sense for and you know before
that although there was a point where I
was like since it's pretty good-looking
I think it's like say she's always been
trying just a little too hard too hard
on they they pulled it back considerably
and it is best flat now of all things be
hyper amorphous in now it's really fun
right it's flat it's not like abstract
right it just looks okay it just looks
nice it's not offensive you know it's
well-designed and and right the
difference between you know the the one
and they asked for in terms of design is
kind of monumental right I don't think
most consumers are probably going to
care but but they have and so what
Samsung has its engineers doing is
building this laundry list of features
that yeah
like literally as a con in the review
David listed additional features can be
overwhelming yeah it's like do you want
a phone that when you're watching a
video and you just look up for a second
pauses the video and then you look again
and rebuff errs the video blink zone
look you don't need that do you want a
phone that like you can wave your hand
over like maybe I do
blink but if you don't use it the right
way when you put your hand back over it
it like goes back a page to know who's
gonna figure out how to use
it's it's only works in servants working
no it only works like 75 percent of the
time you have to like learn how to use
it so this morning this March day that
is way better than working better than
that's that's way better now that's fine
I will say that the hover stuff is like
you could see the potential for it to be
useful with it so if you have Flipboard
open and you hover your finger over a
story it expands the story onto that
page and then you can like click it ok
and then it opens so that's like
interesting but why don't you just tap
it because maybe you don't want to so
it's like a little preview I'm trying to
be I'm trying I'm trying to find what
the the Silver Lining not working so the
dark storm cloud that is started on Todd
now it should just be on maybe it's turn
on and I mean all you need to know about
Samsung software in their inability to
focus and inability to choose is that
you have the option when you pull down
the notification shade to put up to 18
different toggles in there to try out
the different feature it's ridiculous
and it's like why but you don't there's
an easy mode on this phone you can push
a button and have it go into easy mode
so that like normals can use it yeah
which is ridic
yeah I just think look here's the deal
if this had really beautifully designed
software with all those extra features
yeah if I was if I looked at the UI and
I was like whoa this is really well
thought out and well designed and then
also the hardware was nicer I mean the
hardware to me is kind of I mean I will
say that the one is gross so one is so
so so much nicer from a hardware
perspective this would be one of those
things where like I apologize for the
design but I could do so many cool
things with it but but that I wouldn't
have to apologize you just had look if
you just had to say if it was just the
hardware was like a little bit cheap but
it was wet it was a it was a well
designed cuz I think design wise it's
fine I think if that back were were
aluminum and this band were real bad it
was totally different the back was like
made of what a screen makes it look like
you're this like this Mauer
yeah you know compadre but this is like
this is Samsung it's like what I'm
saying what I'm saying this is what I'm
just saying if the hardware everything
was the same hardware wise but the
software were killer yeah you'd be like
this is a serious like I'm gonna really
think about how much I like the hardware
here because this is a great device
because there are a lot of really cool
interesting features and it's fast and
it's capable and the cameras very good
and the screen looks amazing
but combined with like the shitty
looking software and the crappy hardware
I mean technically speaking the hardware
so I mean the cameras yeah the screen is
good it's fast cameras great action
right the but it's cheap lean kind of
made it feels kind of cheaply made you
know that combined with the software to
me it's like in comparison to the one
which is the exact opposite in every way
there's no there's no competition there
right you know for me and I think that
it for an educated consumer if you go
into a store and you're looking at these
two phones here's the deal they're
basically the same phone I mean they're
both really fast Android phones with the
I believe the same size screen same
resin a little bits just 4.7 yeah this
is I think this will be right at five
four point it's like four nine this is
smaller than that yeah no that's not
possible give me that yeah I think it is
I think they it's four point seven I
think they hit the target of the sure
people are yeah yeah you know why
because um you're right because they
were trying to do it yeah that's my
point is that that I think that the one
is just some superior mice and and and
you know a real really the kind of phone
where you look at the iPhone and now
it's fight it's like funny and by the
way they just they did bite a little bit
of the iPhone with the with the with the
edges on the one why should as I showed
this to back back he has a white iPhone
5 yeah and I showed it to her and I was
like I really love the first and she's
like yeah this is gross
and I showed her the one and she's like
this is super hot and so you don't think
it looks like your I thought she was
like I don't think it's anything like my
- yeah I mean I think there's like an
aesthetic sort of the the the chamfered
edge is is well that's what it I have
another would chamfer in a while it
always makes me smile
this is chamfered edge I've spent that
I've invented we spent years trying to
perfect anyhow it looks like it's in the
same job but like this is the nurse
I'd say this is truly I think maybe the
only phone on the market right now well
that I can put next to an iPhone and say
and by the way I've had a bunch of
people pick this up and say whoever does
it yeah yeah people like random people
are like what's that oh so it's the
first it's really the first I can say
that's on the market right now that that
that either can go head-to-head with or
in some ways best so here's the question
and I really want the black one I need
HTC needs to release it now well here's
the question ya know you can buy an
unlocked LTE version of this which with
no deal with no carrier crap on it for a
575 bucks which is a huge deal worth
every penny so but here's the question
yeah and this is the question yeah so we
I think the tech press he agrees that
HTC is even well in terms of creating
some people wall call has bested Samsung
introduced this product yes is that
going to save H are they gonna actually
sell them Samsung is spending and I
believe the number is literally in the
billions yeah on marketing I think this
and I just don't know that HTC can
compete yeah I just don't know that they
can compete with that market I think
this is gonna be a really great test
because I have stood by me a test of how
we're relevant we all are I stood by a
thesis for a long time that that great
products cell and and bad ones don't and
middling ones can do okay and it's it's
whatever and that can be more based on
marketing but if you want to have a huge
success you did an absolutely great
product and I think an absolutely great
product with even a tiny bit of
marketing can do usually way that you
think that an absolutely great product
even with a with a with a 1% of the
marketing budget of the mediocre provi
okay proud I think I think people give
too much credit to marketing for the
success of things and I think Samsung I
would love that spending of mine to be
validated
I think what's unfortunate for you is
that their their their market presence
and their the power and money they can
put into marketing is the sole reason
they have been a success but the also
the s3 was the best Android phone on the
market for a while I think I think that
that that it was the best Android phone
that was available to everybody on every
I found in the Nexus for Galaxy s3 was
an OK phone it had flaws I don't say
there's a perfect phone but I think it
was the best Android I think when you
walked into the Verizon store right the
galaxy s4 was sitting with a gigantic
screen next to the iPhone and he picked
one yeah an HTC phone at the time was
like the Droid DNA which is like much
bigger right looks crappy that's in
variety but but I'm saying at the
Verizon store and what was the HTC phone
at the AT&amp;amp;T was like the the one
excellence which came out later which
was like you know like the one was a
good phone it didn't have also so now I
just I was just reading that the there's
some supplies constraints on the s4 and
yeah it might be that it sounds like
incredible yesterday so that Sprint and
t-mobile are gonna be later with the s4
okay but spring its spring team oh
that's right doesn't matter but but AT&amp;amp;T
and Verizon here in America are the big
dominant yeah the big shard but is the
HTC One shipping at the same time I
don't know their shipping schedules
these I know the unlock one is is right
now is I think I saw somebody at my
coffee shop using one that's possible
it's delayed I know that the unlocked
one is too late 18 t I believe is
selling them at the moment I don't know
I I would I would so love to be proved
right because it's always bugged me like
this has been an age old thing where
people would like to ride Apple products
like well they're not any good they're
just like they've got you know so much
marketing and stuff like that yeah but
but but you know there's an element of
truth that's here right mean like the I
that's what you people said about the
iPod right and Apple spent billions of
dollars marketing me I'll prove them
wrong to create there and it's still
don't like the best thing it was it was
that it was oh you getting a creative
Rio no it was the best thing but it also
had marketing this is like can you do
with a thing that's pretty good and has
an amazing amount of writing right and I
think the answer is yes I think that
Samsung just blew every other phone
maker out of the water with their last
year of marketing I mean including Apple
right I think Samsung ran the most
effective most interesting set of
campaigns of any put their own maker
baby so maybe a phone that was more
desirable than iPhone 5 because it's
clear
everybody just wants absurdly large
screen well it's not just that but
people know the iPhone they're like okay
I know the iPhone what's next you know
the consumer is very fickle right
there's a certain consumer that's like I
just want like a newer thing and so I
mean just the idea of a doctor they also
first I guess but samsung also smartly
appealed to consumers who they drew a
line and been actually in some ways I
would say Apple helped them draw this
line to lawsuit which the luck with the
lawsuit sure which I think really if we
step back and look at it was a huge was
actually kind of the beginning of the of
Apple's real modern trouble and I know
that it was initiated by Jobs but I
think that that lawsuit which was really
to prove a point
more than anything because the the the
the result was that it did not damage
Samsung's ability to sell product in
America or anywhere else really drew
this line where people were like apples
the big bully who sues God there my
Christine Samsung's the cool young guy
who's like fighting you know big mean
Apple and Samsung played into that with
their ads and Apple kind of like by
cheering their victory oh by the way I'm
not saying they were wrong to do it I'm
just saying that from a market
perspective I think that it hurt them
more than it helped them honestly I
don't think either side has learned
anything yes because I keep I keep
poking around I'm like are you guys
gonna settle there's another lawsuit
coming up yeah right because they filed
Apple the second one against the Nexus
One and all these other phones yeah and
that's a sideshow I was like are you
guys gonna settle this and I keep asking
you know the line I keep getting is
basically if now there's no movement
we're just waiting I mean I really feel
like that so we're gonna go through
another trial hope everybody's ready I
think that's a mistake for everybody
involved but you know nobody ever
listens to me damn I said it the day
that we they went to trials like they're
gonna settle this because the topics me
anotherjob we do there's actually
another huge top know may May 21st new
Xbox to be in my my which which which
you know we've been at pains to not call
the Xbox 720 because we know we have a
pretty good feeling that it is not gonna
be called the Xbox 720 but people are
searching for it 2 rango or like I've
gotten emails from you literally you
don't have any Xbox 720 stuff on your
site I'm like yeah it's because we are
not calling it the Xbox 720 and you're
searching for it not finding that
the new Xbox the next Xbox with a new
Xbox and there's rumors that tonight box
the next box yeah there was a we had a
we were we were trying to come up with a
headline for Tom did a piece today
because kind of like everything we know
about it so far and and we were
struggling to figure out a way like do
we boots a call a 720 do we not I got it
yeah Xbox 720 right
yeah how about just Xbox seven I was
like oh that's great it lines up with
Windows 7 ed with those folks and you
know what you've been off the air so
that works so so so yeah Microsoft
basically said we're doing it may 21st
we're gonna show you our new Xbox YUM
and it's it's very interesting it's it's
you know clearly Sony knew that they
were I feel like Sony knew this was
coming and wanted to beat them to the
punch with the four yeah the page four
which is why they didn't even have a
physical console to show and which I
still find very unusual consoles have
been launched without the physical
console to show they show you something
yeah literally didn't show us anything
and I don't think I've been able to
discuss the PlayStation 3 on this
podcast yeah yeah the PlayStation 4 we
haven't probably talked about too much
but yeah I think we did well I am I am
actually I did really bullish on it
why CPC they built the piece yeah they
don't the PM right you're excited
because it's like it's PC because
because global the most exciting most
fun thing that I've had in gaming
recently he's basically twitch TV is
people stream not recently
well not for a year but but in recent
years that's so crazy
yeah is people streaming games and
sharing their experiences in different
ways and and you know there's a share
button
I know that's why I'm excited about the
place that we finally gaming is finally
about to get social
yes and you know what like I really
ain't getting social again do I play
fewer games than ever
I hate social games I love playing by
myself also also basically also this
constants worst kid on the playground
this console generation this console
generation is totally playing in T
Valve's hands basically because they're
gonna be a PC but they'll be a little
more open and it will be awesome for
alpha to be big but I see issues well
it's you know it's got an AMD x86 CPU
it's obvious
yeah right so very PC base as well
mmm combines obviously the graphics with
AMD so the GPU and CPU it's the same
chip that Sony is using which is crazy
which graphics or processor should I be
a little bit aim it's the same on 100
same board should I be a little bit
should I be a little bit bummed that
we're just getting like gaming pcs like
I could build this right now right yeah
basically right it's got a blu-ray drive
it's got a hard drives that's right I
actually have been you know I had Evan
Rogers put together a list for me
because I want to build a gaming PC
right and he put together pretty good
list and I have to say like I'm planning
on doing this in the near future but I
am a little bummed I guess the one thing
about like the ps3 was you know Sony was
like super computer you know we are
creating a new architecture that the
Army's gonna put a thousand the whole
reason this is happening is exactly
because of what happened with the
PlayStation 3 where basically the Xbox
360 is more successful so you design
your game targeting the Xbox 360 and
then you port it to the PlayStation 3 so
it typically looks a little worse unless
you do some extra work that's that's
even ya know and now it's like pretty
even yeah but I think the decade later
its yeah the thing that sucks though is
is but but is also why consoles I think
will still be pretty successful is by
having such a specific hardware target
and this is
awesome that it's the exact same yeah is
is that that developers will be able to
really just hone just hone and hone and
hone and okay you've loved it when
developers home man those developers
gonna home but like the graphics on like
the most recent console games yeah are
about as good as some of the best
graphics on the PC and no matter how
powerful your computer is other than the
frame rate and resolution and some extra
little effects you can get on the PC the
basic concept of the graphics is all
constrained by the consoles and the
consoles have gotten so much better and
I think having this single hardware
target always knowing what you're going
for the graphics so let me get into some
other stuff here cuz that's great but
then it's gonna have a connect to it's
gonna have a new operating system
obviously that is more focused on
entertainment and then the big piece the
huge controversial got a Microsoft
employee fired piece for saying it's
going to be contributed to it's going to
be always on with permanent DRM so
always connect to the internet so much
Xbox 360 this year and that would not
have worked right Microsoft director
Adam Morrison got on Twitter sorry I
don't get the drama over having it
always on console he said before adding
a hashtag deal with it every Microsoft
issued a statement did that guy they
follow I apologize for him in orth
immediately I open it spilling the beans
how do you how does that work I mean I
guess at this point it's kind of hard to
imagine the next box experience without
the internet yeah like I can't imagine
I'm always they don't not be it not be
online like right I mean I know you can
imagine it but it's just so unusual it's
like your computer without the internet
right so I kind of get it I mean when
they say always-on that just means but
these needs acai right so I think that
might be the big and maybe this is just
the game's community being crazy mmm the
big piece is that Microsoft and Sony
antennae have always hated used game
sail
yeah so the the step one is you're
always on step two is you have to
activate your game with a code when you
like just like EA games yeah to use the
way you buy an activation code if you
buy a used game and then the last step
is you're just gonna do all the games
online you're gonna kill the use game
they'll do streaming game gaming I mean
Sony is leaning into it I can't imagine
Microsoft I've got to say I'm gonna say
it you've got the idea of being able to
say I want to play you know what's again
that they they previewed at the
PlayStation 4 event can you think of one
probably a Batman game where you kill
thing I know it's probably said you know
they were all games where you kill
things yeah don't worry about that as a
new Killzone yeah it kills out you know
kills that which I've never played any
Killzone it's by the way but you can
start playing it straight a wallets
downloading in the back you can be like
I wanna I'm gonna buy the new Killzone
play and then you're like five minutes
later you're actually playing the game
you're not downloading a multi gig file
and waiting for it that to me is kind of
mind-blowing it's like the funny thing
about on live and these streaming should
get Gaikai you know when you first heard
about the one we've been talking about
them that you assume a a particular type
of use which is I'm gonna get their
service as a separate thing I'm gonna
stream games on the Gaikai controller or
whatever and you kind of thought of it
is this as its own thing when you think
about it apply to the ecosystem of the
PlayStation or the Xbox so much more
scene it's a crazy amazing new idea and
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I
like it
mmm-hmm I'm not I'm so so you to say by
the players with the DRM stuff it's
annoying right now that you get these
codes and you have to enter so at least
would be nice like if this is what we're
it's a lesser of two evils if this is
where we're going with the industry at
least it sounds like Microsoft will deal
with all the deal with it now the hash
tag deal with it yeah for all your
activation codes so that's a nice
that's nice but they just there's been
so much I mean I think this speaks to
fundamentally what we've been talking
about like I don't think you can sell a
computer anymore and be like the
Internet plugs into it I don't think you
install a game console be like the
Internet plugs into it I don't know you
in soft phone and be like you can open
the App Store if you want but also right
now like I think ultimately you had the
services have to be integrated into the
entire experience both at both companies
are going and it just it speaks even
more to the need for readily available
broadband consistent broadband none non
throttled yea or lightly throttled so I
just ten minutes I just I just got
internet back at my apartment
what yeah how do you know it works that
well I don't follow the cable in your
wall you fall it is just hanging anyways
like so I shopped around which I've done
so many times in my life yeah we've all
been there would you book the only
things I can get are like I can get um
was it Time Warner or leap Wireless or
clear what is it clear
hang it clear I can get four rise in DSL
which is still a slow as it's always
been it's like 1.5 I don't know it's so
slow and I can get Time Warner do your
diet I can get doc says I went with like
the 15 down here full one up you're full
but it's just like it's so annoying cuz
it's like you should be a doctor for
like it's it's probably it's a hundred
bucks a month yeah yeah I think it would
be like for me compared to my plant it'd
be like 50 or $60 more than I like I
have doctors and I think it's great I'm
so money buying by being really slow on
the internet so we'll see if I can
tolerate
I'm happy to hear that good thing you'll
be in the office every day I also got a
phone Oh which I can't really use yet
either but you guys will get triple play
hey I only got double play Oh what oh
you got a landline phone yeah do you add
cable but it's point no I don't watch I
don't want cable okay but in here that
cable the next great yeah no I've got
the next Paul van antenna I get really
great CBS what else is on our list of
topics do you actually done actually
John can you tell me do we have the
video so while we're on the subject
welcome back Paul we've prepared for you
a bit of a contest because I have no
idea what you're gonna do when you come
back on the internet and I think I can't
think of a week actually the way this
contest is going in the early running I
was worried oh god the same thought guys
back on the internet and he went
homeless so Paul's gonna come back
online
Wednesday midnight between Tuesday
Wednesday midnight right right the first
evening of Tuesday in the know anytime
11:59 p.m. on Tuesday and then it'll be
12 a.m. on winds so we have to figure
out what you should look at if it was
transpired on the Internet right so you
have produced a call to action for
readers so yeah I'm looking for
recommendations with a hashtag watchit
LLC so let's run this hashtag what
should Paul see here we go so fast but
not for me I'm Paul Miller and I left
the internet for a whole year but I'm
coming back now on May 1st it's gonna be
a multimedia extravaganza I want to know
what you think is the best thing that I
missed on the Internet
I got a hashtag you can upload a YouTube
video you can tweet you can find you can
Instagram there's so many possibilities
on the Internet
let's rediscover them all together yeah
then I use it all over the side really
no how's that recently filmed yeah no
idea what vine is I know a finance I
helped my roommate create some lines
interesting you go weren't behind the
camera though no no we were doing making
like stop motions I like it what did you
make
well we did one where it's like a skull
of coins and then it starts crying coins
and then another one of this guy here
that's how that dawn committal this guy
like he like like he sticks his tongue
out and then like his tongue like
swallows what sounds like every any
other any topics we need to cover maybe
art maybe our live listeners would like
to offer some subjects there's actually
one other big thing we should talk what
is it um before we wrap this is Amazon
doing set-top boxes I'm not really I
don't know what who cares like fast
I got Amazon all over everything what
it's gonna be like five hours on
streaming on my TV Smart TV yeah it's
just weird they thought why not
I remember time when you have you
watched any of any prime shows let me
tell you something all right
haribol have watched a few moments of
each they're awful and it wasn't happy
with what I saw I mean it was like man
that house of cards is like pretty good
house the car we should watching by the
way exactly I've just gotten into
Episode six or seven and boy it's pretty
good it's really good it is a show yeah
it is a tell you guys we could either
are not dream I think I would watch how
hard he devised flashbacks cuz I could
be assured that it gets bizarre at some
point there are don't ruin it for me
I've only I just don't think I could
Staller eight that much straightforward
drama I think when you get in that into
the seat and bundle up I don't think
there are not having a flashback to I
want a unicorn dream sequence there's a
scene where you at the end of the show
you figure out that Kevin Spacey is a
make sense and and and Robin Wright is
like too bad she won't live then again
who does yeah and then they show a car
driving it's all just all of the endings
and hares it forwards like some folks
call him a skin job well that's like
some of his narration a lot of people
hadn't heard the narration yeah I think
the narration is is better I like it a
complete weirdo
I think the narrations give the the
viewer some context into we once had a
thread who we wanted to have a movie
night for the staff you were off the
unit mmm I'll show this to you yeah he
once had a movie night show blade rock
yes and instead of having a movie night
what we had was a week-long email thread
where everyone argued about which
version we should go which one one none
of them one we all lost whoever wins we
like almost kind of frustrated and mad I
walked and then we didn't order pizza
and watch a movie
I have watched three different versions
of Blade Runner and read the book this
year so I guess I guess I guess whatever
way that is winning is Paul's got a lot
of time for the victor congratulations
well anyhow that's we'll all be coming
to a close because you'll be back on the
Internet and back hard at work yeah
there's email threads oh yeah you got so
many you're gonna be crazy a movie night
email yeah we should do it we haven't
done a movie night at the new office yet
no we should do one pick a movie all

everything out here and nobody tweeted
me about possible topics we should have
brought up here you are here's your last
chance you get one minute you have one
minute to tweet a topic to me that we
