I'm in cities most the time it's 90%
just legend and rumor
it was completely completely forgotten
about no one no one knew was there
people speculated but there was no
actual like grounds for knowing about
that all the experts were saying it was
destroyed and all kinds of bizarre
stories about eight-foot manning rats
inside of it poison gas
even though something sounds outlandish
that may be real
I was born in Brooklyn lived in this
very apartment for most of my life I was
always interested in engineering I
always had an interest in trains because
trains and trains were kind of like a
combination of my two interest which was
history and engineering so as a
combination of both areas so was a
natural fit
when I was in high school I won a
science award for alternative energy
sources I built a working model of a
satellite don't orbit the earth and
change sunlight into electricity using
photovoltaic cells and you could power
up the city off of one big satellite I
was going to Pratt studying Electrical
Engineering but the radio on and there
was a Gil grow show and he was talking
about a book that just came out that we
called the cosgrove report and the
thrust of the book was that John Wilkes
Booth was never killed that he escaped
to England by way of Manhattan and then
on his way out of New York he hid the
missing pages of his diary inside of a
tunnel that was just closed up on
Atlantic Avenue oh by the way next to it
is a steam locomotive laying on its side
so I was like what steam locomotives and
charm folks poof I'm on it
so I figured the best way to start was
to get a good map of the area from that
time period so I just kept on digging
until I found that newspaper article
from 1911 which told about the set of
engineer's drawings at the borough
president's office from 1861 and I draw
a board home I looked at for about two
seconds and I saw it was an opening in
the roof of the tunnel right here come
on silver be a good boy hello lines up
right over here with a dot in the middle
of Atlantic Avenue in Court Street I
figured that must be a manhole cover so
what I ended up doing was I went said
the borough president Howard golden told
him the story and he had the water
department come out the next day and
pick up the lid so I jumped in and
squeezed into a space about this high
and you can see the brick roof and the
dirt going off to the distance so I knew
there was tunnel under there and I
noticed there was a space with a dirt
then dropped down again and you can see
a concrete wall right ahead plugged up
with bricks and cobblestones like a
doorway and when we got through the wall
pulled out all those stones a blast of
cold air came out from the other side I
was just like laying there on my stomach
laughing into the walkie-talkie because
I couldn't talk because I was so shocked
that it was really there and all the
experts were completely wrong that I
couldn't even I was speechless for a few
minutes but the gas company executives
knew I found something because I was
laughing so hard
the young man's name is Robert diamond
and looking read about him in all the
papers
the first subway tunnel ever built in
America that's right I found it a tunnel
shut and forgotten about nearly a
century and a half tomorrow it could
take us all for a journey back in time I
took a close look at one man's obsession
tonight in a dark hole under Atlantic
Avenue in Brooklyn the toys actually
happened by popular demand and so we had
like 7 800 people show up but we got
them all in and out of there
but we weren't interested in the money
were just interested in the experience
of getting people down there because it
was fun and they liked it that the funny
thing to me is that I asked some people
why do you like to come in here cuz I
had people coming back seven and eight
times so what he keep coming back here
and then surprisingly they said because
they like the story of how I found the
tunnel so I'd hear all these people
walking past me saying they wanted to
meet me and then I'd get up and say I'm
Bob diamonds and they would all applaud
I first met Bob when I went on one of
his tours I'd heard about him for a
while and I'd heard about this
mysterious tunnel underneath one of the
busiest intersections in Brooklyn I said
sure probably somebody's basement but I
won on the tour and that's exactly what
it was
suddenly you're in this enormous
expansive tunnel which just stretches
away seemingly infinitely away from the
people looking around and awe and then
we all congregated at the bottom of it
yeah after a while I had kind of like a
routine set up a probably there was
exploding gas and poison gas down here
and five foot netting rats but more
about that later
and I'm kind of like an artist in a way
because I like having people come down
and show him how I work I get pleasure
by them enjoying my work so we just kept
using the entrance that we'd built and
everything was fine up until three years
ago I got a letter one day out of
nowhere there was no warning
there was no due process I just got a
certified letter saying if franchises
revoked and don't ever go back there
again you're gonna be arrested well
we're there for 32 years never had an
accident so I guess I was doing
something right
so yeah like in retrospect like if
something happened down there like if
there was a fire or something then it
probably would be rather difficult to
get people out in a extremely timely
manner considering that it was it was it
was a bottleneck trying to get through
that everyone through that niche yeah I
suppose that was probably a pretty
serious safety hazard in retrospect of
course something I didn't notice at the
time the most exciting places for me are
the ones that are more raw a lot of
times it's a trade-off the more people
you want to be able to see place the
more you have to polish a way that that
roughness that can be so excited we're
never given notice that the thing was
being revoked we were never given a
chance to remedy their complaints and
and and and that basically there was no
due process is that we've been there for
32 years we made it into a federal
landmark it's in the National Register
of Historic Places people come from all
over the world to see it and basically
the city just comes along one day and
just says get out
I like people like Bob who are motivated
by something totally outside the realm
of money and even outside the realm of
kind of what makes sense the keys he has
a vision and he has things he's in love
with fascinated by and that is what
drives him it's such a bizarre surreal
sort of a story like in the middle of an
urban environment where nothing is
unexplored he found a two-mile long
tunnel
what could I find like it was like it's
like well that could never happen but it
did the reason I did those tours because
people had come in there and say oh wow
this is amazing that tunnel was
basically my whole life that's what I
did every week and now it's like I'm
sitting around not doing much for three
years what else am I gonna do I'm 54
years old you know who old to go fight
into the tunnel somewhere else
