Microsoft first revealed its original
surface tablet and let's just say it
hasn't been a smash hit the original
surface RT suffered from performance
issues the surface 2 improved it but you
still couldn't really use it on your lab
and sure the surface pro line has been
much better but it's also expensive so
Microsoft Surface 3 aims to fix all of
that it runs real Windows not RT it's
smaller but most of all it's the right
price at $4.99 the surface 3 starts with
the 10-point 8 inch display running at
nineteen twenty by twelve eighty which
gives it the same three by two aspect
ratio as a surface pro 3 that slight
change makes portrait mode a little more
usable and a little less clunky but it
doesn't change the fact that the surface
still isn't really designed to be a pure
tablet Microsoft is selling a type cover
for 120 $9.99 and you really need it if
you want to get the most out of the
surface 3 without it you're left with a
tablet and a severe lack of quality apps
in the Windows Store
but with it you can use it as a real PC
with traditional apps that aren't as
touch friendly the basic hardware design
hasn't changed much from the surface 2
but the best change is the adjustable
hinge because now the surface 3 has
three modes it's not fully adjustable
like the pro 3 but Microsoft says it
would cost too much to put in a better
one the surface 3 hinge works well
enough with angles that accommodate most
situations good enough isn't great
though it's still awkward to use at
times and honestly I don't know why I
sat like this the new type cover does
have some cleverly placed magnets that
snap onto the screen to make things a
little more sturdy it's backlit and it
has a full keyboard but the trackpad is
still a little too small you can also
buy a stylus for $49.99 it's one of the
more unique aspects of the surface and
it works just as well here as it does on
the pro 3 with different levels of
pressure sensitivity it still feels like
Windows itself isn't well equipped to
use a pen naturally but apps like
OneNote make really good use of it with
a full version of Windows 8.1 powering
the surface 3 you can now run apps like
Chrome iTunes and Photoshop if you want
to get work done an office or in some of
the millions of traditional Windows apps
you can it's effectively a smaller
version of the surface pro 3 only
without nearly as much power
Microsoft has opted
for an Intel Atom processor and while
it's actually fast enough for most basic
tasks I did notice some lag here and
there especially when you multitask with
a lot of apps but if you think of this
as a basic laptop or a Chromebook then
it copes well enough with web browsing
editing office documents and playing
some mobile games but if you're looking
to do video editing or anything really
more powerful than just the basics you
should look elsewhere battery life is
around seven hours in our own tests so
if you start work at 9:00 a.m. that
would just squeak out a working day
that's probably enough for most people
but the addition of a micro USB charging
port means you can use your phone
charger to top-up the surface 3 microUSB
also doubles as a standard USB port if
you buy an adapter like the surface
before it there's also a full-size USB
and a mini display port for connecting
up a monitor if you're not happy with
the 64 gig or 128 gig storage options
there's also a micro SD card slot to
expand on them should you buy the
surface 3 that really depends on how
you're going to use it if you can afford
it you should probably just get the
surface pro 3 it has more power or
honestly just buy a laptop but if you're
looking for a combined device with a
touchscreen stylus and a keyboard then
this is one of the best on the market
for this price at $4.99 just know that
there are compromises the surface 3 is
trying to be a laptop and a tablet but
it doesn't nail either mode really well
and to take advantage of all its
features you're going to need to buy
that keyboard and pen separately maybe
it's time Microsoft just made a surface
laptop at the end of the day it seems
like that's what it really wants to be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
