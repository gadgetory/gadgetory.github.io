transformation from a PC centric company
to a data centric company ladies and
gentlemen please welcome Brian presented
good evening so today is a day where we
all come together to celebrate the
lifeblood of our amazing industry and
that's really about innovation but
before we start I want to take a moment
to thank the industry for coming
together for another purpose to address
the recent security research findings
reported as meltdown and Spectre in the
aberration among so many companies to
address this industry-wide issue across
several different processor
architectures has been truly remarkable
his security is job number one for Intel
and our industry so the primary focus of
our decisions and discussions have been
to keep our customers data safe as of
now we have not received any information
that these exploits have been used to
obtain customer data and we're working
tirelessly on these issues to ensure it
stays that way the best thing you can do
to make sure your data remains safe is
to apply any updates from your operating
system vendor and system manufacturer as
soon as they become available for our
processors products introduced in the
past five years
Intel expects to issue updates for more
than 90% of them within a week and their
remaining by the end of January we
believe the performance impact of these
updates is highly work the load
dependent now as a result we expect some
workloads may have a larger impact than
others so we'll continue working with
the industry to minimize the impact on
those workloads over time when we come
together like this there are endless
possibilities and I'd like to share some
of those possibilities now with
you data will redefine how we experience
life in our work at home in school even
how we enjoy sports and entertainment
and I want to show you how we use our
expertise to deliver this immersive
media tonight this breakthrough combines
artificial intelligence advanced camera
technology and millions of HD images to
blur the lines between reality and
imagination to create something known as
volumetric video so now let me give you
some insight into how this all works
because it comes in a variety of flavors
one of those technologies is Intel true
VR which is already making an impact in
sports globally and will continue to
transform fan experiences it also
extends beyond sports and will
increasingly affect how consumers will
interact with the content and all kinds
of experiences with true VR we place
multiple cameras along one side or
around the perimeter of a playing field
or even on a downhill ski run each of
these cameras has multiple lenses that
allow us to have a hundred and eighty to
360 degree stereoscopic view the
individual cameras are stitched together
with sophisticated software and powerful
computers it allows a fan to not only
use their headset to look around the
field but also choose the camera
position they want now we also have a
technology that some of you may know by
the name of Freedy we are now calling
this Intel true view this technology
takes a very different approach to
deliver this experience true view
involves the installations of dozens of
high-definition 5k resolution cameras
positioned around the entire viewing
area this allows us to define the 3d
space and volume of the area inside the
camera ring by dividing it into billions
and billions of data points that we call
voxels
okay so what is a voxel exactly well
think of it as a pixel that's placed in
three-dimensional space that adds depth
to the content you're capturing by
recording a scene this way we
effectively have the ability to take the
viewer inside the 3d space of the scene
from any angle he or she wants now of
course it takes a tremendous amount of
computing power to do this the setups
we've recreated to deliver TrueView for
the National Football League they
produce data at the rate of three
terabytes per minute three terabytes
that means we're creating the data
equivalent of all of the text in the
Library of Congress in the first quarter
of any football game let me take you
into a glimpse of the future show you
what watching sports would be like we
had multiple data streams so I'll write
you and your audience to join me my VR
headset I'm headed to Arrowhead Stadium
I'm gonna watch a Kansas City shave
Chiefs take on the LA Chargers so now I
put under the game here now the first
thing you notice you have this game on
the giant screen above you right that's
a hundred ninety five foot and you can
see the entire field but you also see a
little blue square and that's actually
the view I have in my headset now if
you're watching this at home in your HD
screen you would have almost that exact
same deal but look at all the data
that's outside that little blue square I
mean all that data has to be constantly
updated and refreshed so when I move my
headset I have a seamless view on the of
the field now when I'm watching the game
at home I'm typically always going to my
tablet or my phone to check out my
fantasy football team but because I've
got multiple data streams here I've
actually taken my entire fantasy
football team and brought them into this
game but what if we wanted to be right
there in the middle of the game what you
see here is that we're able to see right
to Tom Brady and and see what he sees on
the field that's a different perspective
doctors perspective
that nobody else can provide you there's
not a camera in his helmet there's not a
another system showing that that's going
inside one of those voxels and looking
out from outside his helmet well on this
play you're gonna see Joe Flacco from
the Ravens and he's got as you could
tell the Pacquiao he's looking he's got
a cornerback right there in his vision
and he's got the safety he's got to fit
this ball right in there don't throw
this Joe jump throw up touchdown good
job Joe but you know what there's not
any other technology that would show you
how tight this throw was and how
difficult it was for Joe this allowed
you as a viewer to really go right there
and beat Joe Flacco and you could be
like I can't believe he's making this
throw there's no window there you get to
appreciate the ability of that guy at
that moment at the same time you'll be
able to go back and nitpick and be like
not a good job Joe don't the other guy
so let's roll the first single camera
and what you can see it's the western
scene they're fighting the hero breaks
free gets on the horse and rides away
now I want to show you that same scene
the exact same scene captured
volumetrically
now the important thing to remember is
that we shot this scene only one time
and now we have all that of data and the
ability to recreate the scene from any
point of view one of the fascinating
developments is the rise of neuromorphic
computing we've been building something
that truly mimics the way that the brain
observes learns and understands our
research efforts have produced a
prototype chip called Loihi this has
been a major research effort at Intel
and today we have a fully functioning
neuromorphic research chip our Loihi
research chip is the most advanced
neuromorphic chip yet developed and
after only a few weeks it's already
performing simple object recognition in
the labs this incredible technology is
going to influence future products and
innovations let's talk about quantum
computing for a second the quantum
computing represents an entirely
different approach to computing this
technology will be able to solve
problems that are insurmountable today
quantum computers are composed of
quantum bits or you often hear the term
qubits these massively parallel
processing to solve problems today the
best supercomputers will take months or
even years to resolve today I'm proud to
show you the next step I'm proud to
introduce to you our 49 qubit quantum
chip this 49 qubit chip pushes beyond
our ability to simulate and is a step
towards quantum supremacy we want to
build a platform that allows autonomous
cars to become a reality from commercial
fleets to passenger cars everywhere on
the road this isn't just an experiment
it's a path to the future
I saw no hands on the wheels but this
doesn't look like the traditional
autonomous car there's no big lighter on
top there's it just looks a little bit
cleaner and smoother
well first I'm proud to introduce
one of our first vehicles out of a fleet
of 100 cars that we announced last year
and indeed as you said all the sensors
are very discreet we have cameras wing
cameras and side cameras that give you
half a sphere on the side a rear camera
and then for parking cameras altogether
12 cameras and then radars and and
ladders for a redundancy so we have
identified four areas that we are
addressing to make at anomalous vehicle
wheel first is sensing and that's
includes all the high performance
computing and mapping driving policy
which is about planning decisions and
merging into traffic and then models
that provide safety guarantees which are
coordinated with the government
regulations the volocopter is an
entirely novel type of vertical takeoff
and landing aircraft it offers
unprecedented levels of safety is
extremely simple to fly quiet and when
running on its batteries emission-free
it is not some distant sci-fi fantasy
the volocopter is real and already
exists today as we just saw in the video
I can attest that now soon we will offer
autonomous air taxi flights as a service
in cities across the world
revolutionising the way we all
experience urban mobility today and the
best about it it has the potential to be
affordable for all of us no I agree
and that volocopter uses the state
flight control technology that the
Falcon eight plus drone that Intel makes
uses for inspections and surveys and
mapping so it's got a lot of other uses
and and reliability testing so but why
do you think autonomous air taxis are
going to be adopted by consumers why
what's what's gonna drive this to people
well who wouldn't like to fly across
city sit in a volocopter look at it from
an entirely new perspective skip traffic
save time so to fly drones at this scale
what we need are batteries with very
high energy density and also we need the
capability of processing vast amounts of
data in milliseconds
especially when flying autonomously and
that is where you come into play so with
Intel Inside Tech is now able to perform
this task because it is powerful small
and lightweight they want to see it fly
don't you okay we'll make it happen as I
already started you know flying a
volocopter inside the theater live on
stage does come along with some
challenges so in order to pull of that
stunt we had to put some safety measures
in place but I'm confident you will
still be able to enjoy it and get a feel
for it ok let's let it fly
I'd like to introduce to you our newest
drone the Intel shooting star mini
everything it does is made simple and
possible by data now this is not the
type of drone you can buy in a store the
hardware is a completely new design so
it can be safely flown and navigate
indoors where there is no GPS it has the
most advanced software and is fully
automated and a single fleet of a
hundred drones can be controlled by one
pilot I really hope you enjoyed the new
member of our family have a wonderful
evening and enjoy CES 2018</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
