Germany for in 2012 and we're
just getting to grips around the
highlights of the show the canon eos 6d
it doesn't really replace anything in
canons lineup it's nots in between
obviously the eos 5d and a 70 it takes
the full frame sensor from the 5e series
to a brand new price point of 2000 $99
body only in the united states that
makes it the most affordable full-frame
camera that kinda has produced so far
it's also the smallest and the lights
camera of that kind and it's fitted up
against the Nikon d600 which was just
introduced last week as well feature
wise it's very much like the Canon 60d
and the 70 but features a new full-frame
sensor compared to the 7d Canon tells us
that it has the same waterproofing
however it misses the integrated flash
something that the Nikon d600 has also
the Nicoli 600 is 39-point AF system
there's only an 11-point AF system here
on the 60 we don't need one cross type
sensor there there's only one SD card
slot on the 60 whereas the Nikon has two
and very wise you're looking at the
exact same battery as you would get with
a can on year 17 so in many ways this is
a clear upgrade from the Canon 7d
particularly because of the new
full-frame sensor and also the reason
why there is no integrated flash is
because this space here about the
pentaprism is occupied by Wi-Fi radio
and a GPS antenna so both were
integrated
whereas if you want the Nick on route
you would need a separate Wi-Fi dongle
over here on the side Canon didn't make
sure to remind us that although this
camera has fewer autofocus points than
the snake on competitor it is sensitive
to a far lower light than Nichkhun
Nichkhun is - one eveywhere it's kind of
reaches all the way down to minus 3 evey
also the native ISO range for the EOS 6d
is 103 25,600
which is extensible from 50 to 100 mm
availability for the new Canon EOS 6d
should be November or December of this
year which is a couple of months later
than the Nicol alternative but it'll
never</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
