talk about energy okay it's a choice
between sharing in this great energy
well or sharing in the poverty promised
by Hillary Clinton on May 26 Donald
Trump told a crowd in North Dakota about
his energy plans for the u.s. and the
speech didn't make any sense and Hillary
cat shut down the mines she could really
shut down our whole country and your
business will be permanently in many
cases permanently ruined Trump's own
energy plan on the other hand will
create jobs and trillions of dollars of
wealth despite what Trump says it's not
clear at all how he'll do that that's
because Trump didn't release the policy
paper that explained what he'll do about
climate and energy something that
Clinton has done because of this
practically every expert I spoke with
had to tell me first that figuring out
exactly what Trump plans to do is nearly
impossible still there's some meat in
Trump's speech to dissect so here's a
list of the things that Trump said that
just don't hold up number one Trump
thinks making the u.s. energy
independent would be good for the
economy under my presidency we'll
accomplish a complete American energy
independence complete complete for most
people being energy independent means
relying solely on domestic production to
power the US but since Trump also called
for the renewal of the Keystone XL
pipeline project a project that would
bring Canadian oil into the u.s. he
clearly doesn't actually want to cut out
all foreign oil sources so let's just
operate under the assumption that Trump
wants to stop importing oil from
countries outside North America so
what's wrong with the whole let's make
America energy independent thing for one
thing the u.s. is the largest oil
producer in the world
so even though Trump painted the u.s.
the country that's trapped under the
weight of foreign oil markets Americans
are actually doing pretty well for
themselves but that's not all relying on
a single source of energy
the US has own supply is risky if
something were to happen like a
devastating hurricane in the Gulf of
Mexico then the US wouldn't have other
reliable sources to turn to so really
maintaining multiple sources of oil is a
good thing because it protects the
economy from unexpected shocks in the
market
number two Trump thinks of windfarms
kill more than 1 million birds each year
while the administration fast-tracked
wind projects that kill more than a
million birds a year far more than a
million words I have to tell you farm
boy it's not clear where that number
comes from but it's inaccurate in 2014
researchers estimated that three hundred
and sixty-eight thousand birds are
killed each year when they hit wind
turbines and the Fish and Wildlife
Service says that wind turbines kill
somewhere between a hundred and forty
thousand and five hundred and seventy
three thousand birds each year but if
you look at Trump's other positions that
statement becomes downright silly by
some estimates coal mining the industry
that Trump wants to revive kills close
to eight million birds each year an oil
and gas kills between 500,000 and 1
million birds so claiming that wind
turbines are killing American birds is
ridiculous in comparison number 3 Trump
thinks environmental regulations are
killing the coal industry regulations
that shut down hundreds of coal-fired
power plants and block the construction
of new ones how stupid is that
environmental regulations like
restrictions on federal land use have
had an effect on the coal industry but
what Trump doesn't mention here is that
the regulatory impacts are nothing
compared to the effect that the natural
gas industry has had on energy
production in the u.s. the truth is that
natural gas is a lot cheaper right now
so coal is being left behind and that
means that bringing back coal would
probably have an adverse effect on
natural gas production but that's not
even the weirdest part of Trump's
position on coal in his speech Trump
referred to using untapped reserves of
natural gas on federal lands which is
clearly a reference to fracking but if
Trump removes the regulations that
prevent fracking on federal lands that
would probably lower the cost of natural
gas even further and more coal workers
would lose their jobs number four Trump
thinks the Paris climate agreement gives
foreign bureaucrats control over how
much energy the u.s. consumes so he
wants to cancel it President Obama
entered the United States into the Paris
climate Accord
unilaterally and without the permission
of Congress so far and bureaucrats are
going to be controlling what we're using
and what we're doing on our land in our
country no way no way the Paris climate
agreement definitely doesn't give
foreign bureaucrats control over how
much energy the US uses the agreement
clearly states that countries can
determine their own plans for cutting
emissions as for canceling the agreement
the US doesn't have the power to make
that happen so far more than 190
countries have approved the agreement
but if Trump becomes president he might
be able to pull the u.s. out of the
agreement before it's ratified backing
out now however would be catastrophic
both for the world's climate and for the
u.s. as global reputation number five
Trump thinks the oil and gas industry
employs way more people than it actually
does the oil and natural gas industry
supports 10 million high-paying American
jobs and create another 400,000 new jobs
per year despite what Trump says the oil
and gas industry isn't a big player when
it comes to jobs in the u.s. in January
2016
181 thousand workers were directly
employed in oil and gas extraction while
last year the coal industry employed
another 69,000 number six Trump didn't
mention climate change but his denial
shines through the closest the Trump
campaign came to mentioning climate
change in his energy speech was this a
jump administration will focus on real
environmental challenges not the phony
ones that we've been looking at the use
of the word phony is important because
Trump himself is a well-documented
climate change denier list and
conspiracy theorist see he doesn't just
think the climate change is fake he also
thinks it's a hoax orchestrated by the
Chinese so failing to mention climate
change might actually be a strategic
move for him diving into that subject
would have turned an already terrible
speech into a total farce the point is
Trump doesn't really seem to understand
the intricacies of energy and
environmental policy in u.s. during the
month of May alone we learned that Trump
wants to kill California smelt but save
birds from wind turbines
he's also fine with denying climate
change publicly while citing it as a
reason to save his Irish Golf Course
and when he's dealing with fossil fuels
it's totally fine to expand fracking
while somehow reviving the coal industry
the contradictions are so abundant that
it's kind of hard to keep track of
course given how often he's changed his
mind over the years each of these
positions could be entirely different
tomorrow no no no no you'reyou're just
no you're wrong you're so wrong about
this like no no no my dear sir</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
