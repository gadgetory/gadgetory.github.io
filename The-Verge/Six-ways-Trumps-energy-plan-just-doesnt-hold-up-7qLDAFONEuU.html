talk about energy okay it's a choice
between sharing in this great energy
well or sharing in the poverty promised
by Hillary Clinton on May 26 Donald
Trump told a crowd in North Dakota about
his energy plans for the US and the
speech didn't make any sense and Hillary
can't shut down the mines she can really
shut down our whole country and your
business will be permanently in many
cases permanently ruined Trump's own
energy plan on the other hand will
create jobs and trillions of dollars of
wealth despite what Trump says it's not
clear at all how he'll do that that's
because Trump didn't release the policy
paper that explained what he'll do about
climate and energy something that
Clinton has done because of this
practically every expert I spoke with
had to tell me first that figuring out
exactly what Trump plans to do is nearly
impossible still there's some meat in
Trump's speech to dissect so here's a
list of the things the Trump said that
just don't pulled up number one Trump
thinks making the US energy independent
would be good for the economy under my
presidency will accomplish a complete
American energy independence complete
complete for most people being energy
independent means relying solely on
domestic production to power the US but
since Trump also called for the renewal
of the Keystone XL pipeline project a
project that would bring Canadian oil
into the u.s. he clearly doesn't
actually want to cut out all foreign oil
sources so let's just operate under the
assumption that Trump wants to stop
importing oil from countries outside
North America so what's wrong with the
whole let's make America energy
independent thing for one thing the u.s.
is the largest oil producer in the world
so even though Trump painted the u.s.
the country that's trapped under the
weight of foreign oil markets Americans
are actually doing pretty well for
themselves but that's not all relying on
a single source of energy the USA's own
supply is risky if something were to
happen like a devastating hurricane in
the gulf of mexico then the US wouldn't
have other reliable sources to turn to
so really maintaining multiple sources
of oil is a good thing because it
protects the economy from unexpected
shocks in the market
number two Trump thinks wind farms kill
more than 1 million birds each year
while the administration fast-tracked
wind projects that kill more than a
million Birds a year far more than a
million words I have to tell you farm
boy it's not clear where that number
comes from but it's inaccurate in 2014
researchers estimated that 368,000 birds
are killed each year when they hit wind
turbines and the Fish and Wildlife
Service says that wind turbines kill
somewhere between 140 thousand five
hundred and seventy three thousand Birds
each year but if you look at Trump's
other positions that statement becomes
downright silly by some estimates coal
mining the industry that Trump wants to
revive kills close to eight million
birds each year an oil and gas kills
between 500,000 and 1 million Birds so
claiming that wind turbines are killing
American birds is ridiculous in
comparison number three Trump thinks
environmental regulations are killing
the coal industry regulations that shut
down hundreds of coal-fired power plants
and block the construction of new ones
how stupid is that environmental
regulations like restrictions on federal
land use have had an effect on the coal
industry but what Trump doesn't mention
here is that the regulatory impacts are
nothing compared to the effect that the
natural gas industry has had on energy
production in the US the truth is that
natural gas is a lot cheaper right now
so cool is being left behind and that
means that bringing back Cole would
probably have an adverse effect on
natural gas production but that's not
even the weirdest part of Trump's
position on coal in his speech Trump
referred to using untapped reserves of
natural gas on federal lands which is
clearly a reference to fracking but if
Trump removes regulations that prevent
cracking on federal lands that would
probably lower the cost of natural gas
even further and more coal workers would
lose their jobs number for Trump thinks
the Paris climate agreement gives
foreign bureaucrats control over how
much energy the u.s. consumes so he
wants to cancel it president obama edge
of the United States into the Paris
climate occurs
unilaterally and without the permission
of Congress so foreign bureaucrats are
going to be controlling what we're using
and what we're doing on our land in our
country no way no way the Paris climate
agreement definitely doesn't give
foreign bureaucrats control over how
much energy the u.s. uses the agreement
clearly states that countries can
determine their own plans for cutting
emissions as for canceling the agreement
the US doesn't have the power to make
that happen so far more than 190
countries have approved the agreement
but if Trump becomes president he might
be able to pull the u.s. out of the
agreement before it's ratified backing
out now however would be catastrophic
both for the world's climate and for the
US as global reputation number five
Trump thinks the oil and gas industry
employs way more people than it actually
does the oil and natural gas industry
supports 10 million high-paying American
jobs and create another four hundred
thousand new jobs per year despite what
Trump says the oil and gas industry
isn't a big player when it comes to jobs
in the u.s. in January 2016 181,000
workers were directly employed in oil
and gas extraction while last year the
coal industry employed another 69,000
number six Trump didn't mentioned
climate change but his denial shines
through the closest the Trump campaign
came to mentioning climate change in his
energy speech was this a jump
administration will focus on real
environmental challenges not the phony
ones that we've been looking at the use
of the word phony is important because
Trump himself is a well-documented
climate change denial asst and
conspiracy theorists see he doesn't just
think the climate change is fake he also
thinks it's a hoax orchestrated by the
Chinese so failing to mention climate
change might actually be a strategic
move for him diving into that subject
would have turned an already terrible
speech into a total farce the point is
Trump doesn't really seem to understand
the intricacies of energy and
environmental policy in US during the
month of May alone we learn the Trump
wants to kill California smelt but save
birds from wind turbines he's also fine
with denying climate change publicly
while citing it as a reason to save his
Irish golf course
and when he's dealing with fossil fuels
it's totally fine to expand fracking
while somehow reviving the coal industry
the contradictions are so abundant that
it's kind of hard to keep track of
course given how often he's changed his
mind over the years each of these
positions could be entirely different
tomorrow no no no no no you're you're
just no you're wrong you're so wrong
about this like no no no my dear sir
it's a problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
