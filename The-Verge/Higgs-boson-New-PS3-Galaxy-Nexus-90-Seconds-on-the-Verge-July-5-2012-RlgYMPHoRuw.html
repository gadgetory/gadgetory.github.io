Josh Topolsky and you're about to spend
90 succulent seconds on the verge
Americans are celebrating their freedom
and independence on july 4th european
scientists are celebrating something a
little bit more important the potential
discovery of the higgs boson particle if
you don't know what the higgs boson is
don't worry pretty much no one knows
luckily there's a number of helpful
video explanations online involving ping
pong balls cartoons and rap music
researchers had to build a 17 mile long
particle accelerator to test their
theory and there's still a one in nine
trillion chance that this might not be
the particle they think it is also they
presented the findings in comic sans so
seems a little dicey according to some
FCC filings just discovered Sony may be
slimming down the PlayStation 3 once
again based on what we've seen it looks
like a super slim version of the console
could be headed out sometime soon
according to Eurogamer we could see the
new console announced as soon as next
month potentially along with a price cut
finally if you're hoping to buy Galaxy
Nexus any time in the very near future
you might be out of luck Apple's
convince a court to grant an injunction
barring sale of the device in the United
States the device is no longer available
in the Play Store that you can still
find it at some verizon retailers and
other resellers around the country and
google says that they plan to have it
back online in just about a week with
the jellybean 4.1 update that's all the
news for today tomorrow we take a look
at defrag in your cyberspace deck is it
worth the hassle</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
