imagined myself to be pretty good at
video games better than average
there was this one challenging game on
the Nintendo saw Battletoads
for the average player the game ends on
the third stage somehow word got out in
my neighborhood that not only was Shawn
past the third stage on battle toes but
he was on like level 9 or something like
this level that nobody had ever seen
before
and suddenly just all these strangers
were like crowded around the TV as I was
playing it I remember being really like
excited like I get this adrenaline rush
from people kind of watching you do this
for five years ago it was getting kind
of late in the night and Shawn's like in
his computer room or whatever and I'm
like what are you doing in there is it
time to go to bed and he's like I'm not
coming to bed for a while why not he
goes because people on reddit think that
I can't beat Battletoads and I'm gonna
do it live and I'm about to broadcast it
right now before I saw the king of Kong
I had always believed that that was the
hardest game ever and I'd beaten that
game well Donkey Kong without question
is the hardest game and it's
ridiculously difficult on the first
screen
the average Donkey Kong game doesn't
last a minute it's absolute brutality
there's a scene in the movie or Billy
Mitchell's saying the people who could
get besides myself that have been seen
getting to the end of Donkey Kong
gee now that I think about it I don't
think anybody has I just I took it as a
personal challenge like I almost took
offense that like nobody could do this
thing so I started saying hey could I
maybe be good at Donkey Kong and get to
the kill screen there is a set number of
levels and therefore a theoretical
maximum score and people just want to
kind of push that to the limit you have
to stay on each board as long as
possible using really every available
second to score points as efficiently as
possible in order to beat the record
that's it
1 million 37,500 I did it I did it when
I put up my million point score I wasn't
working I guess I should say I was a lot
better at Donkey Kong when I was
unemployed if a good game that would
potentially go all the way to the kill
screen and when the record takes about
three hours and maybe it takes like an
hour to get a game going
I mean that that's just a large time
commitment I had to play outside of my
comfort zone in order to really compete
and I put up you know a score that got
halfway through the game but it was on
pace for like 1.1 million the score that
that won the event I think
much of the community considers me to be
a lucky player people don't think that I
deserve it like I don't belong coming in
this year I have other priorities in my
life I'm working full time this year we
got married Donkey Kong is definitely
taking a backseat to other things that
I'm doing I really probably stand no
chance to win but it's all part of the I
think greater good where we're not
necessarily competing against each other
and it's kind of like all of us versus
the machine
hey love how are you
competitions about to start in like 15
minutes so I'm going to turn my phone
off and stuff so before the dead air
silence I just want to call and say hey
and I love you and wish me luck again
I'll let I'll let you know after the
event as ended today how how I did and
how everyone else did okay I love it you
bye coming welcome to the 2013 Kong off
I really want to thank all of you for
going out of your way to making it out
to Denver making the trip making the
financial commitment and making the
commitment to just getting together
again with what we all found last year
to be a very uplifting experience so
again give yourselves a nice round of
applause for being a part of this great
event what really makes the Kong off
worth wild and makes the whole thing
worth wild is bringing everybody
together we're a crazy community it's
some of us are socially awkward some of
us are misfits some of us I don't know
I'll get along when the internet became
available to everybody suddenly people
were able to exchange information and
bond his friends but not only bond his
friends but bond is Donkey Kong playing
friends we all spend a lot of time
interacting with one another through a
chat room or a message board but for the
few that take the time to come to the
Kong off and meet one another and shake
one another's hands it's just it puts
this whole burst of energy back into
this and it just that's what makes it
all worthwhile
all right everybody's out here all right
so you guys know the order that you're
coming out in you guys kind of know who
you're next to it'll definitely be the
best Kong off yeah as far as the
competition and the potential for
someone to actually beat the world
record live we've got all the best
players playing right now we've got all
of them shooting for top prize
mr. Mike grows back Mike is another one
of the top 12 competitors in Donkey Kong
he happens to live very close to me and
through our mutual interest we kind of
become friends
it's like like the nerves you kind of
get before like you go in for a job
interview or something it's just like a
little bit of butterflies all right
you're right when you're having that
perfect game going it feels very zen
you smash something with a hammer and
time stops for a moment and it just it
feels good
decent for my first games your first
game yeah all right I'll take a little
break and try again
Thank You Bailey first game first
quarter drop got this 600,000 something
which is better than what I did all last
year so feeling pretty positive about it
I mean I think I'd just be happy if I
put up a higher score than them what I
put up yesterday I'm not gonna run
boards though and I don't want to do
that you want to at least have a shot at
placing in the top yeah even a low kill
screen would be cool in the min like a
you know a million 10 or something ok
everybody your machines on your marks
whatever that means get set and yeah
call all three day twos off and running
so it's day two of the Kong off I've
basically been playing Donkey Kong like
it's my job for the past two days
first day I think I did nine or ten
hours never put up as many points for
today we have even less time there's
like an hour and a half left until the
final quarter drop which means since a
game takes like three hours to play
there's like one good game this is your
last chance to take the lead in the
congas last quarter Donkey Kong is
different every time and although you
can influence the game you're not in
complete control of it you have to rely
more on the random aspects of the game
playing out in your favor continuously
for you to ever come close to the record
last quarter rap and my game didn't go
anywhere got to like 200,000 with three
men left
but the pressure was too much Sam
there's still people playing but I'm out
of all the players I think a detective
the Shawn Boyd was the humblest and the
most also frank in his assessment of his
plausibility of winning this contest he
just wants to perform as well as he can
and and maybe break down boundaries and
have new new vistas of highscore
possibility but doesn't necessarily come
into this thinking he's going to be the
winner I was imagining in my mind what
I'd say if I want
something along the lines of surprised
like six screens from the kill screen
he's got one man in reserve if he can
cash in that man is probably worth like
close to 10,000 points so it looks like
he's about on like million 24,000 it
won't put him in the prize rankings but
definitely illustrate hey I'm here to
play the next best thing is seeing Mike
succeed yeah I start white nice nice tab
very impressed very impressed he did get
the kill screen and I think that's
that's what he wanted he wanted to he
wanted a million points and he did it
Congrats again dude I'm so I'm so happy
for it thanks yeah
just got to play consistent
for good randomness I guess thank you
guys everybody for coming out and just
making this such a great event if it
wasn't for you guys showing up and
giving it your heart and all your spice
coming out spectating we wouldn't have
such a great turnout in such a good time
hey how are you
the event is over I did not put up a
score at all
the guy who won last year Jeff Wilms did
back-to-back victories he did it again
so he is hardcore awesomesauce it
doesn't matter I come here and have fun
and talk with the players it's it's a
good time I guess the other thing to
mention is that Mike did real good he
was talking with me at breakfast this
morning that he just wanted to put up a
million points and that's what he did
and I caught the final moments on my
camera so that was pretty cool I'm
really excited for him
all right well yeah I will be safe and
then I will talk to you tomorrow and I
look forward to coming home and
I played close to every night for close
to two years now always aiming for the
record at the time and I've still not
done it is that a reflection of my skill
as a player maybe is it a reflection of
how brutally mean the randomness of
Donkey Kong games maybe
it's that question that it's still
possible
maybe that keeps you playing
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
