Michael Shane and despite what you may
have heard I actually am a supervillain
plotting to take over the world this is
90 seconds on the verge the Moto X is
real and it's coming this year motorola
CEO dennis woodside confirmed the
existence of the company's new flagship
android phone it will be available this
summer and it's going to be built right
here in the United States but it's not
the only phone that might have android
fans excited today Google formally
announced the HTC one google edition HTC
One Nexus experience jun 26th in the
Play Store it's official Microsoft has
been listening to its customers the
start button is coming back the tweak is
just one of many changes coming as part
of the upcoming windows 8.1 update other
tweaks include a souped-up search
feature and the ability to boot directly
into desktop mode windows 8 has been
selling really well but it hasn't
exactly received a warm welcome
hopefully the update will make things a
little easier for everyone and finally I
regret to inform you that there is a
grumpy cat movie in the works sorry not
joking according to deadline and The
Wall Street Journal grumpy cat's manager
has teamed with producers to create a
quote Garfield style film even better or
worse the current plan is for grumpy cat
to talk in the movie nothing's official
until production begins but I think we
can all expect a grumpy road ahead and
that's it for today's top stories coming
up tomorrow the inverse causality
theorem everything you know is wrong and
that's what makes it so right</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
