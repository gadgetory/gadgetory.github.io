get tangled you could yank your laptop
off the table so I so many people buy
wireless headphones these days the
problem with those is that they're
either big and clunky or cheap and small
that's where these come in they're
called the braggy - and they're truly
wireless earbuds it's an idea that was
so popular the company raised three
million dollars on Kickstarter now that
they're here are there any good let's
start with the hardware which is really
good Bragi made the - small enough and
light enough that you don't really
notice them when they're in your ears
and they stay in well enough that you
can run with them you can swim with them
and you can bike with them on the
outside is a really nice polished
plastic with a little light that glows
to tell you how much battery is left on
the inside is some rubber that helps
grip to your ear and some sensors as
well heart rate sensor and an IR sensor
now once you've set them up the ear buds
will sync together and to your phone
every time that you put them in your
ears the lower half of each ear bud is
touch sensitive and lets you do things
like control your music or your volume
or even activate something like Siri
finding the touchpad takes some getting
used to but I only really had trouble
with it the first few days the - will
last you about three to four hours and
any time they run out of battery you can
just drop them back into the charging
case that case can recharge the - in
under an hour and the case carries five
full charges you're not going to get a
full day out of the - but the case makes
it possible to bring them basically
anywhere without having to worry about
charging them now the - connects to your
phone over bluetooth but the earbuds
connect to each other using something
called Near Field magnetic induction
it's a technology from the hearing aid
industry
this helps the sound quality and means
that the audio actually stays synced
whether you're listening to music or
watching video as wireless headphones go
there's even a good amount of bass
though the clarity of the mid and the
high range frequencies could be a lot
better the problem with the - is audio
right now is that Bluetooth connection
to your phone though it's just not that
foolproof if you throw it in your bag or
in your pants pocket the audio starts to
skip and stutter doesn't happen all the
time but it makes the experience really
frustrating but bragging wants to - to
be so much more than just earbuds
there's a whole bunch more functionality
like Fitness tracking a personal
assistant and there are even gestures
all of these are in supremely early
stages and you're almost better off
ignoring them the dash has modes for
running biking and swimming but
can only count your steps and time your
activities it's also supposed to be able
to measure your heart rate but I could
never really get it to work right and I
think it's just a problem of the way
that the dash sits in my ear if these
things worked it would be great because
the dash can also store music meaning
you could leave your phone at home while
you go and work out the dash is also
supposed to be a personal assistant but
right now the voice that you hear only
really guides you through the startup
process and the menus and the gestures
are really limited too right now you can
only accept or reject phone calls just
frustrating because the built-in
microphone on the dash is really bad
even audio transparency which is a
feature that lets you hear the outside
world without taking your earbuds out is
a bit of a letdown
this is a feature that impressed me a
bunch at CES but outside of a quiet
hotel room it's just not the same it's a
great way to hear someone who's speaking
directly to you but the audio clips when
it picks up loud or high-pitched noises
or even a mild breeze which is a pain
because this feature would be most
useful when you're running or biking
down the street now those are all
problems but if you're optimistic
they're also glimpses at the future that
the dash is promising the good thing is
that they can all be solved with
software and Bragi is promising to
release monthly updates until then it's
really only good with audio and even
then it's not perfect at least there's
no wires though</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
