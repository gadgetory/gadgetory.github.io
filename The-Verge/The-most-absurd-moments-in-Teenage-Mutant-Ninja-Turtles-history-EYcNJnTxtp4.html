produced ninja turtles movies hitting
theaters we actually saw an early
screening of it
so the question we mean asked a lot is
did Michael Bay ruin the Ninja Turtles
people seem to forget just how weird
this franchise has been over the years
really messed up franchise actually
think about it so let's actually kind of
go back and look the history of the
trolls franchise 1984 almost 30 years
ago did the first issue and like it was
meant to be a parody of other comics at
the time Marvel's daredevil I think
Frank Miller's Ronin was a big thing and
from there just it just kind of took off
right so the origin story always seemed
to say the same anyway for Turtles get
affected by a mutagen grow up to be
warriors taught ninjutsu by their rat
father and then we have an animated
series in 1987 that turns into a wildly
popular success bonds a live-action
movie that turns into a trilogy at the
time it was everything you want but
looking back it definitely doesn't hold
up do you remember that vanilla can ice
plays a key plot point at the end of the
second film and then the third their
samurais that time travel and it gets
but the weird stuff happens afterwards
and they realize it's a franchise and we
can put turtles everywhere Pizza has
been a sponsor since the beginning and
we have the Power Rangers crossover
we've got was the Oprah thing right yeah
recently made the rounds on the internet
but this thing in the 1994-1995 the
turtles were turned into this song
producing quartet that toured the
country and performed and ended up doing
an episode of Oprah where they performed
to a whole roomful of kids and it's just
super week
there's a CGI film in 2007 that was
swell enough received but instantly
forgotten and then another animated
series in the late 2000s and even a TV
movie that was probably the best thing
that they've produced since the original
series where all the different Turtles
from all the different animated series
ended up working together across
dimensionally and we're actually kind of
cut into modern-day here
2012 the Nickelodeon cartoon is when the
franchise and the toy line admittedly
got much bigger Shh Nickelodeon bought
the rights and actually turned out a
really good product that's still going
on now something that if you don't feel
like looking back on the movies and kind
of hating your past you could actually
enjoy TV has always been a little
different here let's get back to the
movies and this is the first somewhat
live-action film produced by Michael
Bay's everyone's kind of afraid we saw
it it's fun but it's it's exactly what
everything else is a very dumb kind of
film with so much product placement so
many explosions right you could pick
this thing apart in a lot of different
ways if you wanted to but this is a new
live-action movie for kids this is what
they're gonna grow up thinking back on
and maybe hating in 20 years but it is
good enough for them right now and it's
actually good enough if you've been a
fan of the series your whole life it's
worth seeing because it is in a lot of
ways better than some of those original
movies yeah and here's the thing to keep
in context this movie there is no weird
cameo by like a Vanilla Ice equivalent
at all but they're planning a trilogy
there will be two more films at least if
not more so there's plenty of chances to
have like some weird pop culture
crossover or some turtles dance-off God
knows what if history is proven anything
they will find a way to make it even
weirder let me ask you this do you
sometimes wish that April was a turtle
