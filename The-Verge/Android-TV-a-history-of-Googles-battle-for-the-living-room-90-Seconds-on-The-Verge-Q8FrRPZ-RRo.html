television you know what they say fifth
time's the charm
I'm Sam Scheffer and this is 90 seconds
on the Virge this is Android TV
according to documents obtained
exclusively by the verge Google's latest
attempt to own the living room is
expected to launch soon Google has had a
long history of trying to take over the
TV with very limited success the first
attempt was Google TV a full computing
platform that Eric Schmidt predicted
would ship in a majority of TVs by 2012
and we all know how that turned out and
let's not forget the Nexus Q the $300
fear that was scrapped almost as quickly
as it was announced so far the company's
biggest hit with the TV market is the
chromecast according to sources
chromecast would continue to live on
even after Android TV launches the
Android TV described in these documents
is no longer a crazy attempt to turn
your TV into a bigger more powerful
smartphone instead Android TV is set to
focus on an experience that is quote
cinematic fun fluid and fast but the big
question is what market would Android TV
be launching into there are literally
dozens of waste stream internet video
from Apple TV and Roku to PlayStation
and Xbox the real gamechanger will be
the company that can bypass the likes of
Comcast and provide subscription content
directly to the user even so as amazon
firetv is currently proving there's
still a market for dead-simple set-top
boxes that stream compelling content
Android TV could be Google's chance to
get back in that game for more on
android TV check out the verge coming up
tesla joins the battle for your living
room with the announcement of its own
set-top box
must-see TV</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
