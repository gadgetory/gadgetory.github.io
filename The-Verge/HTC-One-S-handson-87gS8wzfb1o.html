with the HTC One S this is a brand-new
brand-new phone just announced here at
mwc it has a 4.3 inch qhd display it's
super amoled although it is pentile
which kind of gets in the way of the
amazingness of it but it is a very nice
display has great color great viewing
angles try and demonstrate that right
now and you can also maybe see the
thickness of it it's seven point six
millimeters thick which makes a very
thin phone it's aluminum unibody it's
been treated micro oxidation it actually
makes it very tough very scratch
resistant tells us HTC which it seems to
be it's a matte surface feels very nice
to the touch it has these recoup curves
and slants over here on the side and
also the gas actually rose over the edge
this is described as a 3d grid boss
designed by HTC
over here on the front you got free
capacitive keys it runs Android Ice
Cream Sandwich but doesn't have the keys
on the screen they're down here at the
bottom it looks to be very fast is still
sort of it doesn't have the carousel
book of the previous versions of sense
this is sense four-point-oh you get a
number of homescreens you can see pinch
to zoom and take a look at all of them
and you get this new multitasking
overview it's kind of like Windows Phone
these are essentially cards and I think
you can swipe away the ones you don't
want it's just a more graphical way of
looking at the multi-tasking menu than
with the standard an Android Ice Cream
Sandwich the biggest optimization HD is
added things on the software side like
Beats Audio integration with Oh music
video games movie playback etc and
there's also dropbox integration but the
biggest thing the biggest change in
sense four-point-oh is something that
HTC codes image sense it is to do with
the camera so as you can see here video
capture and still capture actually still
capture the top videos on the bottom
they're right next to each other so you
can take this deal with the flash or you
can start capturing video you don't need
to switch modes anymore the other cool
thing about this is you can actually
capture a steal while shooting video
comes down here it is a preview you can
capture a couple of them like so and you
can jump here and wait probably needs
some video
you can take a look at what you've got
that's the video and these are the
random skills that we just captured
another cool thing when you playing back
video when you're not recording it you
can still pull out a still from that
video just by pressing the shutter
button there so this is really cool
nobody has really done this it's new
it's just specific to HTC and it looks
really good the phone itself looks
really good so this is our first look at
it it's a preview and we'll try and get
a review sample as soon as you can this
is gladwell diverge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
