what I carry in my bag I mean
specifically what I'm going to a really
stressful thing which for me is a live
blog or like a hands-on situation I mean
I'm a tech writer I get to use pretty
much whatever I want I'm kind of lucky
and so what I have in here must be the
best stuff right actually not so much so
here's all the stuff that I carry into a
live blog and as I unpack my bag I want
to tell a really cheesy story so there's
this movie from the 90s called the ghost
in the darkness and it's it's racist
it's terrible it's colonialism anyway in
this movie Val Kilmer is trying to build
a bridge and he turns out there's a lion
that's messing with the village and so
he has to shoot the lion and so there's
this moment where he has to you know
shoot the lion and his gun doesn't work
and Michael Douglas the grizzled veteran
rolls in and it's what happens misfire
ooh and then Michael Douglas looks at
him and he says to Val Kilmer you went
into battle with an unproven rifle and I
know it's terrible but I always think
about it when you're going into a
high-stress event you actually need to
know how to use your tools they need to
be tested and you need to be ready to go
and so all of this stuff right here that
you're looking at these are my proven
rifles so I could talk about this stuff
for hours but I've already sort of
posted it what's in your bag and so I
think it'd be more interesting for me to
bring in Viren and he can talk about
what he carries in his bag for doing
hands-on Xand we can just have a
conversation about why all this stuff is
interesting so hey hello how's it going
beater awesome how are you all right
this might take a minute okay
all right okay I think that's it
Wow yeah all right so let's start
obviously your video director you've got
lots of lenses right and a camera here
so why this thing instead of I don't
know super dragon red or some like
little tiny thing or your phone or
whatever so yeah kind of going off to
your point that you know you need proven
rifle things that you trust and things
they even know how to operate I'm just
easy to operate yeah so see 100 shoots
great video but you don't need 4k you
need smaller size files you want to get
it up and quick
same thing with lenses we don't have the
super sharp best lenses this is a 17 255
what's good about it is it's Image
Stabilizer okay with because we shoot on
actually let me grab it on monopods and
not tripods okay you got to keep them
stable
same thing actually here we don't have
the nicest fluid drag you know video
head this one is solid because it's not
too heavy him to walk around in these
events and then we have the wide-angle
because if you watch our channel we love
our wide angles yeah in macro for any
you know connectors headphone jacks
although those are extinct right and so
on yeah so for me like you'll see I have
an iPad here which is like a super don't
live blog from an iPad but I have it
because if I need to it's a backup but
also I have a cellular one and so when I
go to an event we usually have a MiFi
and then I have a cellular on this and
then I have Project Phi on this which
can get me sprint and then I also have a
third an iPhone which would be on
Verizon and so I have at least three
ways to get online in case the local
Wi-Fi dies which the local Wi-Fi is
always dies right so your carry on Wi-Fi
as well so it's like having redundancy
is super important for me also I see you
live the dongle life as well this is my
case with oh my god
all the
yeah so this is actually for the eye
button yeah you can use that okay -
Thunderbolts - USB HDMI I just have it
because I don't know why yeah Ethernet
USB 3 USB 3 Apple watch charger yeah
headphones 3.5 millimeter male and
female and microUSB you know just in
case for me the process of like getting
to know a new piece of technology is
like first thing you do is you learn how
to use it like it every time I pick up
this camera I have to relearn how to set
up bracketed shooting and I have to ask
you every time cuz I suck at it but
after a while you get to a point where
like you feel like you're good at it and
I actually think it's really important
don't stop once you feel like you've
mastered it you need to start playing
around with it at that point you need to
start experimenting trying new stuff
seeing what works seeing what you suck
at seeing what's crazy and weird and
then when you go and like you're in the
high-stress environment you don't do all
that experimental stuff but it's sort of
subliminally in the back of your mind so
you do the thing that you're good at but
when you run into a tough spot you like
have run in tough spots before cuz
you're experimenting with stuff that you
weren't able to do and like one of those
things might actually help you solve
that problem alright one more question
what's this
that's an intended switch what that's an
Intendant
when do you have time at an event to
play Nintendo well if there's a surprise
concert by u2 or something like that oh
then yeah you're not gonna want to watch
that that's fair now well at least it
doesn't download you to music onto it
okay so my takeaway here is not that
we're trying to teach you how to do a
live blog or do a hands-on the point
here is you don't have to have the best
stuff or even necessarily the right
stuff you just have to have stuff that
you're really comfortable with and that
you've got a bunch of experience using
so that when you go in you don't panic
true it kind of reminds me of the videos
that you see on YouTube one day yeah
give a little Barbie camera to a
professional photographer send him out
in the field and he comes back with a
just glorious stuff you basically like
know how to use a camera
you have a structure for you no job
you're doing a hands-on and you just
kind of follow the same formula so
whichever instrument you use it doesn't
really matter way back in the day I
would used to talk about how the
difference between a coder and a non
techie person is when a coder runs into
a problem they don't be like all
technology sucks they just go in Google
and trying to figure out the answer and
literally everybody can do that and that
sort of can-do attitude applies to
really stressful situations where you
have to use technology and the only way
to be able to handle that and not be
totally frozen by technology failing is
to have spent a bunch of time using it
getting better at it and it's not about
being the best at it it's about having
experimented with it and having
experienced failures and dealt with it
so that when you experience failures in
a stressful situation you're fine you're
like oh well I've props all problems
before I could just do it again
yeah well been there right yeah I mean
we know I'll know what the lesson here
is right you know make me say it yeah
don't go into battle with an unproven
rifle raffle raffle thanks so much for
watching if you enjoyed this video I've
got another video that I think I like
even more is about slime mold which
sounds weird but it's actually amazing
because it was made by the folks over at
Virg science who have a whole new
YouTube channel and you should
definitely click somewhere to watch it
because you love it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
