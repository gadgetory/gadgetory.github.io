David Pierce and this would probably
look better shot on a Lumia 920 but
here's 90 seconds on the verge how bad
does Google want to do mobile payments
according to Android Police an upcoming
version of Google's wallet app outlines
the company's plan to offer a physical
card that can be programmed to mimic any
other credit or debit card it's not yet
clear put screenshots show withdrawal
and send money feature google of course
has no comment a UK Court of Appeal is
giving Apple 24 hours to rewrite a quote
untrue and incorrect public apology to
Samsung following its failed
infringement try the legally mandated
letter was posted on Apple's UK site
late last week with for additional
paragraphs about similar cases in the US
and Germany where Apple was victorious
it also referenced to judge saying
Samsung products were quote not as cool
as the ipad apple is now being ordered
to post the corrected statement on its
homepage we'll see how that goes finally
the FTC may soon be taking on Google in

from the FTC's year and a half long
investigation into Google search
business so you know that could be a
thing and that's it for today's top
stories on a personal note hurricane
sandy hit pretty close to home while
we're all safe and sound here at the
verge not everyone has been so lucky if
you'd like to help with hurricane sandy
relief please consider donating to the
Red Cross thank you and please be safe</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
