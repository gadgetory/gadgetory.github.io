camera for your honestly better off
using a smartphone but if you want
sharper pictures or if you really need
long zoom and more versatile performance
you're going to want a camera and you
might be surprised with how much camera
you can get for not a whole lot of money
what's the best you can do for 250 bucks
if you're looking for the best camera
you can get for under two hundred and
fifty dollars you should buy the Canon
Powershot SX 280 HS it strikes the right
balance of features performance ease of
use and picture quality and doesn't cost
a fortune to do it the SX 2 a DHS has a
long 20 times zoom lens to get you close
to the action a compact solid metal body
that can survive banging around in your
bag of your pocket a big bright display
for composing and reviewing your shots
12 mega pixels of resolution and a
variety of easy to use automatic and
manual modes for taking pictures as a
bonus it also includes Wi-Fi and a/c and
GPS so you can quickly send photos to
your smartphone for sharing on the go or
tag location data on your pics for
plotting on a map later on and it only
cost 199 dollars so you'll have enough
money left in your budget for a memory
card or two the SX 2 a DHS has accurate
color and takes good pictures in most
lighting conditions but it will struggle
a little in low-light that's just a fact
of life with all inexpensive cameras if
you want better you're going to have to
pay for a mirrorless camera or a premium
compact the SX 2 a DHS isn't the
smallest or lightest in the field and
it's battery life of 210 images per
charge isn't class-leading but it is
enough to last a day of shooting but if
you're looking for a cheap compact
camera that does more than your smart
phone the SX 280 HS is the one that you
should buy there's also the sony
cybershot WX 350 which offers many of
the same features as the canon in a
smaller lighter package and it lasts a
stunning 470 shots per charge
but the sony doesn't take as good
pictures indoors as a Canon and doesn't
offer any manual controls which can make
it easier to capture that picture of a
fast-moving 8 year old the sony is also
248 dollars almost $50 more than the
Canon and really pushing the envelope of
our budget and if you buy an SD card you
go over budget there's a huge number of
other cameras also in this category but
there's only a handful actually worth
looking at the Canon ELPH line has been
very popular for years because it's so
small but the latest model elf 3 4 ths
has a shorter zoom lens no manual
control
and worse image quality low light than
the SX 280 similarly nikon coolpix s
6800 is compact and cheap at 166 dollars
but it's short zoom lens slow focused
lack of controls and poor low-light
quality take it out of the running
Panasonic Samsung and Fuji film all also
have cameras in this category and they
all have big zoom lenses and relatively
compact sizes but they are all really
cheap feeling compared to the Canon and
in the case of the Samsung and Panasonic
took worse pictures in my tests and have
other quirks that make them not as nice
of a choice beyond that field there
isn't much else you should consider
cameras that are super cheap like under
150 dollars have shorter zoom lenses
typically terrible battery life lousy
video quality that doesn't even compare
to the video your smartphone takes and
are made with cheap feeling plastic they
don't even warrant a look but if you're
willing to spend $100 more you can
really get something worth your time an
inexpensive camera won't ever take
stunning photos in low light but they
can take better the photos on your
smartphone with many offering built-in
Wi-Fi you can quickly send those photos
to your phone for posting on Instagram
or Facebook the Canon SX to me DHS is
the closest thing to getting the best of
both worlds and you don't have to break
the bank and get it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
