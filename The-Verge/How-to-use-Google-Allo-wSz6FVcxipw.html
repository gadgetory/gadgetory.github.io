new chat app from them this summer and
it's the last day of summer good news
they kept their promise it's here this
is Google's alo now why do you need yet
another messaging app in your life
well Google's answer is that this app
has the Google assistant in it which is
a smart bot that you can have a
conversation with or it can join in your
other conversations with your friends
which is pretty neat but you should be
aware that at launch it's a preview
edition which means it can be a little
bit buggy first you can sell a low on
iPhones or Android phones and actually
that's it it doesn't work on tablets or
on desktop that's because a low is tied
to your phone number to know who you are
when you first sign up it's going to
send you a text message you confirm that
and then you associate it with your
Google account if you want to and then
honestly it's just a messaging app
texting works exactly like you'd expect
there are some cute features you can
drag up or down on the send button to
make your text really big or really
small sort of like a simple version of
what I message can do and yeah you can
have group conversations there are a ton
of sticker packs all made by artists
that Google hand shows you can get to
them by hitting this little plus button
here and you download them by hitting
this little button but you should keep
an eye out for the little play icons
inside the sticker packs they mean that
the stickers are animated now there's no
gift search here and there's no crazy
fullscreen animations like you can get
on iMessage
but on Android at least you can doodle
on top of your pictures before you send
them and on both phones there's an
option inside settings to save all the
images from your chat to your camera
roll automatically now you see these
little check boxes they tell you if your
messages are red white means sense
green means received and green with a
double checkbox means that it's been
read and you can long press on any
message to to see more details about it
now everything that you send an aloe is
stored on Google servers until you
delete them from your phone but if you
don't like that you can set up an
incognito chat and then all of your
texts are private and in
and then they don't show details and
notifications and you can even set an
expiration timer like this so that your
messages auto-destruct okay so those are
the basics but what about this assistant
thing well here's the deal there are two
basic ways to talk to the assistant the
first is just an ongoing chat where you
can just type or speak your questions
directly to Google's assistant the
assistant will then reply it with its
best answer and you can ask follow-up
questions so here's an example I can
type my team is the Vikings and now
Google knows that my favorite team is of
course the Vikings then I can type how
did my team do and then Google gives me
the answer right there in the chat okay
so look down here these little guys are
suggestion ships they show up in the
Google assistant and even in your normal
chats they try to guess what you're
going to want to say next and then you
can just tap them to say it so I'll tap
highlights and then I can watch a video
of the Vikings defeating the Packers
clearly Google's assistant knows what
matters here videos of the Vikings
feeding the Packers but where it gets
really interesting is in your chance you
can type at Google in a chat to have an
answer questions right inside your
conversation you can use it to settle a
bar bet or search or restaurants
together or even play an emoji game
oh there's one last thing you should
know with the assistant you see those
tiny little thumbs up thumbs down
buttons there those aren't actually for
feedback for when the assistant gets
something wrong or maybe right so you
can tap the thumbs down button and then
tell it how it screwed something up and
yo I got to tell you the assistant kind
of screwed up a lot Google is way better
at this AI stuff that basically anybody
else but somehow inside a chat when it
gets it wrong it feels a little bit more
frustrating than what it happens when
you say Siri or Google now is talking to
you and that's a low like I said it's a
perfectly good fast functional little
text messaging app for phones and
sometimes that assistant is pretty neat
too but I don't know if the assistant is
enough to get you to stop using hangouts
for iMessage or whatsapp or WeChat or
telegram or Facebook Messenger or
Twitter dams
