have Android on your wrist and now you
can have Android in your car announce
last summer Android auto is finally
rolling out into vehicles you can
actually buy and the Hyundai Sonata is
the first car to come with it shipped
from the factory it turns out the future
of your car is your phone for years the
center console in your car has been
dominated by the infotainment system
which controls everything from tuning
the radio to navigation to even managing
the climate control system in some cases
for the most part these have been
universally terrible confusing menus
slow performance and clunky UIs we've
all known for years that the best
navigation system for your car is your
phone but using it while driving can be
clunky and just unsafe Android auto is
goal is to present a clean familiar
interface in your car that keeps your
eyes on the road and your hands off of
your phone the way Android auto works in
this Hyundai is similar to how we work
in many cars instead of completely
replacing the vehicles native interface
Android auto runs as an app powered by
your phone it provides the processing
connectivity for the dash interface you
can't actually do anything with the
phone itself on a Hyundai's touch screen
you're presented with a familiar if
stripped-down version of Android 5.0
lollipop
there are five panels navigation phone
dialer information music and media and a
panel for diagnostic information about
your car which Hyundai isn't supporting
in this version but for the most part
Android auto wants you to use your voice
to do things so you keep your hands on
the wheel and your eyes on the road
navigation works exactly as you'd expect
powered by Google Maps and includes all
of the traffic info points of interests
and other features Google Maps has on
your phone with audible directions
coming through the car speakers you can
search for directions with your voice or
using an on-screen keyboard if the car
is in park and you can get info like
hours of operation and phone numbers for
business locations you can also push the
voice button and dictate text messages
which is way safer than trying to peck
them out on the phone screen while
driving the dialer will show the recent
call log from your phone and you can
turn calls with one tap or using your
voice to initiate the music and media
panel access to songs and podcasts from
apps and support Android auto the list
is pretty short right now but Google
Music Spotify and pocket casts are here
the media apps all have to conform to a
similar look and feel with large
touchable buttons and pared down lists
again the goal is to get you to use your
voice as much as possible
instead of scrolling through a list of
thousands of artists just push the voice
button and say play Baroness to start
streaming sweet sludgy jams in your car
it's not great for finding exact albums
or songs and perhaps unsurprisingly
voice control works much better with
google music than spotify play flo rida
front and center is a main dashboard
which shows the currently playing song
the point of destination if you have
navigation going the current weather
upcoming calendar appointments and
locations that you've recently searched
for it also shows incoming hangouts and
text messages but you can't actually
read them here's the message sweet Lambo
dog compatibility can be hit or miss
here the native SMS apps and some phones
don't work very well but Google's own
hangouts and messenger apps are pretty
reliable but what you won't ever see
here are alerts from email Instagram
Twitter Facebook or the many other apps
and services that ping your phone all
day long that's by design
Google paired this down to just the
things it thinks you'll need while
driving and nothing else that isn't to
say you can have some fun the full power
of Google Voice Search is on tap so
queries like what's the weather going to
be like this weekend and how old is
Jared Leto work just like they would on
your smartphone the system dictating
your answers aloud instead of displaying
them on the screen but managing your
calendar scrolling through your inbox
and playing candy crush will still
require you to pull over and disconnect
which is probably a good thing
Android auto can have some performance
issues during my testing I used a number
of different Android phones and some
perform better than others the platform
requires Android 5.0 lollipop which
instantly rules out a lot of older
devices in every case the phone gets
pretty warm when you're running Android
auto and even though it's plugged in
that doesn't guarantee your battery's
getting charged performance issues and
future limitations aside if you have an
Android phone you're probably gonna want
this in your next car I know I do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
