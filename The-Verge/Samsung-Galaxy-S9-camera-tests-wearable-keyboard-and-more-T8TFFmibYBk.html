the verdict added show so show where you
play this gadget all the time I am you
like to tell us Paul Miller hello we
have a packed show dancey friend
standing right here I'm here but wait
for Dan we have packed show them and
tell you all about it Dan we're gonna
talk about the DA cs9 which is here
Donnie is gonna join us we got a bunch
of new kinds of wacky musical
instruments to play with Paul
it just says you're gonna teach me how
to type that's what it says insulting
very confusing you've got a lot to learn
neela Jake and Ashley are gonna do a
circuit breaker we've also got some
videos to run the middle the very
exciting so some surprises segments
segments you know what those are called
packages the pros column package or the
packages we're gonna listen to our I FBS
through our IMS mm-hmm first we are
gonna talk about the GS 9 which is as we
said last week it came out last week at
Mobile World Congress in Spain
dan did our hands on video the launch
now you got him I got him so I think
we're on the top-down camera here right
I want to play a game
this is very good with you the YouTube
audience
I think this picks along the way these
are Galaxy S nines and Galaxy s8 hmm I
want you to type to me in this chat the
s nines are on there they're physically
located these are the small ones these
are the big ones the pluses and the
pluses and the regulars the s nines are
on one side and the S eights are on the
other side just type left or right which
ones do you think right there loft no
you have to guess so you just vote in
the chat here type left or right look
the right if you think which I think the
nines are they wouldn't let me the only
I did well let me flip them so the
pluses have two cameras is that some of
these phones have extra icons like this
one is like a weather but also it looks
like it's like a link like maybe you
connect to the cloud with that button I
don't know
so I'm assuming new phone
more feature that the ones with the
icons so therefore the two left ones are
ass knots that is my current theory I am
going to say that asking people to pick
a 50-50 choice is resulted in a 50/50
split most people are saying left okay
that's right now much people are saying
right okay oh man this is crazy okay
yeah they're saying the opposite of what
I'm saying there's several people are
saying what is the truth the point of
this is from this side they work a
virtual a dinner yeah all right so two
to give the answer so Paul I'm sorry
buddy so well you didn't I mean like
they basically do look exactly the same
there are some really minor differences
at the top you can see the s8 you can
see more of the front sensors they like
blacks them out more on the s9 Samsung
cost us more immersive
I call it maybe like Oh more sensors on
the s9 well there's the same amount of
sensors let's see that's the other thing
it's like technology wise they're
basically the same
there's same amount of sensors you just
can't see them as easily okay and then
the other difference which I don't know
if you can really tell from your angle
anyways but the s9 has a matte finish on
the metal frame and the S eights are
glossy so that's really the only front
difference and then the other one I
should say also the speaker grille on
the s9 is a single slot and the SI you
had this like but the other is stereo
which just means that it uses the
earpiece speaker as a speaker in
conjunction with the bottom speaker just
like the iPhone does HTC does bunch of
phones do that one of my favorite
features it's great yeah it's like the
fact that Samsung didn't have this until
now is kind of surprising like they're
actually catching up one very important
distinction on the back correct
so on the back the on the smaller models
the big distinction is the movement of
the fingerprint sensor was up on the
camera by the camera on the s8 it's now
down below on the s9 and then on the s9
plus you get a second camera so you've
got two cameras like you found on the es
no date last true for the price of one
you
well I'm sure except the largest crater
you get a free extra tip sure it's like
Costco all right so we people ask us
questions in the chat about these phones
we're just going through them number one
question I've got some tweets here this
surface is 80 today but the number one
question we got was about the cameras
how they work if there's better yeah
garbage what's interesting to me and we
were talking the show last week they
have now have a mechanical aperture
mm-hm so this can step down from they
can close the aperture it can open it's
wide open at 1.5 F 1.5
we're just brighter than any other set
the sort of on camera I think we've seen
yeah and then you can stop down to two
point four which is right so actually
the way it works by default is the
opposite it starts at 2 4 and then
Samsung software will open it up to 1.5
based on automatic settings but that's a
hardware thing that is a physical
Hardware switch you can see we're gonna
try and show you guys this on camera but
we're having a little trouble focusing
this earlier the right now it is wide
open let me open up the camera app it's
because if you go to the pro mode you
can alter this so it is wide open now
Paul let me know when you're ready yeah
and I'm gonna just I'm just toggling
between them what's your listings very
hard to take photos but there we go ok
so you can see it you can see it like
switching it's almost like me which is
which that's close so this is closed and
now it's open yeah open it's almost like
the filters dropped in you can't like
actually do any of the apertures in
between 1.5 and 2.4 it's one or the
other
and a fair like my mechanical lens is
going from between it's like you can
pick a range between well sure well no
but like you know one point five into
point four is roughly a full stop that's
you know in terms of light in terms of
photography so a lot of lenses will give
you third stops in between
that's kind of tangential the point is
this gives you more options than any
other phone on the market and so Samsung
says that when because the F 1.5 lens
lets in so much more light than the 1.7
on last year's phone that sometimes when
you're outside in really bright
conditions it's too much light and so
you close it down you let less light in
you get a better exposure the backwards
so so what do you what most what most
phones would do in a little bright
situation with the s8 does what pixel
does etc they're just gonna increase the
shutter speed so like it's the shutters
open for a shorter amount of time and
you get the same exposure even in bright
light the other thing that a smaller
aperture can do is give you a little bit
greater depth of field or more area in
focus but with phone sensors they're so
small you already have so much in focus
already there's really not much so our
friend Walt Mossberg tweeted me earlier
today
why do they're side by side test photos
I've seen so show so little difference
between two fixed aperture settings so
that's part of that is the depth of
field isn't really not that much
different and we've got a couple
examples I think we can pull up there
you can notice an exposure so if you
guys can see this this is shot at F 1.5
I don't remember the exact shutter or
aperture off the top my head so you can
see this is this is shot at F 1.5 if we
could switch to the 2.4 the next photo
now this is shot at F 2.4 with the same
shutter speed and the same ISO you can
see that it's much darker because you
have 2.4 let's in much less light so
it's about one stop of difference you
held all the settings constant just
switched it just switch the aperture for
that okay so if we go to the next photo
so this is at 1.5 again this is with
automatic ISO and automatic shutter
speed so what you would notice here is
that this part is is pretty blurred out
this is pretty blurred out in the
background and things like that but it's
sharp up front and if we go to the next
photo it's a little bit Morgan it's like
so this is shot at of 2.4 with automatic
is on automatic speed so the camera
compensated for the smaller aperture by
raising its ISO or sensitive we go
we go back one photo yeah what's
interesting to me so most when you think
about shooting in low light you want
that wide open aperture to let in more
light and more light so you can have a
fast shutter speed it's not exactly yep
Samsung is saying literally the opposite
here well they're saying that mechanical
aperture is to know is to knock it down
in bright light yeah it's funny that
they're that they're pitching it that
way because if you use the camera in
automatic mode it defaults to the F 2.4
aperture and only opens it up when it
needs to whereas like most automatic
cameras are going to open up the blends
as far as they can go and only close it
down when they need to yeah like you
were saying but the camera works a
little backwards in that in automatic
mode which is kind of weird and then the
other thing I would say if we can take
this fullscreen I just what everyone to
look at this photo it's hard I know on
YouTube there's all kinds of compression
happening but if you just look at this
photo it's still to my eye looks like a
Samsung photo and say Samsung photos
we've now done so many photo comparisons
you can just see it they're hyper
processed they're a little bit more
crisp yeah I we do all kinds of
processing to smooth things out the
noise on this is really good like this
was indoors at a coffee shop obviously
it's not the best light in the world but
there's like this is at F 1.5 and the
noise reduction is really good that's
one of the things that Samsung worked on
this year is to reduce the noise but
it's still like you said has that
Samsung look and I think a lot of that
has to do with the way it processes
things the way the color is rendered
mostly and and you know certain times
that Samsung look looks great
certain portraits look really nice with
that and other times you know it's
different I don't have a pixel
comparison here with like skin like one
of the Samsung problems sometimes will
just smooth over so on the rear camera
it doesn't do that as much on the front
camera by default it smooths your skin
out and it's dry you can turn it off but
like deep by default it's gonna like
totally make up your face basically so
we should talk about the front camera
suit because the back game was really
interesting Ruben and the chat is asking
pixel to excel or Galaxy S line
regarding the front facing today so the
interesting about think about the front
facing camera is exactly the same as
last year it's the same 8 megapixel
camera it has autofocus it's basically
like the only camera on the market
has autofocus on the front and it does
have a portrait mode but it's not as
good as the pixel two is earning with
the iPhone hence in my opinion but you
can see if we can switch to the front
cameras selfie so by default it can't
will adjust your skin tone and adjust
the color and so like it'll it'll in
like it yeah I don't like the front
camera
I really don't it really really can
really let your skin and then it has
what they call selfie focus which is
their portrait mode on the front yeah so
would you say it like overall I mean
you've only had it for a few days yeah
but it seems largely the same with the
addition of a wide-angle lens and it's
like an S 8.5 yeah like I mean it's it's
the it's the iPhone 6s right it's the
iPhone 8 it's it's the same design they
upgraded the internals with newer more
modern stuff they added a few things
that you don't have on the prior model
but it looks the same it feels the same
if you close your eyes it's like you're
using you know deshauan the chat just
point also focused on your no not ch
no not Samsung one of the few
manufacturers this year knowing with
this symmetrical design watch end a
headphone jack and a headphone jack so
you don't don't need to get you could
just take these and like them to hell
get out of here yeah I feel like my
decision hasn't been made why would I
get any other phone in the world if
they're not gonna have a headphone jack
and I mean I this the s8 I will say the
s7 in the SI well the SI I think was
prettier - the fingerprint sensor I
think they set a standard for front
design mm-hmm Apple had to meet that
with the 10 way they did it notch a side
thing but no one else is close even the
pixel it's not just as a smaller pixel
like I don't know it's like the level of
fit and finish are really nice to like
it's a very well polished this is
something important to me because I I do
kind of want I'm kind of looking for an
Android phone I want a smaller phone and
the pixel
is notoriously bezel forehead and chin
have a big big big for its any metric is
insisting that we now use ya screen to
body ratio yes which makes me want to
die
what's your screen about something so
great it's beautiful hardware the
cameras a Samsung camera people if you
like it you're gonna love it
right it's gonna be improved I think
you're like me and you know I think the
iPhone in the pixel are just a little
bit nicer it's really comes down to the
look and like if you don't didn't like
the look before you're not gonna like it
now it's like an aesthetic choice but
it's here's what we always say about
Samsung phones great hardware most
features so you stick around for big
speed running this software and like
it's just the same as ever right there's
two web browsers yeah so few messaging
apps there's two assistance to web
browsers to to to app stores to gallery
apps to email apps to payments apps
things like that like and certain things
are better than Google's like Samsung's
internet browser I've been sitting for a
while is better Samsung pay is better
than Android pay but the point is like
most of them are not better and then
like you have to have both so like it's
a whole bunch of folder of Google Apps
and a whole folder samsung absence like
nice that you can corral them like that
but like we got to talk about it to
assistance on the phone and to
assistance right one of which is a maps
to a hardware button yeah there's the
big speed button okay so this is Bixby
home which is basically like Google now
one of our great reporters editors said
the big forgotten is hardware bloatware
that's where he's at with Vic's okay
tell us what they're trying to be
unimproved so it's it's gotten a little
bit of a facelift it's a little nicer to
look at but who cares and it's it's
slightly faster but it's still slow and
then in the camera app Bixby vision they
call it where's that has gotten a couple
of new features you can do makeup with
it which is kind of crazy
so you can do like different so there I
am
and then I can like buy that makeup
directly from Sephora horse are you
kidding me why else would it exist wait
go back to the makeup looks this is
great yeah so there's that you know it's
got some you know text things or
whatever but for the most part it's
still Bixby it's still weird
it's don't lower than Google assistant
so let's just try this it's voice of
Texas not as good its whole thing is
that it can actually operate the phone
for you yeah we're supposed to be able
to operate the phone for you so you can
be like turn Wi-Fi off and it opens it
settings
oh nice turn Wi-Fi on wait it's great
turn Wi-Fi on and then Dan was showing
me earlier we can just tweet from his
account Twitter and tweet I love Bixby
it's my favorite that's not great
oh we got fucking experience points it
didn't do that at all so that's that's
like the greater pitches of big speeds
that it can go into your apps and do
things keep your voice right there it
has been trained on my voice so Dan you
do a tweet about how much fun you're
having being on the show okay here's
some ideas my good friends Paul of me
like they're great to hang out with your
damn just do this we open Twitter and
tweet I love Paul and Neil I great Paul
enable great yes is everything oh there
you go so there's a part I was expecting
a big speaking there's a part of you
that says it's upcoming it's like it can
do
actually controls my big problem with it
is that it's slower than just using the
phone hmm like it's easier to open
Twitter and just type that out and
here's the other problem I'm just me
reload everybody every time I hear the
word fix like this is a high-end
beautiful polished device and the
assistant is named Vic speed which
literally makes me think of a dog
wearing shoes who is a butler it's like
a clippie it's like Sam we've been
telling you on average has forever and
last week I asked people to send me
pictures of a dog wearing shoes and
producer Creighton literally started a
tumblr Bigsby shoes tumblr calm and we
have a lot of fan art of Vic's PE here's
who's this one this is I don't have a
name on this one here's one this is
great Paul here's your cheater ass
submission
yeah I didn't draw anything okay it's
just a look really good fun it's a good
photo here's this is my favorite by far
Ricky tweeted this one of me I this one
looks like he opened a door that's a
phone I like my phone I think he's
walking out of a smart Samsung
Refrigerator yeah that's great
this one's pretty good he's holding a
tray that says stuff and this last one
this is great so here's the art this is
from Cameron on Twitter but then he
showed us his process which was a video
which he the dog the dog it's a real
toss-up you you tell me who should win
the prize we have a clear winner is a
Cameron yeah I have to say I'm more
impressed with Bixby than I expect it to
be but I would prefer to just turn it
off yeah so you can turn it off now
you can actually go into settings you
can turn off what they call pics be home
but you can also turn off the button so
now the button does nothing but you want
to remap natively no there are apps in
the Play Store that you can download and
will let you remap it until Samsung
pushes an update and then it breaks and
you
all dance again well it seems Samsung
does not give you a native way to remove
it so it just basically becomes a fidget
button oh yeah but between this and you
know the pixel and the fourth fine pixel
these those feel like the old man droid
phones plan everybody else is doing bad
weird notches there's a lot of notches
out there and I say I'm not gonna buy an
android phone with a notch that it I
understand why maybe maybe I would if
this is so good but this does seem to be
a very good phone it's an excellent just
loaded with Samsung software yeah we've
got to decide if there the other thing
is that like you can't rely on Samsung
to get the next version of Android any
time soon so like I'm gonna get this
name wrong I apologize Johan in the chat
says is the Irish scanner compared to
comparable the SI is a quicker are the
same it's the same they do have a new
feature that they call intelligent scan
which combines I were scanning with
their face scanning function and will
determine which one to use based on your
conditions it's very obvious you're
trying to eat face ID but it's still
slow it's still kind of clumsy and
awkward but thankfully the fingerprint
scanner is easier to use so yeah you saw
the fingerprint scanner so I'm not
totally like you know what about
Samsung's emoji they're real bad yeah
let's look at these real quick and then
we got it so we they're called AR emoji
and they're that is supposedly made you
it doesn't believe any special tech it's
just using the front-facing camera so
you can see the tracking is pretty it's
just creepy and the tracking is really
bad and things like that
here's Ashley I can be Ashley I think
Ashley's looks way better than mine
yours looks like a real jerk well I
guess that's that's very and then
they've got these weird animals I don't
think no this one is but that one is
like a stone dangling to the waist one
what what is that I I think it's a bear
I don't know I got yours up here so
usually an evil cat compared to what
Apple's doing with an emoji which is
very restricted inside of messages an
emoji are not in the camera app on the
iPhone right it's inside of messages
they're actually hard to get out of
messages this is just in a camera yeah
so I could take a picture
some more record I think you'll see more
of this crazy machinima stuff yeah it's
just easier to get out of really creeped
out the other thing that it does is it
creates all these reaction gifts based
on like it creates your an emoji and it
makes a whole Pixar's Pixar's got a new
food and it's about like parachute like
sports people right and so a studio
rushes to market and that's a direct to
DVD release of their fake knockoff
parachutes sports people movie I call
this stuff samsung couldn't help itself
we're gonna take a break from the s9 for
a minute at the very end of the show
Dan's gonna come back we're gonna take
your phone calls
dangerous with your questions at the end
of the show Dan will be back to answer
those questions I'm excited to see how
that goes
next mmm Paul I'm told that you ruined
one of Dan's home video about it here's
my big fear I don't like do pranks on
people because I don't want to be
pregnant and I broke my own rule but Dan
was really chill about it so please
watch this video of what I'm calling it
watch this way back with a circuit
breaker hello I'm Paul Miller welcome ok
Dell says it's new XPS 13 won't be
stained by mustard or permanent marker
guess who got a Dell XPS 13 today dan
cifra and guess who has mustard mustard
dad's at lunch look at this beautiful
laptop be a shame if somebody put must
let's give a shake a little bit there a
little bit there
okay just a little bit oh look at that
beautiful Dan will never know nobody has
to tell the hmm
just comes right off
okay that was some that was and nobody
has to know okay all right I'm here with
the world's bravest human Ashley Carmen
Ashley thinks I should leave the mustard
on the laptop you definitely should
leave the mustard on the laptop
what if Dan hurts me okay okay so I just
put the mustard on just walk away
yes okay this is um this is how peer
pressure works you just do what other
people tell you to do okay that's so
clean oh gosh
that's the gross that's the grossest
thing
before you sit down hey how do you feel
how do you feel I'm honestly a little
grossed out it's disgusting right it's
filthy do you guys think it'll steam
here you go this white texture finish on
the XPS 13 is is mustard proof and now
I'm regretting telling Paul that for
obvious reasons it's on the internet
anybody can read it just a few minutes
what kind of mustard are we looking at
here you're supposed to be able to leave
it on for up to a week well you know in
the few minutes that's been here I see I
see no no issues I apologized oh but you
guys did this to yourselves
so dude are you you're not mad at me I'm
never mad at you Paul this is this is
what true camaraderie and friendship
looks like everybody and smells like
smells like mustard smells disgusting
that was beautiful content
it's really beautiful I'm an enabler and
I feel good about it what other laptops
are good for muster your honor you
should just put it on every laptop that
should be our test the Verge's signature
laptop test you're the bestest yeah
mustard test yeah essential all right
now it's your time for the best part of
the whole show right it's a circuit
breaker
so you've premiered this one a couple
weeks ago and now we're on our third
week we're here last week you asked us
many questions we picked them out one of
the questions we have is actually demand
we'll get to it though and we want you
to keep asking us questions so please
tweet at us you can leave comments on
the YouTube video like go for it and the
chat you could go on Instagram we have
so many places you can reach us just
send us a message ask us a question Jake
and I are here we're here to answer your
questions
perfectly nicely but you know yeah I
mean we take questions in any form it's
true all right
so our first demand or actually
complaint is that last week we talked
about Nintendo's the Nintendo switch in
various accessories we didn't end up
getting to the cases and I'm sorry about
that
but I've brought a couple cases here
with me today to explain to you how you
should look for a Nintendo switch case
so I own a Nintendo switch and I
actually don't have a case but that's
just because I'm a rebel and I don't
respect my gadgets and it's fine
dangerous I've carried it your helmet on
a case and my backpack and just let it
kind of jostle around in this noggin
they don't do that just don't do that so
I pulled a couple of my co-workers who
are way more responsible than me
particularly creighton who is our show
producer and he recommended this case
the unique hardshell case I've actually
taken this case to Mexico with me before
he let me borrow it during a family
vacation and so things great and the
thing to note about this case and I
think the reason Creighton chose it is
one it has hard shells it's protective
also it has a sleeve here where you can
put different game cards and there's a
pocket so you can keep a massive battery
which is what Creighton does or joy con
or whatever else you want to keep in the
pocket I will say that while this is
protective it has lots of room it is
massive and pretty
took out my entire carry-on so you know
if you have space go for it but if you
don't have space I talked to Chris Welch
a news editor here at The Verge and he
has this case from a company called Tom
talk that's the commuter slim case it's
way thinner but it's a little hard but
definitely not as hard as the unique one
you'll see in here there's no pocket so
that's what it's missing it does have a
little game card slot here but there's
no place for you to keep a battery
really his switch isn't here right now
so those key things I think you'll want
to look for if you're looking for a case
is that pocket if it's important to you
if you think you're gonna carry external
batteries or something like that or if
you plan on carrying enjoy cons if not
if you're just like purely a commuter
you're on the train or something like
that maybe you just want a slim case
that's light and easy to carry around so
we have both options for you here that
case looks fantastic for just throwing
in your bag yeah this is great like this
is definitely what I would be worried
about yeah this is what I would go with
purely to keep your screen protected I
would never carry I don't I can't it's
like a pelican case of like switch it's
like it's huge its massive so next we
have a pair of questions about Android
Go Android Go is Google's new
stripped-down version of Android it's
meant for phones that are really low-end
like under $100 came out on a bunch of
phones last week and we've got a couple
questions the first is whether go apps
are available on other phones and so
part of Android Go is it's not just the
operating system it also is bundled with
a whole bunch of apps that are supposed
to be optimized for lower end hardware
so that they'll run better and the
answer is sort of yes and no some of the
apps are available some are not the good
news is that two of my favorite apps are
available the first one is files go you
can download this on any phone and you
really should it's it's like basically
the file explorer that Google should
have included with Android but didn't it
recommends files for you to delete and
it just is a really easy way to look
through all the images the songs and so
on on your device that you have probably
forgotten about so this is really great
the other one is called date Holly and
it's not strictly a go app but it's
gonna be on some go phones and it's made
by the same team inside Google that
makes the go apps and this one is for
tracking your data usage unless you
quickly see how much each of your
different apps are using up lets you you
know lock them so you can say I don't
want to Instagram to use any data right
now or and it'll only work over Wi-Fi it
is really easy to use it's another good
one if you're trying to make sure that
your device doesn't you know use up too
much stuff so the other question we had
is why isn't Google just making all of
its apps optimized so they run faster I
think that's a really good question
because you know some apps get really
really heavy but the reason why that goo
why Google hasn't done this with all
this apps is because some of the you
know it is optimizing them but optimized
is like a really big broad word and so
in some cases that means stripping
features out if you try Maps go wood you
can download a new device it's just like
Google Maps but worse you just should
not download it but if you try Google go
you'll find a completely different
experience because it's been customized
for different markets where people are
just coming online and the search box
looks basically as foreign as a command
line so you're gonna get different
experiences in different places the only
unfortunate thing is I wish that YouTube
Go was available in other areas I think
that's another reason that you're not
seeing these expanded YouTube go has
some of the paid features that you find
in YouTube red so I'm sure there's sort
of a monetary thing in there too that's
for us be sure to you sent us more
questions for next week and now over to
da me with some musical calculators Hey
Tommy's here everybody she's more of the
musical calculators you have like a
selection of crazy new instruments I
have so many fun wacky musical
instruments I want to show you guys
I'm gonna save musical calculators for
last save the best for last
but we're going to start with the
otamatone I think a lot of people might
recognize this this has been around
since 1998 which is kind of surprising
I've never seen one of these in my life
okay
does this sound familiar to you so this
is created by a Japanese design firm yes
he's got a little face like he's saying
hello to you but yeah we have a picture
of me ah danke the Japanese design firm
behind the otamatone and that's them
right there they're super dope as you
can see I don't think you can buy that
one but the the automatron is available
in different sizes and colors I think
they have like little keychain versions
of it can you play a song on this I
personally cannot you can try if you
want to but there's three you can play
it in three different pitches so you can
set it to low mid or high high is like
kind of mid and I'm gonna hand this over
to you and maybe you can play a little
song for us a little bit earlier and
think about the last time that somebody
invented a new instrument like
straight-up just invented like an analog
instrument that's what Yamaha did last
year with the Vinoba this is like a
cross between a recorder and a saxophone
and they like to market it as a casual
wind instrument as well as you can see
on the screen there you just take Nick's
like on the go yeah what makes it casual
is easy to play or is it like globe mate
it's like super lightweight it's like
made of plastic I think so it's
waterproof I played it in the rain if
you want take it anywhere
go back to that one this one is weird
because she's like you suck at the
vanilla this one is carrying a duck yes
I just I don't know that you want to
just roll around like throw it in your
purse oh you never know when someone's
gonna asked you to play the vanilla bar
yeah I personally I don't know how
Yamaha offered is done someone who and
you gotta play but you Crichton our
producer was like we got instrument
before my life but yeah this uses like a
synthetic like plastic Reed if you play
like a clarinet or saxophone like you
should be able to pick this up pretty
easily
is that a docking you're like no this is
$99 which i think is a pretty good price
disposable necessarily call it
Yamaha introduces the disposable
saxophones lightweight you know it's no
pressure but yeah I'm really excited to
get to these musical calculators I
ordered these from Aliexpress these are
my personal calculators
it's the AR 7 7 7 8 you can also order
it on Amazon for 20 bucks but it's
everything's in Chinese I had a little
bit of trouble reading reviews from some
youtubers yes so I found this on
youtuber called it's a small world and
this person is like a master at it she
was playing for calculators at a time
she was playing like the Super Mario
theme song so thank you to her for being
my inspiration I think I've seen this
video and it is absolutely amazing
amazing so
Wow okay so you can play like almost two
octaves as you can see the time and date
is here
maybe that's all shake everybody close
your eyes remember January 1 2005
full-throated us what was happening I
have no I was doing I was in high school
so yeah yeah anyway you can also use
this as an alarm clock so you can wake
up to the sweet sounds of a calculator I
also want to point out that every time
you put in batteries it places jaunty
tune or is it supposed to be yeah you
can absolutely do that it's just like
for accountants with dreams are they
sneak into work I just bring my regular
important important note on that is
their headphone jack I will be taking
your requests in the chat there are some
sheet music just a bunch of numbers no
way yeah it's a lot of songs I have it
any size I reckon you know maybe Chinese
in the comments can tell us but yeah
they gave us all a lot I mean there's
one with a lot of six six sixes oh okay
that's the devil's music yeah yeah so
you have to kind of play around with it
and now we're back to the songs they
don't play the calculator um yeah so I
can play Smash Mouth um All Star
I've never been more excited so you wait
you've labeled this one yes so this one
I'm really trying to learn this I
labeled it with my post-it know it's
still raining fossil s you know I'm
gonna try by the way Rashad request
sandstorm which is obvious we got more
you got more people cliffs of Dover and
then Funkytown isn't here nah I'm
leaving my dog I'm gonna become a
musical calculate I would like to the
verge that if you were going to quit the
way to do it is to show up on the show
future careers that calculate I'm
talking my hidden talents
incredible Express if you're willing to
wait three weeks 20 on Amazon
alright and then what's the channel I
should check out to watch people like
freaking out on oh it's a small world
also I saw somebody do a duet with
himself with this Disney cutters oh yeah
really polygons video editor is really
good at playing the Vinoba yeah yeah
okay
that was incredible thank you so much
Tommy if you don't know Ashley actually
hosts a great podcast called why'd you
push that button with Caitlyn Tiffany is
also an emergen there's they did a first
season 2 episodes you can go listen to
you right now their second season
started today mm-hmm and we have a
little trailer for it so we're gonna
watch that when I come back and then
Paul just keeps threatening to teach me
how to type which is something I already
know how to do basically the next mom is
speakin so watch this we're gonna come
back and play some key words
have you ever ghosted someone so I'm not
proud of it it's very immature of me
this is a pretty typical New York
hosting story he was ten minutes away on
his way
texting me and he ghosted this shit I
mean yeah it was fun I had a nice time
but I mean I know that was really good I
wasn't really looking for a relationship
or anything really bad a lot of people
he was like text me and then he was just
like keep texting me and then at one
point I realized he was having a
complete conversation with himself one
on one day and I thought the day went
really well so then when she goes to
does never really love people do it to
me because I think it's a big part of my
anxiety where I'm like I always need to
have an answer like God chairmat like so
then he found me on Facebook and then he
found me on Instagram and then he found
me on LinkedIn part of you is it's like
are you dead maybe something actually
bad happened like months into the
relationship he dressed like throbbed
all ties
I've never really had a terrible date or
I've had so little respect for a person
and I was gonna stop talking to them
because thought this isn't worth it I
realized I was completely incapable of
telling people that I didn't want to see
them again
I feel like there are tears too ghosting
first date you're fine
second date I feel like me you can do it
beyond that I feel like you're in
dangerous territory I've been like
minorly ghost it on before and every
time I'm just like so my message like
you know what if you don't want to hang
out like that's cool there's a lot of
strategy involved if you're wondering
what to say like I just didn't feel the
spark cuz that's kind of it's not like a
bad thing about them never gave in never
again I will not give in will not
why'd you push that button is my
favorite podcast on this planet if you
must absolutely listen to it also I have
been a horrible ghost in the past I just
want I wanted you feel like I ghosted
you but you went into this other
emotional zone no I was like didn't do
the bit that hit me really hard
oh you were ghosting I was trying to get
in you were supposed to react a deeply
emotional point this is a the tap a tap
strap sometimes is called I think it's
just called tap it's a weary honey
energy fronts again at the end of all
this we're gonna take your calls
let's get the number on the screen oh
yes nine questions Dan's gonna come back
and when answer your questions from
called is a one eight four four four
emotion yeah we'll see okay I came up
with them come back all right this is
the tap and wearable keyboard it's a
bluetooth keyboard and mouse the mouse
part is not true yeah but uh so you you
tap to type so like like this is AEIOU
there's different combinations of
fingers like D em Z so I'll do a little
my current on my phone oops but we've
already started so this is like a little
speedrun just type in ooh this is pretty
is really gonna keep like a virtual
keyboard in front of you are you
courting it chords I'm making shapes
with my hands it's like almost like just
shares a little bit but they're taps and
so I'm gonna make the right wanted it's
almost like sign language in a sense
well I mean the double digits very
reason why is that like so I've got some
some phones with keyboards remember
there was a time when parents had
keyboards I think the weird Android
sidekick they made yeah this is a very
strange phone or blackberries remember
blackberries the anyways you could feel
what you were typing mhm
with a software keyboard you can't and
so if you want to input text on your
phone you can always use your voice but
if you want a discreet way to input text
Moberly but what I'm really excited
about is is wearable computers like
stuff like Google glass or whatever the
future holds for what we're gonna
actually wear on our face and will we
have discreet text input or will we
always be using our voice so this is
obviously we're not going to do this
joke I think I was like 2008 okay this
is the twiddle ur keyboard this is in a
sense of a very simple concept you're
making finger combinations to make the
letters out of a limited set of keys it
also has a joystick for use as a mouse
and this was used by a lot of the
wearable computing I think we have a
photo yeah so right here this is my
personal hero fad starter who has been
basically using a Twitter keyboard and a
will wearable computer since I don't
know the 90s wow this is Steve man these
are very very very important people
they're still working on photos from the
90s
yes that's very nice looking at sort of
the Birkenstock should finish on the
jeans over there place them you know
people always say the 90s are back like
it right this this could totally be on
my Instagram right now okay okay so
anyways this could be the keyboard that
I've been looking for
yeah it's a tab keeper so I want you
that I want you to try it yeah I'm into
it
I'm gonna teach you how to type since
we've been teasing that this whole time
all right there you go so you got some
brass knuckles they just go past the
knuckle here yeah all the way up up here
it comes in two sizes and it's comical
you really really need this is the large
and and it's infinity war okay
okay so here okay a little tutorial okay
so what you wanna do is you're gonna
float three four and five
okay alright alright so then temple five
to proceed there you go okay all right
doesn't work perfectly so this is this
is one of my biggest problems with it
now you try to curb curve I want you to
heroin yeah so it's not like you're
typing on a virtual keyboard you're kind
of making these gestures but this
tapping is very important and sometimes
because it's you know it's using motion
detection to figure this out sometimes
it doesn't quite figure it out and so I
think this like learning system is
amazing it built you like learn some of
the letters in time it could get
mnemonics you're doing figuring is
already hacking my very quickly becomes
let's do some new letters you've got
this one so that's a e i o u so let's do
in TLS basically the okay the more
common letter is the easier it is to
there's a songs really great songs but
the print in so because really good
positive reinforcement you get it right
and really good negative reinforcement
when you get it wrong but sometimes you
make the correct shape but you've just
moved in some slightly incorrect way and
it can make it hard
you got this space is all five fingers
at once it's the period is a double
space like a mobile so why would you so
this is like here oh wait okay okay okay
okay yeah doing it yeah
I mean that's annoying when it gets a
problem it's weird how quickly that I
seem to have learned to this alright it
just goes right into your braid yeah so
we're Neela and I are both left-handed
you can you have to switch it with
software to which hand it's gonna be on
so but if you learn it on the right hand
it's mirrored so thumb is a index finger
is a key middle fingers eye so forth
this is weird it's weird how quickly
whoa oh you're type of words now you're
basically a typist you can type words
like laughs sass so how much is this
thing this is a hundred and fifty
dollars yeah and there's a bunch of
different apps for from mobile there's
like they have games they have this
these learning apps like they've kind of
reinforced both like the physical
capability and the actual typing
capability I mean just that was weird
that I figure out you ever watch you
play video game on the show I'm usually
bad at them but that was weird well
someone pointed out to me that in a
sense it's kind of like learning guitar
chords okay it is a chording keyboard a
sense okay I'm gonna do the ultimate
test I'm gonna try to type on my laptop
yeah
and I'm also gonna try to pair something
on bluetooth we're gonna get a sign that
says days since last place you fail
because we're it like one Hey okay so
there's a few things here so like these
three fingers is delete returned it's
kind of weird
they're inter so I'm gonna also really
don't like how to type my name so the P
is kind of a weird shape so P a you
is so your idea is G is a tough one is
that what yep God Wow
so I've been practiced for about a
weekend okay on Friday the idea here is
that you wear a computer on your face
and you and I type and you so you just
walk up to service here's the thing I'm
using this hard surface right on their
commercial they use it on a lot of soft
surfaces like they're using it on like
someone does it under a table on her
knee or someone does it on his arm
so like and I especially the more
complicated letters are really hard to
do on soft surfaces which kind of almost
ruins the entire point I think about
Twitter it doesn't matter what the
surfaces but for this you want to be
able to take notes while you're just out
and about hanging out yeah and you can't
really do it oh the other thing I wanted
to show you the mouse okay should I ask
this is the optical sensor so this
surface is what slides on the table and
it just does not work so just like now
it's typing accidentally there's like a
right-click there's a scroll gesture I
had the inventor of this demoed it for
me if he could barely use the mouse he
kept on saying it's really impressive
how good mice are these days as an
excuse for why this is so bad but it's
really hard to use as a mouse so that's
kind of a bummer to you okay
well I'm excited about this hopefully
they can keep improving it with software
there'll be some software updates yeah
and I'm gonna I'm gonna keep practicing
maybe do a little bit of typing on the
go like okay Dan is back that was cool
the taps I'm very interested in like new
input new interface ideas Dan is back he
just wandered over to the archives Oh to
get the phones and I am told we have a
call look you want to call us you can
call eight four four four three six
six eight four six we'll take your
questions call her on the line
talk to us yeah we told we have to wait
we'll see we'll see if we can use this
phone technology all right caller talk
to us oh hi I just had a question about
the same thing dog vf9 camera yeah okay
so my question is how in the marketing
they're talking about how it the cameras
like reimagine I just wanted a Batman
that the phone was actually like the
camera was actually much better than
made high-end smartphone cameras but it
was just like the frame that the camera
is the camera hardware which we bob yeah
hey what's your name man goal always you
saying it cool oh sorry a little fuzzy
all right cool I'm what Danny answer
this one but I'm gonna tell you my gut
instinct is that as just a marketing
tagline so yeah that's the thing with
marketing you have to understand it's
all marketing so Salmons gonna are
Samsung's gonna try and market this as
heavily as it possibly can and use all
the words at once
the reality is they have done a lot of
work on the camera it's not just the new
switchable lens they do have a new
sensor that is a lot of more processing
on the sensor itself to do reduce noise
and image artifacts and things like that
and it also does things quicker on the
sensor to do that kind of processing so
it should produce better images than the
s8 or last year's phones is it
dramatically better than any other front
of the market no is it better at all the
other is it better than pixel to what
would you know it's a lot of personal
preference at this what would you say
reimagined refers to I believe what
they're referring to is the ability to
switch the aperture because that is that
is an entirely new thing that we have
not seen on other smartphones these do
have image stabilization on both the
front and the rear cameras so at that
all I carries over from the sa optical
image stabilization yep yeah I think the
thing to me as well thing is having the
mechanical aperture
for so long the thing with smartphone
cameras was to make them better to make
them more like DSLRs we don't have the
physical space to move light around like
a DSLR we're gonna have to do this all
in software and figure it out we're
gonna add a lens to get a depth effect
we're gonna do all this other stuff and
now we're starting to see actual
physical camera features and show up in
these cameras but for not the reasons
that you would otherwise expect yeah
yeah I mean if it was like you know I
really feel like the the mechanical
aperture is more of a marketing tool for
this the phone looks exactly the same as
last year as we pointed out before so
Samsung needs something to market this
phone with and mechanical aperture we
have a question Thank You Cole
appreciate thanks Cole Gabriel asked the
chat is a larger aperture work for video
yes yeah I haven't really done ton of
testing with that is how much control
you have but it definitely will do it in
the automatic modes let's see if we can
do
all right well cam break it out that's a
great question not here I've got the
controls here so I'm gonna open it up to
F 1.5 I'm gonna shoot some video now
once it's in video and recording it you
can see very faintly then we get this on
the black there you can see it set to
1.5 but I can't actually change that in
a video recording once I stopped
recording I can switch to F 2.4 and
record a new clip at F 2.4 but I can't
switch on the fly okay victor says his
face unlock Plus iris scanner combo work
well I think the real question is does
it work as well face it you know it's
slow and annoying and the other thing
that it does is we don't have it set up
right now is that it shines a red light
so you know on the on the iPhone it
doesn't infrared thing and our cameras
can pick that up if we put new eyes
iPhone here you can see but you can see
it flashing on the camera on the Samsung
phones
it actually flashes and you can see it
so you set that up we have all from our
friend Sam Scheffer Sammy are you in the
line I am here hello
I'm doing well
watching the show live I just I'm
curious do you think this new aperture
and smartphone thing is a trend or is
this sort of like every time every
smartphone now has two cameras is
Apple's new iPhone going to have a you
know variable aperture camera and then a
kind of a follow-up is do you think
we'll ever see interchangeable lenses on
smartphone I don't think it's gonna be a
trend simply because the benefits are
not manifest like like the it is it
feels really like a purely marketing
thing with the two dual cameras that
we're seeing a lot of phones I disagree
with you the camera but why would you
ever switch it to F 2.4 just keep it at
5 because having a wide open aperture
you do lose some detail you lose some
sharpness right like they keep it closed
more often than not and I think that is
to increase the depth of field but as we
saw in the examples the difference in
the depth of field is minimal at best
yeah and also the difference in my
experience the difference in sharpness
is imperceptible what about the most
important question that Sam asked so
here's my worry with this thing for real
it's my 6s died not for any particular
reason
except I dropped it and the mechanical
the focus well it wasn't like to die for
software or like the battery died in
slow down it was literally the moving
part in a camera that focused it started
grinding
and just a phone that was at the end of
the phone yeah having moving parts and
phone scares me and I think we've seen
this endless trend to get rid of every
moving part I would instead of
interchangeable lenses on cameras I'd
rather have a battery door and a
replaceable battery you're not gonna get
the no so I think like moment is I know
that's you use a bunch of
interchangeable lenses in your existing
phone right alright Sam yeah yeah yeah I
think that those companies don't have a
field day because it's specialized yeah
I think the real race is getting more
light into these sense
so Samsung has done one thing I think
there's a reason that they had to build
a mechanical aperture ring to close it
down because I think you want it closed
more often than not even though it
dances you can't see it different but I
think the real race is what Google is
doing with automatic HDR I think apples
gonna do its own tricks but they're all
doing multi frame processing now where
they capture a bunch of frames stack
them together to reduce noise increase
detail things like that
Google pioneered that Apple does it
Samsung doesn't know they say they're
doing into a greater central us nine it
like you said that the real enhancements
are gonna be on this office because cuz
there's a physical limit to how much you
can how far you can go with the so call
it now just the the 2018 iPhone copy
Samsung with this aperture thing I would
say no I said I sincerely dad I think
Apple Apple will find a way to mock this
they will find a way to say we don't
need to add moving parts to the phone we
can do this with our software that's I
mean that's just the way they'll just go
in with like a 1/4 lens instead and just
say hi Samsung
maybe I mean like again like we are
saying from at the beginning when we're
looking in comparison photos these
photos still look like Samsung photos I
think Apple is very happy with the way
it's photos look and they've been happy
since the iPhone 6 right I mean they've
been putting iPhone photos on billboards
and being like look at how great these
photos are for just five years so anyone
I think is gonna be tough I think
Apple's bigger challenge is the pixel
because I think the pixel takes better
photos more often I think iPhone can
generate beautiful photos but more
consistently that adding the pixel to
those better job thanks Sam Sam our guy
the kakatiya see anybody last question
you gotta go max is asking how's the
battery life in the si that's fine plus
so the for just to lay down the specs
they are the exactly the same as last
year so it's a 3000 milliamp hour
battery in the small one thirty five
hundred million power battery in the big
one and you can expect the exact same
battery life in my experience is that is
the 845 supposed to be more efficient a
45 is supposed to be more efficient but
it's not a dramatic leap like from other
processor generations it's still the
same manufacturing process
so you're not getting efficiencies there
samsung says there's some software
efficiencies and stuff the real
real-world experience has been that the
s9 will last a day for light users yes
nine plus will last a day for heavier
users but if you're real heavy user you
can even kill the yes nine plus battery
neither neither of them have bad battery
life neither of them have exceptional
battery life it is the typical what they
market it lasts a day and no more all
