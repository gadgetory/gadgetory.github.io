show for the past couple of weeks you
may have noticed that the show now comes
in three different sizes we've got the
classic version with three editors the
Virgin Mobile show to with for editors
and the Virgin Mobile show mini with
just two today we're bringing you the
verge mobile show to with for editors so
stay tuned for the Virgin Mobile show
hey so i'm dan seifert have lads have oh
I'm Chris tickler and I am Peter bone
yes so we actually have all four of us
here this time with a dealer coming in
via phone as you notice there and this
is our 20th episode for the week of
October eighth for the Virgin Mobile
show it's it's a milestone it's a good
miles get a strong number indeed next
next week we're going to our binge drink
and yes next one else where we are all
drunk during the shitty drunk completely
yeah it's a good play I think that I
brought this up before but I just want
to confirm yes the 20th anniversary is
you give the gift of China but a modern
that's the traditional gift but the
modern gift apparently is platinum so
listeners if you'd like to send us
platinum you're welcome to do so we'll
give our just our home addresses well
isn't the gift of China you know in
expensive smartphones made by slave
labor I I see what you did there wait
that's what I was gonna ask do you mean
like actual China like bone china like
post yeah my entire country yeah you
just you give the gift of 1.3 billion
China yes okay cuz while you were saying
that I brought up my cup of tea up to
our mouths and it's made out of China I
was going to note that but I was amazing
i want to interrupt chris there she's
also really on that plaid you should
have done that once now people think
that you don't need china and they're
not gonna send it to you okay what look
I don't um
have this and it's a really educational
cut because as also saw ducks on it
including their names including a
mandarin duck and a PO chard I guess I
guess people who drink tea get bored
easily so it's good to have some
fascinating information oh I also want
to note that we would like to really
thank flag for joining us today because
he is on vacation and he took time out
of his vacation to join us for the
Virgin Mobile show today yeah by really
distant vacation in my own we pulled
them off via the sunny beaches of
Britain over to to join us this sunny in
Shin good beaches of Britain yes mm-hmm
well you guys did pull me off of the the
sunny beaches of San Diego which I would
be at right now rather than actually
going to the the mobile con convention
today because there's not a whole lot
else to do at mobile comets it's an
enterprise only show and it is
ridiculously quiet and so are we even
talking about stuff that having a mobile
con later in the show yeah I guess we
are yes yeah absolutely but like I'm
skipping the keynote so that I can be
here with you guys and I couldn't be
happier well we couldn't be happier that
you're with us dieter it's it's a really
emotional thing for me because this is
the first ctia that I've missed since
2006 so I wow I'm sorry that I couldn't
be there that's crazy yeah yeah and I do
believe Chris today aware of the fact
that you're not going to be there which
is why they have absolutely nothing new
sure right yeah that's it they were like
well Chris isn't coming we got to
postpone all these launches that we were
planning for the earth for the event
that's exactly what happened I believe
that all of us oh sorry glad I was gonna
say there's one thing that is new that I
saw which was the t-mobile variant of
the samsung galaxy note 2 cool a really
bad new because we've seen it before
because Vlad you wrote an excellent and
comprehensive review let's talk about
that flat tell us about this review tell
us about that you guessing
yes about the note 2 ah what can I serve
our ally at the moment like my
conclusion at the end was basically at
the moment in my beat the best android
device you can buy and I'm gonna stand
by that even though it's kind of
outrageous to say because to me when I
look at the premiere Android devices
we're talking about the HTC One X or the
one x+ or the one XL whatever variant
you want to look at and we're talking
about the gate is free from Samsung and
both of those are 4.7 inches and above
and to me that makes them devices that
are most comfortably used with two hands
you know one hand to hold the phone why
hand to operate it and then I look at
the guys who note 2 at 5.5 inches and I
think well that's kind of a small jump
but is it it isn't the same way that it
was with the original Galaxy Note with
the original Galaxy Note I thought I
thought it would be such a niche device
because it was on a tablet wasn't giving
you as much a screen real estate as an
actual tablet but it was forcing you
into a new way of using your phone and
at a time the premier phones were
actually around 4.4 inch size so now
that your best choice is a 4.7 inches in
above I just feel like well step up a
little bit and get the bigger battery
the big screen and the stylus with the
galaxy note 2 just my reasoning so I
just figure it's so close to the galaxy
s3 in terms of specs and some of the
capabilities it has the exact same
cameras and processor etc why don't just
get the better more powerful device so
you're saying but if you're willing to
go big enough for the galaxy s3 you
might as well just go as big as you
possibly can exactly and that's exactly
and the thing I also said at the
beginning of my review is that this
feels like the galaxy has free no
tuition the crazy thing to me though I
mean I hear what you're saying about you
know like they're not being that big of
a difference between the s3 and the note
2 in terms of size but there's a this
really striking picture somewhere near
review where you have it next to a 1x
and like the eye I'm not positive about
this but it looks from the picture like
if you place the One X on top of
note to it would be completely contained
within the outline of the display itself
on the note 2 which gives you know yes
how big this device is the note 2 does
make the 1x which I'm holding up right
now next to my face uh so yeah if you
know how big my faces you know how big
the 1x is you can get an idea of Alaska
I think we need a comparison next to a
bicep to really know but all right
there's there's a scientific principle
that says that the size of Lance bicep
cannot be accurately computed anyway yes
ah i ah I also think that anything that
is not bigger than my biceps counts to
the boat as I special so the note 2 is a
phone no it's not it's a tablet I'm
counting it's a tablet I've never called
the note to a phone I never called the
original note to phone I'm still not
calling in a phone but the distinction
is that I will use it in place of a
smartphone because it can replace a
smartphone I just don't think it is one
any other thing I was gonna say quickly
about it sighs is that yes it makes the
1x which is a big phone look kind of
small and cute which is amusing so maybe
you can answer this for me Vlad the
problem that I had with the original
note was that it was a giant to me it
always felt like a giant smartphone
because the software on it was all
smartphone software you had the
smartphone version of android smartphone
apps except for like two customized
samsung apps has that changed at all
with the note 2 does it feel like are
there more tablets specific type of
software on it or are we still just
dealing with blown up versions of the
same phone apps that we would get on any
other smartphone well you said to
Samsung specific apps that you must have
had some sort of stripped-down bloatware
free version well perhaps perhaps I was
exaggerating a little bit but it was
only a handful if i were to download an
app from the Play Store for instance i
would get the smartphone version of it i
would not see a tablet version no of
course I mean there's no tablet of my
station here to speak of Samsung has
loaded I don't know dozens and dozens of
its own apps some customizations its own
presets
when you first like using the note 2
you're going to have to dismiss so many
little tutorial notes and little do you
want to do this do you not want to do
this it starts feel like you're setting
up a windows machine and so there you go
all my check boxes for hating on samsung
hating on TouchWiz hating on Microsoft
I'm just doing it efficiently but
there's no tablet optimization it is
very much a phone experience extended
upwards but I mean I still don't feel
like android tablet interface such that
it is it's particularly good right so
just expanding the smile for one seems
reasonable enough so I sound concerned
okay alright so brass tacks can you fit
this thing in your pocket yes okay fair
enough I come down with it in a
but it fits there's a one hundred
percent chance that dieter is going to
buy the 18 Tiant of this stupid device
yeah I mean I'm the guy that said he was
guys like I do you need to sustain the
stylus is useful I guy I think we need
to make a point out of this I mean the
first thing I already mentioned the 3100
milliamp hour battery to note 2 is very
strong and very good in probably the
most attractive feature far as i'm
concern is is legitimately useful and
and the handwriting recognition is
really improved than the original note
like it'sit's I can't make it a miss now
and my handwriting with that stylus is
so much worse than my handwriting with a
regular pen so it deals with the
challenge very well recognized his
handwriting and on most occasions now I
used it to take legitimate notes you
know I'm on a call with somebody not
with the note itself but I will sit down
and just scribble notes on it and Silas
works it doesn't like when you when you
say that are you are you talking about
in the you know the S note or the sm oh
man I forget that it's still insane to
me that there's s note and s memos
that's still the case I don't understand
was to exists okay
are you are you talking about taking
handwritten notes on the main screen as
you have in this gesture here or you
talk about using it in like the keyboard
input area where you get rid of the
software keyboard and you use it as like
a handwriting entry area like like Dumbo
I've taken full page notes just have
written notes which i haven't converted
to text I don't know Samsung has the
option to you know take your handwritten
notes and then retro actively convert
them nfo so written messages just by
using the handwriting area in like the
messaging application I both are good
both for useful see that's that's really
bad news for me because I'm really
interested in I've been I've been taking
a lot of notes lately handwritten on you
know I like carrying around a little
field notes notepad in my back pocket so
I'm really used to used to taking notes
on a piece of paper that's actually
smaller than the Galaxy Note 2 and so
like I could maybe legitimately use this
thing for note-taking and so you can and
expect that so yeah I might end up
needing to get one of these now the
thing that I'm worried about is as as
you mentioned like actually sitting down
like I love that like there's nothing
else to say about this other than you
know talking about its size from my
perspective but I guess it's because I
haven't played one but like if this
thing takes off and becomes popular I'm
calling it right now the holsters back
baby oh no now that'll be the greatest
travesty of the note in the note 2 and
whatever comes after the note 2 beyond
the fact that they exist would be that
if they brought back the holster here's
why here's why the holster is not coming
back I can tell you exactly why it's
because unlike uh you know that the late
90s early 2000s when holsters were were
chic but I'm gonna stop you right there
Chris they were never chic they were
just in use yes what correction when
they reuse the StarTAC holster was
pretty suit was pretty sweet well what
was this we have no common it was it was
a plastic holster designed specifically
for the start
it was very svelte and thin and you know
because it had an antenna you know and
like you would click it in and so the
back of the phone would would point out
and so it was just you know it was it
was very low profile so so it behaved
like any other plastic holster that's
ever been produced but it was the first
one that it that like was saw widespread
use everything else copied that one well
look the difference how is that every
man it is now acceptable for men to have
purses and it wasn't when when holsters
were first in use I I carry a purse
everywhere I go basically uh so I mean
it's not called a purse is called a
messenger bag but for all practical
purposes it's a large purse so you know
if it doesn't fit in your pocket you're
just gonna throw in your messenger bag
oh yeah I could see putting this in a
jacket pocket that's actually where i
put my nexus 7 is in like the inside
pocket on my jacket and i suppose you
could do that with the note 2 as well
yeah i was going to just suggest that
just where you know dinner jacket
everywhere you go which I speak so looks
like TouchWiz is still sort of i think
the phrase you use is that they're still
emphasizing quantity over quality and i
was really hoping that they would try
and tone it down a little bit now that
you know they've revved it up to to
android 4.1 but oh well how's google now
on it is it is it you know the same is
on the Galaxy Nexus you know I didn't
use it telogen everybody going to use
google now much I mean two things have
you said here now the first is the
TouchWiz is the most tolerable skin as
far as I'm concerned Android skin and
when I first turned on the note 2 and
starts just wiping around the home
screens which Sampson again preloads
with just the crap ton of things you
don't want and you have to clear away it
i'm seriously really feels like you just
bought a Windows 7 machine where there's
just all of this stuff we which you need
to disable and get rid of and clean up
and tidy
up like part of the packaging is having
way too much stuff in the software but
the besides that besides that complaint
when I started swiping between home
screens I was like wow it was just so
quick and in my first reaction was I
must have forgotten how responsive the
galaxy as free is but then I realized
that is gently and jelly bean his
project butter and project butter is
gurus optimizations to make the screen
animations fever make the better etc
look project button is a lie it has done
nothing on the Galaxy Nexus in fact I
that's my most glorious day that's my
point you need a fast processor to
benefit from it because I had jelly bean
on the Nexus S and I was like well
that's impressive yeah but it is in this
phone oh sorry on the note 2 which is
not a phone but to be fair you haven't
used the note 2 with ICS so I mean the
note 2 could in theory be just as fast
with ICS yeah that's also true and also
its quad-core processor is clocked at
one point XK hers worse I believe in the
galaxy s3's 1.4 so another thing that
the note 2 has is it has a title for
benchmarking the highest out of any
android phone pad it's kind of a hollow
tight with bad days because there aren't
that many games or things that use that
much power but yeah well I think it
essentially what it is is the same
solution as we've always seen with
Android to make it faster smoother
they're just throwing more hardware at
it and upgraded hardware and faster
hardware and faster chips and stuff like
that yeah but it that's true and people
complain about that but at the same time
things are actually constantly improving
and every time somebody like Samson
throws more hardware power problem it
improves things so it might not be as
fast or as a you know just clean cuts as
somebody said okay improving a software
then it's fixed for everybody but every
single time is improving is getting
better it's getting smoother which is a
good thing if you're willing to upgrade
your phone every six months yeah
what's really amazing to me is that you
know for a Jesus at least five years if
not more there was his principal this
widely accepted principle in mobile that
the region between five inches and about
seven inches was no man's land it like
nobody could create a successful product
in that in that area and like most
recently like the dell streak is a great
example that rightly i'm being a single
person in the world bought the dell
streak and samsung has pulled it off
they've pushed this product through and
actually created this nature that simply
didn't exist before and it's obviously
here to stay and you know you got to
give him credit for that the question is
whether other OEMs can and will follow
you know we've heard these rumors of the
5-inch HTC that's coming but i don't
think that one has a stylist of course
LG has tried to follow without this view
so we'll see if this category is here to
stay or if it's a flash in the pan Vlad
tell me about the display real quick
because it's actually different than
before the the dreaded word pentile
appears to not apply but you say that
it's still not as good as the One X
right well nothing is as good as the 1x
nothing I've seen a lot of people have
said good things about the iphone 5
display but i haven't seen in person I'm
actually really terrible in terms of
getting a hold of an iphone 5 ivan
actually experiencing using it I in any
case I've compared them I've compared
them well I can answer that I've
compared them side to side and the One X
is slightly better because it has better
viewing angles so the One X is like
basically 180 degrees and that the
iphone 5 kind of washes out when you
start to angle it yeah that's why I
clients exactly good job by HTC now if
they actually had an Android skin worth
using their be in business that the
birth again is not to display so his
thing is not pencil anymore but way you
had a red and a blue and too green
subpixels you now have a red and a green
sub-pixel and
larged blue sub-pixel so the enlarged
blue sub-pixel is the same size as the
two green ones previously which kind of
generates the same look I think in terms
of like how many subjects did you
actually have in the display now you
have bri sub pixels per pixel instead of
previously having to a red and a blue
and then two green ones so ultimately
the new display actually has more sub
pixel I think that's the case yeah so
I'm very sure most people are following
me anymore after I started you know
trying to break down so do you I said
we're gonna start calling this the heck
styledisplay ah I don't I don't know hex
why hex six well yeah six cuz pen is
five isn't it no yeah I pentose now a
brain pentel is a brand name right like
that's yeah that's a branding okay yeah
right I'm just I'm just waiting in any
case like uh it's I don't know how to
explain it exactly um there are still
issues with it it's still not a straight
RGB where the red green and the blue
subpixels exactly the same size and
regular like the good displays have like
LG's IPS displays like the 1x that were
mentioned um but generally speaking in
your general use that doesn't really
matter like the only issue I had a
couple of issues oh if I only pick it as
a couple issues of note to one is that
the screen kinda has a blue tinge which
you've noticed almost with any AMOLED
display particularly with Samsung's
outlet displays and also its automatic
brightness test to be a little bit too
dark so most of the time you might want
to set your own brightness level instead
of trusting it I think Sam's is kind of
over-aggressive on saving power correct
me if i'm wrong i think the galaxy s3
had that same problem with the oh yeah
brightness and I'm sorry they still
haven't figured out how to do both
automatic brightness and still allow you
to adjust the brightness like they do on
iOS I don't know if that's a patent
issue or you know I drives me nuts
although Samson's credit its
notifications drop down it has a
brightness slider you can adjust the
brightness from the notifications menu
which I think everybody should be should
have that there's a little shortcut and
also Samsung has the most useful
notifications dropped out in terms of
also little toggles things like turning
off gps Wi-Fi etc um I like it I like
Samson little tweaks on the side not
samsung software Samsung's apps you can
just broke protem of this device and you
actually enjoy yourself more but Samsung
little tweaks on the side are mostly
good the weird thing about that sub
pixel arrangement to me is that correct
me if I'm wrong but I think that the
like scientific concept behind pentile
was that the human eye is less sensitive
to green than it is to red and blue you
got it backwards it's more sensitive to
green but your head in the right
direction but yet it though the eye is
more sensitive to green light no but but
doesn't it have twice as many green
subpixels as red and blue that was the
original pense out the new one has more
blue I thought I had more blue subpixels
that was my understanding at least I was
the explanation that I had gotten from
Samsung when I when I asked them about
it was because according to them blue
subpixels on AMOLED displays degrade
slower than the red and the green so
they make the blue ones larger or they
use more blue ones ought to make the
display last longer yeah let's just move
on from some pics right so can it can
actually just make mention something
here I do believe were under estimating
how many people listen to our podcast
and how many companies is to a podcast
like I say the ctia people they found
out chris is an attending so they
decided to completely nuke their show
and I've been saying that somebody
should do a high-end phone 4 inches and
then Samsung confirmed that they're
doing a galaxy s3 mini and then this
morning even though wasn't working I was
like yes I'm excited it's gonna be
galaxy s3 mini is gonna have a 4-inch
display
it's probably gonna be like the Galaxy
Note 2 in so far is it just the S free
but in a different shell so let's go now
we have real competition for the iphone
5 but alas it seems like it's not going
to be what I was hoping it'll be so I
had the same exact excitement as you
Vlad but I tried to keep it tempered
with a huge dose of reality because I
don't think Samsung would ever
jeopardize its baby being the galaxy s3
and and it seems to be from leaks that
just this morning of this this alleged
Galaxy S or I guess this galaxy s3 mini
these alleged leaks are we're looking at
a pretty mid-range to low-end device
with a WVGA display a dual-core 1
gigahertz processor that is supposedly
made by st-ericsson it's not a processor
that we've seen before but I wouldn't
count it to be up there with like a
Qualcomm s4 or an exit now there's a
there's a sony phone that uses that
processor i believe oh yeah there's a
couple you know everybody male second i
thought it was a variation of that Nova
Thor a new variation that we hadn't seen
in a very yeah yeah that we hadn't seen
yet but it's still a dual-core 1
gigahertz processor that might be fine
pushing around to wvga screen but that's
all it's doing is pushing around wvga
resolution so I'm livid about this
because Samsung when it confirmed the
galaxy s3 mini name today or that a mini
galaxy s3 was coming the head of the
company said that it would be a
competitive device that would not be a
low-end or entry-level device and that
seems to be exactly the opposite of what
these leaks elite specs are telling us
so it's just as much as I would love to
have a really high-end really awesome 4
inch android device that has the best
specs as far as processor goes and a
really great high res display it doesn't
look like the galaxy s3 mini is going to
be it now hear me out hear me out people
would be note to not be better served if
it were called the galaxy s3 mega I mean
am I am i right yeah the mini this the
classic and Omega no I the note brand is
really good and strong man sorry yeah I
know I know you kind of takes the start
calling anything mega is awesome but I
just don't think that it works here I'm
sorry uh fine so just a quick mention
Samsung differentiates between its note
platform and it's a smartphone platform
right with the stylus the or the not the
stylus but the year the a spin yeah what
whatever look up crapping on my dream
hey listen I've had my flat and I have
had our dreams crapped on all morning
with this very much yes three a mini so
you know I'm just gonna say one more
thing about it and it's that
manufacturers have said I know Samsung
has said this that consumers want bigger
phones and every time they do these
market research things they say they
want a bigger size device and people are
buying these bigger sized devices and
droves but when you think about it if
you want on a high-end Android device
you couldn't buy a 4 inch high end
android device now like you don't have
that choice if you want a high-end
Android device you have to buy a monster
phone that's 4.7 or 4.8 or god forbid
5.5 inches in size so essentially I I
don't know if you know consumers if they
had the choice would choose the 4-inch
one when it's sitting next to a shelf on
a shelf next to a giant screen but I
know that I certainly would and I know a
lot of other people that like the 4 inch
size form factor for its usability as an
actual phone so yeah dad and I were in
the you mentioned idea yeah I actually
blame carriers I think that you know and
i think that basically comes down to
manufacturers like we could make a sweet
4-inch phone carries like yeah but
that's really hard to sell because we've
got our suite 4 inch phone with the
iphone but if you make us a big huge
phone it's really easy for us to sell
that and so don't give us the suite 4
inch phone because it's too it's just
it's too complicated it's too much work
for us to actually move those units
and that makes me die inside but dance
dance point was a good one when he said
that Samsung wouldn't jeopardize its
flagship by setting a 4 inch device with
the same specs and and I like that
because I do you feel like if you
actually offered the exact same spec the
exact same user experience which as I
say jelly bean would actually I was
stack what color eyes nose is just
gorgeous alright if you offer that at a
4 inch device and eject in a 720p
display I don't know this is a 4 inch
720p display particular another good one
um but if that was possible and somebody
did it I think that phone would sell
like crazy at 4 inches you only need to
HD realistically I don't think that
there's a compelling reason to put some
20 p &amp;amp; 4 inch qhd or whatever the
resolution of the retina display is you
know if it can just match that I'd be
happy yeah fair enough yeah the retina
display is a little higher resolution
than Q HD or HD is what 960 x 540 540
yeah but even if you know Samsung did
what Motorola did with the razr m and
made a 4.3 inch screen in a phone that's
the size of a 4 inch device like I'm
okay with that the razr m was not the
answer to my dreams because it has a
terrible display on it but otherwise it
would have been a good device if it had
a better camera it has an s4 processor
so it's got a very solid processor and
if it came with jelly bean and a good
display I would have been very happy
with that but again disappointed yeah
and and what what also drives me nuts is
that they made a point of saying that
this you know they're responding to a
specific market need in Europe you know
which is like it's like such a
stereotypical thing to say that like
Europeans want smaller things like you
go over there they have they have like a
you know tiny cars coffees many coffees
a tiny coffees and it's and uh you know
I mean I you've seen limited success
well i think i've used this analogy at
least 20 times on the on the show in the
podcast over the years but it you've had
limited success but some success with
luxury segment small cars in the US you
know products
like the audi a3 in the mini cooper and
and there's no reason for these guys to
to keep believing that Americans always
want everything as big as possible so
you know I think that if if some carrier
would go out on a limb and range a high
a quote unquote high-end four-inch for
3.7 inch device it would and and if it
was marketed properly would stand a very
good chance of doing well I mean look no
further than the iphone you I don't
understand why the iPhone should have
the exclusive on that form factor it's
very mad Mary and also from the European
perspective I'm also headed because
we're not just into small things
somebody from these companies should go
to oktoberfest and see the size of the
beer junkie quadratic and end if the
specs are exactly as we've heard as the
leaks indicate this is essentially a
galaxy s advance and I would also point
out that people in Europe don't like
being taken for a ride they don't like
companies being dishonest with them so
if you're calling this again as he has
free mini and you specking it like an
old-ass phone people aren't you
impressed that I'm going to be happy and
the ones who buy it on the premise that
it's a galaxy as free drunken down I'm
going to be disappointed it yet think so
if it hurts the galaxy s3 brand yeah
yeah you know all this doom and gloom
can we talk about the next Nexus phone
uh yes called the next week I just want
to make one I just want to make one
final point I was I was looking
something up there and and I think it's
very telling that Vlad calls the galaxy
s advance an old-ass phone and it was
introduced in january of this year so it
just to be put there in respect to be
fair the advanced did not have
cutting-edge january 2012 specs exactly
yeah it's fair I mean anyway it has the
same display that we saw on what the
galaxy s2 or maybe even the original
Galaxy S so I don't know staffing
pre-2012 which means I'm not expected to
remember it
okay Nexus oh so we've seen lots of
pictures we had some pictures that we
posted that had actually shown up in a
random album on XDA developers and since
then I believe we've had some more
photos come out with with that basically
make it look like take an LG optimus G
and make it look like a Samsung Galaxy
Nexus and that's what it looks like and
you know we're expecting you know
whatever is going to happen with the OS
I don't think it's going to be a huge
leap because we just had jelly bean but
yeah it really looks pretty obvious that
LG is making the next Nexus phone and
having played a bit with a couple
versions of the optimist now I'm
actually pretty excited for this yeah
I'll say that I'm pretty excited to
actually have a Nexus device with a
cutting-edge modern processor in it well
and a decent camera and yeah that too
and LTE well yeah that's that's that's
the problem though is the optimus G is
heading to AT&amp;amp;T and Sprint with LTE and
that's awesome a super pumped for that
it's weird that they're different like
sprint skits the 13-megapixel camera an
AT&amp;amp;T get doesn't which is a little bit
odd but the you mentioned this in your
post on the original pictures Chris that
the stuff that we saw at the FCC for
what we believe is going to be LG's
Nexus phone didn't have LTE it was just
being tested on HSPA right so like yeah
be multiple variants right very easily
in fact our history there are there
would be have to be if they're going to
range it on ATT and Verizon and whatever
else so I can't get a nexus phone on
AT&amp;amp;T with LTE out of the box that I
don't have to hack a rahman 2 by the end
of the year uh I'm going to go to
Google's campus and I am going to take a
pickaxe to all their cute little statues
that's not a real photo joking just just
to be clear I won't take a pickaxe to
them I'll simply do somewhat spray paint
because I mean cuz honestly dieter at
this point I am strongly considering
going there in and destroying them with
a pickaxe myself and then pinning it on
you because you're the one that said it
on the show oh man I mean yeah it's just
not having something either a
cyanogenmod or a stock experience with
LTE and 18t I know you can you can get
you can it's doing really well in the
gs3 cyanogenmod on the One X is not it's
you know it's great given you know the
resources of the guys that are working
on it but it's not quite ready for prime
time and I'm ready I'm ready I'm waiting
and I'm angry that it's not available
and I'm deeply hoping that it will be
but we should talk about this LG
Hardware because I think who here is
actually held an optimus G and like and
put it through at least a few hands on
paces I think you might be the only one
dealer oh really oh well golly you just
want to gloat about that do you just
want to let us know that he's held
multiple versions multiple times while
the rest of us have been sitting here
rising not handling them it's the LG is
really an interesting presence at least
here at mobile com because they've
announced for AT&amp;amp;T and Sprint they've
got this you know low-end mock slider
phone for sprint whatever and then
they've got this mid-range l9 for
t-mobile so they basically you know they
basically been talking about LG not
having anything in America for like a
year now that their last hit was
whatever that lowend Optimus was that
they had a bunch of carriers and MVNOs
and all of a sudden out of nowhere we're
expecting to have a Nexus device and
they're launching like legitimate
contenders that are like decently good
you know I don't know you know until we
review it i'm not going to say it's in
the same classes that the 1x and the
galaxy s3 but it legitimately could be
and could maybe even better them in
terms of build quality if you're into
this weird like glass not
glass but some kind of shiny back with
the texture underneath it doesn't look
terrible it's not i'm not totally into
it but it looks pretty good yeah i'm
holding judgment because uh you know we
I think we said the same thing about the
optimist HD and its variants like the
nitro HD etc etc and those phones ended
up being just complete garbage so LG has
has a lot to prove with these next few
devices that they're released and a lot
to prove onto multiple fronts I know a
lot of people were burned by the whole
what was the g2x thing with its software
updates that we're coming weren't coming
and then weren't coming again so I think
LG really has to if it if it wants to
make a dent in the American market it
really has to hit a home run with this
next device you know assuming everything
comes out as we expect have we ever seen
this many US carriers launched this many
LG phones yes and really I mean how
about well so the the optimist one like
you mentioned was on almost every
carrier as an entry-level android phone
and then the the one that Chris just
mentioned that which was the optimus LTE
was the nitro HD on AT&amp;amp;T it was the
revolution on verizon 22 LTE carriers
here in the US so this is the first
high-end one that I think we've seen for
sprint if i'm not mistaken but we have
seen LG attack multiple carriers in the
US they're actually recently their own
branding you know it's getting the the
Optimus branding instead of getting
renamed like 44 different carriers yeah
that's that's a very good point so I
mean it will be really interesting to
see if if LG decides or it manages to
pick up some mindshare if not market
share in the US I was talking to Phil
Dickinson from Android Central and he
made a really good point that LG if this
launch of these devices goes well for
them they turn out to be really good
like they have the potential to like
kind of eat HTC's lunch because we all
know HTC is not doing well lately and
you know they refresh the 1x and you
know we love
devices is not not a huge fan another
software skin but it always feels like
they're kind of you know underperforming
relative to the the kind of hardware
that they're making but like you know
they're on the ropes and you know and
drink their milk shake so that was a
nice mix of metaphors going on it but I
well my question about the optimus G is
whenever has that quad-core Snapdragon
s4 incited um and maybe that just I'm
about to reveal how little i've been
paying attention lately but first it
doesn't ship with jelly bean on board
and secondly what is its responsiveness
like how smooth is it so every time i
played with one here at mobile con you
know I get the the standard song and
dance about it still being you know
pre-production I don't know whether
that's true or not the responsiveness
it's not it's not like whoa it's just
like oh this is okay this is pretty good
and so I don't want to I don't want to
judge it one way or the other until I
have a device that is you know shipping
and sold but like basically my overall
opinion on both the build quality and
like you know even the skin and
everything about these is like they're
legitimately good and they could be
legitimately good when they ship but
there's there's nothing that's
immediately like oh my god this is going
to suck or oh my god this is amazing
it's like oh hey LG's making really good
stuff all of a sudden okay and I also
just want to bring us back to the LG
Nexus phone for a moment because we saw
today something called the LG Nexus 4
and the carphone warehouse stock listing
and Nexus 4 would make sense because it
will be the fourth generation of Nexus
device but it kind of sounds like then I
mean do you only have one nexus fourth
generation device mean the big room when
the one everybody Obama's was excited
and proud about was that we would have a
nexus from multiple manufacturers so
I've actress looking for a linux is it
boys if that isn't
referring to a 4 inch device I think
that's a very misleading name I because
he the previous nexuses weren't named
123 so no one's going to grok the fact
that they're trying to say it's a fourth
generation device you're just gonna
think oh it's a 4-inch phone and of
course it's not the first of all what's
chris the first one first one was a
nexus 10 yeah good point I'm an idiot
yeah but but now we have the nexus 7
which clearly indicates sighs yeah so
yeah so having the nexus 4 is exactly
like what Chris said it would most
people would assume that has a 4-inch
screen I mean the fact is we don't know
that we just have the name LG Nexus 4 so
all that really tells us is yes LG has a
Nexus device so yes who can be excited
on that front um I I just again I'm kind
I'm kind of like I'm sure myself and Dan
would be proud to have a 4-inch Nexus
device brand new one that would be great
but I just kind of feel like two desus
argument and point everybody's pushing
24 point whatever do you know sir so
maybe maybe and this will be the pretty
awesome thing maybe LG gets to make the
4-inch Nexus device and then somebody
else gets to make the 4.5 inch Nexus
device and Sony get to make the 5-inch
Vita Nexus device cetera cetera so just
to uh about the to go back to about
there possibly being more than one um
Nexus device and is there any evidence
of it the pictures of this alleged LG
Nexus G or whatever show on the back of
it it says it has the width Google
branding which we haven't seen in a long
time I don't think we've seen that since
gosh I mean I recall it on the the
original g1 but generally the Nexus
phones have said Google on the back and
not with Google so you know we can kind
of read be reading into that and be
pretty skeptical as to what exactly that
means at this point but perhaps you know
there will be a line of them that you
know each one is stamped with Google and
they have like a pretty standardized
hardware specifications and then each
manufacturer can can have a Nexus device
in their lineup nobody else matters no
no I'll figure and I think it makes
sense I think ultimately what might
happen is that the nexus branding and
name could just mean stock Android which
I'd be totally cool with and I would
just make that by one like my first
prerequisite for buying an Android
devices make sure it says Nexus
somewhere on it and a quick question LG
with the optimus 2x in the first joke or
smartphone they had with Google stamped
on this thing this is kind of backbone
that the phone had in the back bit in
its shell so with google maybe one or
two years ago now um it was being used
but yes since then most most haven't
been using that sort of branding but a
nice LG has kind of a track record with
yeah I'm gonna say if this if this like
you know just call it a nexus if its
stock Android and multiple manufacturers
offer it pans out like that'll be great
but I'm telling you right now that
Google better get its update situation
hashed out right fast like because it's
not been great on the Galaxy Nexus it's
been pretty terrible actually and so
like if they're going to have you know
the whole big new push then they need to
also not have people wondering when
they're going to get the latest version
of Android on a device that says Nexus
on because well it was it was just fine
for the unlocked gsm version the Galaxy
Nexus it's always you know as usual to
the carrier's that gum it up right the
verizon version just started getting
jollibee a couple weeks ago right uh yes
yes that's correct so that's I mean it's
as always it's the carriers okay so can
I just use that as a segue and move on
to a company that does software updates
in a more organized fashion which is
Microsoft surprisingly but yes and we
could do we could do a bit of Windows
Phone talking cuz we
even Oh Android all day today so what's
happened is the Lumia 920 is an AT&amp;amp;T
exclusive which would have made a lot of
people cringe and it's launching
sometime in November alongside the Lumia
820 in brie and I do that they have a
cyan version that's the only thing that
matters about this device screw windows
phone 8 screw the camera on the 920
nobody cares are the only thing that
matters is the fact that it's coming in
cyan thank goodness all right so the
world is a better place it goes yes yes
I'm gonna go get agree with Chris here
uh that the world is now right it was it
was you know right before here's the
thing for us it the science online only
right right so it you're not gonna be
able to walk and people aren't gonna
walk in a store and see cyan it's not
gonna it's not gonna change the world
man it's not gonna change fashion
industry it's not gonna change anything
but doesn't beat her i don't i don't
care if not as if not a single other
soul on the planet buys this phone the
only thing that matters to me is that i
can go to a website in order a cyan 920
that's all that matters that was the
only reason i was i was bellyaching
about it everybody would actually be
happy if nobody else bought it right
everyone else can go use their yellow
and red versions it's fine by me I think
the gray ones were I think yellow yellow
is also online only right yellow and
cyan the only ones you can get
instructed by red and black well it's
like a matte gray I think all right all
right so look a try he screw civet e a
bit I could see it it's gonna go one of
two ways one it's genuinely exclusive
and Nokia is not going to launch uh-uh
it's you know top the line phone on any
other carriers which is a bummer or two
they're going to do what they've done
with the 820 where they're going to
launch variants on other carriers we've
seen the 8-10 on t-mobile and then
there's the rumor of the the Atlas
variant of the 820 horizon and so
everybody gets an exclusive but it's
basically the same phone which also
seems like kind of a huge bummer III
think that nokia's is trying to have its
cake and eat it too they're they're
signing exclusivity deals with carrier
which I'm guessing in some cases is the
only way they're able to actually get
carriers to range these phones
considering what a lukewarm reception
the 900 ultimately got a retail so I
think that 18t said look you can either
give us an exclusive on the 920 or you
can go expletive yourself yeah and
Stephen Elop said okay well then there
you go there's your exclusive and
meanwhile we just happen to be working
on a very mildly change version of the
device known as a 922 which verizon will
get as an exclusive right my guess
that's my hope because you know I've
been basically having I've been
basically saying all year that this fall
verizon's going to go big on Windows
Phone and it's going to be a big
game-changer for Microsoft and now I
have egg on my face because I'm starting
to think it's not going to happen well
if if it does turn out to be that the
920 is the only version of the 920 that
we see in the US and it's only on ATT
that will be directly against what nokia
has been saying itself all year and that
it would be you know working with as
many carriers as possible in the US and
working with all of the you know the big
four to get its its phones out there so
I i really think that it's going to be
the second scenario it's which is still
unfortunate because it nokia loses the
whole advantage of the iphone and
burning and the galaxy s3 branding that
its competitors have but at least it'll
be available to more people well and
also these are you say that might happen
you know verizon making a big push
Windows Phone we don't know yet and the
still ample time for that big push from
verizon to come because the windows
phone 8 launch event are multiple
expensive now be scheduled folks over 29
other the one in San Francisco there's
one in London that we just recently
announced but amusingly the windows
phone 8 pre-orders are going to begin on
October 21st so for Microsoft will let
you preorder a phone an operating system
which is going to get us big unveil on
October 29 Glee don't know yeah I
don't even know it's like it's like
they've got to email threads going for
planning this stuff and everybody just
keeps responding to you know the wrong
email thread and so they just you know
they just got their dates mixed up
because of that that must be it like
they just need to switch to gmail that
has better threaded messaging then
they'd be fine problem solved yeah can I
talk a little bit but yeah the 810 yes
it is terrible oh it does have an
interchangeable back plates though there
will be a cyan back late from what I've
ya know there's a cyan back plate but
like remember was it last week or two
weeks ago I took that picture of my old
visor prism that big blue chunky PDA
that's what you eat 10 reminds me of
it's like just this big square thick
hunk of phone and you know they wouldn't
let us turn it on and I took the back
plate off and actually like the route
like you know cuz everybody's locking
all the screens on these phones they
wouldn't even like let me turn the
screen on they like actually like they
put a piece of paper on the battery
contact so that it wouldn't turn on but
it's like it's super thick and the other
crazy thing is we know it's a variant of
the 820 but it's not like I mean nokia
did more than just like take the a20 and
put a square frame around it like they
move stuff around a bit and moving stuff
around on a phone is not a trivial thing
the stuff gets packed in very carefully
and so like they've spent some time
making this and to be honest you know if
you're going to sell a mid-range or low
end Windows Phone there's got to be
something that's really like you know
appealing and cute about it and I just
don't feel like this is it despite the
fact that it has you know user
replaceable back plates I actually think
that the the 710 was a much better play
for what a windows phone alone Windows
Phone and t-mobile should look like than
this I just I just think this is moving
in the wrong direction i I'm gonna I
haven't handled the 810 yet so I'm not
really in a great position of authority
here but I'm gonna disagree with you
dieter I thought the 710 was a hideous
mess and and I hated that physical home
button physical Start menu search back
button
was at the bottom of it I thought it
really cheapened the device and really
made it feel like garbage och you
honestly I thought the 810 was kind of
good looking well wait till you hold it
maybe maybe disagree with me and you'll
think it's got some sort of you know
retro blocky charm but like there's just
what it looks like you know what it
looks like to me it looks like uh the
810 was a last minute they're like oh
crap for whatever reason we can't sell
the 820 on t mobile tmobile wants to
range a mid-range phone from us so we
need to throw together something you
know maybe they needed to skirt some
exclusivity clause that they had with
with other carriers so they're like ok
these are the minimum things that we
need to do to make a version of this
phone that we can sell on on t-mobile so
they threw this together in like a rush
in a few weeks and that this is what
they came up with because you're right d
I mean like I'm looking at your gallery
here and I just I mean it's such a
nondescript like its amazingly
nondescript for a company that has kind
of become known for its hardware design
this is kind of outrageous that their
that they're selling this I mean it
looks like it looks like a um like a pro
not a prototype like a like a reference
like you know if a company is coming out
with like a phone that they like a you
know rims dev alphas right that's
exactly what idea yeah yeah this is
Nucky as a dev alpha B device yeah i
mean i like the Lumia 820 I liked it too
look at the other I honestly I'm sighing
with X you know a exhaustion
exasperation is aspiration that's what I
was looking for yeah at the fact that no
kids gonna have to do all these variants
you know it's gonna be a little tweak
for horizon a little tweak for tmobile I
understand the remote we've heard about
the verizon version of the a20 that it
will have different specs as well it's
just uh you know I mean its status point
you're diluting your branding like okay
people will get that Lumia means nokia
lumia means windows phone but the number
is constantly changing after the Lumia
is just
annoying and it's not consistent and
consistency is actually what acne yeah
if they can hit a 49 99 I'm contract
price point for this thing out of the
gate I will rescind all of my complaints
and say hey that's actually pretty cool
but I'm you know who knows that's that's
the other thing is asinine MOA guess
what you can get for free on contract in
iphone 4 like 999 is not impressive
anymore so free I can't get an iphone 4
from t-mobile true but I mean yeah
that's details have you guys noticed
like in the past I guess basically the
past month like everybody forgot that
it's a good idea to announce price and
release of it release dates like nothing
that I've seen at mobile Khan has got a
price or a release date attached to it
which I'm really advise but that's just
kind of par for the course for the
companies that you're seeing stuff
mobile come from I mean need the note
that's par for the course for nokia it's
been doing it since you know forever
LG's been notorious for that Samsung's
notorious for it I mean the closest
thing that we've gotten out of all these
new phones to a release date is from HTC
when it announced e8 x and the 8's and
it said you know it would be on these
specific carriers in November but even
that is not very useful yeah but I mean
a big part of this is Microsoft's in the
Windows Phone development cycle I mean
this is Samsung ative s or active+ atif
t bless you yeah thank you tita it work
that is one of the most fascinating
phones just because it hasn't existed
outside of some renders and some samsung
produce the video and pictures you know
um and the reason it hasn't existed
because what Samsung got to do they're
gonna bring it out and exactly is due to
just add with the Lumia 810 they're
gonna you know screw around just show
people the shell it's like what was the
point in that you know everybody do this
hardware which is just perfectly ready I
hey I also hate the fact that they say
things like pre-production some
pre-production is the freaking
production device it's just the soft
boys I'm ready it'll call it what it is
it is the production device you know you
could take pictures with it and you're
gonna get the exact same camera quantity
gonna get the final device it's just
that the software isn't baked ISM ready
and this is why it's looking at this
ridiculous situation where you can
pre-order a phone on service very first
and then eight days later microsomes
gonna do the big unveil like Microsoft's
deadline for finishing windows phone is
probably October 28 midnight I the other
getting done get it ready we need to go
to the event the other thing is I don't
think that Microsoft's actions are
stopping any of these manufacturers from
announcing price with it I mean the the
software being finished or not is not
going to affect the price of the fun
when it launches so I mean I why they
with holding all this information is it
just it only makes a sky hell that's
really I have a theory I have a theory
which is that they know that there's a
lot of news happening in the month of
October including presumably or possibly
some Nexus announcements and it might be
just a game of brinksmanship where they
want to wait as long as they can until
they find out how their competitors are
going to price things to decide how to
price these devices I also feel like
maybe maybe Microsoft is asking them to
hold back the pricing and the full
details so that October 29th Microsoft
be the one who says here it is with this
phone 8 coming out here's a pricing is a
date is the carriers the phones of
course if you're also pre-order on the
21st you you'll be pre-ordering blind if
that's the case yeah yeah which I don't
put it past Joseph oh this is just gonna
be like do you want to give us money do
you want to invest in with this phone
it's gonna be the Kickstarter campaign
it's going to be like sign enter your
email for more information type of thing
see so you know what I want to kick
start is an achievement 5 inches I would
I mean think about it a windows phone
version of the galaxy note 2 I mean that
would play right am I crazy uh well the
whole point of the note is it's is its
s-pen right yeah um so yeah so so do a
UH you like a I don't know maybe have an
atif mega running Windows RT instead of
I don't know I'm spitball
here live on video but I think that
there's I think there's a product here
that Samsung should probably consider me
I mean look Samsung makes so many
products at so many sizes half of which
probably don't sell a single unit they
might as well make an atty Vega even if
nobody notices that it ever came out
like they might as well it costs them
nothing they own the display
manufacturing like just do it which
would you would you buy if it's a Chris
can I get you on record that if Samsung
is uh would be willing to release in at
Eve mega you would actually go out and
buy it and be the one person that buys
it no of course I I just want that make
it kirsta just so reckless with other
people's production lines I'm telling
you whatever whatever OEM steps forward
and starts using mega in their product
names gold mine like it's it's an
untapped font of like it just it's gonna
print money for these sponsors
embarrassment chris months at Motorola's
already using macs so if somebody wants
to go up against motorola and its max
branding yeah make its way better than
max it's just a stronger sounding term
and then they contend patrolling that's
okay let's talk about this a bit of has
been a bit of development with t-mobile
and it's talking about more takeovers
and mergers but i'm gonna let you guys
handle this cause it's American so we
were we were talking about this last
week actually because it was on the
verge of possibly happening i think by
the time we were on the air for the
mobile show it was rumored that it was
going to happen but it wasn't confirmed
and then like the next day it got
confirmed that deutsche telekom which is
the owner of t-mobile USA is by
essentially buying metro pcs and plans
to integrate metro pcs into the t-mobile
brand and company and it will use metro
pcs ha's spectrum and network for
t-mobile's LTE network at years down the
line and into by 2015 so it's it's kind
of an interesting thing i think
both Chris and I said that it wouldn't
be a huge surprise if this were to
happen so it makes sense based on the
both both metro pcs and t-mobile's needs
in the future maybe not right now
because they have not incompatible
networks for their non-lte services but
for the future it makes sense so and
it's a sudden I hear a rumor that that
sprint was maybe going to try and swoop
in and make like a competitive bid or
was that bunk so that was rumored we
haven't really heard about it since the
rumor which came out just it just after
the deal was officially announced the
rumor came out the next day that that
sprint might do a counterbid against
Deutsche Telekom for for metropcs but we
haven't heard anything about that since
then so okay so my theory is that
Deutsche Telekom really doesn't want to
own t-mobile USA even even after the 18
teeth and they tried to show some
lukewarm re commitment to the
organization but in reality i think that
they really would like to get rid of
them so my theory is that they're using
this metropcs acquisition to in an
effort to create value in the company
where they're currently you know i mean
it's it's no secret that t-mobile is
deficient number of ways both
technologically and you know in terms of
spectrum ownership and and sometime oh
shanthi yeah and then personally he's
gone to hell they're no good Carly on
the race likes it just annoying right
thank you very yes because you can trine
rhyme six with Phoenix it drives me mad
every time every time I see that
commercial oh but she tries to run she's
like 12 Kalamazoo 34 Jersey Shore 56
west Phoenix and and you can't rhyme six
with Phoenix it sound really weird so
glad that you have that memorized Chris
I've seen the commercial like a million
i I've not seen that commercial I was
just referring to the one where she
drives through the city and a motorcycle
and all the buildings turned pink or I'm
sorry magenta right yeah I know I've
seen that one too but this one is like
it's every other commercial on TV right
now but but anyway so I suspect the
Deutsche Telekom will ultimately try to
spin off the combined organization as a
public company sometime after 2015 and
then you know we'll just be you know and
their their theory their hope is that it
will be sustaining by then and what do
we like do anything that actually has a
chance of working out at I mean I'm
still not convinced that the US market
can sustain for profitable national
carriers as much as it pains me to say
that but this probably gives I do think
that this properly gives t-mobile the
best shot possible in light of you know
the spectrum that's available and the
circumstances and the competition that
they're facing what's funny is that even
with this merger it still doesn't put
tmobile within range of even sprint
which is its next biggest competitor so
Sprint's got 50 million plus customers
now I believe with metropcs and t-mobile
combined it's somewhere in the mid 30s
so it's still a ways away from even
reaching number three yeah okay wow so
us seriously guys you need to make these
US carrier discussions a bit more
exciting for Europeans it's like we were
added onto my face because I do it any
15 and it's a long road and they need
out t.o.o bellyaching ah ok I'll give
you some drama I think that verizon has
a huge chip on its shoulder about LTE
like they held this event yesterday
where they announced that I think was
October 18th they're gonna launch their
400th LTE market they're actually gonna
get like for 17 or something and they're
gonna hold some like party and marquette
to you know celebrate their 400l te
market and there you know here's our by
the end of 2013 every single 3g area
that's got 3g is going to be have LTE
and we're working with rural carriers
and you know on and on and on and i
think basically like the they had such
you know a lead in LTE and they pretty
much still do especially if you compare
and even compared to AT&amp;amp;T there just in
way more markets and I think that you
know eighty calling HSPA 4G and you know
also just saying we have LTE now even if
it's not and you know in anywhere near
as many markets I think verizon is
finally like tired of it and so they're
trying to swing the LTE hammer while
they still can and wildly still have you
know a huge lead and LTE I think I think
you're totally right dieter because now
Verizon used to say that it has the
largest 4g network and then you know the
definition of 4G got really murky and
changed and now 18 he claims that it has
the largest 4g network because it's
counting its hspa+ and LTE networks
combined and I'm fully wholly agree with
you data that that gets under verizon
skin to no end because if you're really
going to be a stickler about the
definition of 4G LTE is much closer to
the original definition and verizon's
LTE network is much larger than any of
the competitors here in the US so now
Verizon claims that it has the fastest
4G network in the nation instead of the
largest so I mean I you know I I expect
that they're going to be doing nothing
but pushing 4g for a while and you know
once 18t catches up in terms you know or
at least gets close enough in terms of
covering you know markets in 4G we'll
see another turn but like the question
is like what's next for these guys in
terms of pushing themselves is rise I'm
just going to go back to reliability or
are we gonna like are they finally gonna
start doing like you know voice quality
again you know that would actually be
kind of nice to see carriers competing
on like voice quality that I hate
talking on the phone that's I don't
think anybody I mean voices I'm just
gonna raise that question I know HD
voice is something that was picked up by
sprint and I know Apple introduced that
with the iphone 5 and I think this I'm I
don't think it was a feature in the
Lumia 920 I don't know if it was but I
seem to record it on the iphone 5 and so
some other recent phone what is
happening with HD voice what's happening
with picking that up amana carry at
least here in the US it is
available from sprint but it's available
for on one phone and it works between
only that phone so if you have an EVO 4G
LTE you can make HD voice calls to other
evo 4g LTE owners and we haven't really
seen anything since then about that I
don't think any of the American carriers
are really going to be pushing HD voice
I think that the next step for them is
vaulty and that's what they're going to
be putting their focus on and and that's
what we're going to see I know that it's
been Verizon's been very cagey about its
multi plans and it might be yeah so I
actually see them but I asked them about
they brought it up in there there little
press conference and then I asked them
specifically about it later and their
line is you know it's still a ways off
and the reason it's still a ways off is
we are our implementation of it is
amazing and the best thing ever and it
takes a while to lay the groundwork for
doing it right instead of doing it
quickly where they got that line from
yeah by the way I just looked and
apparently the Lumia 800 supports a mrw
B which is also known as HD Voice so
aren't good carriers in the UK that that
have it for some time lady Vlad you can
confirm that I believe or an orange has
it yeah or a while yeah but I mean I I
like it i've seen tested it and it makes
a real real difference and and it's
basically no phone that can't handle it
because it's just kind of increasing the
bit rates on your phone call like it's
it's a tiny extra bit of data
transmission I can't really see why
nobody has picked it up I mean voti is
nice and all but then you need to be
connected to the LTE network which
consumes the most power out of any
networking option like there is a seat
boys you know you can do can you do it
over 2g connection uh I think so yes I
think so too but you can do it over free
g connection which still I mean that's
one of the things that companies often
scold us about like we get excited about
latest phones the latest technology etc
and then they tell us ah but you know
the rest of the world the this China
there's India there's Africa all of
these countries don't have you know the
capabilities or the budget to buy really
really powerful devices with large
screens and fast connections so to me it
just kind of silly that you have this HD
voice option which seems really
straightforward on the technical front
and nobody seems to be pushing it hard
enough because I can I mean I don't see
what the marketing issue is with pushing
HD voice it's like here's your phone
call and I use your phone call on HD
voice can you tell which one is so much
better than the other right and then you
saw that's people I think people will
buy into it I wife I think that it's
it's pretty straightforward I think that
it's a combination of you know the fact
that you need to roll out handsets that
are compatible with it and at least in
the u.s. there aren't many yet so you
end up you know having very little
practice enough it to the feature but
but more importantly I think that that
voice is widely regarded as a dying
feature of phones and so is selling
people putting any significant marketing
effort into a feature that is attached
at the hip to a dying mode of operation
is is a you know a tough sell I think ok
and then what's the point info t so
faulty has a couple of different reasons
especially for verizon because right now
on verizon and i guess you could say
even sprint you can't do phone calls
while you're on LTE especially like this
came out with the iphone 5 the iphone 5
on verizon and sprint if it's on a phone
call it will drop its data connection
vaulty will allow it to keep the data
connection because you're you're doing
everything over LTE and also volte
moving to volte harmonizes the like that
the operation of the phone so that it
doesn't need to be connected to multiple
kinds of networks so it becomes a
power-saving issue it becomes a reduced
complexity issue because everything is
is packet data instead of maintaining
both the circuit switched and a packet
data connection and then also long
that means that they can repurpose all
of their bands to LTE and and higher
technologies whether that be
lte-advanced or 5g or whatever instead
of having to maintain both both those
kinds of technologies simultaneously and
I think the most important is that the
most most important point is that volte
is just really fun to say yes it is it
is and I was just gonna say Christie's
argument is spot-on I just wanted to you
know raise the earlier point because our
podcast should include developing
nations and developing world where less
fortunate people than yourselves such as
myself here in the UK can only think and
dream about LTE is something coming in
the future maybe I don't get me wrong
but I was absolutely love to have HD
voice that's something that I would love
to have because I I hate talking on the
phone I noticed with the iphone 5 the
calls quality are much better than with
the iphone 4s and a lot of other phones
but it's still not HD Voice levels
because we don't have to support for it
here but i would i would love to have it
it's just a matter of whether the
carriers will give it to me which I just
we just can't see happening not here the
price at least now I get that get that
and what do you say to me is is even
with HD Voice the bandwidth is
outrageously low i mean i think that the
lowest defined am rwb mode is like six
kilobits per second it's insane I have
notes is that with you guys in America
in the fact that you you like to have a
choice of no more than two so AT&amp;amp;T or
Verizon two presidential candidates it's
like as soon as you get a third or a 4
competitor you kind of lose interest and
was just make a league out of it I want
to desist that right there because a lot
of people would love to have more than
two choices and more than two carriers
and more than two presidential
candidates it's just it's it's a matter
of that's kind of just the way it is but
it's it's not something like like I
don't like it see I person who is one
Manny I just want everything tech
related to me just give me a bone like
don't give me a choice you know okay so
I don't really have any good
transitional segue but I think we should
move on and talk about Hawaii ah who are
into a new congressional report pose a
national security threat to the United
States with their networking equipment
and they've responded saying rossetti
said is disappointed by the allegations
while we said that the evidence is
lacking predictably enough but again i'm
handing this over to you guys in the US
how do you go about it so what would we
thought i'm leaving this one up to Dan
ah so I'm actually very disappointed
with this report um you know it's
essentially if you read the report
there's no smoking gun evidence that the
investigation turned up against huawei
and ZTE and they spent 11 months doing
this and really where they're still at
where they started where they had
suspicions that this could possibly be
happening as far as you huawei and ZTE
using the equipment they make sold to
American companies to spy on either
trade secrets or national security
concerns and then relaying that back to
China and the investigation didn't have
any smoking gun like I said that that
says that they're definitely doing this
the one complaint that the committee had
was that huawei and ZTE did not open
their doors as much as they wanted them
to they didn't show them as much
evidence that they're not doing this and
they essentially did improve their
innocence in the eyes of the committee
so the committee said there were just
issuing this recommendation that
American companies don't buy their
products which is like kind of crazy
when you know the whole basis of the
American judicial system is innocent
until proven guilty but you know it
makes it makes me disappointed I think
that actually huawei and ZTE feel the
same exact way if you release is that
they put out
that you know it the decision was kind
of predetermined before the
investigation was completed or even
started and it's it's going to make it
difficult for them to break into the US
wireless market to bring in their
infrastructure and and their equipment
here if companies are explicitly told by
the government that they shouldn't buy
it there was actually a report on 60
seconds our 60 minutes this week where
they interviewed seconds would be better
yeah 60 seconds would be better right
but they interviewed a couple of people
involved with this they interviewed some
of the members of the committee and an
actual a an executive from a regional
carrier that bought equipment from
Huawei to deploy on his network and was
visited by federal agents afterwards
which is like insane to think about so I
mean I I don't really have a conclusion
to say about this other than you know I
I don't like where it's going I mean I
can I can totally understand out of a
out of an abundance of caution I can I
can definitely understand why the
federal government would not want to
install any foreign source a networking
hardware in sensitive areas you're not
going to put a huawei switch in Los
Alamos National Laboratory right but due
to recommend that private companies
don't use our equipment is I think is a
bit over the top and and the other thing
is that there really aren't any American
competitors that you can sources stuff
from Cisco still exists but it's not
competitive on the same level that
huawei and ZTE are with their their
equipment at this point so if a company
wants to buy the best that's available
to give them the best advantage in the
marketplace they're not looking at
American companies they're not looking
at Cisco they're looking at Ericsson and
they're looking at huawei and they're
looking at ZTE yeah well I don't want to
necessarily support the Congressional
report which is dan says is light on
substantial you know allegations and
saying things like you know there's this
piece of information which somehow found
itself into chinese han
any pass through their networks that
like dust never happened so there isn't
like hard evidence against them but I do
recall that over here in London while we
had an agreement I believe to provide
some networking infrastructure for some
either Wi-Fi or 3g roll out on longing
underground like my memory of this is
hazy and unlike Chris I'm not looking at
opening up on Wikipedia during the
podcast and but they had one of those
deals in place and then there was some
concerns about who i away from from the
UK and from the government which is
coupled the deal was actually so there
is some sort of track record there is
some sort of distrust there and I'm more
willing to credit the UK government
would be rational about it than the u.s.
one so I would well be a UK is not alone
Australia actually banned yeah Huawei's
equipment as well so they have the same
concern so it's not it's not like the US
government is the only one that has
these concerns I just would have liked
them to actually have proven their
concerns absolutely yeah yeah yeah I
mean I think exactly same as that I
don't think there's like a hot
conclusion that that we can put under
this there's not a hardware hard way
yeah we have to talk about hard way um
it's not like a single line which we can
summarize it but neither party in this
seems to be particularly clean or right
which is kind of annoying is we like to
conclude on some sort of definitive
point perspective I guess um but you
know you know I mean I also without
getting too political I do you find it
kind of shocking when I see how openly
American politicians just attack China
and just say China steals from us china
is a Peyton thief and an IP thief and
like choice I mean those allegations are
not with
out Merritt I mean I then they're not
they're not but you know usually when
these conversations happen there so
there's so much more subtle and
diplomatic where is America politicians
have taken to just being like uh you
know Chinese a thief china cheats china
etc and i don't think that's perfectly
fair in the other thing so what does
sorry go ahead white well i mean just a
quick point i was gonna make is china is
a huge country and we underestimate how
huge it is as a population and size and
scale and all of these things so does
the other thing even if Huawei is in in
cahoots with the government in the state
that doesn't I mean yeah it implicates
the Chinese state but it doesn't
implicate all of China doesn't implicate
all of China's businesses and it's
dangerous for countries to also
generalize in that fashion as well I
feel right yeah what what's what's very
interesting to me is that apparently
dieter I don't know if if if phil
mentioned this to you when you were
talking to him but apparently
androidcentral has been blacklisted by
the Great Firewall so you can't reach
androidcentral in China anymore of
apparently over there reporting on on
this on this issue I had not heard that
that's that's amazing anodyne so China
is taking this very seriously ok say the
betta crazy affair with you we should
like stub ourselves but before we start
talking too much about things we don't
know about or understand yeah I don't
want to get too political here but yeah
before we wrap up I i do wanna tease a
couple of things which we've got coming
up so apparently i just want to give
this clip mentioned jolla which are the
guys who are working on developing amigo
device former splint nokia guys who i
like to call splinter cell but another
in its been so they're gonna show off
their meager based a western finland
next month so that's coming up I
bad that i really want to pronounce that
Hoyer instead of insert jolla or joy
awesome look cuz it must be Joe la jolla
but moving on ok if you must jaja want
to call it that one do that it doesn't
matter yeah so does that and also next
week a sous is going to debut the
platform to which me and I'm going to be
there live in person but with better
lighting that I have had on today's
podcast so that's happening on tuesday i
believe so choose the next week the
platform launch event is happening we
may we may have to move the podcast
timing a little bit to accommodate that
event happening but I should be
reporting having touched it and play
with it and probably touched all the 17
different accessories that it ducks into
a pretty sure is gonna be a phone
looking into a tablet ducking into a
keyboard that makes it windows 8 laptop
talking into an all-in-one desktop
talking you to a tank they just showed
the final version of the original
padfone at mwc like it's to the point
now where they're going to announce the
launch event for the PadFone three at
the same time that they're showing the
padfone 2 for the first time okay I just
combined them into more still muck idea
in the US ever yeah at the end of the
padfone 2 event they're gonna be like
and come back join us again uh in two
months for our pad poetry of it I'm
actually excited to see the padfone 2 I
think there's been some specs leaked
that really make it kind of like a
pretty bunch of a beast of a phone very
similar specs to the optimus G if I
remember correctly so I'm excited to say
I'm very eager to hear what you think
about it glad when you do actually get
to to see it in person all right I sure
I should do my utmost to give you the
first-person experience and also Annie I
need to just apologize to anybody you're
watching a show by because I've been
messing around with my mood lights here
in my room because this podcast started
wow I had daylight and I was so
delighted because for once I'm not doing
cast in the middle of the night and then
Dale I just kind of died half of an hour
into the podcast and I'm like I don't
think I'm visible anymore and incited
screwing around with this despite your
background has gotten progressively
darker but you're still you're still
illuminated properly so yeah that's it
that's all I got so do we have anything
else to wrap up here we think we're
we're just we're just waiting for you to
wrap it Dan alright so let's wrap it
even you that was a virgin mobile show
for the week of October eighth we want
to thank you guys for tuning in of
course you can follow us on twitter i'm
at DC seifert chris is at z power Vlad
is that Vlad savov and dieter is at back
lawn and they can email us right yeah
mobile at the verge you watch you
why not yeah why not I don't show it
 with the verge or you can tweet
at us or whatever you want and there's
the farms I think in a farm and the
forums yes so jump in there go crazy in
our mobile forums because we always like
to see what you guys are thinking and
doing in there as always st of ideas I
mean yesterday's about seventy percent
read already is uncredited yes yes we
always do like to cultivate or free
ideas from there so right um next week
we should be back on Tuesday but like
ads flat mentioned we may have to shift
our normal time light a little bit but
we will definitely give you guys a heads
up as to what's going on there but for
that's it for now so I guess we're
signing off so see you guys later thanks
guys hi guys
