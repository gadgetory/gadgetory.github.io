Aspire a seven which was just announced
here in New York City it's a a new
laptop that has a hinge they're calling
a ezel hinge it allows the screen to
completely allows it to have complete
freedom basically you can move it
however you want it has a touchscreen
obviously for windows 8 and you can open
it in a regular laptop mode like this
and you can close it here's the hinge
and when you open it up you can pop it
out through the sides there's a lot of
tension in the hinge she can keep it
however you want interestingly asus
decided to move the touch pad to the
back here so you can put it in a mode
like that a little bit like the
Microsoft Surface has a backlit keyboard
it's powered by a dual-core 1.2 hurts
Intel processor and we don't have much
information on pricing but it can be
available exclusively from bestbuy here
in the United States and that's the acer
aspire a seven hey guys this is david
with a virgin we're looking at the acer
aspire p3 they just announced it to the
internet new york city they're calling
it the world's first ultrabook
convertible so on the one hand it's kind
of like a laptop it has a keyboard and a
big screen here and it's powered by an
Intel processor has a 5-megapixel camera
10-point multi-touch so it's a pretty
normal windows 8 machine and it even has
kind of a really nice keyboard here but
it also it pops out of its little sort
of clumsy deck at slums clumsy box here
it becomes just sort of a regular
windows 8 tablet it's kind of thick and
kind of heavy but it's super powerful of
his Dolby home theater audio it has you
know pretty regular ultrabook specs and
they promise super long battery life
it's a pretty interesting idea it's kind
of like the Microsoft Surface in that
it's definitely designed to be a tablet
but also work in a dock when it's docked
it is a little awkward and flimsy and
folds down it has pen support and it's
again it's kind of thick for a tablet
but certainly superlight for a laptop
it's going to be coming out soon no word
yet on price or availability for any of
Oda stirs announced but it's a pretty
interesting new thing it's an ultrabook
convertible and I bet we can start to
see a lot of those so that is the acer
aspire p3 now we're taking a look at the
iconia a1 it's the only tablet acer
launched today and in some ways it's
kind of the least interesting product it
does basically everything the ipad mini
it does it has a 1024 x 768 display
which is you know decent-looking it's
seven point nine inches it has two
things that are interesting about it
there's a five finger gesture where you
just tap on the screen with all five
fingers and it'll wake it up and kick to
whatever particular app you choose so in
this case it goes to the calendar and
then there's another app there's another
one oops where it's off and you do it
with two thumbs and it will launch into
another app otherwise this is basically
the nexus 7 in the body of the ipad mini
it's relatively stock Android there's
not a lot of extra apps or anything here
not a lot of skinning going on but it's
also just generally not that interesting
what is interesting is the 169 dollar
price it is a quad-core processor it
runs pretty well and it's one hundred
and sixty dollars less than the cheapest
ipad mini for an android tablet with
basically the same specs and what
appears to be you know a half decent
setup here plus pretty cool features
with gestures so it's a little big and a
little thick it feels like kind of a
knockoff iPad Mini but it's cheap so
what can you expect that is the acer
iconia a1 the new tablet just launched
today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
