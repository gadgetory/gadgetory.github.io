glad and with me now is hella MA from
razor and he's going to talk to us about
a couple of new products of the
company's introducing here first up
there's the reasonably watch well just
taking a look at it from the outside
everybody's going to say very obvious
saying it looks like a casio g-shock
watch so have you combine a casio
g-shock watch with smart features from
smart watches that's what happening here
we've designed what we think is a razor
design digital watch that has full
features like alarm stopwatch and then
we put a secondary screen at the bottom
of the watch that displays notifications
that you get from your iOS or Android
devices directly to your wrist so
basically the digital watch the things
up when you phoned us really what we're
looking at and it's very rugged but
razor is a gaming company so is there
any game angle to this product yeah
definitely so one thing that the Naboo
element does is watch to watch
communication so what that means is it's
a little bit like a 3ds streetpass
functionality where two people are
wearing the watch or one person who is
wearing the watch or and another person
is wearing the reasonable man can shake
hands and copy exchange contact
information but what I'm getting it is
this is an open platform that we're
designing and that we have an SDK for
that other companies and app makers can
use and make apps to utilize that
functionalities for example we have an
app maker that made an app where you
shake hands and you can add each other
on Steam and compare steam profiles the
entry level watches 149 99 and it's
available right now on register you can
pre-order it in ships end of this month
there's also more expensive version that
comes with a few more metallized parts
same functionalities and it's 14
199 looking at the stand here this is
your new webcam except raise the
Stargazer could you give us a quick run
through what it does for streamers who
already streaming the game content at 60
frames per second this is great because
now they can stream themselves to match
with that 60 frames a second and the
reason why it has you know all the
sensors on the front is because it has
intel realsense technology built-in am I
correct in thinking this is the first
external webcam that has real sense
built in yes is where the first one that
brings this to market in the big way and
why real sense matters to game is is
being able to isolate the background
because it has that perception you can
have the streamers face down in the
corner but there is no background
abscess normally it would need a huge
green screen set up behind you with what
lighting and a screen behind you that
takes up a whole room basically with
this camera you can do it right in
camera so you can take this with you if
you're traveling as a streamer for
example you always have that cut out
silhouette of yourself right on the
stream this is going to come out in q2
this year and it's going to be 199 so
that's it from razor guys stay tuned to
the birds you can find us on the verge
