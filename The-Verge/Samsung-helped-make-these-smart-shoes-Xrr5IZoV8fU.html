Verge and I'm here at mobile war
Congress and I am wearing the i/o fit
Smart Balance shoes I hope it is one of
the first companies to be spun out of
Samsung's Creative Lab startup
accelerator and while the idea of smart
shoes isn't exactly new they're one of
the first companies that's really trying
to put a whole bunch of stuff inside
fitness and training shoes so what's
inside these shoes our Bluetooth sensor
and pressure-sensitive insoles as well
as a battery in that battery lasts 5 to
7 days and can be wirelessly recharged
the pressure-sensitive Souls can be used
for all sorts of different activities so
running CrossFit strength training and
they're also selling a separate pair of
shoes that are made specifically for
golfing now there's all sorts of things
you can do with this data with the app
that comes along with the shoes you can
see how far you're leaning forward or
back left to right the strength that
you're using to hit the ground or
walking with there's a whole bunch of
data coming off these shoes and you see
it live in an app along with a live view
of yourself and you can compare multiple
recordings to so you can give the app to
a coach and they can show you which one
of your golf swings was better and why
the shoes themselves they're also really
comfortable too they're really light
they've got a mesh covering so they
breathe really well
they're grippy on the bottom they're
everything you want out of a general
fitness shoe so I hope it's gonna be
bringing these shoes to Kickstarter
later this summer probably around July
the fitness shoes are gonna cost about
$1.99 and the golf shoes are gonna cost
about 249 each of those are gonna cost
about a quarter less on Kickstarter if
you get to them early so look for them
later this year four more here at Mobile
