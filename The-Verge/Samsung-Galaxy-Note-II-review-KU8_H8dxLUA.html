the Galaxy Note 2 a 5.5 inch smartphone
/ tablet hybrid that ships with latest
version of Android onboard jelly thanks
to improvements in Google's operating
system and Samsung's excellent Exynos
processor the Galaxy Note 2 is one of
the quickest and most responsive devices
of any kind yes smooth and fluid enough
to compete with the standard setting
iPhone and consistently snappy Windows
Phone interfaces I noticed a clear
advantage for the note 2 over the HTC
One X one of the leading Android
handsets speaking of Android flagships
it would have escaped your attention
that the Galaxy Note 2 looks an awful
lot like Samsung's top-of-the-line
smartphone the galaxy s3 similarities
between the two and more than skin-deep
as a note 2 is built in the exact same
components as the S free from quad-core
system-on-chip to the 8 megapixel camera
on the back the new device adds a couple
of upgrades of its own however firstly
there's the S Pen Stylus which has been
redesigned from the original S Pen to
made lighter and longer though it still
works with the same high degree of
accuracy and reliability it's based on
what coms inductive technology so
there's no need for batteries and you
can use it to navigate all around the
TouchWiz interface a new function for it
cold air view can now recognize when
you're hovering just above the note 2
screen and react accordingly Samsung's
harness this technology to give you
instant content previews that don't
require to click anywhere such as with
thumbnails when you hover over movie
timeline or by expanding s planner items
for more detail look Samsung's biggest
upgrade for the s-pen has been in his
handwriting recognition the original
Galaxy Note struggled with my
handwriting whereas the new device is
almost never wrong even when I try to
intentionally make my writing difficult
to decipher
this makes handwritten input on the new
tablet a legitimate and reasonable
option to consider if there's any
downside to the s-pen is that the still
scarcity of good drawing or editing apps
to make full use of its capabilities the
second important upgrade from Samsung
comes in the form of the 3100 milliamp
hour battery set under the note to use
glossy shell this gives it superb
endurance by smartphone standards anyway
as you can go through two days of
regular use without recourse to a charge
the first galaxy note was good in this
department but the note two takes that
lead an extra step forward camera
performance is as strong as you'd expect
from a device power in the galaxy as
freeze imaging hardware the note 2 takes
beautifully detailed pictures and shoes
excellent 1080p video Sam settings only
enhancements here have been a few
software tweaks like a burst mode and
some added editing options overall the
Galaxy Note 2 easily out does its Europe
predecessor as you might expect but also
surpasses the majority of Android
smartphones and tablets as well it's
lightning quick offers the best stylus
solution you can find on any mobile
device and last for days on a single
charge
sure it's far too large we considered a
smart phone but if you can accept having
to wield it with two hands instead of
one the Galaxy Note 2 may just be the
best Android device that you can buy
