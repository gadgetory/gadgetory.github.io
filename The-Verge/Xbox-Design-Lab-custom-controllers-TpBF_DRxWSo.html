slightly redesigned controller but if
white is in your style Microsoft has
introduced a new program called Xbox
design lab that is to turn that white
controller into something like this the
colorful new controller will be
available starting September for $79.99
which is only $20 more than standard
Xbox one controller if you want to add
your gamertag or maybe you want to name
your controller
there's laser engraving available for an
extra $9.99 this is the exact same
controller that comes with the new Xbox
1s which means that it's got a few new
features that includes Bluetooth which
gives you extended range and also means
you can connect up Wireless into your PC
the back of the controller has also
changed and that has this really nice
texture back that makes it really grippy
while you're playing so when you
customize it you can actually change the
color of just about every part of the
controller that includes the body the
back play the buttons the triggers and
the bumpers even the d-pad microsoft
says that there are 8 million different
possible color combinations the colors
look fantastic in person they're really
bright and they just kind of pop and way
you don't normally see on a game
controller what's really nice is that
while there are third-party companies
that do this kind of customization
they're usually a lot more expensive
than what Microsoft is offering starting
today you can log on to Xbox comm / Xbox
design lab to pre-order the controller
and you can already start playing around
with the tool to figure out which of
those eight million different color
combinations works for you for more
