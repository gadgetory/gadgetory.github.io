i'm here with Qualcomm and Bonnie
chapatti rata of the Qualcomm
development group he works on this
mobile development tablet which has a
quad-core apq8064 Snapdragon processor
inside for playing this game rain of
amira here which is a three-dimensional
hacking / title they protagonists who
might look a little bit familiar to you
she is modeled after the character in
desert winds a game which qualcomm
showed off to demonstrate the power of
its Snapdragon s3 while back and if you
want to talk a little bit about the what
we're seeing here well I think we're
seeing me die first tell me a bit about
what's going on in the scene here that
I'm playing so will be shown here is the
gameplay in the world would come in with
this quad core tablet comes with our
next generation GPU adreno 320 GPU and
as you can see with the game played high
quality why we are making use of the
power with the dt Adreno 320 GPU
combined with the power of the quad core
cpu's with each of the CPU is being a
great
see people running at one point Tyga
guards with the combined 6 gigahertz
processor see and can you tell me a
little bit more about this game and when
we could expect to play it ourselves so
the game was currently something that we
are working actively on we are
developing it so as you can see this is
one of the very first connections of the
game with the advanced gameplay with
multiple levels and we expect this came
to be available very soon sometime later
this year all right you know what kind
of price would expect for a title like
this um this would be something I would
have to get back at going back that's
fine and uh uh i don't know i think i
think i might be dying again run away
you're doing buddy but so far it looks
like all I've got to do is build up a
little bit of a little bit of meter here
and then I get oh I can do it quick oh
there we go and get a little quick swipe
here on the directional pad to roll once
I build up enough oh I don't know once
you build up enough power you can
unleash one of those special attacks i
showed you earlier alright thank you for
watching that's reign of amira on the
quad core apq8064 come in next summer
for the processor not sure about the
game not thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
