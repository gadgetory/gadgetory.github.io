with the gmail iOS app it just came out
this afternoon and had a bunch of bugs
and got some really terrible feedback
and Google's actually pulled it from the
App Store but hopefully to be back soon
so we're just going to take a look at
what it look like when you're able to
get it again so the first thing you see
for right now is an error again with the
notifications and at least google knows
and is hopefully fixing that once you
get in it looks just like the gmail web
app it's pretty simple it's put in a
different rapper it works offline now
but you know all the functionality is
basically the same there's this swype
out menu which is pretty nice it's an
easy way to get to your labels and some
of your other folders and you can search
which is pretty nice it's faster in my
experience than the the web app search
except for right now yeah so the
conversations are just like they are in
the gmail web app they're threaded and
it's easy to respond and you can reply
all or forward pretty easily you can
flip through your emails and you know
mass delete or archive or what have you
one of a lot of weird things and this is
with photos if you if somebody sends you
a photo you can't actually open the
photo in the app you have to open it up
and then go to the screen in the browser
where it still won't let you do anything
and then you actually have to open it up
in Safari before it'll let you download
the image to your iPhone so that's
annoying if trying to send a photo is is
nice actually you can you can email a
photo that's on your phone's camera roll
you get access to all the photos you've
taken on your iPhone so you can just
flip through and pick one and it will
automatically upload it one thing that's
not here that we wish were is
integration with your iPhone's address
book you're supposed to be able to just
immediately search through all of your
iphone contacts but right now none of
that is showing up when you go to send a
message
that app is also available on the iPad
and it has you know a lot of the same
issues so again hopefully Google's
fixing those but as you can see it's
once again just the gmail web app just
in a wrapper this time it's the iPad web
app and it works offline otherwise it's
pretty much the same that's the gmail
web</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
