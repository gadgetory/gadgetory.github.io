felt like at some point I lived my whole
life up there that was former NASA
astronaut scott kelly who returned to
earth in march after spending 340 days
on the International Space Station his
year in space is a stepping stone for
future missions to Mars and deep space
because it's helping NASA understand a
long-term spaceflight affects a human
body but how does long-term spaceflight
affect in mind what about the
psychological challenges of being in
space
in short what will he take mentally to
get to Mars a mission to the red planet
will last two to three years that means
that for two to three years astronauts
will live in microgravity isolated and
far away from home they won't have many
comforts they won't be able to just step
outside and breathe some fresh air or
pick up the phone and call their loved
ones
and they'll be living in a high-risk
environment where they might die if
anything goes wrong such a stressful
situation is likely to have
psychological implications microgravity
can add to the stresses as well and that
can produce some stress and strain
maneuvering around and that's McKenna's
a space psychiatrist at the University
of California San Francisco also the way
people look in microgravity sometimes
they look puffy and sometimes kind of
angry and so it can be a stressful issue
as well one of the main reasons for
Scott Kelly's year on the space station
was to understand how his body change
and adapting in space so on the space
station while I was there was 400
different experiments and of those a lot
or life science experiments you know
most of those are related to
understanding our physiology so we can
go you know further into the solar
system and tomorrow someday we already
know some of the physical problems
austra not space people who spend time
in space experience bone loss
microgravity causes muscles to shrink
making astronauts weaker and less
coordinated and all struts also eat less
than they should and it's key to get the
right nutrients to stay healthy but
there's a lot we still don't know about
the effects of a long space mission on
the human mind for now we know that
astronauts in space sometimes suffer
from depression NASA astronaut John
Blaha has admitted to becoming depressed
onboard the Russian station Mir in the
90s Blaha said he turned to a family
photo album every night to keep him
going
and deal with the homesickness we also
know that astronauts often develop
sleeping problems in space Space Station
are noisy and try falling asleep when
you're floating Plus because the space
station zooms around the earth 16th time
a day there's no real morning and night
to tell your body when to be sleepy it's
like feeling jet-lagged all the time
often astronauts sleep less than 6 hours
a day in space and lack of sleep can
trigger behavioral problems we also know
that conflicts can rise and on crew
members and Mission Control on the
ground being constrained in a relatively
small space with the same people for
months on end is challenging especially
when these people come from different
backgrounds and speak different
languages well you know you're deprived
of so much on earth and then you have
you know all these possibilities you
like your crewmates but you're you know
you don't have a variety of people and
things and possibilities when you're
living in such a compliant closed
environment for so long nASA has
guidelines to deal with mental
breakdowns in space you someone has
severe anxiety paranoia hysteria or
attempted suicide
astronauts are instructed to find the
person's wrists and ankles with duct
tape restrain the body with bungee cords
and administer tranquilizers the
procedures has never been used and NASA
says that no behavioral emergencies have
ever been reporting you in spaceflight
but there are no causes of anxiety and
conflict in space during the Skylab 4
mission in 1973 astronauts got so
stressed out that they turned off radio
communication with the ground and spent
the whole day ignoring NASA during a
solute 6 mission russian cosmonauts at a
dream of having to take and started
obsessing over it and he started
worrying about well gee what if i really
did have a tooth problem here i couldn't
do anything about and he just sort of
obsessed about it
that's neat Candice again it wasn't
critical for the mission in the sense
that he was sort of talked down and he
was able to continue to function but it
leads to the idea that for some
astronauts to experience anxiety of
being in the space environment also
mattifies it they will perceive it as a
worry about a met
a physical problem so almost like a
psychosomatic reaction but it's not all
bad
some alternates have reported a change
of perspective seeing Earth from space
give them a better appreciation for
people and the environment so I'm
originally from Italy and I moved here
five years ago and I honestly think that
being away from home kind of changes you
somehow and you've been on the ISS for a
year which is the farthest you can
possible be do you think that you're in
spaces change you some way yeah
absolutely you know I think you know
just living on that space station for so
long and understanding how difficult it
was to build and operate kind of
inspired think that if there's something
that we want to do we can do it if we
put our minds to it looking out of the
earth over the course of a year and
seeing the impacts that our presence
have on the environment especially in
certain parts of Asia you know makes me
feel like there's more that everyone can
do including myself to make earth a
better place for the future inhabitants
and you know when you're when you're
detached from Earth for so long you do
feel a little bit more empathy for kind
of all the bad stuff that goes on down
here yeah I mean how as it as your year
in space changed your idea about the
environment and what we should do to
preserve the earth well you know the
atmosphere is very looks like a thin
film over the surface so looks really
fragile and
it's what keeps us alive so it's worth
protecting the psychological challenges
Oscar nuts will face on a mission to
Mars will be even greater on the
International Space Station crew morale
is kept up by sending surprise presents
treats like fruits and vegetables or by
arranging phone calls with favorite
movie stars or sports figures astronauts
can also easily keep in touch with loved
ones on earth through emails and phone
calls and they talk to a psychologist on
a regular basis but on a mission to Mars
astronauts would be more isolated than
ever
communication with earth would have a
twenty to forty minute delay so close
with friends and family are out of the
question
crew members also wouldn't be able to
rely on Mission Control to solve
emergency situations another's boredom
people's schedules on International
Space Station are packed up with
experiments cleaning and maintenance but
a journey to Mars will last much longer
than the usual six-month day on the ISS
some studies are simulating missions to
Mars to figure out how people deal with
the stress and confinement in one funded
in part by the European Space Agency six
men were locked up for 520 days in a
fixed space ship that simulated a
journey to Mars some crew members
reported being depressed another one
developed insomnia and the simulation
didn't even include microgravity and the
actual dangers of space travel on the
International Space Station one of the
favorite activities is to gaze out the
window and look at our planet on a
mission to Mars there'll be a time when
our planet will look like a tiny star no
one knows how people might react to that
right now there's never been a human
being who hasn't had some contact with
the earth visually either seeing it from
the moon or being on the ground or being
in the water you
place in a sense of being in contact
while on Mars the earth will be a
insignificant greenish blue dot in the
heavens and that kind of earth out of
you and everything that's ever been
important to you being so distant and so
trivial may have an effect
psychologically on some of the
astronauts as well so what advice would
you have for Austin Austin are embarking
on a journey to Mars you mean like a
three-year journey you know a year is a
really long time so I would say you know
try to keep that in perspective manage
your energy and fatigue during the
course of your time getting there and
then on the surface one thing I always
tried to think about is that even on the
last day of maybe even two being there
for a year I would have to be able to
respond to an emergency situation the
same as if it was my first day so I
would suggest to them pace yourselves
would you ever want to go to Mars
I would but it's easy for me to say that
knowing that I probably won't be able to
but I think in a few years if someone
said hey we got a trip to Mars would you
like to go I'd probably volunteer now I
wouldn't go on that one-way trip to Mars
I think those people are I don't know
what's the right word but I think you
know having spent a year on the space
station I can't imagine spending the
rest of my life in an environment like
that where you can't go out and get
fresh air you'd want to come back
absolutely
I think anyone they send there if you
send someone and they're gonna stay
there forever they're gonna have a
change of heart at some point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
