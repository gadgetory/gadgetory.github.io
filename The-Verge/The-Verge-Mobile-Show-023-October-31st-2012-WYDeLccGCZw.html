hurts but whatever man it's awesome
we're gonna push through we got a ton of
talk about it's gonna be exciting
therefore you should stay tuned be happy
there's all the show hi I'm dieter bohn

October 29 2012 today the day we're
recording is the well known
internationally beloved holiday my
father's birthday happy birthday dad I

have been good yeah I just like
information for somebody to steal his
identity yeah everybody knows his
birthday anyway mr. bone dr. Bowen he is
a doctor and so is my sister like
everybody in my family has got
doctorates except for me but you're this
issue out of the family oh come on
dieter is a doctor of mobile telephony
he's got enough knowledge
a geeky 'used doctorate ever we need to
sell phones because as I said at the
outset I'm cranky not really though I'm
happy I'm happy because there is so much
news to talk about and so many big
announcements to talk about and I'm
happy that Vlad is happy about your nose
phone so it's finally here but now my
little thing here I want to do a little
impromptu demo ok tap and send on
Windows Phones all right cuz i just said
them up and they've got this got a
couple of Windows phones here in my
hands never got this crazy sound oh it's
not crazy anymore oh there it is so I
tapped a pair and that is happening but
the sound is cool you know so say I
haven't been able to tap and send
anything between DC phones but the sound
is cool so I've confirmed that um carry
on cool demo bro dude the sound theory
here you know what no you don't know
that I'll do it too what's up we're all
just gonna sit here and make noises no
I'm not one of us um Chris huh I'm the
only one here with after windows phone
it's very exciting to me it really
should be hey uh I'm gonna stop teasing
people and I'm gonna show these two
phones side by side and hopefully it's
be useful oh no my face is visible oh no
i've got by a volume turned off so you
can't hear it okay anyway um yeah so
Chris how is life without Olivia 920 I
hate you glad I and I and you to dieter
and and tom warren if you're listening
right now i also hate you because all of
these gentleman doesn't happen i need
midol or not what tom warren does not
have one yet
knowledge no but he's with you or he was
with ya he was he is he is currently at
at the conference proper talking to
developers and nerding it up about
Microsoft and there's a lot turned up
about to be honest yes let's get off
without it I mean since I started off
with this random exposition on windows
phone and it steps and feature that lets
kick off with Windows Phone 8 which mike
so finally launched so yeah so they
launched it in Seattle uh two days ago
three days ago I've lost track of time
and you know we've been waiting and
waiting and waiting to find out what the
big secret is why they wouldn't allow
hardware manufacturers to show off the
entire OS and so on and so forth we
actually talked to them about that we
talked to Joe Belfiore and his answer
was you know we wanted to get the
hardware manufacturers you know a chance
to you know show off their wares talk
about their their Hardware on their own
timeline and we wanted to hold and have
our own launch for windows phone 8 so
it's not like there was a big conspiracy
or mystery they just wanted to try and
see how it went this time around I think
it probably went okay for them I think
that you know we obviously knew what was
going on you know a long time ago but
maybe general consumers didn't but you
know in terms of like big huge new
features it's sort of like nips and
tucks in terms of like actual user
experience that the really big big big
feature in Windows Phone 8 is that it
shares the same quote core with windows
8 which means that they'll be able to
get a hardware updates out more quickly
and they can support faster processors
and bigger screen sizes and you know
theoretically it should enable more
cross-platform you know code and
collaboration between Windows 8 Windows
Phone 8 in the future for now briefly
like and I'm just going to mention
briefly you're right in terms of
introducing brand new features there
just launch event I think the only thing
that Microsoft shota was the active lock
screen where applications can take over
the lock screen
and they talked about the fact that
Facebook can do it facebook application
got Bing and they got a couple of other
apps but yeah and and by the way as
silly of a feature as that is I have to
say I really like the Bing one cuz you
know Bing as much as I kind of like
vaguely dislike it as a search engine
the one thing Bing does very well is its
homepage and their photography the
imagery that they use for their homepage
and and if you turn on the Bing
integration on what is funny home screen
you get that daily Bing image
automatically on the lock screen so you
know it's kind of cool you turn on the
phone you see new image every time and
it's always a really cool photo yeah but
the thing I was going to say is besides
that against tita says it there weren't
that many surprises but uh the thing
that stood out for me actually is
thinking about the weight of things
built up because usually when a company
bumps a deadline of bumps or release
back to where the Microsoft has been
doing I mean we knew as a fact that it
was because the software wasn't ready
but usually when a company is forced to
do that at the end they release it and
it's full of compromises full of holes
there's bugs there's issues its laws etc
now you guys go you know you go together
and as a pair you did a thorough Windows
Phone 8 review and I want us to get into
that but the thing that stood out for me
is that actually the stuff that is being
shipped in these review devices the HTC
windows phone 8x and Lumia 920 is really
robust and solid so windows phone 8
might have things that still need to be
refined and improved on but in terms of
just reliability and just functioning
and doing the things is supposed to do
I'm impressed I microsoft hasn't added
that much but the things that it has
added all seem to work mostly yeah
mostly the other there's one weird thing
yeah go ahead yeah well yeah just gonna
say that I think the single biggest
annoyance for me I'm a few friends not
many but a few who use
windows messenger and if I'm talking to
it's microsoft does not have their their
windows messenger story as together as
Apple does with I messages now with you
know between mountain lion and iOS 6
because like if your assignment I signed
on to windows messenger on a desktop
machine and you also have your Windows
Phone sitting next to you it is
completely random which messages go to
the phone and which messages go to the
PC like it's it's completely like insane
and unusable well now i'm using an
official email and other pc chris i'm
using adium well that Windows users is
pigeon I mean it's the same code bases
pigeon so yeah but I think it might be
true face politics up yeah um I'm not
sure if I works exactly like actually I
really like the chat integration in the
outlook com web site your website how
the chat is just off to the right of
your email but when I was doing that
with facebook chat I think messages
actually duplicated so yeah I think
we're on to something either the message
is duplicated or Agatha my phone and
then I got others on the outlook site
which is an idea you're right you can't
be sure worried the next message is
gonna come no it's great but I don't
want to trade on the negatives there are
a lot of good writing LC you know it
does but like the thing that I was
talking about is just the basic core you
know it's like nothing is crashing for
me nothing is freaking out well again
nothing is kind of a maybe an
overstatement maybe he things fe
oddities my sprout up but I expected a
mini disaster to be honest okay I just
expected app crashes and issues and
problems and this this feature will be
forthcoming soon cetera cetera and that
hasn't been ok so it's encouraging
another very reasonable thing to say
because you know as as few user-facing
changes as there aren't windows phone 8
they actually did
extricate the kernel of Windows Phone
and replace it with a completely
different kernel and it was basically a
complete architecture of the system so
able to say that you know we we review
these devices and it the existing legacy
apps worked fine and we didn't
experience any like crazy crashes is
pretty impressive in its own right DJ
what what did you listen guys you guys
watching I was watching cat I met the
chatter that I've gmail who's down for
some people assigned for me but um ya
know all of my actually i should mention
that i just noticed that all of my
google services simultaneously crashed I
don't have any access to anything right
now which is interesting usually if
that's a hurricane sandy situation oh
maybe I might have to break out the
podcast since I writing he's Isis about
this well that that's all I what that's
actually what happened during our google
hangout we did a hangout and I'm sure
that some of our listeners were
listening in when we did a hangout on
Monday to talk about the day's news cuz
monday was a big day and we'll get into
all that shortly but halfway through
apple announced that scott forstall was
leaving a hand and so with it was our
listeners kind of got a live peek at
advert editors freaking out at actual
news breaking which was I'm sure
enlightening for some view and confusing
for others so yes if there is a massive
Google services outage right now uh you
heard it here first yes so I think
because we've just confirmed it in the
UK and in Chicago and in that seattle
hotel room today we go that's Google
back to Windows Phone I was gonna say
that the most impressive thing speaking
of services about Windows Phone for me
is is the Sky Drive integration I know
that there was a bunch of it in Windows
Phone previous but this was the first
time
I really deeply used it and Microsoft
has done and just an incredibly good job
of making it feel a seamless and
connected and you don't have to think
about stuff when it sinks to SkyDrive
and my favorite part about it and I
think I mentioned this in the review is
you know apples got iCloud and you know
different apps can connect the iCloud
but you know apples being so aggressive
at hiding the file system that it's
really hard to sort of be like you've
got access to the stuff that gets saved
in iCloud where was SkyDrive it's very
transparent you know it saves a skydrive
you go to your SkyDrive and there it is
no problem yeah um Vlad actually pointed
out that the the photo integration was
really really good and you know so I
hadn't even like realized that I you
know I left it on because that was the
default so I hadn't paid attention to it
but I went and I started playing around
with it and it was like it had been
invisibly uploading my photos into a
folder that I could get to just without
me even thinking about it without me
setting it up without anything and it
was really impressive really amazing and
as an option you can also disable the
automatic uploads which I have to do
because I'm so picky about my photos
that I usually take about six versions
of them and if every single one was
uploaded to SkyDrive then me going
SkyDrive will be just the most
frustrating time in the world so many
dudes um but but anyway yeah SkyDrive
very much for my purposes again strictly
just for my purposes can replace Dropbox
um but for my purposes when using a
mobile phone which I primarily use
Dropbox on my mobile phone to take
photos and share them around so I can
access them on a computer I still prefer
Dropbox for everything else which
includes you know sharing things with
colleagues sharing things with friends
etc but the way to SkyDrive works is we
just be saying it's really nice and also
the new SkyDrive website which together
with outlook.com got overhaul during the
summer is really really nice like I I
never go to Dropbox a cover i always do
it I was manage things from my devices
and but also when i'm on dropbox oh come
on i feel like it's particularly
great layout or anything like that works
with SkyDrive is kind of a pleasure you
know you can drag things around it's
essentially a web app and it's nice um
but the thing that actually stands out
when we with SkyDrive is um I'm showing
people sample photos from our reviews
and I'm setting the skydrive pictures
and I like whoa sky dried lake I haven't
seen one of those and and I was gonna be
one thing that Microsoft's gonna have to
break through this I don't know
prejudice or just expectation that it's
not going to be as good as you know the
leading services because as I say if you
actually uploading photos to the cloud
it's just at least as good as Dropbox
speaking of Microsoft needing to break
through and get people to take them
legitimately in the smartphone space I
want to talk about Internet Explorer 10
I am really really impressed with its
speed and with how hell how well it
handles web pages but I've had to switch
it to full desktop mode because even
though it's a fast web standards
compliant browser most of the mobile web
is built for WebKit it's built for Apple
and it's built for Android browsers and
you know anybody else uses webkit Chrome
Safari you name it but of course uh IE
is not based on webkit just like firefox
is not based on webkit they've got their
own rendering engine and google
especially but there are a few other
sites see this browser and they treat it
like a second-class citizen they're like
now we're going to give you our old
mobile page that we coated in 2002 or
whatever right like it it's like using
IE 10 on google's web pages it it's the
same experience as if you're using
blazer on palm OS it's terrible um and
that was that was kind of an outdated
analogy I have to sedate her what one
that they sent around the overworked
down 2006 don't use any on Oda one on
twists today and I go cold out by a
bunch of people well I think it was a
good one so I'm just gonna recite it
saying that the Lumia 920 a nation of
mine that's a spoiler eats it you can
find it on Twitter it's a really ancient
leaving 920 m be a related analogy
that's so I'm gonna say yeah um very
good as yours I can tell ie10 is a
really good browser and it's just it
can't get no respect and there's like
that same exact thing of they need to
get attention from outside of the
Microsoft bubble and browser and people
accepting SkyDrive is a first class
citizen of the cloud of the web and apps
you know Microsoft told us I think
they've got 46 of the top 50 apps that
they're targeting or something whatever
that's great they need more of those top
apps I know what's the number they hit
120,000 or something but the problem
isn't number of apps because the numbers
game is the numbers game the the problem
is the quality of the apps and how well
they're updated and Chris you actually
made a really good point about this a
while ago that like Bill they'll like
tick the box off getting a nap and then
a year later the app is still basically
in the same state that it was and that
hasn't been updated right yeah and I can
I can think of a bunch of examples of
that where you know they obviously you
know paid or otherwise encouraged a
top-tier developer to make a brand-name
app for the platform or Microsoft just
said screw we'll do it ourselves like
they did Twitter and Facebook but but
you know when they're good when they're
reaching out these third-party
developers to make their apps for work
for Windows Phone I think they're just
the other like you say dieter they're
just taking the box to get it on windows
phone and then it's kind of like set it
and forget it and then you look back six
months or a year later and the app is in
the same state maybe it's gotten one
update to fix like a critical bug but
then meanwhile in iOS and Android
they've been updated every you know two
days it I the the running joke for a
long time dieter I think you were you
notice this as well said on Android are
do for a while was being updated like it
was a Spotify already or one of those
tools are you updated every 25 minutes
was ridiculous yeah for like a month or
two um and you will you will not see
that on Windows Phone that's for sure
yeah what else do you want to say uh the
the SmartGlass xbox stuff seems pretty
cool i haven't played with it a ton
chris you or you were messing around
with that more often than i was yeah i
mean it i went into it thinking okay
this is gonna be a silly gimmick that
you know i mean it'll be like cool
whiz-bang feature that i'll never use
but i could realistically see using
smart glass as my full-time xbox control
cuz i'm not really a gamer you know I
don't have my xbox to play games like I
bought Fez and it's going to take me
five years to beat it but apart from Fez
I basically just used it for watching
movies and whatnot and so for that kind
of stuff the the remote control that is
in smart glass works great because it's
basically a trackpad for the Xbox that's
on your phone or tablet now long-term I
don't necessarily see myself using smart
glass on a windows phone but the cool
thing about it is that Microsoft is
going cross-platform with it they're
launching clients for iOS for Android
and of course for Windows Phone and for
windows 8 so but yeah it works very well
my only complaint with it is that it
never thought that it was on the same
network as the xbox I don't know why
because they were on the same network
and when that happens my first thought
was okay this is kind of crazy cool that
I can control my xbox from anywhere in
the world basically because they don't
have to be on the same network but the
downside of that is that it disables the
SmartGlass browser and the keyboard but
you can't for some reason so you can't
type with it and you also can't use it
to browse websites using your phone
projected onto the xbox and I was never
able to solve that problem I tried a
budget I enough cellular data I like
like I have three different Wi-Fi
networks in my house I tried all three
but you know it was on the same subnet
as my expects the whole time
what the deal was but strictly as a
remote control it's it's awesome like
regardless of whether you're using an
android phone and android tablet an
iphone and ipad whatever get smart glass
if you have an xbox for sure so internal
launch hardware I mean we should just
get into it like there's there's a bunch
of phones we saw the 822 coming to
verizon and it's just like whatever
t-mobile's got the 820 i forget what
t-mobile's is they attend all these like
mid tier nokia lumia devices they're all
basically like iterations on the same
thing it's a big chunky phone there's
the t VES from samsung which basically
feels like you know we got a hands-on
with it finally it basically feels like
a like a galaxy s2 it's like a plasticky
Windows Phone it's super light assume
that's so crazy s2 I would say maybe s3
it's like a little less three I guess
it's not quite as big deal it to me
because I seem to recall the big sales
pitch from Samsung being that it had
aluminum excuse me aluminium
construction it's training you're like
right and I'm playing around with it I
took off his back cover its classic thin
plastic from Samsung and extremely
flexible and you know I'm kind of poking
at it I'm touching it from every angle
I'm like I don't feel any metal here
well it it pretty much is a galaxy s
free running Windows Phone which you
know probably some people would love but
it's kind of in the woman right so we
spoke to HTC at this launch event and
they explicitly said we want to stop
having our windows phones basically be
repackaged android phones and the first
phone that we're doing that with we're
designing it as a windows phone from
start to finish was the 8x and of the
two you know there's to basically hero
launch devices for windows phone 8 the
8x and the nokia 920 the Lumia 920 and
we have already we have reviewed the 8x
and Vlad is is it fair to say that you
are smitten is it fair to say that that
maybe
or you're so deeply in love that if you
were walking in up here you wouldn't you
wouldn't notice if you walked out the
end you just keep going and walking on
yeah just holding both of them up like a
salesman and I just feel ready good
doing that um I'm trying to be useful to
the people who are actually watching the
show but then holding them up like that
is kind of starts feel like an
infomercial and yeah i mean i really
like the 8x and i'm not alone um Aaron
phoneDog what's their name Baker Baker
that's right I just had two swords
twitter handle somebody retweeted him
and you saying the same thing that has
got the edx on his desk and he just kind
of randomly picking it up and playing
with it and you know touching it and
looking at it it still phone we're
talking about here and keep in mind out
of the gutter I mean I just think it's
really nice a design phone and these are
this is something that you said first
and I've echoed a bunch of times it
seems to really flow very well with the
ethos and the aesthetic of Windows Phone
in general right because to me windows
phone 8 is the maturation of the windows
for an idea I would windows phone 7 and
just the square tiles which didn't have
the size flexibility it wasn't there but
now that you can resize the tiles I mean
I've seen some of the PR people who are
showing of these phones and there was
some ridiculously nice patterns built
into their home screens just by having
you knows square one another one a tiny
tile and you know they just arrange them
in to really kick it as peasants um but
yeah it's all kind of minimalist and
stripped down and kind of modest in
terms of you know it doesn't take up all
the space that there's no skeuomorphism
the sole extra chrome and all of that
junk and we're just following a kind of
involves that in a really nice way from
windows phone 7 and you know frankly if
this phone was just running with his
phone 7 I would be like well that's a
great design with a sucky OS but I feel
like that there are so many little
tweaks and um
I mean maybe the home screen change
seems more than it is in practice that's
the way that I feel like in practice it
just gives so much more flexibility so
I'm excited by the airwaves like I feel
it's fresh and it's different and even
though there's a massive massive gap
where the app ecosystem should be is it
just to somebody like myself and you
guys it just really new and fresh and I
just need to explore it and I just want
to explore I need to and and just the
design of the EDX is brilliant and it
just feels so good in the hand and is so
ultra matte when I was saying it has
some economic issues like as a 4.4 you
scream but it's exactly as tall as the
Lumia and 20 which is a 4.5 inch screen
but I'm the difference when you hold in
the two in your hand is crazy I edicts
just makes everything else who's so fat
now can I can I provide a counterpoint
to absolutely everything we just said
blood okay yes so so first of all and
and if any HTC employees are listening
right now I apologize in advance because
I'm gonna sound a little cranky and I
know and I want to emphasize that my
views on this phone are not shared by
pretty much anyone else on this team and
I also think that my negative views may
have been influenced by the fact that I
was set a sense of black one when
everyone at HTC knows very well that I
like colors so I want to know I want to
know who at HTC is trolling me and why I
got one right here Chris it's very blue
I know I know you have a second I
believe me and it has a it's empty logo
on the bottom it's healthy I'd known
that oh you're just trolling me ah but
looks oh so i will say a few things
about the 8x1 the phone is too square
it's annoyingly square so it no matter
where you're holding it no matter where
you're holding it up or down along the
edge of the phone yet one of the the
corners is always digging into your hand
it doesn't roll across the hand nicely
as most phones do even squarish phones
like the iphone are rounded enough at
the
coroner so that it isn't annoying but
that the the 8x is square enough so that
it does dig into your hand that's for
the first problem too it's a the soft
touch is so soft touchy that I just got
an email from Jeff at HTC saying yes HTC
employees are listening aah Jeff I'm
sorry for what I'm doing to the 8x right
now but I'm gonna continue um now that I
know that I'm on a stage the the back of
the phone is a little too rough so it I
had I wouldn't call it difficulty but it
was like a it was a little bit tougher
to like put it into and pull it out of
my pocket than I would normally expect
with the phone even a soft touch phone
and then third and somebody else made
this observation to I can't remember
whose you dieter or Josh but i agree
someone was pointing out that despite
how thin it is for some strange reason
it feels thicker than it actually is
yeah it does it's weird yeah yeah and
and so I guess those are my three big
ones with the design don't get me wrong
like it yes it was very good mr. really
you missed the real complaint about the
designer there's only one genuine
complained that i have about the design
and that's the power button which is on
the top and I'm used to step in being on
the side but it's sort of it's easier to
hit from the front then on the back
which makes no sense and like I'm
constantly missing it I'm constantly
like having to press in and like push
harder than I ought to get it you know
if you're gonna have this nice you know
angled thing on the back you should be
able to sort of just tap on that that
ridge on the back to get it but instead
you've got like reach all the way up
there and push down on it it's sin is
really going that's Christ you only do
complain Appert over the pass free
minister everything else is just a crazy
girl riffing and I'm gonna say but it is
the bit is so soft touchy that I can't
pull it out of my pocket it's a free
room it's like it's like it's basically
an adhesive back like I could probably a
stick it to the outside
my pants and it would just stay there
like it's really adhesive but but yeah
the power button is completely flush and
and Vlad I think you pointed this out as
well the position of the power button
relative to the volume buttons is such
that it's very difficult for some
strange reason I found myself constantly
pressing the power button and
accidentally triggering the volume so
I'd be with you know jack the volume up
or down one point you're on the 30-point
scale that they use now that that's true
that's true and it happened to me the
first day or so but the other thing I
would say is I'm adapting and and I'll
give you I'll give you the point about
the edge as well it does dig into your
palm a little bit but then you just kind
of adapt your grip a little bit and I
don't want to sound like Steve Jobs I
don't want to be like you're holding it
wrong chris fix your grip but I'm just
saying you you kind of adapt in these
things fade into the background like
that they don't stop being an issue I
spoke with HTC people and and I was
saying to them you need a sign my own
power button because everybody else is
doing it and it just makes so much more
sense like Nokia LG Samsung everybody's
melting on the side apart from apple and
that's where the power button really
belongs particularly on this really talk
phones because there is no way that you
can use any phone with a 4.5 inch screen
or above or even the 8x with one hand
and not have to readjust your grip to
reach it up and then come back down to
the capacitive keys to the very bottom
where is it if the power button is on
the side then you've got no problem but
but still you know go ahead Chris whence
when Samsung first started doing the
side power buttons I was like this is
the dumbest thing ever and I now kind of
don't like it when a phone's power
button isn't on the side especially to
your point glad if it's like 45 inches
are above like I get really annoyed if
it's not on the side yeah just yet the
other thing I was gonna say a blue out
of my mind ya know it was the fact that
a made no secret I've got a 920 here
with me and i can tell you he ate eggs
in spite of its flaws that we just
discussed
is the phone I keep turning to like I
just wanna you know it is the one I
prefer I mean does the other thing is
I'm very open to the fact that a bunch
of people might prefer the Libya also
something else but the 8x just kind of
really appeals to me and that's
basically the instr and i don't i don't
think i'm alone i think it's a really
well-designed phone I also think thing
that you mentioned about HC not just
taking its Android designs over the
windows phone or even flipping around
just you know posing designs between
operating system is a good thing because
one of these designers they need to be
paid they need to have jobs and they
need to do something fresh enough to
keep us interested I think the EDX is
totally one of those devices yes I will
agree with you on that as as many
complaints as i have about specific
design points on the 8x i do uh you know
i have to give it to HTC for making
something that is very notably different
from their android line and that's
something that you know i think that
they are very cognizant cognizant of the
fact they fought in the 7.5 world you
know if you look at like the titan to
from a distance especially an average
consumer walking into a store I think
the assumption would be that that's an
Android device until you get close and
and realized that it's it's not running
Android just a quick update here on a
breaking news story about google apps
they seem too bad byeeeee first of all
they're back so that was like a little
blip but also somebody someone tweeted
at us saying Google App sets a crash at
the wrong time just as I meant to
receive my bootloader unlocked from HTC
dev the thing that I was safe to that
person is that he's being way too
optimistic I registered to get a
bootloader unlock and to get my well to
get an account started on HC dev and
took them about three months and I need
to get in touch with somebody for them
to sort that out so don't worry about it
you haven't got tht seat Evan buck stuff
happening in Eva I'm pretty sure um but
it shall we
android now do you want to speak yeah I
was just gonna say the the big crazy
news in addition to windows phone is
android we have got the nexus for the
nexus 10 the nexus 7 HR 32 gigabyte plus
mobile whatever and android 4.2 we went
to google's campus we got a deep dive on
google now we got a very close look at
the phones and the tablet and uh it all
got announced despite hurricane sandy
and I mean I don't even know where to
start there's it's you know the nexus 4
is based on the optimus G as we expected
it's that looks like a LG version of the
galaxy nexus it's got glass on the front
on the back it's got wireless charging
which I'm going to have a little freaked
out about later and it's got android 4.2
it's crazy fast it looks really really
good it's remarkable how much better it
feels than any of the optimus G variants
that I've held I've held the sprint one
the 1881 and the the international one
and it's it's markedly better it feels
way better than all of them the way that
they they did the rim with the soft
touch plastic that just barely goes over
the glass so it's less likely to scratch
when you set it on a table Matthias
convinced me that like they got into the
design i mean the next program is funny
because you know they work with other
manufacturers and as you go this is just
a rebranded geo this is just a rebranded
galaxy s2 or whatever it is but the
amount of design work that went into
especially the nexus 4 makes it feel
like a completely different phone and i
desperately love it I desperately want
to make it my next phone but I'm
desperately unhappy about the lack of
LTE which is something we really need to
talk about yeah maybe we put that up and
you guys want I'm wondering what you
guys in general impression of the nexus
4 was from what you've seen chris i
absolutely i mean it's very from a
since I should I should qualify this I
haven't touched the phone I haven't seen
it in person but from a distance judging
from the pictures and the impressions
that that the josh posted everything
that I know about the device it seems
like exactly the upgrade from last
year's Galaxy Nexus that Google needed
to put out there and I'm cautiously
optimistic at this point that LG a
company that I don't associate with
great hardware is going to pull off this
phone in a way that everybody's happy
with but yeah the dream killer I mean
there's zero question that if this phone
had LTE that it would be my next phone
there's absolutely no question and I
think that that that sentiment is echoed
by several people on our staff get it um
but the it's a dream killer I mean I can
especially in Chicago where att's HSPA
network is completely worthless and
continues to be it's just not feasible
for me to use an HSPA only device okay I
can't do it so okay I mean let's just
get into it though to go ahead lab sorry
but I mean I was gonna say a quick
Chrissy's point is fair enough you can't
the you know if you're stuck without alt
you're stuck but as the International
member of the show I have to UM give
voice to all the crazy people who have
freaked out a price because google is
selling this phone unlocked so it
doesn't have LTE which is a major issue
in the United States but most of the
rest of the world is not and selling
this unlocked and I understand is 279
pounds in the UK it's two night as crazy
rest of the I forget is it this this is
it a 16 gig version that's 299 I think
it starts at eight is it a tiara yeah
it's just ridiculously cheap for a phone
of this caliber to be trying that
straight up without a contract yet 299
for 8 and 3 19 / 16 if you're on
t-mobile in the US this is the phone to
buy because especially since t mobile
charges more
18 and Verizon do for equivalent devices
subsidized I I think t-mobile has
several phones that are 299 or more on
contract you can get this phone off
contract and then you can go under one
of their value plans that are actually
lower per month because you're not
taking a subsidy it's a no-brainer yeah
okay dammit that person with who is
expecting the AC dev email got it so I
was completely wrong I'm a troll I'm a
terrible troll and I apologize um well
but I mean to that point like you guys
have this 199 price point in the US and
it's kind of nice and straight forward
like you can't on contract pricing the
UK is like a fool's errand to try and
keep track of it's ridiculous like you
can get this phone if you pay 50 pounds
in advance and it will give you 60
pounds cash back and then you to sign up
for two years and after two years we get
to name your first child etc etc it's a
mess right but the thing with the 199 on
contract price is that ultimately if you
don't get some sort of random amnesty
from AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon or whatever or you
don't upgrade before the contract
expires in order to use and enjoy the
phone with your service you paying a lot
of thousands of dollars by the end of
the full contract whereas with this new
Nexus 4 you're getting a top SPECT
Android device I could vouch for the
specs and the experience at the optimus
G I was using the what basically a is
korean version the international version
of the optimus G just before this deluge
of windows phone 8 devices to cover my
life and I was really enjoying it like
as far as I was concerned the optimus G
is like the nicest Android that we've
got going on at about woods I mean maybe
the nicest camera necessarily but I was
really enjoying the user experience even
LG skin and I'm not but yeah the nexus
for being stuck in all of this I mean
the nexus 4 is yeah it's stacked on good
things and it's cheap compared compared
to prima Terra figure so the LTE thing
again mighty big deal in the u.s. it's
not going to get in his way so I'm going
to stand its way
and as far as Android taken over the
rest of the world I don't think I'm the
price point is just the crazy thing
that's the real stand-up thank me yeah
so in terms of it not having LTE like we
we talk to Google a lot about this and
it basically it comes down to a few
issues one I mean there's the battery
life issue which i think is a red
herring because we've seen plenty of
other companies handle this and so
Google wants the Nexus program to be
sort of like pure Google and like like
morally pure ethically I don't even know
what exists what the right word is for
but they want to push their software
updates out without carrier intervention
and without having to wait for that and
basically the they didn't feel like they
could do that if they released a version
with LTE because if you're going to
release a version with LTE on verizon
you've gotta release it's got to have
CDMA and if it's on cdma or LTE under
eyes and verizon gets to you know that
your software updates what's interesting
is that on AT&amp;amp;T we talked to AT&amp;amp;T about
this and they're like whatever would
bring it on lock bone to our LT network
totally cool we have zero problem with
that and you know so why didn't they
maybe we assume it's economics that you
know there's just not a big enough
addressable market on AT&amp;amp;T LTE to make
it worth it for them to create the
device i guess but basically we talked
about this in the Hangout that my
feeling is like apples pulled this off
because apple is able to do it google
apparently isn't they don't have the
clout in the mobile space with this
nexus line of phones to demand software
updates without carrier intervention and
so they had two choices they could stick
with the purity of the nexus program or
they could get their hands dirty with
the carriers either to force through the
update issue or to accept the delay and
they just decided not to get their hands
dirty yeah Rana Klee and Dida I think
that you you made this point earlier in
the week I know if we were talking or if
you
said in a post or something but
ironically if Android was a closed
system that they had kept themselves and
developed over the years I think that
they would have the same level of clout
and Apple in this situation they'd be
able to throw that way to run but
because Android is open carriers are
like who cares about this nexus will go
tell motorola or algae or whomever that
we want these ridiculous changes to the
software and we'll get it exactly our
way and we won't have to deal with you
and goodbye yeah and I mean you know it
got ATT he's got the optimus G Sam so
what did verizon get the they got the
something from LG that's like not the
optimus G but it's pretty good it's a
spectrum to or something the Connecticut
and I mystical I think it's the it's the
optimist nitro achieve max HD oh that
one I remember that one you know if
you'd only had 11 for your name I might
have forgotten about it because it has
so many over no problem yes Tommy when I
was thinking okay you know what I'm just
gonna use the optimus G on AT&amp;amp;T that's
I'll just accept that but then you can't
uninstall 18 tease junk and that's
insane that you were supposed to like
Google reneged on that promise that
you'd be able to uninstall stuff after I
screams out you can't unsolved up and
that's not okay windows phone there's a
whole bunch of AT&amp;amp;T junk on an AT&amp;amp;T
phone no problem just uninstalled gone
gone gone gone not not an issue at all
um yeah so like I don't know what I'm
gonna do am I gonna go with the Lumia
920 am I gonna go with DiNapoli's G am I
going to suck it up and not have LTE
it's hard for me not to get LTE because
i use it for tethering all the time when
you know it's one of my things I need
for work another thing I was gonna
mention guys is a boot building up the
argument for going without LTE if we're
going with tmobile mobo t mobile mobile
is apparently what Lisa's my
understanding team over had the best
reception during the hurricane in New
York
like it stayed up the best out of all
the networks am I correct in this I
think that's the thing that our
colleagues were saying yeah yeah might
be our goals are not chartered I have
bad signal so yeah Kimber lives I
believe Kimber lives in New Jersey
Kimber if you're listening and you don't
live in New Jersey I apologize but
whatever Kimber was she had tmobile go
down I mean it's not a neighborhood by
neighborhood basis would have actually I
will talk about this little bit more
later but that is part of the reason why
I t-mobile is sharing their network with
with uh with AT&amp;amp;T through this disaster
because I think that some networks are
having better luck in some neighborhoods
than others and vice versa so it kind of
works out okay fine that wasn't a great
argument for me I guess but still I mean
if you wanna help out the underdog like
if I'm in the US I would work really
hard to get on sprint or to get on
tmobile just to undermine the oligopoly
happening or even the duopoly happening
up top you know do my level thing so
that our children can have a choice of
work at right aging against the machine
is a fool's game uh in the US wireless
business I mean you're only hurting
yourself it's like you know I look I
mean t-mobile is is great and I love
what t-mobile's trying to do they have a
very very pro-consumer policy largely
because they have to because they're the
underdog but at the end of the day I
want LTE and Josh made this point in our
hangout on monday i think that is the
difference is not insignificant in many
parts of the of the country right like
we're not talking about five verses 7
megabits debt we're talking about like
um Oh 20 megabits down versus two or
three and two deters point like when
you're using the phone for work and
you're using it for tethering and that's
something that you need to be able to
rely on that makes a big difference not
to mention the latency difference yeah
so we're gonna have let me imagine bring
us back to Nexus 4 for a moment because
I
I am really hesitant about the gioca the
geo class stuff hey I've heard all the
arguments about yes his gossamer on his
last bag blue protective glass really
well blah blah i am not i'm not a fan of
that like I would need to again I'm kind
of like Chris and so far as i've only
seen the pictures in the videos of it I
haven't seen it in person yet but I
would be really surprised to see a phone
with glass on both the front and the
back and you know for it not to lose
some durability some endurance for it
not to be more fragile than one that is
made out of plastic or metal I mean how
do you guys feel about that tzu I know
the iphone four for us I never should I
never shattered the back or the front on
the four for us so apparently uh early
it's not a problem for me i doesn't it
doesn't give me pause yeah neither did I
and actually have to be honest i'm
actually back on an iphone 5 for the
moment um and i would actually prefer
like as good as the phone looks and as
good as the aluminum looks i would
prefer the glass of the 4 4 s because i
don't care about drop durability I care
about set it on a table and it doesn't
get a like micro scratches durability
and that's something that I can't like I
always have to make sure to set the
iphone 5 down on a like a soft surface
like if I'm setting it on a table I set
it on a book or a magazine or some I
don't set it on the table itself cuz I
know that we lifted up and find some
micro scratches that's something that
you don't worry about with class so i
would i would much prefer that a phone
be durable to that and not be able to
survive a six foot fall than vice versa
and i'm just imagining right now how you
facilitate all of these soft surfaces
and i'm thinking cuz you didn't tell us
when you complain but the 8x and how it
how to paint to take out of your
trousers you didn't tell us whether they
were silk but it made out of silk cuz it
was that the issue it's so true silk
trousers first of all I
I have to tell you that there's no such
thing as trousers in America or in other
freedom-loving countries we call them
pants hats yeah but other people call
pants underwear a rather they go on the
web pants what no underpants yeah yeah
that stuff there's it there's a
difference between pants and Underpants
also we could we could call in
pantaloons others like Pat the lowest
branch would open yeah we could yeah we
were believe the image the composite
image that I'm getting from this podcast
today is that Chris is this out of going
love silk wear and gentlemen who has
this little you know silk okay but he
lays out on a table every time used to
put down his iphone yes he's like we
give my people micros cripes I'm pulling
my iphone 5 out of my silk pantaloons
and setting it on a silk handkerchief on
my table that's right that is exactly
the image that I'm getting that's that's
it you think you figured out the true
are you the Scarlet Pimpernel yes yes
yes I irises versus he he is Chris oh my
god could we talk about android 4.2 I
think it's a really nice a pip update
for android day they just added a whole
bunch of like I don't know random
features but they did some good stuff so
I miracast I guess is interesting maybe
I gotta swipe typing gesture typing
they've got a quick settings so you can
swipe down from twice or there's a
button in the notification area to
toggle quick settings what am I
forgetting there's the photosphere thing
you know that's fine for Adorama stuff
oh the lockscreen improvements I think
that's really interesting so you can
swipe left or right to get two different
widgets or to go straight to the camera
even if you have a password on it
finally and then of course you know we
did this deep dive on on all the stuff
they've added to Google now that makes
it just you know be able to do more it
can read your inbox now and can give you
hotel and flight package information
from stuff that was emailed to you and
this is an Android 4.2 thing but we got
really deep into their voice search
stuff and how how well they are able to
recognize voice based on their neural
network which actually apply to the
iphone too because the voice search app
for iOS just got released and it's
amazing anyway uh you know I it doesn't
look like it's as crazy big as either
ice cream sandwich or jelly bean in
terms of all my gosh I must have all
these features but you know I want it
and I am looking forward to spending the
next 18 months complaining about waiting
for updates to 4.2 from every single
manufacturer on the planet mu Z so can I
be the first project that the galaxy
note 2 will get its 4.2 update roughly
three months after key lime pie comes
out on the next Nexus phone that's my
prediction and and the key lime pie
being the thing the thing that comes out
to 4.2 right as for going to sue
jellybean technically in Cooper's rollin
but but detail I mean I'm intrigued now
there's a couple of questions here so
Google now can now read your inbox you
said how first of all how does that
integrate into the whole set of
information at guna presents you and
secondly and I know that Chris like
myself still hasn't gotten into using
google now on a regular basis so and can
you give us the fresh sales piezo now
known update the the email features
actually they have been trialing these
email features on google search on the
desktop or you know you could sign up
for the trial and basically it does it
doesn't happen on your phone it happens
in Google's cloud and it just you know
it every time you get an email Google
now Google reads it and if it sees
something in a certain set of categories
a hotel reservations flight reservations
package tracking I think like event
tickets and concert tickets
takes that information and it puts it
into you know Google mouths database of
things that knows about you and then
when you land in a city or your flights
coming up or your you know use time for
you to leave to go to the concert or
whatever the next time you check google
now it you know a card for that piece of
information will just be there and then
you'll be able to use it to get to where
you're going so like you land in the new
city you pull out your phone you check
google mouth and the first card oh look
at that there's there's my hotel I don't
have to looking into my email for it's
just sitting there and that really fits
in with you know you guys say you
haven't like made Google now part of
your life and like that's okay like I
don't think anybody should try and
completely depend on google pal yet but
it's sort of one of these things where
you know every now and then it like
pushes a piece of information in front
of you that's like oh man I needed that
that's great thank you and so it just
feels very serendipitous but it's not
like a utility it's just sort of a nice
like oh hey now I you know I know I need
to leave to get home in time or oh you
know this is the weather or oh my you
know baseball team lost or you know
whatever it's but what's interesting
about Google now is that Google has got
all the pieces to enable this futuristic
vision of computing and they're like
moving in that direction slowly like
series of personal assistant but Google
now actually knows the stuff about you
that you want a personal assistant to
know like it's able to check your email
like first launceston by right of course
you could opt out of all these me though
the issue for me is that as soon as
google introduced now and made it just
kind of too ubiquitous for for a thing
exactly as you're describing i think i
totally agree that you can't necessarily
rely on it can't be your personal
organizer it can be a helpful assistant
and a sidekick I guess but then Jung
google now just way too easy to access
and accidentally we've talked about it
I'm previous shows and Google is kind of
pushing on to people where's again I
and it's too much agreement for podcast
be honest we need to do something we
would have an idea this morning uh yeah
and we've completely failed or like
we're gonna fight fun and then we just
agreed with each other it was great
funct it uh well it's it's too much
respect man it's we need to I don't know
um stop disrespecting each other start
rolling each other each other a bit more
but anyway em like I say I agree with
you in so far as Google is building
towards his vision I guess you remember
I missing out one of the Google fellows
he did a talk in london and he was
saying google's uh kind of you know its
ultimate goal the pinnacle of where it's
going is to do search without search
this is what google now is building
towards it's not there yet it's not
great but that's what Google wants to be
that's what Google wants to evolve into
and I find that an admirable goal and I
think that would be an exponential
useful things to people even if it makes
us dumber and it kind of builds into
that Wally scenario where we're just
kind of being rolled around on
autonomous cars that know everything we
need to do and we just kind of a bovine
about the whole situation but ok so you
now forgot what it was oh yes you did
you say ovine bovine yes so you're
saying that people become cows because
of google no it's a Oh gonna give up I
best bugs are you wanted her old man
yeah ok it's Nietzsche Nietzsche was a
guy who's saying that well he used to
bovine to describe just people who don't
have you know the interest or the mental
Adam who just really calm and impassive
about the world around them uh you know
just bovine you're like a cow bull is is
milking people
I'm sorry continue I point man let me
make my point and it will get back to
the troll let's see that but but yeah
the point I was gonna make is Bruce
Miller brought us up and it's a great
point there's no setting where you can
just punch in a few quick settings for
yourself and get going right so if he if
Ross wants scores for his favorite
sports team he can't just jump in and
say this my favorite sports team start
feeding me the scores I want to know
about their performance in the playoffs
assuming that make the playoffs he needs
to go and check for those schools like
three or four times and then Google now
will wise up and say yeah this guy cares
about this team made the connection so
yes it's making these connections and I
know if you go to particular locations a
bunch of times it will ask you does this
location maths to you this is where your
dealer is is this where you do whatever
you need to do etc and then you format
and it builds all of this information
but the point is you get no control over
you don't get to customize it you know
to kill two kingdoms yeah the you can
customize the sports teams but you're
over your larger point is is actually
completely correct that there's this
tension where if they add a whole bunch
of customization options then it becomes
a huge mess of settings right and
they're trying to do this thing where it
organically learns about you and then
organically gives you the abbey of
information you need and you know it's a
design decision and it's you know it's a
compromise one way or the other and they
decided to make the decision to have
fewer settings for stuff and it
frustrates me so even in 4.2 you can't
tell it that I don't need you to give me
an alert for calendar a B and C I only
needed for calendar de NF i'm subscribed
to a half a dozen calendars and i don't
care that Vlad has a meeting I care that
i have a meeting but Google now shows
you your next appointment and it thinks
my next appointment is Vlad's meeting
and that's really frustrating but that
said it's like I said it's it's one of
these things where like you just sort of
check it to see what's going on
and you can't you never get the sense
that like if you by looking at it you
feel like you comprehensively have
everything that you need but you do
often check it and you get something
that you forgot that you need if that
makes sense it doesn't give you
everything you need but it often gives
you something you forgot you need yeah
it does it does and I haven't put hump
which was I forgot about the check the
time change because the UK is back on
gmt now whereas the United States isn't
keeping in step so the difference
between myself and you guys is an hour
less right and that's why I go closer
cussing that's what we're discussing
Archimedes Jude for the podcast because
I had one I had literally a Eureka
moment where i was i was in the bathtub
sharing an intimate moment with the ax
and then i realized that actually the
podcast isn't starting in an hour and 10
minutes is starting in 10 minutes and
then rushed over here I'm actually quite
fortunate to have got show oh yeah yeah
there's a dozen google now sorry what
and cook some Google now yeah well I
mean you know so I haven't played a 4.2
yet so I can't contribute to
intelligently to this conversation other
than to say that like I I you know hey
well these are the original updates
should be rolling out to 4.1 are they
gonna be rolling out to decipher 5 i'm
using right now because if not then the
night I so well with that um but yeah
you know I I have so far found google
now to be creepier than it is useful and
not not creepy to the point where I want
to turn it off but just I'm am I was
looking at it and saying you know it's
really weird that it thinks that I need
to go home now uh and and you know
that's something it that might be a
generational shift where it's like you
know 20 30 years from now people are
gonna be like well of course my phone is
going to just tell me what to do all day
but right now it's just a little too
strange for me just
like the self trivia does that's what
about being bovine like you told me but
that's my point about being bovine
because maybe sheep like maybe that's
more appropriate way you're just happy
to be instructed and led along right
arch our children will be Milt by google
in ways that we are not yes like
domesticated mammals yes we're on the
same page now baby but we're on it okay
well I think audio listeners of the show
aren't getting the benefit of seeing the
expression on my face right now but
trust that that moment of silence was my
complete abdication of responsibility
for the previous two minutes of
conversation what does in say is that we
can probably leave the nexus 10
discussion for the verge cast and
anybody else who cares about tablets uh
anything to say I will say it is it is
really not it is it is the best android
tablet a 10 inch android tablet barna
but I've ever held but you know it's
still kind of change or tablet so right
um they've got some work to do and I'm
just gonna v2 it optimal podcast dammit
because we talked about the Galaxy Note
already which is tablet uh you know
getting 10-inch tablets on hit doesn't
matter okay the charges are still must
be like I don't know maybe we gotta talk
about the charging orb I'm all hopped up
so Matthias showed us the charging orb
it is a third of a sphere cheered off at
an angle and then you set the phone on
it and it connects with magnets and the
magnets align the phone and that
inductively charges it looks like a
touchstone it looks like a you know a
curvy sphere of a touchstone it operates
exactly like a touchstone it aligns with
magnets and and in android 4.2 there is
a new feature called the dreamscape
dreamland dreamy time I forget what the
what the exact thing
is that they called it during the dream
time anyway it um it's the same thing as
this thing that was called Exhibition
Mode and webos where as soon as you set
it on the dock it would present you with
like you know some kind of screen saver
like a wallpaper or a time it's
dangerous that's what it's called or uh
you know whatever and you know
eventually you know they opened it up
sold third parties get out of widgets to
it and so on and i'm sure that google do
the same thing so like it's it's
completely hilarious how much of this
the whole ethos of their wireless
charging solution just came straight out
of palm and I don't know it's any
mistake that you know matias came from
palm and then that's what happened but
now he's good tea it's like there are a
lot of X palm people at Google right now
a lot and you know I gotta say that I
prefer the way that they're handling the
charging solution with magnets to what
everybody else is doing with the with
chi or charging it's a cheap a solution
because the magnets really do make a
difference in terms of knowing that it's
connected and it's charging and and but
it's aligned properly and in the right
spot it really does matter for lining it
up the thing I was gonna say about this
wireless charges is that I would just
love it if we could standardize I mean I
love it when we standardize on anything
but even micro USB micro sims which did
not see them but whatever um no but it
was just just nice nice how that who is
a again powermat who's a competing
standard tucci just formed yet another
consorte thing I think the Alliance for
wireless power ok the Mooka just ignore
them dance but but starbucks and google
are backing it the power management
that's what it's yeah so why is Google
backing this competing standard that's
putting charges into starbucks just to
see what happens while they're using a
different standard on their flagship
phone also why does children starbucks
doesn't make as much sense is the thing
that i was gonna
proposes my reason for caring which is
having one of those freaking things on
my desk because it if you just sit down
and think about how often you just sit
down and you pop your phone on your desk
if there's a wireless charger under it
there then you just stop worrying about
the phone's battery you just do like you
come to even if you in the office for 30
minutes you just pop down your phone
underwater charge do you work leave and
you're pretty much fully recharged again
these things are freaking convenient but
again if they're done right like you
were just saying so if Google is doing
it and it's using Chi and Qi is the
thing that verizon's been pushing
verizon is extra you know covers that
you can buy with qi charging for most of
these phones nowadays just keep going
with it I don't care if it's not perfect
I just I mean it works right it's
functional I ask you just no reason why
you know any other standard should be
pursued we need to just you know push
kee on everybody and then it would be
just such a beautiful world I agree and
and you know the other thing is think
about all the people that have multiple
phones and all the families that could
just you know you can stick like a few
of these charges around the house and
everybody can just drop their phones off
on to them by that I mean these are
healthy things I won't work yeah yeah i
love i love that like you know this
dream world that you are you know
describing is a dream world that i lived
in for you know four years when i was
using my boys phones almost exclusively
i had you know touchstone in my car i
had it on my desk i had up a bed i had
it by desk at the office and just you
know just wherever I went just set it
down so that you know all the pre phones
had ridiculously bad battery life but it
didn't bother me that much because I was
always topping it off that's how
everything should be Chris's animal what
Chris is doing what is getting up I I'm
know I'm taking in this
this fascinating conversation about
wireless charging I have demoted myself
from participant to listener for this
portion of the conversation I I will I
so I will say this I agree completely
Vlad that like you know there are many
things we're competing standards as
frustrating as they can be are actually
to the benefit of everyone at the end of
the day but i don't think that wireless
charging is one of those things because
you're going to end up with like a world
where no you you know you go into this
coffee shop and it's this standard you
going to another coffee shop and it's
this standard your phone might work and
might not is like who's who's losing out
by there being just one dominant
standard I dancers nobody right that's
it I'm sure it's a licensing thing is
it's got to be that like somebody you
know whether it's well first of all
powermat probably has an ego coming into
this because you know they say they're
ever yeah they're like well screw Chi
we're going to do this ourselves and
they're they're they're just entrenched
enough like they have just enough
momentum to gum up the works which is
exactly what they're doing now well what
I was just thinking is hopefully Jeff is
still with us hopefully those HD
employees are still watching us on their
massive cinema screen in the Taipei
offices so they can register this down
for us wireless charging guys I mean
you're doing it already Dax tom warren
Bryce he managed to get the screen that
hey Dex and verizon's gonna have
wireless charging the which actually I'm
pissed off about because the one in
Europe doesn't I suspect I mean we don't
know for sure but it won't surprise me
if that was for eyes and saying you know
if you want to sell this phone on our
network and needs to support wireless
charging because they've been I mean
bright glad you mentioned it earlier
verizon has been very strict about that
ever since their first LTE phones came
out they've been like you know if you
want to sell this LT phone our network
you need to either have cheap built in
or you need to offer a chi accessory
which that I think with very very few
exceptions they continue to do
we obviously the iphone 5 does not have
a chi back but but apart from that I
think pretty much every LT phone they
sell can be SPECT with a chi back yeah
and from what some walk from the
admission Tongo the change is going to
be built right into the 8x so we'll make
it an e bulky will make it a different
it won't be an accessory just right in
there right yeah I'm coming over guys
I'm gonna enjoy the EDX without T and
Verizon boo Chicago this is the attack
this is the technology nexus of the
United States a lot of people don't
realize that yet but but there's a lot
of momentum here and and the real icing
on the cake will be the news that vlad
savov is moving here and not quite yet
but soon you know one thing so as soon
as somebody doesn't perfect phone and
only release it in the US then i'll be
oh okay deal but then it was a quick
like you to it cuz you like what we
rolled out i want to i want to point out
the we've got a really excellent feature
about the ad 0 phone the phone that's
made out of bamboo and if you haven't
you should go take a look at it it's
it's a just an incredible story Aaron
did a really really good job putting it
together and then we you know we want to
end on a happy note so let's let's talk
about the UK getting LTE you're on yeah
there's nothing like that yeah let's
talk about that and the first thing to
say is I don't have it it's not because
I don't have a review phone II very
kindly provided me with a phone and a 4g
sim but at home I can only get three and
a half g I mean admittedly i'd be in
this remember all these windows phone so
i haven't had time to you know do a
little tour of london with it but at
least at home all i can get it's very
hot g and it's actually slower
then I get on the free network so that I
think that is going to be the killer CEO
for this whole II 4G roller here in the
UK most of the spectrum is on high
frequency and the Achilles here was
going to be that it's just not going to
be good at penetrating through walls and
that might well be the cakes I mean it
might be the case that I step outside
and oh hello i have 4g but i don't know
i i'm always like okay if you have
really fast connectivity but i can only
use it when i'm on the street that just
really limits the benefit of it because
when I want to have a really fast
connection I'm usually working and I
don't want to be out in the rain or the
snow or the win the World freaking
hurricane to have some sort of
connectivity so I think maybe next week
i can give you guys some legit Lafitte
back on the network the thing that we
know is it super fast I mean it reaches
speeds up to 30 30 max down probably
because nobody's using it and it's in 10
UK cities now so I mean look give credit
to the company for doing the roll out
the way promised it would do it it's
working really hard it's getting things
up and running really quickly so at
least in terms of execution is doing
well but I'm still dubious about
proposition also we got pricing I think
few days back maybe we go and nobody's
been particularly impressed with it it's
been quite steep so I don't know um and
obviously LTE isn't the same sort of
killer must have feature that is for you
guys in the US and I'm personally
content to wait for Vodafone and 0 2 and
3 particular because 3 is usually the
network that gives you the most and puts
the fewest limitations on it you know
Vodafone will try and censor out of
websites 02 will try and sell your data
ok I'm being kind of
libelous right now but yeah I would had
a bit of a privacy issue few months back
whereas free can adjust as when we say
unlimited data would mean unlimited data
and you can go crazy so it's my favorite
camera is the one that I use so I want
to see those guys get a hold of the 800
megahertz band and give you the real
high quality 4g then I'll be like okay
you can / price as though is because
then I need it but for a moment meds
kind of you'll complain about the lack
of LTE on the nexus 4 just like us yeah
yeah although by that time we're gonna
be talking about some cortex a15 madness
put nexus sure and we're gonna be
talking about lte-advanced cuz someone's
gonna launch lte-advanced and then
everyone else will be upset that they
only have regular LTE yeah if that
happens in the US just as soon as we get
LTE in the UK i'm going to scream it's
goodbye man i think AT&amp;amp;T and verizon are
saying 2014 for their LTE advanced
launch i think so okay i should be able
to get ahold of some LT before then i'm
pretty confident i think my fingers are
got it for you thank you sir I mean yes
it's good news it is good news and and
the other thing is all of these early
adopters who pick up this LT stuff
they're bringing up their networks for
the rest of us did bring up the 3g
networks so it's actually trickle down
economics theoretically you're right and
and I was hoping that that effect would
kick in in Chicago to alleviate the
stress on the HSPA network when the
iphone 5 came out i haven't seen it yet
like I still in the middle of a business
day if I go out with the galaxy exes
into the heart of the city I can't do
anything I can't browse to to a website
i can't check my email so i hope you're
right i hope that eventually that
transition happens but it hasn't
happened yet and you call in this city
the technological nexus of the u.s.
sounds like a technological black hole
man that's
those are fighting words you and I onew
causation we were trying to ruffle the
freaking podcast yeah well I'm time I'm
calling X time we call time we see each
other okay now the next time was each
other yes please finish it I was just
gonna say next time we see each other
wet which is probably gonna be de esas
you and I are definitely gonna have a
Donnybrook the I want full show thank
you everybody for watching listening if
you want to follow us on Twitter you
should we're all at verge I'm at
backline Vlad's I bad lads have off
chris is on facebook I guess so just go
find him there because whatever we'll be
