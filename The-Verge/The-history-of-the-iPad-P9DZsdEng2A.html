looks like when the first iPad was
announced in 2010 Steve Jobs demoed it
kind of as the ultimate way to browse
the web it could do more of course but
it was big and slow it couldn't even
multitask
a year later Apple had already totally
redesigned the thing it was suddenly
stylish lighter and more capable then
serious updates started to come in 2012
when the iPad finally got a high-res
Retina display and to processor bumps
within an eight month time span Apple
also introduced the iPad Mini that year
almost three years after the original
iPad this is the lines first spin-off
and the idea was that it could help
Apple compete against the onslaught of
cheap Android tablets that were rolling
out like Google's Nexus 7 in 2013 the
iPad received what is arguably its
biggest update to date the air was a
complete redesign in the mini style
making Apple's flagship tablet far more
portable than it had ever been after all
of that both iPads only saw small
updates in 2014 the air got a better
display and a fingerprint sensor and the
mini just got a fingerprint sensor they
were tepid changes and they may well
have been a reaction to have the iPads
business have been changing that the
iPad started out as a fast growing new
product its sales had started to decline
at the same time Microsoft service line
was turning 3 and starting to come into
its own it's been growing fast and
that's a pretty clear sign that big
powerful tablets are in demand which is
how we get to this week suddenly the
iPad is huge capable of multitasking and
supports a keyboard and stylus it's a
natural evolution of the iPads annual
increase in power but like the iPad Mini
it's also an obvious response to market
demand so sure the iPad pro is just a
bigger iPad but it's not even close to
what Apple could have made 5 years ago</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
