are taking a look at the motorola moto g
the Moto G is Motorola's latest device
in its lineup and it looks very similar
to the Moto X that preceded it very
similar shape size weight and feel as
the Moto X it's a little bit thicker and
it's ever so slightly heavier but you
really wouldn't notice that unless you
compare the two side-by-side the Moto G
has a 4.5 inch 720p LCD display as
opposed to the AMOLED that's on the Moto
X it's got a 1.3 megapixel front facing
camera and on the back is a 5 megapixel
camera with LED flash the other unique
hardware thing here with the Moto G is
that you are able to remove the back
plate which you can then swap with
different colors unfortunately the
battery is not removable nor does it
have a micro SD card slot so it is
purely a cosmetic thing to take the back
off the battery inside is 2040 milliamp
hour battery so it's a little bit
smaller than the Moto X but not hugely
so another big difference between the
Moto G and the Moto X is the Moto G does
not have LTE which kind of makes sense
because Motorola is targeting this at a
global market where LTE is less of a
priority inside the Moto G has a
quad-core Snapdragon 400 processor it's
clocked at 1.2 gigahertz and it's got
one gigabyte of RAM and this particular
unit has 8 gigabytes of internal storage
but Motorola says that it will be
available in 16 gigabyte versions as
well the software that's running on here
is a very simple build of android 4.3
jelly bean but motorola says that 4.4
kitkat will be coming to the Moto G in
the very near future the big difference
here between the Moto X and the Moto G
is that the G does not have any of
motorola's unique software features it
doesn't have active notifications it
doesn't have touchless control and it
doesn't have quick capture to launch the
camera the biggest story with the Moto G
is its price which is $179 unlocked and
without a contract it's one of the most
impressive prices we've ever seen for
phone this capable Motorola will be
selling this in Brazil and other parts
of the world this quarter and it's
expected to come to the US next year
where will be sold on prepaid brands
