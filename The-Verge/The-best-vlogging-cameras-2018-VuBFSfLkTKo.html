Verge's Gadget Show on YouTube that's
the platform you're watching this is the
show you're watching you found it Nilay
that's Paul Miller well and we've Sarah
D cheese here we actually have a huge
show today Sarah's gonna talk to us
about vlogging here you just buy all
these cameras instantly you're
successful longer yeah that's amazing
our senior feature that our Michaels
lenko so much about minimalist cell
phones which is a wild trend that's
going on Ashley's gonna join us we talk
about more smart gardening tech spring
regardless of the snow in New York we're
short sleeves yeah optimism it's gonna
happen you're gonna grow some basil
defaults and then Jake is gonna use a
circuit breaker you got a ton of
questions about the new iPads we're
gonna answer all of those but let's
start Sara you're here welcome to
circuit breaker Q thank you it's great
to have you it's great to be a youtuber
I am real yeah I know I don't just live
in YouTube he's like I know we're
talking gear we're talking so much
cameras so this is a true thing every
like teenager I know once they grow up
to be a vlogger it's a fact
hmm I would like to go see a lawyer this
writings for the birds and I feel like
it's pretty easy to start you just start
with a phone a lot of people are doing
that super easy it's like one of my
favorite things about technology it's
when I say things about your channel
right like technology helps you make
things that's great but everybody wants
to what's upgrade what gear to get so
what's the first upgrade if you are
aspiring vlogger you've made some videos
there phone you're feeling it what's the
first step so I would say go for the
point and shoot this is gonna be in the
price range of seven hundred to a
thousand the one that I use all the time
I started with the mark three I know how
the mark 5 is the Sony rx100 so this is
a point-and-shoot you can fit it in your
pocket but it packs a lot of punch so
the price tag is $1,000 but you can
shoot slow-motion so you can actually go
up to 960 frames per second and high
frame rate issue in
so you can get that slow-mo New York
City people walking vibes you know but I
would say it doesn't look the best so
you need to stay in about 240 or 480 to
get footage that is usable of course you
need a lot of light but you can shoot at
60 frames per second 120 frames per
second and full 1080 and that high frame
rate mode it does scale it up but this
can also shoot 4k so of course you're
getting 4k in phones now but you have to
think about the sensor size so this is a
one inch sensor which you're not going
to get in any phones out there yeah so
when you when you think Sony think low
light and so a similar point-and-shoot
that has the same swivel screen it's
great for vlogging would be a canon g7x
but that price is probably like three
hundred dollars cheaper than it rx100
just because it's not as good in low
light it doesn't have that grade of slow
motion so the Sony rx100 is kind of you
get everything in this tiny convoy but
there's one thing so when it comes to
vlogging you want good audio yes you
can't plug in a microphone into this so
there's no audio and there's nothing No
so but it is cool because you have a
flash and then you also have a
viewfinder so you have an electronic
viewfinder but yeah so you do sacrifice
a few things but if you want that audio
jack you can go up to the next line of
cameras that a 6,000 a 6500 so those are
kind of in that beginner next step I
think so he knew that vlogging this came
out a while ago like 2012 2013 yeah and
they've been doing it for a while yeah
they've released a new camera almost
every single year from Mark one yeah
but they do you think they knew that
vlogging would be a trend where they
designed this thing like you were
telling earlier if you're waiting for
the mark 5 you got to think they're
gonna put an audio jack or something
right and so yeah so I mean this is the
mark 5 who knows when the mark 6 is
going to come out but um the audio jack
thing I do not think that they're gonna
put the audio jack in the arc
100 like ever exactly because if they
put an audio jack in the rx100 there
would be no reason really to buy that
like a 6500 or to go that one step up so
what you're getting with that next step
up is an audio jack is interchangeable
lenses but it's just it's those small
things that will get you to upgrade to
that next like $500 extra and that is
like the story of the camera industry
like 5000 models and the confusing
numbers you know but that's why we're
here yeah all right so that's the first
step and yeah yeah you maybe want to
think about an external microphone and
do that - what do you there's like a
software piece this - right you get off
your phone you no longer have here oh
and I've seen you know your iMovie what
software do you like start using so
usually it's in between - um Final Cut
10 or Final Cut X or Premiere Pro so
those are the big steps up however if
you have a Mac everyone has iMovie I
start an iMovie there's nothing like
shameful about iMovie iMovie is
confusing as hell
thanks for ok ok so forget I'm every
time I use it I think to myself this is
not teaching me how any other system is
a question yes it's not going to
translate well if you want to go big so
you might as well go big or go home
Final Cut X you buy it one time so it's
like one two hundred dollar fee or three
hundred premiere you pay monthly but you
get that whole suite of products you get
premier Photoshop Lightroom any any
other products that ago he makes you get
that for $50 a month and so premier has
a lot of things and it has an ecosystem
attached to Photoshop and things that I
use that is really helpful and Final Cut
10 you have to think about the magnetic
timeline some some of the things that
are kind of just quirky about it yeah
that is it's going to be very weird if
you know something before it yeah so if
you're new you want to pay a one-time
dollars faster than that and it's faster
so if you're on Apple you're gonna
export something that would take 15
minutes
premiere on a Mac in like three minutes
whereas with premiere you could buy a PC
and it will be like point-and-shoot yeah
maybe some editing software talk to us
about the next hour yeah this is
actually your rig this is my rig so it's
it's bigger right and so you have the
Joby Gorillapod which is kind of that
tripod that all of these vloggers have
when I'm in my office and kind of doing
more tech related stuff it gets to a
point where it's like let's just use a
tripod you know I mean they're great
this is my main setup it's a rode
videomicro
this is the new version that if you if
you see here when I turn on my camera
the mic automatically turns on which is
very nice because previously I would
record a segment forget to turn on my
mic and then lose all the audio which is
not good so yeah this is my main setup
you know I shooting 24 frames per second
and then we were talking about earlier
this is a vergence cluesive but
something that I like about the Sony is
you have a lot of picture profiles so I
shoot in VPP 3 profile which is
basically just a flatter profile but you
get more contrast in saturation than in
like pp7
and what picture profiles are for people
who are unaware is it's a flatter image
that lends to a better a better
editing experience when you're trying to
add color trying to color greater image
to maybe a certain look that you want
this isn't like shooting wrong no no so
it's not a heavier process in your
computer after but it's basically saying
you have a flatter image that you can
then go and add saturation contrast at
Alette to your will and make it look how
you want to look you color corrector
everything that you put on YouTube I do
I do sometimes it's more heavy sometimes
it's lighter but because I shoot with a
little bit of a flatter profile you have
learned or see that pp3
you heard it here first guys I have to
say one the chat loves that you're here
oh other question says feed you fam in a
house and then there's just a full-on
Mac versus PC
one person says iMovie is a trash fire
that's to drink so what do you use this
just like show us like okay you're going
to film something today yeah what do you
what do you moves so basically the lens
that is the lens it's pretty important
so this is a 16 to 35 it's a pretty wide
lens so that means when I turn it around
myself you know usually I have this Joby
and like what's up guys I'm a vlogger
this is happening this is happening
right now maybe this might be in a vlog
of some sort this is going to capture
most of my surroundings without it being
flip out screen so yeah I don't so you
have to trust it you know and this is
the thing with the sony is you can trust
the autofocus system i would say if
you're looking for a camera with amazing
autofocus and that is number one
priority and go with the canon for sure
but sony it has good enough autofocus so
when it comes to a camera that maybe has
more features and is more worth it in
terms of specs i would go with the GH
500-strong rack yes but i yeah so these
are the two I would put next to each
other so you have the sony a7s 2 and
then you have the G H 5 H 5 has a swivel
screen which is clutch so when you're
vlogging you turn it around you know we
can see each other see
then when you do it you're gonna be
constantly looking in that double screen
you gotta pay attention to the audience
you know but this so it can shoot up to
180 frames per second so it does super
slow-mo you have a swivel screen you
have the different picture profiles and
it doesn't have a record limit yeah
so when you hit 30 minutes on this it's
gonna it's gonna shut off you have to
hit it in well it's technically a photo
camera so it's like an import tax so
they can call this a photography camera
and not get an extra video camera tax
put on it crazy so this the gh 5 is
technically a video camera so they can
go past that 30 minute record limit and
so there's things like that but then the
autofocus in this so there's a lot of
things out there on the internet that
are like autofocus fix if you film in
like you know 30 frames per second you
do this thing and will be fixed which is
tricks that you for how you use the
camera or what you learn tricks for like
settings in the camera however that's
dependent on the are we ntsc here inside
us so it's dependent on like the PAL
system and stuff so it really doesn't
like help for shooting at 24 frames per
second so there's a lot of trade-offs
but this is also a Micro Four Thirds
sensor yeah so and this is full-frame
and this is full-frame so maybe I'm just
picky but when I compared the footage of
both of them instantly you're like oh
that full-frame look I missed that full
frame like so we have a couple minutes
left but we have some new Sony cameras
yes so to walk us through the line cuz
you're saying you're waiting for the a7
s33 873 yes but we have the new versions
yeah Suri's this is deeply confusing -
oh it is so confusing so let's put these
next to each other so this is the a7 r3
so when it comes to the art think
photography so this has almost double
the amount of pixels as this so when
you're shooting uncompressed raw on an
a7
our three you're gonna get like an 80
megabyte hundred megabyte file to work
with so photography a7s2 video but we're
waiting for an a7 s3 it might be around
the corner who knows
so a7s2 video a7 are three photography
and then you have this like awkward yeah
I mean this lens is beautiful I mean
this is this is the 85 1.4 yeah it's a
juicer it's probably 2500 I should have
looked before but this isn't mine I wish
it was mine yeah so these are two are
brand new and but you you're saying for
vlogging you're waiting you either buy
this one now if you want to get into it
or wait for wait maybe the rx100 and
this last one is the a7 3 which is a
good middle ground so it's not going to
be as expensive as the new a7 or um but
the a7 a 6500
those are good milligrams and then
lastly so you've made the big upgrade
you're living in this world
yes and you this is Sarah actually
showed up with her stuff with all these
cases and all this day because of
managing these cameras is apparently
very hard yes and these are very basic
things maybe it's like old school rule
or things that people did but with an a7
s you're gonna go through batteries like
that so I have 10 to 15 batteries so
it's you want to be able to manage and
know what batteries are alive and what
are dead so basically if I you know
number my batteries this is just washi
tape and basically if it's on top that
means it's good to go and when the
battery is dead I just stick the washi
tape on the bottom and so when it's at
the bottom of my bag I know that this is
dead do not grab the bag he already
showed this to be in rehearsal sign
these
because these things burn through
batteries oh yes like crazy so just hate
you know and then these are basically
two SD Pelican cases that I use just for
SD cards um
you only accidentally delete footage
once you know that's only a problem that
you happen it happens once and then you
try to fix it so basically I keep all of
my full SD cards in one case and all of
my empty SD cards in another I know like
don't touch Sarah I still need to load
this onto the computer they can just
actually most common comment we've
gotten people are arguing a lot of
people saying phones are fine yeah I the
note eight I got to play with recently
has a lot of great like slow-mo and
stuff and then I'm I'm a user of the
iPhone 10 mmm-hmm which is good yeah
what's up what's a good upgrade if you
just have a fun you stick with your
phone.i goodness in terms of accessories
yeah I would say check out a moment
lenses really because they really help
take your phone and bring it to that
next level because you basically put a
case on your that we had tons of moment
yeah fantastic you have telephoto
fisheye why I would have I would have
100% guests you were gonna say I'm
microphone yeah tell the people where to
find you whatever watch your channel yes
you can just Google Sarah peachy but
also if you're on the internet maybe my
name's somewhere you can just find me at
youtube.com slash Sarah deechi it's a
hard last name but that's their Aditi
runs the PG what's your last name at all
oh my first times Neil I I don't know
let's go to another difficult last name
Jake a stern a can answer all your
questions about that new iPad take away
Jake we had a ton of questions about the
new iPad last week it just came out we
just posted our review of it today but I
still wanted to go over some of the most
common questions that we got and the
really really big one was about the
school
we've got a ton of questions asking
about how it compares to other iPad
screens and the reason this is coming up
is because the screen on the iPad pro is
just so good and the answer is this
display is not as good that's because
the iPad is $300 cheaper than the iPad
pro so what you're missing is the
anti-reflective coating you're missing
the high refresh rate you're missing the
wider color gamut and one thing that
people keep asking about is the air gap
there's going to be a little tiny bit of
a gap between the glass display and the
actual LCD itself and if you're just
looking at the screen for the first time
if you're not looking at them
side-by-side it's still going to be a
really nice screen if you've seen any
other iPad you will know how makes very
good screens for these tablets they're
one of the best you can get but if you
do put it side-by-side it is clear that
the iPad pro still has a way better
screen and that is really the reason to
get it so if you're a designer somebody
who that really matters for that's still
going to be the way to go the second
question we had was is this iPad can be
good for gaming and I think it's gonna
be you know about as good as any other
iPad I'm not necessarily huge on
touchscreen controls but I think it's
fun for like stuff like hearthstone we
were just talking about hub G in
battlegrounds the other day you can
definitely do this to the specs are
basically the same as the iPhone 7 so if
you've used that or any newer iPhone you
know what you're gonna get should be
good and then a last question again just
a whole sort of assortment of questions
which is how does this compare to other
iPads we already went over the screen
that's really the big differentiator it
now supports the pencil so both of them
are equal on that level really the big
other difference is that the iPad pro
has the keyboard connector and so I
would say that unless you're really
planning to use this for graphic design
or to replace your laptop that the
cheaper iPad is probably gonna have
everything that you need and the thing I
would really want to point out is that
you can basically buy two iPads for the
price of an iPad pro so if you think
you'd rather have two you probably don't
need the pro and the iPad probably has
everything that you need since it is
already one of the best tablets out
there so that's all for me we now have a
video from Phil who is going to try to
figure out
to use a Harmony remote hi I consider
myself to be a pretty technological
person I've wanted a harmony remote for
a long time so I think this should be
pretty simple I don't really know what
this thing does
I assume this plugs into the TV somehow
I don't think it's a touchscreen because
nothing works and it just says my
harmony calm so I'm gonna go to my
harmony com2 all right welcome to
harmony
it says nothing about how to set this up
I'm kind of stuck Oh fun insertion I'm
just kidding I found a poster that I
ripped so I think it my computer which I
don't really want to do this seems like
a lot of setup to just get over remote
working one micro USB cable I don't know
with my videos before it is on here
plugged in and nothing's happening I
refer back to my poster I just set up an
account for the remote setup to my
harmony and there's stuff right today
right like ten minutes deep and I
haven't even gotten this remote off of
be whatever splash screen that is fun
this app looks like it's from 1999
you see that it looks horrible I just
got an email difference of many your
remotes ready in four simple steps I've
already done like seven steps okay it's
now giving me the option I could drag
and drop like thirty different common
inputs I can't even find HDMI which
doesn't make sense to me alright it's
not set up properly I don't know what I
did wrong it's probably video eight
instead of video nine but I'm still on
this flash screen and I now feel that
I've wasted $250 don't buy this the back
oh it's on I set up that remote one of
my favorite things well I feels like
everything I've ever tried to do with
all technology I know if I go on the
show a week all right Michael's my goes
here hello Michael Michael is our senior
features editor that's right you
recently underwent what sounds like a
very painful experiment you tried to
live with one of these minimal cell
phones for two weeks actually all of
them all of them so over the course of
two weeks I played with four phones in
an effort to kind of disconnect a little
bit try out some minimal devices these
are real high played
these are hype there's a bit of a
movement going on with people kind of
disconnecting a little bit with their
phones so we got four of pretty minimal
devices here and people just kind of
like little fewer features can't really
text that well no cameras that kind of
stuff we exploit this life to see if it
was for you or do you see what the draw
was for other people I think a little
bit of both so I have an iPhone 6 which
isn't the nearest phone but it's new
enough but I find it extremely
distracting I find myself like scrolling
through my feeds for hours on end so I
was curious to see what it'd be like to
play with one of these and maybe spend a
little bit less time on my phone and he
loved it is what I heard alright so this
is the unit Hertz jelly let's get this
going so this is just the Android phone
I mean it's extremely tiny that's the
first thing you'll notice about it it
runs Android seven has
a front-facing in the back facing camera
the specs and these cameras are not
important the specs these cameras are
not important and not that interesting
but what it's just a tiny little Android
it's just a tiny bit slack can I open
your snapchat yeah I don't think I'm
logged in begin open it this is
hilarious yeah just a little
is it a slider it doesn't slide it looks
like it slides yeah but you will break
it if you like what about the keyboard
ass so the thing is the problem with
this phone is that the keyboard is very
very tiny I mean the entire thing is
extremely tiny but actually trying to
use this it's almost impossible so like
oh I have normal-sized fingers which
most people do and it makes everything
Alice
how is oh hell live
hello yeah yeah that's the drawback I
mean the other drawback is this phone
has about 4 hours of battery life so I
end up having to carry on a battery pack
with me which defeated the whole purpose
of having a minimal device I felt very
connected to the battery pack that's how
much is this thing
this thing's 130 ok just preach it and
then this is like big hype last year
this is big high 8310 that's right so
Nick here we release this or they
released the version last year it is
almost identical to the original though
it has a bigger screen by the way
everyone is say in the chat is saying
you should use glide typing on that I
think it'd be home
I still think it'd be hell so you open
this up and it kind of was like it's
updated it looks like a new phone disco
Facebook it's got Facebook you think it
has Facebook but you'll actually open it
and Aliens a set card but it opens the
web browser yeah it opens a browser and
yep it's like navigating these things
like almost impossible I tried to log in
from Facebook for like 10 minutes I
finally gave up it's really not worth it
and same with the Twitter app they're
not real apps it's good team on ok it's
got t9 so you have to kind of like brush
off your t9 skills and mine are not good
yeah but if you wanted yourself using
more abbreviation
you do and you find yourself making a
lot more typos and your punctuation goes
down the tubes but if you want to text
less maybe it's not a good not a bad
thing right like if you're trying to
disconnect and be less in conversations
then maybe having t9 is a good way to go
okay it's got sick lobos snake it's got
snakes snakes pretty good still oh it's
Gabe now
oh it's been super dressed up yeah this
is too much this is not what you want
from side oh no I want LCD blocks so
this is this is the punk tempio one punk
is a swiss company they make one too
minimal products they decided to make a
phone this phone costs more than you
would expect this phone costs 230
dollars and this phone only does two
things so this phone only you can only
make calls and you can only text texting
is t9 it has a couple buttons on the
front this is your kind of this is your
phone book and this is where you can tax
the big problem with this phone is that
it breaks up text and it doesn't thread
them so you have an inbox and outbox
will have sent templates why would you
build Outlook instead of just threaded
text a 2018 I don't want to embarrass
you I just want to help explain t9 for
people that are you want me to create a
message like I'll do it if you want I
mean all right here we go I'm the ex 29
here's the other awful part about this
phone is that this thing which is
supposed to capitalize the first letter
in a sentence and then keep all the ones
and lower cabs mm-hmm doesn't work so
just cap all of them which makes you
sound like a lunatic or like you're
really angry or excited about me yeah
and then that's just the end
I'm not very good at this
well that's t 99 is you push the number
of multiple times to get to one of the
letters in case someone
you know so we've got young audience
that's true yeah yes this is a so it's
very slow but it kind of does like help
you disconnect one text nothing cost two
hundred thirty dollars and it only
operates on a 2g network and only
t-mobile has a 2g and only t-mobile 2g
network and they're gonna phase out
their network within the next two years
so if you ever gonna buy it buy it now
they're gonna come out with a 3d 3G
version this is definitely the world's
most expensive burner yes and it looks
pretty good it's very pretty so it seems
really nice this is the hypest type of
all this is the hyper type this is the
light phone this is $150 this does
exactly one thing which is make phone
calls so I'm gonna turn it on so this
thing is actually really really cool
although it does hardly anything all you
can do is make phone calls you can store
ten numbers in it but you have to save
the numbers when you connect the phone
to your computer and that's kind of all
it does so you cannot you can either
tether it to your smart phone or you can
have a 2g simin here and it's kind of
cool like honestly this looks like the
most futuristic thing I've seen in a
really long time even though it looks
clunky and like basic there's something
extremely futuristic about how light it
is how small it is the size of a
business card even like the crappiness
of this display is like a little bit
futuristic yeah and glowing just see
here get my metro card going this is
gonna work yeah whenever you want to sit
on it yeah that's what the real Costanza
situation try not to show off my credit
card how's your back all right pretty
good audio quality on all these well
let's find out let's find out I'll call
my phone and I wanna show the camera
don't let anybody know so I was gonna
use like some reflections are your
eyeballs calling calling
you know yo what's up
Boas just hanging out you sound terrible
you sound great like this takes yeah I
do yeah you sound awful
I mean I will say that this makes this
speaker makes your voice sound deep and
resident but when you talk through it it
takes all of the low end out of you yeah
this is extremely painful how much does
this thing this thing is 150 bucks they
ship 10,000 units what's exciting about
this is that they're releasing a second
version or at least they say they will
next year and you can be able to text on
it yeah I suppose you have an e ink
display they said it's even gonna have
some apps they're gonna have like some
navigation stuff in it this is you start
with a super minimal phone and then the
next version you gotta add I do I view
it not as minimalism but that we want to
burn everything down and build from
scratch
yeah well you said the next one isn't
gonna have what they're not gonna have
is social media or news those are the
two things that are like we're
definitely not having that everything
else they're like negotiable ah yeah so
if you if you had to actually use one of
these as your only phone for a while
which one would you go I would use this
one this far t9 is a little unbearable
and I do need to text so this thing is
really cool but like honestly nobody's
gonna pick up my calls like nobody picks
up calls anymore so even if you have
this and you're like well I have a phone
in case of emergency because it's like
it does minimize the amount of time you
spend on it because it's so
uncomfortable and this is my thing my on
my desktop I use a bad twitter client
right because after a while I'm like I
guess I'm using Twitter it's a horrible
so limits when I used to keep it small
fears slightly a crappy technology
Fahrenheit 451 has a small TV instead of
the big room size TV yeah it's you went
straight to Fahrenheit absolutely all
right well reefer nights are for real
people thank you Michael you want I'm
sorry that you are required to use
from now on yeah I can't stop you from
making these videos what you do well I
was so excited that we were gonna see
Sara's vlogging setup I wanted to talk
to James one of our photographers here
at The Verge about his product
photography setup so I shadowed him for
a photo shoot
cigarette hey it's your friend Paul
Miller I'm here at the office early
Friday morning it's probably around 7
a.m. here to check out James baram's
photography process he does all the
photos for the vert well not all the
photos he does some of the cool photos
for the Virg
I want to see how does he get that Virg
look step 1 find James James how's it
going it's going well Paul I know it's
really early in the morning it it's past
10:00 but I wanted to see your process
well thank you welcome to my process tip
1 have a camera have a camera so
shooting on the 5d mark 3 okay with a
lovely love this lens what is it
50 millimeter 1.2 so it's a standard
lens 50 millimeter lens is the closest
to the focal length of the human eye
okay in the tip to have some lights have
some light so that you can see and when
you have your lights so subsection of
tip 2 you have a main light and a fill
light okay
tip 3 always have access to reflectors
both dark shadow reflectors and bright
we've got white around here if we needed
that yeah there are little tricks that
you can do like have you have a laptop I
believe yes most laptops if they're like
silver or bright you can open them up
and they make an awesome reflector and
if you have a coat you can have a
reflector in there and a coat put it the
other side and that creates shadow just
little things moving around it's all
simple so what we have is we have the
shadow coming this way is from this
light and the main light I love to have
all the main light in all of the shots
we do or as many as possible when we do
still life to come from the top so it's
like the light is coming from your
eyeball as a viewer know it's like
you're sitting in the same light as the
subject we're shooting because you're if
you're outside the light is up here or
you're in a room the lights are in the
ceiling so when you're looking at it
kind of mimics the lighting around it if
we keep the lighting consistent across
different products if we have a phone
and a laptop and a camera that we've all
shot hmm and it's all on the verge comm
great website check it out all of these
images are consistent okay they fit so
there's like a context on exactly we
don't shoot things and then cut them out
and put them on a color background we
shoot them for real real plus I call it
real but better it does actually call it
real cause then tip four is make sure
you have little bits of gaffer tape or
little bits of putty to make things
level and stand up clean the products
but we don't want to clean it because
real plus is we want it to be real we
don't want it to look like an ad right
we don't want it to look like it's a
render this is real Google glass and
then tip where are we up to tip four I
believe but what it does always when
you're shooting a picture try and keep
the camera level and square you don't
want to be coming in from one angle or
another because it distorts things and
then I really like the fiddling aspect
so you basically have your variables
which are the two lights the reflector
and the shadow err yes and then you
fiddle with all those variables and then
obviously get the subject to frame and
level and stuff like that it's like
recording music in a studio it's it's
all about the mix you have all of the
components and it's all about the mix
all about the mix thanks James
thank you very much a little so much
I've learned so much I like saying these
things because I make it up as I go
along
we're back ashes here oh if people are
asking you were at the beginning really
yeah mom here here so real quick I just
want everybody know we are aware of the
situation at YouTube headquarters the
team in our newsroom is covering a very
calm and check out more we'll be
covering it all day it's very serious
we've just got one more segment of the
show so we're just gonna wrap up and
then we're gonna go check in on that so
hopefully everyone is YouTube is okay
but we're just going to wrap up and move
on to that so ash yes you for his plans
yes because you know what it's miserable
outside Nilay and we need to spring this
it is snowing in April I'm trying to
like uh sir be the change I want to see
in the world while wearing a shorts a
shoe I'm so proud of you thank you so I
brought us a new gadget that's not on
the market yet but before we get to it I
wanted to kind of look back at smart
planter attempts yes so Neil I you are
intimately familiar with eating a hand
this is my eating yeah yours so you can
see how dirty it is this was actually
outside in our garden so this is a smart
planting system so if it's a regular
garden outside which we had just regular
dirt in the ground this is a soil sensor
it's solar-powered connects to your
Wi-Fi it's actually really cool connects
to Wi-Fi it's a system called blink so
it flashes a light and you hold your
phone up to it or your phone flashes it
screen and a light sensor reads your
wife I'd like a cure code but with
flashing lights so this sticks in the
ground it measures your soil moisture
and you know nutrients and all that it
you thought well plants you have it
tells you if it's the sort is
appropriate for plants what you might
need to do and it pings dark-sky lose it
knows it's gonna rain and then this is
the watering valve so you plug a hose
you plug your garden hose into the side
you follow your sprinkler into this side
and if it's not gonna rain saying opens
up starts watering your plants so what's
the catch the catch is this is a tank
this was all designed by Yves Behar okay
we sold them in Home Depot for a while
and a big deal it's a tiny little
startup of company and that is the catch
so it's a tiny little service company I
was trying I wanted to show everybody
the app they're having server problems
I can't login right now
you know I just like I hope I really
like them I met their CEO he's a nice
guy
I hope they survive with every cloud
connected gadget you got a you just
gotta make the bet like is this company
gonna survive or they still are your
plants alive the plants did great cuz
they were water yeah that's what I
realized that people just don't want of
their plan so all of these gadget is
like Oh will water the plant for you
yeah
what's this thing seems ridiculous so
okay but they it's the whole thing
it's acidity and you never really did
anything with that right we didn't need
to okay you just have great soil up
there so parrot the drone company I do
not know why randomly back like Amy back
in 2015 they announced it they announced
this parrot pot which the idea behind is
is like a plant babysitter it's supposed
to keep your plants like they can go
indoor/outdoor and it look has a light
sensor so it's looking at light has a
temperature sensor and moisture sensor
and importantly instead of a hose hookup
it has a reservoir so you fill it up
with water double-a batteries to power
it and it connects over bluetooth to
your phone so I'm going to show you guys
this we've planted something called a
snake sounds like sneaky plant I took a
picture of our CDs my whole life and
never knew what they were called
so I'm connected to our planter right
now it tells me water level and also how
moist the soil is you can put it in
automatic mode where it's like it it can
last for a month that they say so you
can take a nice long vacation right now
it's pairing but you know you call
paired a drone company but I've been
covering parent long enough to know that
pair will just hop on a tiara and it's
like they invented a blue sheet ship and
they're like wow I think that's because
they were a Bluetooth headset headsets
they did like car stereos really just
vamping all this thing pairs their
progress I mean this is really slow so
clearly their Bluetooth chip is not
great
but I will say that this was originally
priced at 100 please work and there's a
way to put in a pairing mode you can see
this it's like how much closer here
we're basically in the pot so it was
originally price that 150 you can find
them online for like 50 bucks now they
don't make these anymore it's like got
it and then it like made me laugh and
laugh it's really exciting okay so in
the past we have talks about this gadget
the click and grow I just brought it
here for reference because clicking grow
is actually doing I think decently well
there's no business which is at this
point a good thing potting soil ponds
and their way to monetize so with the
pair pot you could use your own plants
to eat in it's your own garden whatever
you wanted click and girls like you know
what we're gonna monetize by selling you
proprietary pods which is why I love
them and this is not actually connected
it's a timer light and the app idea
originally I think was to try to teach
people how they could garden at home and
have their own indoor garden but
unfortunately their app has been really
bad about teaching people that was one
of my big gripes alright so with all of
this in the background meal I still
working on this pantry I try to figure
it out we have this massive thing the
grow duo so it's from a company called
grow they're in New York City this is
designed to go outside
you don't need proprietary pods it's
your own seeds and it has sensors in the
bottom so for the soil it's measuring
the moisture and temperature and outside
it has a light sensor a temperature
sensor and you'll see inside has this
little it hooks up to your hose has a
little sprinkler system there's two of
them because he wanted me so when it
detects then it needs water
the sprinklers on what what's your
involvement at this point at this point
you would have to plant the seeds and
harvest them and they give you tasks so
they want you to feel like you're still
part of the garden so maybe you should
prove okay so you can see this my
pleasure
earlier planted beets which I have but
because you can see we have basil in
there there's other herbs there a big
idea because clearly monetization is
huge they want to also sell people these
seed cheap at least some iPods
that's a sheet of seed it's a sheet of
seed so in the app it would show you but
what you would do everything is pause
this flies in the face of everything I
thought I knew about seeds in there put
this little sprinkler right through the
middle
this will disintegrate they would ask
you to sprinkle a little soil on top and
then it is plant and I can view it what
I'll do and what they really liked about
this is they suggest to you different
vegetables and things that will work in
your environment so knows you're in New
York City I'll say hey it's winter this
is kind of your option is this beets
beets and basil essentially so these are
good degrees right they suggest things
that are good for you I mean early
spring and they'll tell you when it's
going to be able to harvest so we just
planted these now it would be ready at
the end of May so I can look at my
activities here oh my god here my
activity is I'm actually gonna go with
the prune and it's going to teach me a
little bit about how to prune them so
this is really trying to sure to be a
farmer it wants you to feel involved
right and then when the apocalypse comes
ready thank god this ribah taught me how
to farm I see cheat I'm going to cut
some basil because this is the one skill
I did actually learn when I use the
click and grow earlier this year by the
way somebody in the chat said I see
clicking grow it all my friends houses
seriously
who is this person I want to know them
actually okay I'm gonna cut these guys
you always want to leave two basil
plants maybe I should pick one closer oh
well I think I'm screwing this up guys
but you know what you can always get
another seat all right I have a cold so
I can't smell anything but I will let
Paul and Neil I smell it certified this
is real basil basil is the official
plant of the circuit breaker show it's
good yeah basil I'll try it later
exciting toothpaste
Caleb says I've seen that clicking grow
up multiple friends parents houses oh
and they are dried up in the corner it's
a good well okay my parents I actually
got them a clickin girl for the holidays
and my dad was so upset that the
tomatoes really can't get very high up
and they're really small so he planted
them in his own planter and now they are
thriving he took them out of the
clicking girl
all right this is very exciting so going
back to the pair of hot just for a
second I want to show you how the water
system works so there's a reservoir
if I press water connected this is a lie
it's super lied to us
I'm gonna try quitting this happening
all right well I think when you close
the app if you wanna know why okay why
this product is no longer okay Ashley
thank you so much yeah all of you please
grow plants the personís 199 is not
available till July so Sheila terrible
yeah and it comes with all the seat
sheets and things all right so here's
what I learn anyway today we're gonna
start Gardens uh-huh become vloggers I'm
gonna vlog about our Gardens
like all our friends on tiny phones
that's right let's take a break
everybody if you want to hear more about
that if you want to see more news or
what was happening YouTube check this
site again I hope everybody is okay
thank you for watching we'll see you
next week 4 p.m. Eastern at circa
