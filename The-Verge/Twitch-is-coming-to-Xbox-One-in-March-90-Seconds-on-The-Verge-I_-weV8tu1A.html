new first-person shooter you can now
live vicariously through someone else
for free Google is focusing its lobbying
efforts on stopping the political focus
on people who aren't focusing on the
road but are instead focusing on glass
according to Reuters the company is
speaking to legislators in Illinois
Delaware and Missouri in an attempt to
derail distracted driving bills that
would include wearable computers like
oops glass Google runs one of the
biggest lobbying operations in the tech
world so being heavily involved in the
lawmaking process is nothing new for the
company the company believes that making
people more familiar with glass will
help ease their concerns saying that the
device will help connect them with the
world around them got milk not anymore

iconic got milk tagline as part of a
rebranding effort to promote milks
health benefits the new slogan milk life
will focus on nutrition in an effort to
boost declining sales the shift marks a
return to the industry's nutrition

up tomorrow I start rebranding other
beverages oj don't drink it after you
brush your teeth that's not pee that's
