for a long time years and we've seen a
lot of devices even a few good ones but
for the first time thanks to google and
android wear smartwatches feel like a
thing a thing with a future and a market
android is huge it's everywhere and now
Google is committed to putting it on our
wrists we have one version of Android
wear and two watches running it and we
have our best look yet at Google's
vision for the future of wearables if
this is the future it's going to look a
lot different from what we thought let's
start with the hardware there are two
Android wear watches available for
pre-order now they'll be available on
July seventh for two hundred and twenty
nine dollars you'll get the LG G watch
one hundred ninety nine dollars buys you
the Samsung gear live that's odd
actually because on almost every front
the gear life seems like the more
high-end device it's a square watch with
sharp chrome edges in a rigid rubbery
strap it comes in black or in wine red
and both are sort of a simplified
version of samsung's new gear too it's a
little chunky as watches go and I really
don't like the toothy clasp on the strap
but it's a decent looking device there's
a button on the side that activates the
gear lives 1.6 3-inch 320 x 320 Super
AMOLED screen and a heart rate monitor
on the bottom next to the 5 contact pins
for the gear lives awkward clip on
charter this is not the best looking
wash I've ever tried on but it's decent
looking decent looking is kind of a feat
to next to the almost ridiculously
boring LG G watch there's just nothing
to that you watch it's a square with a
rubber strap that comes in either black
or white there are no buttons no eye
catching design touches no nothing the G
watch is at least inoffensive it's hard
to find something to really dislike
about it but only because there's
nothing really to say about it in
general the G watch does score some
design points with a long list of custom
watch faces which give it a cooler look
than the gear lives pretty bland options
but once developers can build their own
both watches will get a lot better
looking the G watch has a slightly
larger display than the gear live one
point six five inches versus 1.63 and
it's slightly lower res actually 280 x 2
80 instead of samsung's 320 x 320
neither is great then neither is
terrible but the gear lives display is
definitely superior its colors are more
accurate it's viewing angles much better
neither works especially well in bright
sunlight which is a big problem for a
device you're supposed to look at all
day but the gear live does do a bit
better the G watch is also imperceptibly
heavier that 2.2 ounces
and at 9.95 millimeters thick it's a
little heavier than the eight point nine
millimeter gear live but actually in
practice since the G watch is less rigid
and stiff it's the more comfortable
watch both displays are always on 24
hours a day there's what's called
ambient mode which is just a simple
watch face that kicks in a few seconds
after you stop using the watch the power
controls are buried in settings and
they're literally isn't a way to turn
the G watch back on once it's off
without connecting it to the charger
they both have batteries that last one
day maybe slightly more but prepare to
set their awkward chargers next to your
bed every single night all the
differences that exist between these two
watches are tiny they run 1.2 gigahertz
processors with four gigs of internal
storage and 512 megabytes of RAM they
both work as basic step counters which
is handy and and this is the important
part they run the same software just
about exactly the same way that software
is Android wear when you download the
where app and connect either the G watch
or the gear live to your Android phone
you'll immediately start getting your
full stream of notifications on to your
watch text emails snapchats system stuff
everything imagine Android wear is a
grid in one tall column in the center is
a running list of all your notifications
your home screen is at the top of that
list but also off to the left when you
push a notification away you're
scrolling through the list and back
towards your home screen off to the
right is extra information week views
for the weather archive and reply
options for email and in a cloud
hovering over the whole thing is Google
now listening for your voice it's sort
of a clunky metaphor and sort of a
clunky interface but it mostly works
some notifications you can just read and
dismiss others you actually do something
with on your wrist you can all cover a
reply to an email you can answer a text
you can answer a phone call or quickly
deny it with a can text like can't talk
right now what's up you also get
information about the weather when
Google thinks it's useful or flight info
if you have one coming up basically
Android wear is google now writ large
it's a card based operating system
designed to let you do a few things but
mostly to do a lot of things for you the
problem is it's all very inconsistent
some things are notifications which you
can swipe a way to get back to the home
screen but other times you're actually
in a nap and have to move around a bunch
to get back home everything you can
actually do on the watch starts with a
tap on the screen or the words ok Google
then you can set a reminder or see your
calendar for the day or do a Google
search you can take notes set alarms and
a few other things too it's all pretty
basic and for any
other than a handful of small things
you're going to have to pick up your
phone though the watch can make it so
your phone is instantly on the page
you're looking for eventually google
hopes there will be much more to do
you'll be able to say okay google get me
a car and pick whether you want your
watch to use uber or lyft to find it
take a note will work in google keep as
it does now but maybe also in Evernote
or simple note the possibilities are
theoretically endless it's just up to
developers to figure out what to build
but none of that is why you'd buy the g
watch or the gear live you should buy
one if and only if you're willing to
give all your data to Google to trust it
to show you everything you need at
exactly the right time sometimes Android
wear feels like magic other times when i
accidentally swipe a notification to the
right and then it's gone forever it
feels like a headache before it's really
interesting google needs to work out
that balance between giving you things
to do and doing them for you i want my
watch to be a watch first and foremost
but i want to be able to do more to like
get directions or open google search
results and i don't want to have to get
out my phone every time if you do want
to buy an android wear watch right now
you can basically close your eyes and
pick one the both sort of boring they
have ups and downs and they both run
android wear quite well i'd pick the
gear live because i like the screen
better and actually like the slightly
classier design but if you'd rather have
a simpler watch and a bunch of cooler
looking watch faces the g watches for
you of course neither one is preventing
me from holding my breath for the Moto
360 and the next generation of even
better looking devices if we're all
going to wear something on our wrist all
day but only is it occasionally it's
going to have to be jewelry good looking
fashionable something I want to wear and
be seen wearing that's why I we're
watching the first place so I hope
Android wear devices improve at least as
fast as Android wear it does I'm
eventually going to want a watch like
this but neither of the first two
options really catches my eye
