and we're taking a look at Shoney's me
mix which is this insane phone that I'm
holding right here which as you can see
has a display covering almost the entire
front of it show me is calling this a
concept phone which is because it is
supposed to try out new ideas but
obviously is not a concept phone because
I'm holding it right here and it works
and it's actually even on sale in China
right now the phone has a six point four
inch display with a 24 T by 1080
resolution that's a little bit over
1080p because it actually has a 17 by 9
aspect ratio which is a little bit wider
than usual it looks really cool though
in effect the size of the phone still
ends up being pretty big even though
there's almost no bezel just because
it's a six point four inch display but
if you're already okay with big phones
then you might not mind it this is the
iPhone 7 plus which has a 5.5 inch
display you can see it is just a tiny
bit smaller than the me mix is even
though it has about an inch less display
on it which is pretty crazy if you're
somebody like me though who's used to
tinier phones then you're still not
going to be able to handle this very
easily
the mimicks has a ceramic body that
feels and looks fantastic at least until
you notice just how bad it is at picking
up fingerprints this thing gets
disgusting pretty quickly and there's
almost nothing you can do about it but
put on a case
fortunately show me include one with it
which is kind of okay it removes the
effect of the edge-to-edge display a
little bit which is sort of a bummer but
at least it covers up all the gross
fingerprints the specs on this thing are
basically as high-end as you're going to
get it has a Snapdragon 820 one
processor four gigabytes of RAM hundred
twenty eight gigabytes of internal
storage if you pay more there's actually
a higher-end version with six gigabytes
of RAM and 256 gigabytes of high-end
storage the version also has gold
plating around the fingerprint sensor on
back and around the camera as you can
see we unfortunately do not
have that version in but that sounds
awesome at the very least both versions
this camera have a 16 megapixel rear
sensor and a 5 megapixel front-facing
sensor which is maybe the only low end
thing about this otherwise ludicrous
phone but you're probably paying
attention to the quality that much
because the selfie mode actually has
this ridiculous and maybe slightly
offensive feature where it tries to
guess whether you're male or female and
how old you are we've seen it get both
of these things very wrong on our own
all of our tests basically so it's kind
of fun in some circumstances but also
just like probably a really terrible
idea
the mimics is on sale right now in China
you can get it elsewhere but it is
expensive I thought for like 800 or so
dollars online and the bigger problem is
that it's sound networks are designed to
be used in China so you're not really
gonna be able to get full functionality
out of it everywhere else even though
this isn't getting a kind of wide
release like that though it is still
wild to see show me toying with an idea
like this concept phones and mock-ups
have been trying to get that edge to
edge to edge display thing going for
years now and it is wild to see a
company finally make one that gets
really close to that I'm 22 years it's
fluctuating between 21 and 22 years old
it says I'm a male which it did not
always get correct earlier but it has my
age way off let's see
mark it sees your face but it doesn't
have a guest hmm I have a guest for you
yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
