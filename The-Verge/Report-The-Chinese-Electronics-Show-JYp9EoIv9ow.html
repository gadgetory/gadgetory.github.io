central hall expedia through the largest
tech trade show in the country and this
spot is usually anchored by two American
companies Intel and Microsoft Microsoft
of course pulled out of the show this
year leaving their boots empty and it's
been filled by a company that most
Americans are probably not familiar with
hisense is a Chinese electronics maker
that has the number one market share in
televisions in China and they're
treating CES this year as kind of a
coming-out party they've brought a wide
variety of products from the phones and
tablets to a smart refrigerator to a
touchscreen 3d transparent TV as well as
the google TV enable high def big screen
TVs with their best known for hi sense
is just one of several large Chinese
companies that have decided to bring our
AGame CES this year well there's been
some criticism that CES is waning and
relevance as big companies take their
biggest announcements to their own
events the Chinese companies really see
this event as a prestigious platform and
while they're far from overtaking the
major brands from the US Japan and Korea
the Chinese companies have certainly
made a strong first impression
