which means you can get a Samsung gear
live or an LG G watch right now once you
do you'll be swiping through your
notifications and searching Google with
your voice like a champ but now that
it's out you can also do something else
load up your watch with apps aren't a
ton of apps available yet but of the 30
or so that we've checked out there at
least a few that are worth your time
luckily installing an Android wear app
is simple you just install or update an
existing app on your phone and if it has
an Android wear component that part is
automatically installed on your watch
there's a few different kinds of apps
for your wrist the first and easiest way
is to just take advantage of androids
built-in rich notification system
Android already lets you see and do
stuff right from the notification shade
on your phone and those same features
can work on your watch too so when you
install an app like one whether it's
notification gives you a detailed
forecast you can swipe through other
apps that haven't been fully updated for
wear sort of work you can fav and
retweet from Twitter for example but you
need to bust out your phone if you want
to apply the best way to end great with
Android wear is to take advantage of its
default voice search actions right now
those include some basic things like
take a note or call a car
by far the best have to take advantages
features Evernote you just say ok Google
take a note and then speak and it turns
itself into a quick note that's saved
right into your notebooks in the cloud
if you're already an Evernote user or if
you just don't want to use Google keep
it's pretty great you can also say start
Evernote and then open up your to-do
lists checking off stuff from your
shopping list while keeping one hand on
the cart the app of the biggest wow
factor here is lyft just say ok Google
call me a car and the app will
automatically figure out your location
and then Hale a driver be careful though
if you're showing off to your friends
you only have a few seconds hit cancel
before the app actually does what you
tell it to
but apps can actually do all sorts of
other stuff on Android wear there's a
hidden little Start menu inside the
watch which gives you access to
everything that's installed on it you
don't have to dig for it though instead
you can just say something like ok
Google Start eat 24 and soon you'll be
presented with swipeable tappa Ballards
that will have a pizza and route to you
immediately if you're interested in
unclogging your arteries afterwards both
RunKeeper and runtastic work with
Android wear another great app is
duolingo the app that helps you learn
new languages the wear version gives you
flashcards they let you quickly refresh
your vocabulary lessons so that you run
through the full app you don't have to
talk to your watch for this one but it's
an easy way to pass a couple of minutes
learn something while you do right now
the apps were most hoping for our custom
watch faces to replace the built in
options there's one already it's a
binary clock for nerds but there are
more to come until then have fun talking
dear watch and someday I promise it
won't feel super weird</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
