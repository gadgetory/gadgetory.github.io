here at sony's playstation 4 reveal it's
not quite a launch event or announcement
because there's a lot we didn't see
including the playstation 4 what we did
see were a lot of games and the
PlayStation 4 controller the DualShock 4
which is pretty interesting it has an
integrated touchpad as a headphone jack
it has a light bar in the front that a
camera accessory can look at and track
motion and it has a share button that
lets you immediately record your game
footage and share it straight to social
networks so that's pretty interesting we
also saw a lot of game demos mostly
engine demos and some upcoming ports I
was on watch dogs from Ubisoft which was
it III which looks very impressive we
saw a very realistic model of a human
head to show off some the graphical
prowess of the ps4 looks really great
it's terrifying but it's very impressive
and we saw basically just a lot of quick
clips of games showing off some of the
graphical horsepower the ps4 but not a
lot of actual gameplay I think only
twice did anybody actually use the
controller on stage and we really didn't
see a lot of the ps4 zy we didn't see
what's going to make it special beyond
just gameplay and the other thing we
didn't see which is kind of important we
didn't see any of the media stuff there
was no mention of blu-ray there's no
mention of 4k nothing about how video
might be transferred the service nothing
about other content partnerships nothing
about TV so Sonia is very gaming focused
very developer focus today a lot of talk
about how the ps4 is really a
supercharged PC the developers will find
easy to develop for and make games for
but very little about what the
experience of actually purchasing this
thing putting in your living room and
using it will be like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
