in a vent in Soho to check out dance
central 3 we're in a lower part of
Manhattan somewhere in the belly button
belt buckle region very cold what's
interesting to us this is actually the
first bit of smart glass functionality
we've seen since e3 microsoft unveiled
SmartGlass just months ago been largely
quiet ever since and now we're going to
see the first and probably the best
implementation SmartGlass we've seen
which of course is a tool patrolling
your friends and dance central what
you're basically doing is taking the
menu system from the game itself and
kind of putting it on a separate device
this is the second screen initiative
Microsoft has been playing up a lot so
what you can do from here is you connect
it to your xbox you sync it up and then
you can make playlists you can select
the songs adjust a lot of the settings
basically what you're doing is you're
taking kind of the complex settings it's
currently on harmonicas game in a kind
of a swipe gesture you're basically
making much simpler touch interface
dance central 3 comes out this week
however we won't be able to seem smart
glass until windows 8 comes out or maybe
even later that's pretty much entirely
up to Microsoft at this point however
the system the app is here as part of
sonora clasp initiative it's code once
works everywhere so it should work on
the iOS on the Android Windows Phone
Windows 8 whenever that comes out again
that's entirely to Microsoft what home
box is done here is actually pretty good
pretty effective and of course it's the
first time we've seen it in months now
I'm gonna put Macarena on every single
system up there Macarena Macarena
Macarena 50 cent the club Macarena and
one more Macarena
