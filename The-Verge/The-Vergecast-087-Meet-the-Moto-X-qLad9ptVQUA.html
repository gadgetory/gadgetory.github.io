this like this works brother Tucker
crimes happy I might as well be on on
fox news right now tonight Obama you
can't trust them okay Eddie how uh all
right hold on a second so anyhow this is
the verge cast and if you've been if you
have been talking to you the person
watching if you've been depressed that
there hasn't been enough gadget chat on
the verge cast recently you're in luck
get in get ready for an experience you
will be telling your grandchildren about
about how you wasted your life watching
a web series a Webby Award web a webby
award winning i don't think the verge
did the virtual yeah oh did oh yeah
you're right you just have so many i
can't i can't keep all you know what web
eme Oscar you know you can't really you
know where you got it once you ego where
did you write anyhow this is the verge
cast and we have a where
dine over on the there's just a bunch of
news I don't know how to phrase it
there's a bunch of news that just
happened much motorola news yes and and
we got you something we brought hey
we're holding a moto x this is the new
the new motorola flagship smartphone by
the way for people asking designed and
assembled in the USA right so i tweeted
like a phone made in the USA is pretty
interesting you have to admit something
like that and then people are like a
maid or assemble and it's like well so
there's a lot of different components in
here obviously many of the components
are from China and other countries but
presumably there are components in here
that are also you as I said like that
the gorilla glass is us minutes
yesterday there's stuff from sixteen
states and then countries all over the
world yes I think it's mostly yet like
Corning isn't yeah this are there is
there RT I have stuff in here I don't
know maybe anyhow Qualcomm I don't know
where their stuff but it is it is a
symbol than what Fort Worth Texas amber
the fort worth texas which is
interesting so I'm open city but I've
never opened this you guys ready I've
not opened this this is unopened still
sealed still actually has a little flap
on the side look at any close-ups of
them are we can you see I just open
ethical moment that's how it opens oh
there it is in there there's a phone
clearly we're not singers what color is
this is a boring black phone you guys
had all kinds of colorful phones just
the one here just just oh you got this
colorful phone well you know we're
swapping I just want you to death seems
here oh here it is it's the new let me
take the stupid stick girl wait is how
you texting and driving it can wait all
the time all this time I've been texting
and driving feeney there was no time to
lose that's how you teach tiny ha
unboxing this right now we haven't done
once the last time an unboxing was done
on anything that we were in long ago I
think we have a line but along they
wouldn't vine launched we did inaba do
we did a vine unboxing pics that can you
learn box so let me so let meet still
let me to say so let me just save so
here's the galaxy s4 by the way this is
significantly smaller right like like
really a lot tomorrow you probably can't
see this hold on but this is not useful
to any but it's a significantly smaller
phone um it feels really solid this is
great these are my first hand I've never
done it
it firsthand also is a in the box as an
instruction manual in case you don't
know how to use a phone there's that
this is so thrilling i'm pretty sure in
the guide in the reviewers got they gave
us one of the things it says is if
you've never set up a smart as a micro
USB cable and i'm not gonna lie to you
uh i think this is a great texture here
wonderful design of the various sides
the plugs of this particular microUSB i
would i give this a nine strong high
sign if it's not made by monster on uh
there's this there's this which this
thing oh they did this actually that's
actually in this motorola motoroi oh
thank you so motor rola ships with their
droids they ship these dual USB a what
are they call adapters power adapter
sorry these are awesome because you can
plug two things in at once which is an
incredible idea so that's gets a nine
and then there's there's also this tiny
what's in here it's a condom that's a
very small condom for your phone it is a
sim tool a look at this fresh sim 12
this looks surgical look at King get at
you see an enormous and get for this
tool like something you'd use in us in a
surgery like your you're like I gotta
take your blood yeah oh yeah like yeah
you're doing a TB test yeah yeah okay
anyhow that's a lot of packaging you're
right kind of wasteful not very eco of
them um anyhow so that obviously this
stuff is all not that important but so
let me get back to the phone so this is
the news of the day by the way besides
the Edward Snowden got asylum in Russia
yep but yeah the story about the leaker
know that we have a great that's true we
have a great interview with Stanley
Kubrick's wife yes there's a lot of you
should look really really good also we
redesigned slightly redesigned our
homepage today bunch of new stuff on it
really added new video widget which you
might be watching this from yeah
management anything's better it's been
the load times have been improved
significantly I'm told by developers god
yes um okay so anyhow so the phone feels
pretty nice I haven't turned it on or
anything you should see that oh they put
the power button up there huh oh wait
it's at on now okay it wants me to use
English as the language so what's the
deal with this is not stock Android no
no it's for 22 even the little Basin
version of Android I don't get it where
the buttons here no buttons on all
software also offer about
um I don't know I could get used to this
but it's kind of a mid-range phone right
I mean it is it is and it isn't like
i'll tell you the wrong type this right
now just from feeling it and pressing
this button it makes it really makes the
galaxy s4 hardware feel like crap it
does like like just in a one second I
just I just powered it down and that
just the feeling of the button and the
heaviness and the solidness of this is
like night and day right so this one we
got the test account I don't think we
have touchless on there if you want to
go ahead and set up your voice just live
on yea what does that mean like that ok
Google now stuff how do i do they just
set it up so you have to go to settings
settings Oh a lot of work there's a lot
of work the screen does not look very
good to me so far looks a little
oversaturated uh man Oh eighteen
eighties dress me on here is that for
real fo real that's got to be oh no is
it that he removed a meeting somebody
tell dieter all right what am i doing so
no need to set up what am i doing
touchless control what am i doing it's
gonna tell you how to say here we go
here we go this is the most boring
broadcast ever in the history of
broadcast uh ok I have to be in a quiet
room here we go really shut up ok you
have to be quiet it actually said that
it was noisy on using look it says that
it's noisy thats thats quiet i don't
know if you can see that now it says
quite ok Google now I didn't it didn't
work i guess uh huh ok Google now that
would work got it ok it likes it ok
Google now I really like that worked ok
here we go ok Google now boom I know I
didn't oh ok now it says it says try it
out say ok Google now help me oh you
said it I did ok Google now help me nice
as hi there says hello pack it'll help
me wait no wait hold on too many uh it
helped me did I did it okay to help me
is what it read and here's the uh here's
I don't know what this quick came up
here the first thing is from scroll fans
com help me
choose growth is my starter deck but
clicking okay I don't this is obviously
some sort of game um so now what now
what do I do I mean that's any other
touchless control is happening now what
do I do how do i act now like give me
your phone well II got out that phone
let's pretend this is yours right now
yeah now now say ok Google now ok Google
now you got you know yeah say hello wash
why am I so impressed by that give me
that um but here's the other thing if we
start screaming it it won't do it right
nothing I don't believe it let's try ok
Google now ok Google now how's my hair
google now don't think you can start
with that list you I mean really smart I
wanna tell you ok Google now is the
verge the best website ever it totally
got that perfectly right it said no
she's not willing to answer well I'll
tell you what came up our Wikipedia
entry and then the 50 best websites of
2012 yes it did from time com we
respected a respected publication unlike
the verge ok fair enough ah well that's
pretty cool i have to say but i i'm i
mean you know only time will tell if
it's as cool as we think do you actually
want to use that though feel like all I
you say before I do nothing I don't talk
to my phone a lot yeah right I don't do
a lot of transcription I have in the car
you know when I've had to to look
something up or get a phone number or
call somebody I definitely used that
function and there's a thing like it
knows when you're in a car when you're
going certain speed and no like cater
some the Android experience to that yeah
so that's that's kind of nice it'll like
throw a lot of like bright flashing
light to you exactly a bunch of siren
noises so you driving alessi driving ran
right right I like starts like flash
like flashing the the the thief camera
sketches I was a camera on this avicii
checked out turning out alright so let's
talk let's talk about let's get real for
a second okay get into real talk by the
way this chair is definitely weird lilo
I don't know why you wanna rates so so
so we asked and we did a big feature on
on the Moto X and we and we are we had a
query which was can the save motorola
and you know what would what is saving
mode what a saving motorola mean well i
would say at this point what is motorola
need to do
in order to be saved whatever that means
uh and and does it have anything to do
with a phone see I I don't know cuz to
me it's like this is proof that my role
is no more than like a Google incubator
now Google doesn't care we got your
patents make something you like you know
like I don't think Motorola's bottom
line matters to them at least for the
next year so well but I mean they don't
like losing money do that he does no one
want to lose money right there the
droids but at the same time it's it's
but the droids aren't making them money
I mean they're not they're not getting
their not breaking even with the droids
no but in a right it's been a right down
for for google for it's like a rounding
error for Google on the site it's not
good to lose money but for them right I
feel like Motorola is one of their moon
shots well the word I can be great if
they took over but if not and we go I
think Google has this incredible
sensitivity about making their other
hardware partners feel that they somehow
our giving special treatment to Motorola
or anybody but I feel like at this point
with what the way Samsung is carrying on
you know with the way Samsung is
operating I don't think it would be
crazy for them to say look we're gonna
do a special phone with Motorola it'll
be one of many devices available that's
kind of what this is except it's not
right yeah I mean how much interaction
is they have a Google on this it didn't
seem like much like I think they said
like there's a an employee share program
that's 70 google employees decided to
try i just woke up by the way for some
reason I don't know what they just did
just maybe it's active notifications
like it kind of shows you something yes
that's not how to lie up no not an LED
so what it does is it's that's the only
reason that an AMOLED screen is any good
is what it does is it lights up just the
portion of the screen you need it so now
if you Tom on it it'll let you open
right into animations or show it to you
what's not doing it just showing me the
time Oh congratulations now you know
what time ok Google now why are you just
lighting up the screen for no reason
that totally worked it's super weird
just like a screen for no reason is what
it is what I thought I said that makes
sense it's so close mmm and yet so very
far but I don't think motorable needs
saving right now no Sarah I think
they're in a place where they can do
this experiment I don't think
hit a huge loss for it yeah well I mean
I just don't I just don't know you know
is this this is not a it's a 720p
display with it what's the CPU it's a
Snapdragon s4 pro with to figure out the
x8 compare that to compare that to the
galaxy s4 worst of the worst it's
considerably slower yeah so I mean to me
it's taught it seems like a tough sell
why not make this a flagship phone could
they not get the margins you think it's
the margins that they couldn't do a
flagship phone and do it made in America
assembled in America no I i honestly
believe motorola when they say they
could have done all these other things
but what they did was they wanted to
build a phone that was the size that it
was like to hear them talking about it
they basically designed a shell and then
figured out how they fill it in the rest
way right but they also want to design a
phone that has really good battery life
right and i think they decided wrong or
right that having you know a 5-inch
1080p screen is not better enough over
the 4.7 inch 720p to be like a real
meaningful difference the the screen on
the one is 4.7 yeah and it looks
incredible oh it's amazing yeah like so
leaps and I mean I think the question is
you know who is this for and do they
care I mean to me it seems like it is
targeted much more at the the iphone
sort of the general consumer the iphone
market if you go right and last at
obviously less at the enthusiast but
right but so is the galaxy s4 so is the
one I mean those are targeted the
general consumer those guys aren't
trying to make you know niche phones
that that uh nobody you know that only
nerds by or whatever that's not the
problem is there's this you know this
wonderful idea of having like the
default android phone where it's like if
you don't want a certain phone this is
just the phone that you buys and in that
way it becomes sort of like the iphone
right I'd like you said that is for that
phone I think galaxy s foreign maybe
recently the one right which which I
have to say like it when I've been out
with the one somewhere in public or when
laura has them or somewhere people are
like is that the one I've heard about
that like they know about people known
and they're asking about they're really
interested I see a lot of them to I'm
always surprised by how many I see I
think they've gotten some traction on it
i mean i really do you know but but but
the thing is it so how does this fit
into that
you know it's a it's the same price it
is the same price right it's about the
same I mean what is that what is the s
for sale for 199 or 299 yeah I think
they're all want to gather all 19 right
so depends on the care same price so to
a consumer they're just gonna look at a
price question uh but that is this a
friendlier looking more comfortable
phone for people and I would argue
versus the one yes for most people
they're not going to notice the screen
difference they're not going to care for
the process difference the price makes a
little screen name is getting really
aesthetic for fashion the screen really
looks astoundingly bad to me I mean I
can't tell for sure but just on a
side-by-side comparison you know it's
it's even to the s4 which is an AMOLED
screen yeah uh you know it doesn't look
I'm not in love here right they look
similar could be it could be a
brightness question you know i will say
that when you get to into the range of
720 and 1080 on a screen of this size
there's not a huge resting just as far
as pixel density and yeah i think the
amal that is a much bigger problem than
the fact native 720p me to take a look
at some email side by side here this is
thrilling stuff this is the Virgin I
this is thrilling email well it's a lot
less blue than the than the s4 display
I'll tell you that what did john say
when he was filming it I think he just
cried mostly at all times that he just
couldn't even look at it why is that
John so you know how Neil I hate screens
john is a muni like crazy i'll say this
they look at the colored variation
between these two john just said in the
headset it's disgusting disgusting how
look at the color variation between
these two stories so much less like that
looks like more pure like white and grey
this actually looks this call it is more
natural but who knows who could really
tell you got a ver jap on here well
that's like what you just said is kind
of what Motorola's hoping everybody says
which is you know maybe it's better a
little but most people don't really
notice and the thing for me is like if I
hand my mom the galaxy s4 I don't know
why keep talking about my mom yeah I
know I don't know either she called her
mom lately no not in too long hi mom uh
let's see here can I can I also hi mom
can I can't disable 18p address book so
catch you later that won't be a perfect
music
google phone would never kowtow to like
cares Motorola's like fine let's let's
play but they're gonna do a google play
they're gonna do a google play edition
of this phone yes soon they say they're
doing a Google Play version of this
which is a carrier agnostic LTE device I
assume uh i believe so whatever whatever
the most recent Google Play version do
you think it'll keep the voice the
always annoys functionality because well
I'll say this the the the one keeps
beats right right and the s4 works with
like some of their special covers maybe
there's something there's something they
were talking about the touchless thing
being hardware driven like it's one of
its part of the x8 is right yeah that's
why they built the x8 right so like did
you know comes past the same processor
probably will yes I hope so yeah I mean
honestly once you get into the realm of
stock Android or just these kind of the
more modern android phones it's tough to
I mean I was using the one the skinned
one and yes it had 18 address book and
was very annoying but at this point I
mean I think Samsung is still like in
enormously bad it software design right
in terms of look and feel at least yeah
god yes but like the one and this seems
almost stock and then the stock stuff I
mean there's the variation is is very
minimal yeah point right but this this
reminds more of Nokia's like idea and
hardware design i love the colors and
like I think oh I think this is I think
this color stuff is killer and I love
the idea that you can not only customize
the backs but you can customize the the
rim around this right that's cool what
you can do what could how many colors on
so you can do there seven that you can
do for the ring around the camera lens
and the buttons yeah and you get to on
the front and then 18 on the do they
have like a design thing you can go do
it like a website it's great it's it's
super and you can do the bodily me the
button so buns in the camera and i look
i'll be on in do they sell it unlocked
not you're going to yeah now be also 18
i'll be going to buy one just to do some
crazy color variation aight i mean you
know that's but i have a problem yeah
well why is that frozen well just
looking at an image of you oh those
incompetent combination so they said on
their site that it's 2000 combinations
on their water i was just looking on
their on their blog they're liars how
are they again maybe they're considering
all of the different carriers
that's interesting that would make so
the math doesn't quite work what's what
no it does work you'd like it's to those
two thousand with the carriers yeah yeah
check you out calculator Ross Thank You
Alfred out you know but uh that's great
and if the add the wood options even
more right yeah that's cool the wood
thing is kind of and you can engrave
your phone would ya like it's a lot
short of it is I want I will you know I
hope at Motorola has some success with
this phone it doesn't seem like a bad
product uh it's just in a very crowded
it's just in a very crowded marketplace
with without a ton going for it well we
think it has two big things going for it
the color stuff and the fact that it's
get does this voice thing which is
pretty novel and I don't know how much
people really care about that right I
mean I I know people care about novel
features I just don't know how much
Samsung made all its money for I just
don't know how much people are going
like I you know I really want to phone
the listens to me more yeah right my
they might yeah um but man our video
looks benign the faculty I was walking
around with like my phone in my pocket
ever seen and i could just be like what
time is my next calendar appointment and
it would just shouted at me from my
pants it's the phone my pants yet no
fucking pants I have talking pants it's
the phone really Connor $99 is the phone
version of google glass yeah yes I mean
really right yeah that's kinda is the
one you don't have to wear yeah which is
not you just wear glasses no and then
have this phone maybe I guys I've google
glass yeah yeah next one yeah rah can't
even see it it exactly and impress
people um alright so i think that's it i
think that's all we can say about the
Moto X is that true with the except you
did like an hour about the motive yes we
did we've talked about these people God
be sick eating about the moto accent yes
other questions do we end do we get to
any were there any questions that you
guys didn't get to answer that we can
answer and so the one that I keep
getting asked is about the off contract
price and the answer is I don't know we
talked about that but just i heard i
just read somewhere as we tweeted me
that he was gonna be like 550 and 650 or
something yeah it's like 529 on AT&amp;amp;T
site right now but that doesn't
necessarily mean anything for what it'll
be from my roller i think if they didn't
off contract of like 400 that would be
pretty impressed yeah right but then i
would be really mad that I fit 200 on
contract and Alton I mean but it's two
hundred dollars last that's true so why
would you be mad well and might you did
a savings of 200 it's true if you got it
on tmobile you traded in anytime you
want for another phone
when it comes on tmobile as long as you
pay a bunch of money for yes yeah well
so each of you so without what other
questions any other I don't know
rostered we have other questions I think
we publish come like a lot people want
to know about like obviously
international google play our audience
loves sock android stuff oh the way the
one that we didn't answer was software
updates and we talked a lot like
yesterday months yeah we've met some
motor old people and uh we asked
software updates are they coming via
google because you're now a google
company or just have to go to the
carrier and they were like to obviously
going through the care go into the
carrier Ross got like rot Rosco gonna
test you with these guys he was like so
heavily tell us about software updates
and he's like well we'll get them and
then Ross is like he'd like look the guy
in the eyes I tell me about softly I
just like I did great your teeth like
that it's been a very long time so I've
been in over think you hate me yeah
you're like look I don't have time for
this I got stuff to get I get it I
forgot core almost like just just tell
me yeah and like what no but like it's
they're like well it's it's closer to
stock android so ATT will prove it
faster that doesn't mean anything yeah
I'm still waiting for AT&amp;amp;T to tell me no
it's it's a terrible situation right and
if you have to if you have to get me
every time you open your contacts app on
this it's going to prompt you to use ATT
address book which is like a virus of a
nap as far as I turn on phones it really
is yeah I don't mind telling anybody and
everybody about it it's a virus it's
like it's like you say no to it brings
you say no to and then it comes back
it's like do you want to use a Jane your
dress while yelling no thanks then it's
like three times later it's like oh
sorry buddy remember relating to address
books have you changed your mind on it
perhaps maybe she's give it a try it's a
touch that doesn't like Heights it goes
to maybe just try me out for a little
bit wow this is like we cool the sloppy
seconds will kill you I'm gonna go well
I don't know that Ganesha um anyhow but
uh no I mean to me I mean of course I'm
a I'm a I'm a guy with a very particular
tastes yes I would not want the carrier
version of the phone if there were a
stock version or a closer to stock
version there hmm but i do want to
design one very badly right yeah do you
think you'll get a choice for those
google play editions you think it was be
like black and white like that they
don't have those choices for them is a
choice for the s4 in the in the one they
just say it's like white you can get a
white phone yeah right it's like shut up
here's your phone which kinds i mean to
be fair samsung has customizations to
its the s4 active as the s
yes for whatever like the zoom the zoom
thank you yeah like their series nothing
but like choices they're like
customization now just try so gender
difference a difference cues listen I
appreciate you trying really I really
you really pushes here to like take a
devil's advocate really pushing it with
that one alright what else do we have in
the news today the boss Gus here's an
I'm gonna Reeboks this reebok while
you're driving Yuri boxing you ever
boxing everyone's what all the kids knew
the new thing on YouTube would any time
but the BMW i3 this is interesting
because stealing I would be interested
in talking let's let's do this it's the
it's BMWs electric car there take
against Tesla yeah but for people who
are scared of electric car going too far
which is everybody which is everybody
yeah rational otherwise rational this
point you can also get a rental SUV yeah
I really stop and stay for the night so
I think the idea here is that too to
combat range anxiety which as we all
know is a is a problem that faces
America's ultra-rich with the Tesla a
problem facing the one percent yes uh
range anxiety of your electric sports
car right and so on on the driving range
it in or on the driving range like will
buy right will my club get that far
enough down the green to keep going you
did you make me a successful golf artist
Mulligan's forcible God so so yes a BMW
introduced the i3 which is obviously
very interesting it's a forty one
thousand dollar not cheap no a cheaper
than a Tesla yeah yes 41,000 a lot of
bmd 1000 yes yes forty-one thousand
dollar electric car uh with all the
fixin's hmm just like Hardy's fixit's
who has the fixin's bar I thought fixham
just a southern snow I fixed in the bar
is like at a specific fast food
restaurant think it's Hardy's just user
for fixing and fixins with no g of quick
fixes with no J yeah oh it's cry
Nutcracker Nutcracker me I know it sends
y'all fixin's bar y'all who is I ' Roy
Rogers Roy Rogers very very close though
yeah Hardy's also great great shakes the
hardest merge has brought to you by
Hardy so so anyhow but 41,000 our BMW
all like
gets 90 to 100 miles yes is it would
they have a better model that gets more
mileage is that right I don't know
that's what that's what we said in our
post that story I go crazy let's see
production line you might be crazy
there's something that's I thought I
maybe I misread something anyhow but but
they have this deal that you can get
that plus access to basically like a
very very high end zipcar which is an x5
right a BMW x5 which is an SUV a
gas-guzzling SUV yeah they weren't just
like you can have a BMW sedan they're
like we're gonna give you access to the
thing that gets the worst gas mileage
right in the world like your you're
gonna break even using this twice a yeah
where's the x5 ruv x5 miles corner
fuelly.com uh let's see about 20 22
miles per gallon 22-mile 1770s p17 now
it's up to 20 points 6 miles they're
getting it together I have a that's for
have a increase I have a volkswagen golf
TDI right nice and on the highway i
regularly get like 44 45 and well mpgs
it's pretty legit at that point why even
get an electric car agree it's pretty
legit it's pretty legit well why i can
tell you y'all get that fun percent to
put diesel gas it in diesel fuel not
that easy to find homes you just run out
of gas looking for diesel fuel I have
definitely come very close i'm like
really that you don't have diesel okay
great i have like 10 mile is your car
like from nineteen forty-seven thousand
ten you jerk come on you got that thing
you were so excite I'll of that car and
beautifully me like how you have to park
cars in New York like every other well i
gotta i finally got a lot you did yeah
near my house so I can park it in this
fit relatively insecure dress free
really relatively unsafe so he broke
into my car the other day actual that's
right they but they merely it's really
weird they opened my car somehow they
got in my car maybe I left the door
unlocked I don't know because I parked
it across from my house and they've gone
through the glove compartment they took
stuff out of it but didn't seem to take
anything like there's some caches in
there there was a bottle of aspirin what
did they take nothing there's stuff in
the trunk they didn't take civil
compartment was just like open and like
there wasn't anything valuable in the
car just like it was just like my
registration really need a receipt badly
it was weird though I think you think
that I would buy if I way to the trouble
I've I went to the trouble of opening a
car and all I found was like a pair of
sunglasses I'd be like well at least
take us I'm not leaving without
something I'm taking these sunglass yeah
you know and principled hipster my hair
is out of control today do you see what
to happen in here it's like it's like us
like a slope it's like sliding down my
head really upset it's funny can we get
a graphic of like skier we gotta come
and get my hair charts Alex better if it
just stays like that John all right here
so the eye to the i3 I mean when it's
available at the end of the year right
november october hmm you gonna get one i
haven't had a car for like a decade do
you miss it not really i do i miss
driving soul oh I'll uh I'll Drive for
any stupid reason I agree I'm like you
need to go to Duane Reade it's half a
block away let's take the car all right
let me think I I would miss it anywhere
else I would I hate driving in New York
the few times I've rented a car here
it's just it's the worst yeah going
through traffic this is a horrible drive
in New York but it's in as it's like you
know if they put in a forza I'll play it
okay I'm that's not really I mean I
really didn't I'm not in any what a
conversation killer it's not in any way
it's lickable to the sky person video
games video games hey what else what
else you have on our top this actually
just happened I think on the way here
James Cameron is now making three more
avatars you know when I first saw the
first avatar i said to myself this is
good I'm enjoying it you said that I
said he was happy I said here yeah this
is good yeah I've enjoyed but but I
really could go for three more of these
same mmm three more and hopefully as
long if not god yes yeah yeah now these
you know do you remember on the CNN
reported on this there were like people
I mean I feel like maybe they made this
story up but people who had become
obsessed with the idea of Pandora as a
as like a real thing and they started
like painting themselves blue and they
and they became really depressed because
they couldn't because they couldn't live
we may have actually covered there we
may have actually wrote we written sorry
about their story Wow but it was like
the people who had become obsessed with
avatar in the universe of avatar and
they were they were very blue for lack
of a better term about about not being
able to live amongst the creatures of
Pandora Wow yeah so now that that's out
now that gets a real world James Cameron
this
oculus rift needs to come to its full
potential yes like the oculus lift
oculus rift with the Kinect and the
bicycles paper boy are we talking about
that don't waste it let's just talk
about avatar avatar then we'll get to
that anyhow so that's why when I think
of avatar I think of those people how
did avatar end you know spoilers I don't
remember but I boiler learn how does
avatar en I remember they're pretty good
i time you guys want us yeah it's like a
goody I eat the guy's mind the bad guys
had to go like you know what I don't
want to see his Pocahontas for take that
doesn't sound good really it's a nice
Pocahontas is like old there's like
grandkids it's just her in a wheelchair
just like going around on Johnson is
boat exactly I would watch that edge a
nice I mean now you just grab it I've
kind of like that sounds amazing yeah
yeah um no so oh yeah three more average
three more why not two more why not a
trilogy why a quad quad rolla G
quadrille cordial it's because JSOC
Cuadrilla Jenny work what an alien's
call it aliens is a quadrilogy it's a
quad I think when they release a trilogy
quad case yeah I drill is exactly like
not quadra-trac quadri ecology is the
study of fours yes is it hi dig that up
quadrant you ask you the wrong guy it's
three more and like like the Peter
Jackson thing and I think they're gonna
film all over at the same time so let's
think of what would happen in the in the
Avatar universe here's my here's my film
number two okay takes place everal years
after the bio a spoiler alert if you
haven't seen avatar I've just stop it
jaan jee an avatar I don't know what I
don't know what universe you exist in
but um spoiler alert we're about to talk
about the end of avatar wha several
years after the end of avatar one is I'm
not referring to it uh I'm mega the mega
corporation returns Pandora guns blazing
and having gotten having gotten
permission from whatever international
government like government yeah the
phony government body to go full all out
and it's an all-out planetary war
between the forces of good and evil
right the forces of man and nature okay
and I think plastic and it ends in a
very dark ends on a very dark nut that's
my guess and it's an empire
no buts but it's the first of the
trilogy now right and the second of the
condo is the first it's the first of the
quadrilogy so you think they're going to
end dark note I think that you're gonna
go dark and thank you goes middle 2 i'm
thinking like a main character doc first
lady oh yeah that's just about two main
character maybe dies at the end ass film
too ok film film 3 picks up darker than
ever oh and some or none more black it's
like an enormous this particular noir
which is very dark I don't know the plot
of that one because who knows without
I'm guessing something matrix e happens
like we find out that the Oracle and the
architect have actually been doing in
wait for a while like the idea that at
the end of this fourth movie somebody
will just sit down and explain all that
apply I'm tonight with the or the Oracle
the architect were like lovers right I
just saw like two of The Matrix movies
on television anyway I just want to be
clear okay they were doing it anyhow and
so they're so they're so something
somebody some equivalent of the Oracle
in the architecture appear in their Sun
God God step change some things like you
got to go big but you got to go like we
discover that the universe is some part
of pandora is valuable to the universe
in some way that we unbeknown that's
correct yeah exactly or it turns out
that there's some invisible roots that
spread out into the planet into the
starting to all planets I know the all
the universes are connected through the
threads of Pandora are you getting
excited about this to be human are you
feel like this yeah was the human does
the avatar interest a tree there's a guy
in the chair yes planing so I got a
weird like not like the Kentucky Fried
Chicken guy yes he's Colonel Jenner see
I Colonel Sanders thank you you would go
he went from the show sure so anyhow so
that's the third one is it turns out
this is much bigger than we thought and
also the Oracle of the architect we're
doing it right and that the fourth one
obviously the fourth one obviously happy
resolution we're just everybody's doing
well there's gonna be a big some kind of
big battle robots and then and then and
then like nature triumphs over over over
man-made nature triumph ultimately in
the universe writes itself right no or
interested bioengineering there you
don't need to see avatar to 384 done
this it's actually a prequel to
prometheus literally the last movie ends
but I don't like it a blob DNA following
this guy what who cares about the
prequel to prometheus
that's I saying but you're tying the two
biggest quadrilogy together give a
terrible movie Hana let's think of a
terrible movie first off that's taken
that's the freakiest yeah that's this
fifth alien movie technically not elings
yet well whatever it is oh boy ler think
of a really bad movie what's a really
bad movie you've seen good luck Chuck
Howard the Duck Howard the dollar that's
like a prequel to Howard the Duck I
would actually be more i would actually
more usage i would be more ease into
prequel to Howard the Duck then then
then some thing tying together
Prometheus and Ed avatar like I want how
I i would definitely watch a prequel to
Howard the dodd yes where did Howard the
Duck come from space right yes yeah god
howard the duck is a cool movie hey I
think well I think that's a classic that
any time is kind of like him and Alpha's
can we get a shot of howard the duck up
on screen Evan do your magic I just I
actually really like this education we
really I can't believe how I thought we
were on way longer no no I can't worry
about in the deep would be is at the end
36 minutes anybody as well I hope
whoever is watching this is
appropriately stoned I think it's very
important that we start doing prequels
to terrible movies yeah how are they God
would let happens how it has to start
really fantastic Howard the Duck origin
right is what I would call it and it's
like gorgeous and amazing yes by the way
when you want you want to talk about you
want to talk about truly disturbing
imagery here I mean thank you for Sookie
if you I tell you what if you are if you
live if you have roommates or if you
have a loved one that you live with a
spouse of some type I highly suggest
finding a way to get a howard the duck
costume hmm and then appearing while
they're sleeping appearing at the foot
of the bed and just waking them up in
the Howard the Duck outfit we're just
like it I feel like there's nothing
could be nothing more terrifying no
creature agree no no lovecraftian
creature no no James Cameron designed a
monster from space they could be more
terrified that the than the I don't even
know the questioning the quizzical face
at Howard the Duck living looming over
you he's kind of done with you nude from
the waist is like really oh thank you
for the house
cat how everybody our cast it's actually
think that wouldn't be the duck cast
like duck castor the counter says I
don't know we could do a cast all about
people named Howard yeah and include
howard the duck who else would we
include Howard Stringer uh yeah Howard
Stern Howard is Howard Wolowitz one of
the characters in Big Bang Theory yes
Wow yeah oh you don't know I've watched
all 6 mar 30 know in like a span of two
weeks yeah seriously yes Wow yeah I've
watch all the big bang theory I mean so
you basically just watched one episode
of years you're not here's the thing
it's not good ya know you've watched six
seasons of you know it's not exactly why
did you say I didn't like he's like
feral acronyms like cheap macaroni and
cheese okay okay it's not exactly good
and certainly not good for you right yes
but it's kind of enjoyable to eat
sometime no but six seasons and mac and
cheese and like I'm bloated and doing it
dis yeah how did you do that and what
point do you think I need to fish you
know I have seasons in I've gotten to a
point I've gotten to a point oh I
definitely so we when we started it was
like first off here's how it started
I've already talked about this but big
bang theory is on like seven times every
night on television okay and so I would
come home from work I do some more work
like I'd end up like get a tablet out
and sit in front of the TV and like we
kind of ran out of shows to watch that
we really wanted to watch so i would
start flipping through channels and big
bang theory was on constantly so it
started as like let me see how far how
much of this i can watch if anything
will make me laugh on the show okay and
I've definitely SAT through at this
point several dozens and dozens of
episodes where no most i would say
nothing made me laugh at all yep and in
fact i was depressed but um but so I was
watching like offhandedly like while
looking at something on a tablet doing
to me me or whatever it was in on in the
background and then I made this I've
done this before where I kind of make
these jokes that turn into reality we're
like it's almost like a challenge to to
Laura I'm like I'm gonna I'm gonna get
I'm gonna get into Big Bang yeah I'm
gonna wanna watch this i watch the whole
thing straight through like this after
seeing it enough i was like i want to
know I didn't understand some of the
plot lines okay it was starting to
bother me like I would catch something
going on and I was like what does this
meet like why does this matter and I
didn't understand it's like I'm gonna
I'm gonna watch is like sort of jokingly
okay and then we started watching it and
anytime there was even anything remotely
that made you chuckle we would look at
each other like embarrassed yeah like
we're embarrassed to be laughing at it
it's like when you're crying you're a
little bit of shame yeah exactly you
look over and there's everybody's
laughing yeah yeah baby how so so I mean
look so when from it went from that to
like to just like okay we're doing it
now and it's just gonna be on all the
time and it's just like a go-to there's
so many of them right that if you don't
have anything to watch and you don't
want to put a lot of effort into
watching something just Big Bang it just
is there yeah they're all the time it's
not but now we're approaching the end of
the six seasons well but now you've seen
60s you just go back and it'll Biddle
you just relive it yeah let's Italy
quantify that shit 135 episodes over six
seasons yeah it's almost 3,000 minutes
that's over two days little kids your
life a weekend so we cannot stop not we
cannot just I've blown weekend any worse
things trust me I've wasted weekends on
far less valuable stuff here's what I
noticed here's what I find extremely
grading about the show you know it first
off it's this depiction of nerds it's
like strictly like it's kind of like a
revenge revenge of the nerds depiction
of nerds right which is really sort of
uh yeah sort of offensive on several
levels but uh it's also this type of
nerdom where it's like everything's
awesome like we love everything right we
love magic the gathering and we love the
Avengers and we love Star Trek and we
love you know it's like real nur the
nerds that I know they don't like
everything they loved one they're like
this they're like this is my thing and
that stuff sucks right and and there's a
line it should be K of a little bit of
that but it is definitely like a it is
CBS's idea it is a it is a old rich guy
old rich white guys idea right of what
nerds are like in the year 2011 or
whenever there's any left 2010 or
whenever the show started I don't know
anyhow so it's it's a horrible but also
highly enjoyable it's cheap mac and
cheese let me ask you something this is
the isn't this a crow quills this this
this this art on this box isn't this a
reason who's the name of the artist Andy
Gilmore Andy Gilmore yeah did Andy
Gilmore do the art for this or is this
just a ripoff it cool
this is a ripoff can you zoom in on this
if you guys know Andy Gilmore is he's a
great good amazing digital artist yeah
and I actually like any time somebody
asks what wallpaper were you guys but a
lot of hazel I put a lot of Eddie go
more wallpaper on my but this looks
exactly like yet dirt yeah if you got a
crow quills calm the amazing amazing
picture you know Andy Gilmer might want
to call motorola and ask them huh yeah
come on guy oh yeah I love these so I
just I just looked down and realized
that so what are we talking about i
think we just went through my shadows
shame I'd ashamed myself a baby how many
how many people are watching right now
yes uh can you tell me John everybody
left to watch the big bang theory over
7,000 everybody comes to concurrent
viewers ah it's not that many let's talk
let's talk about paperwork which I oh my
god let's talk about paper for this I
don't have you guys seen this have you
guys seen this this is the coolest this
is one of the coolest things to ever
have been done with anything and so what
is it I don't get this okay somebody
made a paper boy you know the game paper
boy right it's like you got on the bike
you throwing papers okay somebody made a
version of paper boy that is like a
immersive 3d paper boy where you where
the oculus rift okay you ride a
stationary bike kicker and there's a
connect oh why do you throw papers off
of the bike and it's like in your in the
world of paper boy from like a
first-person perspective that's a we can
we get the we have video of it I'm not
sure we get to via yeah they're trying
to get video let's be clear like this is
generation of technological advances and
innovation interaction design yeah and
it's to emulate a childhood job of like
throwing paper yeah but y los embodies
incredibly awesome but but that is a but
that is a twat my plan it instills good
value is that is an incredible
insufficiently being a paper but it's
just such a cool idea because because
because when you think about the world
of paper boy and you do think about it
all the time 11 guys constantly think
about the later once when you think
about the world of paper boy did you
ever think at some point I'm going to
like literally inject myself into this
matrix tile and be living I'm gonna see
the view of the paper boy I'm going to
here we go I'm gonna feel what the paper
boy feels he is that would be a lot look
at this
we see there's some gameplay footage
here hang on hopefully this is the dude
who made it by the way yeah ok so here
we are in the world favorable I really
never looked this good ok can we get the
first person wears i think is this is
the whole trailer beautiful exciting but
uh does it have really like that it's
important which bike yeah the bike is
like this is very good it's a really
good bike but i just think like when you
think about what the oculus can a lot
could allow for what it can do right now
here we go this is so cool also great
yeah this is so awesome it's a great way
to exercise yeah I mean just think you
could play like a light bike Tron light
bike game that we're moving where your
speed is controlled by the bike by the
pedaling of the bike mm-hmm that sounds
amazing yeah let me this think about
like he's throwing paper all over the
place I mean this is incredible where
does he get all those papers look it
doesn't matter this you gotta admit this
is unbelievable this is pretty I mean
this is some out there ultra futuristic
right just totally who could have seen
this coming right mmm I love these guys
and like this isn't like crazy complex
technology like in like to talk about
this like very lovingly like like just a
great a bunch of ideas in terms like
interaction look at this I don't like
that I mean that's that's too much
that's not play that's on paper boy
style III know paper boy and he would
never do that being a paranoid he
actually my defectors coming like that
oh yeah this is really cool I think it's
one of the coolest stories of the week I
have to say um and I was blown away by
it and I'm excited and I want to play it
what else do we have we could talk about
um one thing I was hot but we're not
gonna get too far a dog TV which i think
is hilarious we're not covering it what
is dog TV I got a press release today uh
it's a channel for dogs sounds great why
are we covering it actually so do you
guys listen to this american life right
yay me I mean occasion they did a whole
episode a while ago about this guy who
started the puppy channel and his his
whole idea was well sometime it was like
you and the big bang theory he was like
sometimes people don't know what they
want to watch they just want something
on right or like its commercials of
another show that they like and we're
just going to show them puppies why are
we watching so okay we need audio for
this right we watching is a screw
it's screwed yeah in the IT works like a
charm is this puppy TV this is cat TV Oh
catch even Scrooge predicted it years
ago Wow well that they should suffer for
cats the writers of screws should still
worried should sue Bill Murray did it
the guy was in that movie so give me
some buzz hey no but the thing we should
about to get more gadget focus is a
couple d Apple stories this week the
china labor watch report mmm not this
week listening this was last week it was
like late last so long yeah but a long
long wait a few weeks I don't remember
it well you're really bringing this
thing down yeah we had an amazing
conversation I'm having all right let's
talk about Netflix that's much cooler oh
yeah Netflix is a huge story sorry Tyler
but also I want to talk about our John
Wilkes Booth feature oh yes oh where
we'll get to that okay talk about next
little uh so netflix this is a sea
change as far as I'm concerned your way
they do they're busy Netflix is now
offering multiple user accounts on the
same uh subscription yeah the same
screws how many accounts tag it's 55
return it's fine miss violet five
accounts on the same account so you can
now freely give your netflix
subscription to friends and family right
yeah for up to five people which is
amazing Netflix is kind of like we just
don't care anymore will it be new she's
like HBO Go or they're like dude you
know share pirate it whatever we make
lots of money and I guess I guess they
get your hook no no here's why because
like when they were doing how's the cars
like we knew is gonna be hit because we
we knew what our subscribers were
watching yeah and when you have 10
people using the same account it gets
confusing like what kyndra's like liking
well yeah I know what user likes what
he's not green light the proper shows
yeah that's actually that's actually
really smart and I mean I my assumption
is that they are you know seeing a much
bigger position than simply a
subscription service yeah right what I
mean they are they are going to become a
real powerhouse in terms of programming
they're going after HBO I mean Iran and
I gotta say I you know I think their
shows are really impressive i've been
watching Laura doesn't like it but I'm
watching orange is the new black how far
are you uh we're about five episodes in
she doesn't really care for it I am on
the fence I think there it has good
parts i think it has mediocre parts but
but like we watched i watch the first
episode under the dome last night we'd
seen someone i've seen some under the
dome i got renewed here and there isn't
but i keep seeing Laura to be
watching something when you look at the
quality between those shows yeah you
know under the dome is a big-budget
network show right right I think
qualitatively speaking the netflix stuff
looks so much more sophisticated and
seems so much more really yeah it seems
so much more like NY cable ship I me
about my network shows I don't know what
it is you know and bryan cave on did the
screenplay for under the dome right
right yeah which is you would think
would be okay well that's a great start
stephen king's x blast by stephen king
um there's some great actors in it but
it just feels like it feels like
revolution your watch revolution it's
like it's like everybody looks too clean
and everybody's like the plots are kind
of like this is sort of yeah genki like
a chauffeur mainstream like it's like an
adult show right because it has adult
themes yeah but it feels like i don't
know just not done well can able to end
by arison it by comparison you watch
orange is the new black which is the
show that you know it's a very different
tone right yeah but the our house of
cards is better and wiser card feels
like a you know an HBO show yeah it does
it doesn't pull punches orgeous yes
fires to a more mainstream i mean if i
were if i were left me investor any of
these guys i would say like guys here's
what we're gonna do we're gonna take an
hour two hours one you know one night a
week and we're gonna be like guess what
guys adult programming we're gonna take
these the dudes who are creating great
stuff for cable I'd say you're gonna
have a block you're gonna have an hour I
mean do what AMC's doing at say you know
Safety's off this is real adult
television we really care about telling
great stories and we're not gonna like
pull any punches I think that would be a
big deal at this point I feel like
they're look at the Emmys in a bunch of
me they've been that the networks are
basically passed over for for these for
any other they used to hang onto without
any question right and even like things
like comedy and stuff are starting to
get away from yeah but that's only
that's only growing here's the
counter-argument up for a comeback CBS
who just wants to like again like it's a
profit margin thing the best traffic for
for cable is like the worst for like an
hour you look at this day and you look
at the and you look at the top 20 shows
they're all CBS shows Daniel and their
dominate their dominating you know but
what the NBC's the ABCs the world are
obviously want to get in there
more to the point that way people watch
is changing right and as that changes I
think you're just going to start to see
people drift away from stuff that isn't
the quality they expect if you get that
quality by subscribing to netflix for
nine dollars a month I mean if Netflix
really started cranking out a lot of
shows that were desirable I mean net
house could conceivably you know they
could and they're not they can't
conceivably do this at this point but
they could have a walking dead or a game
of thrones right Sherwood should just be
like you know crazy I mean I don't know
their houses difference between house of
car well how about large has a big
viewership but not like it's not like
these phenomenal terms of its not a
phenomenon like like some of these yes
are these shows are the quality I mean I
mean walking dead and madmen changed the
face of a NFC you know they completely
trained in and now it's like you know so
many people watch The Walking Dead it's
crazy it's got a bigger audience the
madman yeah got bigger audience and I
don't know not bigger than Game of
Thrones but it's been enormous the big
ass audience might be bigger than Game
of Thrones it's cuz it's on basic a
bright right anyhow the point is I think
there's a change coming to shift coming
and I think I'm surprised when I swatch
on to the dome it's an intriguing story
you know it seems like there's some good
threads to pull there but some of it
even the special effects I'm like that
just doesn't look very hot budge mmm
that does not look high budge no I
budges the thing not race that's a
phrase yeah that's a bus Stephen King
James camera would not allow that avatar
for it's gonna be churned return to
Pandora which no no avatar for is gonna
be the final triumphant return right I
mean presumably as a major death in
avatar for no you know it's good isn't
without that isn't without meaning
they're gonna get stranded away from
Pandora in avatar 3 and avatar for is
gonna be them however they might come
back where would they be stranded i
don't know there are somewhere in the
next door earth were interested in New
Jersey hose get I got to be some earth
stuff right yeah well sure the dist opik
nightmare world of Earth yeah yeah kind
of like Mars from from from total recall
the original method it's like a mash-up
of Elysium and avatar will easy looks
good god I'm excited what's coming up
this week right I think Elysium is going
to be the sci-fi movie we've all the way
for I saw i finally saw oblivion Oh what
do you think well i think that there's
one
logos in it first off I mean the Ale the
alien ship spoiler alert shit there are
i really i really just boiled it bad oh
no I know there's it says in the
trailers aliens yeah the alien ship
looks like a huge verb slugger it's
really nice you mean the impossible
triangle yeah well but but but more
infants but our noble re the penance is
triangle to the Penrose triangle is the
thing but our Penrose triangle has an
additional side right that's the thing
that makes it cool and more impossible
join it actually looks like it has an
additional side anyhow uh I thought was
pretty good though I mean was better
than most movies but also highly
derivative and I it's a new like IP like
it's not a sequel of anything right it
does right I would watch a sequel to it
soundtracks pretty good m83 to the
soundtrack yeah really but it's like m83
with with like but somebody didn't let
them do their thing they were like
here's an orchestra yeah they're like I
like it don't you don't you don't go too
crazy you can't dance to this no and
like you know drum fill yeah you know
there's a little less interesting than I
think you could have been but beautiful
looking film and of course Tom Cruise is
in it hey uh who I love it's not tall
the cruise missile I'm telling you he's
not that short I mean you know that I
met him yeah you desert spoke to him
BFFs yeah I want to say there one BFF
you already Norma's so it's it's I'm a
big guy but and maybe it's just his
tremendous personality he didn't seem at
he didn't seem that short his smiles
like 65 that's right yeah his smile is
is oversized right yeah so makes up for
any fair enough issues we've got three
things we should definitely do it
promote for guilty this week was the
premiere of small empires oh yes this is
small empires if you haven't seen it
your uh your get out of my face let's
get out of my face and don't ever come
back to my face until you've seen small
Empire and then tell you um this yikes
what is this morn Paris yeah this is a
trick it's at oh yeah oh yeah no but the
first episode JP this week it's zocdoc
will have many more episodes every week
I was like no only thing about Detroit
oh yeah no this is alexis ohanian the co
founder of reddit is is doing a show
with us and it's very cool he's like
looking at new york startups New York
starts right now I could expand in the
future right and we have a bunch more
episodes that it's very exciting very
good beautifully shot and produced by
the by the Vox studio crew was it was it
zocdoc that has the they have coffee on
tap
in the office which is like the thing I
want more than anything we have world we
have shelter on tap yeah but you know
it's like maybe I don't covet your
neighbor's condo on coffee on tap like I
copy of talking about idea that's what
idea how do you how do you keep it fresh
no I take it where's it coming I take it
back front is a huge mistake it's called
room that'd be good very costly though
what do you have to do you have to let
you feel like there's like a coal
furnace somewhere you load up with copy
like what is the mechanism that keeps
the coffee going hmm coffee doesn't like
magic I mean I think about carbonated
water is you take water plus air and
it's like a thing coffee's like hot
water and you have to grind it and
there's a filter and there's like a
brewing process like how does that
happen on tap Oh bullshit this is
bullshit anyhow all right there doctor
first what is the other what are the
other things ah definitely talk about
I'll real quick the site redesign we had
a little girl front page really 9th week
let's not get crazy we know we tweaked
our homepage we we we actually found
that during CES there were a lot of
things that we really liked about we did
a homepage I'm sorry a CES hub and we
were like oh this is cool the page is
bigger there's more slots for stuff
there's more areas where we can
highlight features yeah different piece
of content and so we did some refresh to
the homepage today we added some things
which are still tweaking still adding
still fixing a few if you see any
problems at verge support on Twitter we
can see it here you're putting it man we
have a new we have a new we have a new
video player witness where you can watch
small empires uh and a bunch of new
stuff oh it's is we're gonna do this now
it's not going to really do this yes
we're doing it here we are nope no it's
like it's floating to you um and and
this is and also the the page load times
have been sped up yeah significantly
which is huge and this is all part of an
ongoing process of trying to tweak and
fix and you know the funny thing about
is we launched um less than two years
ago yes but 18 18 19 months ago
Halloween I remember that uh and you
know it's crazy how fast things move you
forget that what we were doing at that
time was scary in new and weird and
people
like we really I was really scared I've
said this before but I was so sure
people gonna be like I hate this is the
worry we got three months of hate mail
Cohen go back to this my next cover yeah
yeah when and then eventually that that
went away but you know the layout was
crazy we're doing these big feature
things and now it's funny like you look
at around the landscape and everybody's
kind of doing this stuff you know we
were I think you know we were part of an
early sort of trend of thinking about
how to use the web differently but you
know everybody's going responsive now
polygons responsive SB Nation's
responsive a bunch of other sites bunch
of you know uh peers have gone response
and we're like oh man we really need to
do we want to do it right it so people
were asking like are you gonna do
responsive that's coming right it's
definitely coming there's no question
we're working on it now it's just a
matter of getting it right we actually a
really complex site design and we and
what we want to do is keep the spirit of
it and make it more useful and more
usable and better for various platforms
the other thing I'll say is coming in
the near future is we're going to clean
up I've talked about this in forums a
little bit and I probably mentioned it
may be on the verge cast before but
we're gonna clean up our taxonomy AK how
we organize stuff right right so you I
think we're gonna have a better way for
people who if you just want to read tech
news we're gonna have like a tech
section yeah where if that's what you've
actually want to plug into if you're
just an info junkie on that stuff you
know that will be there for you if you
want to read the breadth of stuff that
we cover the features and the the
culture stuff and some of the more fun
things that we do that'll be on the
front page people still going to do tech
obviously but we're going to have
separate sections for some of these
we're going to go we have a new design
section which I'm excited about which I
think we're gonna you know be able to
put a little more emphasis on company
cuz I'm up because I'm a designer and I
really get off on this stuff and so you
know sexually and so I want to have a
two of us that's the big bang theory
some more of a platform for that I mean
we've it's all stuff we've been doing I
just want to clean it up vandalism when
we launched we're like we didn't call a
site we kept calling it an app because
we want to think of an iterative updates
and we'd actually well had that version
history page ever get flung we still
have it we still have it yeah and we add
a verge video recently we want to
integrate that better that's one of the
things will happen in the in the near
future I think next few weeks or months
better integration of video better
integration of
that which is responsive by the way it's
a kind of completely responsive separate
part but we're gonna integrate those
better so does my also separate for the
rest of the site but yeah I mean we do
think of it as it as a nap and we do
think of it as a work in progress I mean
there's no if you guys don't aren't
happy believe me like I'm way less happy
than you are like it's always can always
be improved you'd be fair that's just
true never been happy there as sure I
don't know I'm not familiar with these
emotion described that people keep
describing to me as happiness right and
then and then speaking of right features
and great site like great side stuffy
accomplishments we ran a big feature
story this week about John Wilkes Booth
which is about kind of a conspiracy a
sort of historical conspiracy about when
he died and where he died and we have an
incredible story that Jesse Hicks wrote
beautiful layout done by our one of our
new design people Kelsey good work
Kelsey think a and is there any other
way to spell it i don't think there is
but um and it's just a beautiful story
it's a great story incredible video
again from it from the bond studio team
and really cool like story eat anyway
you you get it so i suggest you read it
and and it's cool because they're
actually using DNA to try to figure out
who whether or not John Wilkes Booth
died the way that the authorities say he
died if he actually lived much longer
you know probably our most infamous
assassin in America well maybe I don't
more infamous than then Lee Harvey
Oswald you by the way I think everybody
knows renaming you can't be you can't be
an assassin a presidential assassin
without three names that's true well
can't be like Josh Topolsky not to worry
about him doing anything what's your
name it's ryan but i would never use it
you know just a history will you history
will use it yeah why but why they said
hell's weren't you tell me so John Wayne
Gacy there's no something more sinister
about with having his middle name yeah
well no john gacy Johnny a guy you can I
tell you a car John Wilkes Booth is just
a good good killer name yeah it works
well you think it is now because he's a
historic know I was directly I would've
said that two hundred years ago I've
been like this guy watch out watch out
for john william booth
just don't trust me i'm trying to think
of like how you would say that in a 200
years ago voice but i don't know what it
would sound like anyhow are what else I
mean that's the big thing for the week
oh and I think it's a good place to kind
of start wrapping up you can start
playing with your Moto X that's all I
want to do I guess we need to start
wrapping how we do there's also a two
percent so is it oh boy this is it as
well no oh yeah like a hundred sixty
years thing is last week we had Neil I
hear you were not here and um you know
the couple times team has been hosting
that outros are always a little bit off
we need more of the Josh in person doing
the ultra-right sure don't flow well as
the verge can assault charge that's the
verge gasps for this week if you want to
get in touch with us you can in a
variety of ways you can email us at
