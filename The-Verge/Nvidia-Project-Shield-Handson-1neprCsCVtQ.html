showing here by you judge decided for my
video and we taking a look at this brand
new freshly announced and video project
shield handheld console so you Josh
while I'm getting to grips with this can
you tell me what are the main features
of this new device that you just
announced yeah the main features are the
console grade controller that we've put
in there obviously a 720p display it's
got these bass stereo tuned port
speakers and I think the biggest thing
is that you play all your android games
we can also attach to your PC at home
that has a geforce gtx in it and stream
your pc games and play it on the device
itself okay and this also access to the
steam games tool you can access the
steam game catalog as well as any PC
games that support controller that you
already have installed on your PC
alright so it runs table 4 which is also
the brand new chip that you just
announced it's a quad code device a 15 2
gigabytes of RAM you said storage will
range from what was it I think we're
still defining the storage that will
have in the system itself but the other
thing about Tegra 4 is it has the quad
core CPU yeah but I think more
importantly for the device that we have
here because it's gaming device it has a
72 poor GPU in it as well so it's really
the GPU horsepower that really helps us
play the games that you see on the
device here all right I'm going to
5-inch 720p display so all of the games
or the output what are you putting out
to your HDTV so being played at 720p
that's correct also Jensen one last
night demonstrated the new 4k video
output with this swing around the side
we've got HDMI port micro SD micro USB
and a headphone jack you've got a couple
of shoulder buttons pretty much
everything you need out of a controller
right because it is primarily a gaming
device but then it also is fully fledged
Android device oh absolutely you can
watch your movies on it go to Google
Play read magazines read your kindle
books surf the web gear you know as we
found out last night in the middle of
our event whatever one started telling
us on stage you could even go to the
verge
browser you can even go to the verge all
right thank you all right thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
