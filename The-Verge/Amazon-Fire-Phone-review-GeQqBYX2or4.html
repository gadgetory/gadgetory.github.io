our smartphones are our most personal
devices our most used devices and Amazon
wins when it's right there in front of
you
so of course Amazon was making a smart
phone and this is it
the fire phone the first time you look
at it or touch it there's really nothing
remarkable about the fire phone it's a
black rectangle a slab of glass and
beveled plastic it's heavy but not
really big but not really it's just a
phone it has a 4.7 inch 720p display
that's not anything special but
certainly gets the job done it has three
speakers so you'll always get stereo
sound it has a raised home button which
I weirdly like a lot and an edge to
Amazon logo on the back it has excellent
performance thanks to a Snapdragon 800
processor and about a day and a half of
battery life it's all good enough
without ever standing out it's just fine
the camera at least is fairly
straightforward and pretty good it's 13
megapixels and take solid sharp images
in just about any situation it's better
in low-light than almost any Android
camera I've tested actually there's a
nice panorama mode plus one for taking
photos you can look at with the dynamic
perspective features turned on the only
problem is the cameras slow slow to
focus slow to shoot just slow the only
hint you get from looking at the fire
phone that it might be something a
little bit different is the 5 count'em 5
camera lens is pointing out of the front
bezel they make for an ugly front of a
smartphone like exposed screws or
visible seams but they enable one of the
most important features of the fire
phone that features called dynamic
perspective it uses 4 cameras in the
four corners of the fire phones face to
recognize your head its position and its
motion and then it lets you see lots of
different parts of the phone's OS in 3d
sort of when you look at the home screen
and move your head around you'll be
looking around the icons you can also
move the phone which responds to tilts
and gestures to always be showing you
more information to open the quick
settings menu and the notification
window you flick your wrist back and
forth with the phone in it you tilt it
to show hidden menus or pop up more
information in a map amazon's whole idea
is to take away most of the information
on any given screen and only show you
what you want to see at that moment
games are awesome with dynamic
perspective more immersive than just
flat-out more fun but with everything
else it's just a gimmick and sometimes
it's actually unhelpful it means that
the fire phone doesn't always show the
time or
battery levels you have to tilt the
phone slightly to make them appear I
don't want to do that
I want all of that as accessible as
possible all this tech is open to
developers and they may well find cool
ways to use it but really all I wanted
to do was turn it off and just use the
phone the other big new feature of the
fire phone is Firefly
it's basically an ultra powerful object
recognition tool able to scan email
addresses and phone numbers and websites
and deodorants and teabags and books and
movies and songs and speakers and almost
anything else you put in front of the
fire phone's camera at a very basic
level Firefly is a shopping tool like
the ones available for lots of other
devices you're running out of soap so
you scan the bottle and four seconds
later you've bought more soap from
Amazon but you can also listen for a
song and in one tap start an I heart
radio station with whatever you are
hearing it's up to developers to make
this interesting because all Firefly
does is figure out what's being shown
eventually it'll do more than just add
soap to my Amazon card the problem is it
doesn't work all that well it got books
right most of the time always figured
out what song I was listening to but it
often couldn't figure out the object at
all or got kind of close but not really
Firefly is kind of its own thing a
single app with a single purpose but
dynamic perspective invades everything
about how the fire phone works its
software fire OS is all about three
panel interfaces in the middle your
content on the Left menus on the right
is what Amazon calls des lighters little
additive tricks that add something fun
or useful to the app you're in that
concept is fine even though it's
frustrating how few third-party apps
currently play along it's the navigation
that's the problem
there's no indication that those menus
exists off to the sides or when they
exist or what's in them you just have to
open an app flick the phone back and
forth a million times and see where
everything is the fire phones
multitasking isn't exactly obvious
either I spend a lot of time just
hitting the home button going back and
starting everything over but even the
home screen is confusing it shows every
app book or item you've opened in
reverse chronological order as you
scroll through them below each one is
related information your agenda
underneath calendar recent text
underneath messages underneath most of
them though is just more stuff to buy
you have to do list app here are five
more some things scroll left-to-right
some up and down and there's an app
drawer hidden underneath the row of
icons at the bottom there's a lot going
on here and once you understand the
paradigm it's even sort of clever but
it's a million miles from obvious
or intuitive the only thing consistently
straightforward about the fire phone is
how easy it is to get things from Amazon
buying renting streaming anything from
Amazon is easy but that's not what a
smartphone is for a smartphone is for a
lot of things shopping definitely among
them but it's also for getting work done
for relaxing for communicating and since
Amazon doesn't have the Play Store it's
missing a huge number of Android apps
including all of googles and everything
from the email client to the calendar
app to Maps suffers as a result Amazon
is only going to win if it gets
developers on board with its most unique
features and when it can't even compete
on number of apps it's hard to see them
really working to develop for one phone
on one carrier from Amazon so the fire
phone cost $199 with a two-year contract
and it's available from AT&amp;amp;T it's full
of big ideas a couple of them huge and
full of potential that will probably
never be realized in a few months or
years things like dynamic perspective
and Firefly could go from cool gimmicks
to actually important features Mayday
the super simple OneTouch support system
is really awesome as well and you'll
need it in order to figure out how to
use the fire phone but in an effort to
make something different and new and
innovative Amazon kind of forgot to make
a good smart phone a good smart phone
should be fast and efficient entirely
without complications the fire phone
tries to be fun and delightful but too
often it's just complicated
