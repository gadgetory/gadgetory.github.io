jokes Paul Miller hello Ashley and hi
I'm are gonna join us a little bit later
but we're gonna get right into it it's a
gadget show live gadget show we're in
the chat with you we want to answer your
questions or ask away
but there's one gadget this week one
father's for this it's in Barcelona it's
called the Samsung Galaxy S 9 Samsung
makes phones now they've done it again
for the ninth time the 8th long they
were like no way both can't get better
than this so we know you all probably a
lot of questions on the s9 we've got a
whole crew of people mm-hmm at Mobile
World Congress but just give me some
quick answers about it stop tracking a
45 it looks exactly like the SA but
there are different color ways different
color ways that's different screen ratio
yep 5 foot 8 inch screen sm + s 6.2 6.2
almost as big as the node 8 almost the
biggest a node 8 it's got a headphone
jack still Hey hmm Samsung can figure
that out no one else can it's some crazy
camera tech no I really thought it was
gonna fingerprint sensor under the
screen this year no we're not ready for
that
but they moved the fingerprint sensor
from the weird spot next to the camera
to under the camera and then like you're
saying the bigger phone has a crazy dual
camera system but it's not doing lots of
funds of dual cameras obviously I have
an iPhone 10 year or the dual camera but
this one the second camera has a
mechanical aperture right so it's a
wide-angle on a telephoto and then it
can it can go down from F 2.4 to f1 from
F 1.5 to have 2.4 so you get more light
in get more or less shallower depth of
field which is what everybody wants
I think it's mostly for a little I think
they're moved to get more light into the
camera mmm it's to open that aperture to
go to F 1.5 mostly if I tried it dan
tried it mostly what you it runs an F
2.4 it automatically switches there's a
pro mode in the app that you can set it
manually but it mostly automatically
switches and mostly in low light it'll
just open up to F 1.5 to get more light
into the sensor but data it's all right
a few point 4 here's the thing that's
interesting and I want your questions
about this phone we're gonna be a video
from Dan that we're gonna run later
well answer your questions as best as we
can later on the show like the big open
issue for me mmm we've done a lot of
camera test this year mmm the pixel to
you by far the best camera on the market
iPhone 10 something in there I have been
consistently saying Samsung's cameras
are not as good because their software
processing is so aggressive well Google
is almost doing the least with the
camera the most with the software and
they're getting the best results right
now yeah so will that be continued to be
true so if you're gonna do all this
fancy actual camera stuff moving your
apertures around is your software just
gonna crush that difference away I mean
there's got to be a point where hard I
mean that's why I have like a digital
SLR like a mirrorless but like
interchangeable lens camera cuz I want a
big sensor if I can get low aperture and
fancy low depth of field and it's great
I love it but if phone hardware is not
even anywhere close to that then maybe
software still is the answer
so we'll see the phone just came out
came out we our videos published it like
yesterday basically the teams in
Barcelona they're using it we're gonna
run leaving fingerprints going up to
every phone the show just touching them
all so we don't have it it's again just
came out we're gonna run some hands-on
video of the s9 a little bit later in
the show ask us questions both in the
chat and on Twitter use hash tag sir
Greg alive we'll try to answer them
throughout the show as we get them about
si and everything else happening at MWC
but we have a lot of stuff here to
actually show you we've got a packed
show today so we've got the Cobo here
Ashley's gonna join us we've got this
smart light situation is very precarious
we just left it set up she's gonna show
us like the future of what's happening
to OD smart lights hymens going to show
us the switch
antenna switch wreaths one-year
anniversary's on Saturday the whole
ecosystem and accessories we're gonna
play with a bunch of those want to take
your questions we're gonna do floor
report such a good show it's a lot going
on and I will say all of our demos are
very precarious starting with this one
so what's this Neal I so I wanted to
have this on the show last week okay but
it was too hard to set this just gonna
get back here this is the Cabo actually
coming home rosario says you push I
recommend moving from SH the s9 I don't
know that's like we got to get it we got
to review it I don't think it's enough
anyway this is the answer more questions
later so keep that's fine too so this is
a Cabo it's a universal remote system
mm-hmm they want they want to say a lot
of other things about it I will say just
all things aside having a HDMI switcher
is a very nice yeah so basically the way
I think about it is to solve the problem
of controlling multiple devices you
can't just like have a remote that's
smart anymore or hub you actually have
to control them all so this is an HDMI
switcher it connects to the network and
connects over Wi-Fi mmm it logs into
your services for you it keeps track of
what you're watching on what device mmm
it's just it's amazing like a little
Butler it's like asking your friend to
do complicated remote procedures right
so this is the remote okay we got a plug
in on this TV back here knows what it's
doing so right now it's ringing this is
Amazon fire TV the CB has emotion
smoothing on this demo is over there's
this is the combo you can see it's got
this interface over the top I can just
like press can cabo turn off motions
moving cabo cannot turn off motions
really okay so this remote it's just
like a universal remote okay it's
controlling this fire TV right which is
okay now here's the crate so it's just
basic universal remote stuff
here's christen we've got a Roku what
I'm gonna plug a Roku into this Cabo
okay see these like crazy posts
chromecast here let's plug that why not
so the Cabo is smart two new devices no
this should so I set those up okay it's
gonna think about what they are it's
gonna recognize them okay automatically
figure out what they are it's gonna
automatically map this okay and then who
next this thing is by the way it's
insane it's five hundred dollars this is
so complicated it's this artificial
intelligence or did they just like
painstakingly just so the reason that
you want to plug things into here is it
watches the screen right so look you
know it looks at what's on the screen so
I'll show you so so you can see here it
figured out we plugged a Roku and on
chromecast and I plugged them into just
random ports okay next you'll test
control of all connected device so
that's a switch over to the Roku keep
thinking this process takes a minute so
now it's got to find the Roku of a
network because it's going to try to
this is probably word this is going to
fall down I'll be here
so the way it doesn't just control it
with like IR the way harmony does and
doesn't just control it with CEC the way
that which is remote messages passed
over HTML right it controls it over
everything so it has an IR blaster it
checks it checks the commands over CEC
it watches the screen to make the
commands get taken how does it work with
the chromecast the the chromecast is a
it's never going to find this record
Creighton our previous just by freaking
out right now because we knew this is
where I would fall down or could sorry
where we're not a like a home
environment right or like in our office
but but you set this up in your home oh
wait it just took awhile you didn't
trust it yeah so now it this is actually
great you can see the screen right now
of the room yeah it says test it it just
took a while because we're on the office
Wi-Fi here so I get it works
Creighton you're enough to do this back
there man
you got a Cabo Cabo count to one seven a
everybody type in like ready to go on
the back so this is Alden all of your
services so now when you watch a show on
Netflix you pick it up on another device
it'll remember done okay so whatever so
yeah yep so now we're in ok and you have
like a hybrid interface there's work ooh
there's Roku act but cabo pops up I was
here so now I can be like watch altered
carbon this is the Cabo search it's
gonna show me the Cabo thing okay and I
can do that or I can push this button
and I can decide which device to search
on Wow this is Blanco so I can say
search on a Roku it what it's doing in
the background because it can see the
screen mmm it's opening the Roku
interface and it typed altered carbon
into the Roku search for me which is
insanity Sol I can also I don't know why
you would do this on this device but I
can go into settings the Roku and a fire
TV are like very similar okay but I can
set if I only want to watch Netflix on
the Apple TV I can set it to run in the
Apple TV if I only were on Amazon so now
if I go and set this to Roku I can do
that that's at that one to Roku Wow
so now what's the show on the Amazon is
like the Grand Tour watch the Grand Tour
so at the car show it's the car show I
just know it's on Amazon so it's you saw
that was on on the Roku interface at
that now it's just operating everything
in the background and so switch to the
fire TV click through the fire TV
interface for me mm-hmm
it's Barger's to me like I've tried to
fight I'm trying to find just regular
websites like help me find what I can
watch on my different services yeah not
even like a small problem just like I'm
so impressed this thing is actually
working and then the other thing you can
do so now here we are in the Amazon
this Alexa here okay this echo here it's
listening thanks
Alexa stop because of because it's
bridging and controlling right you can
use Alexa to control devices that don't
normally support it you can use to
control Apple TV you can control Roku so
you like Alexa tell kaavo to play
stranger things and because we set
playing stranger things because we set
that to happen on the Roku it'll do it
do you have to push the button oh you
have to do a profile it knows about your
Netflix profile so it'll ask you so now
it's push match the Roku and play it
so these how much it's doing like it's
doing it just fall over it baby so it
could it's very brittle okay so I fell
over from me a bunch the setup is crazy
my wife hates this thing Oh because when
it falls down and just falls down
catastrophic Lee wait and if I just if I
just press pause for me yeah the other
thing is if you have a cable box you
won't have it support okay watch it
comcast x1 box Dish Network it will
support it it does all that it will also
at night just scroll through your DVR
and read the screen of what's on your
DVR so it has an index of what's on your
DVR so it's just like meta interface
universal remote well it's like because
it can watch the screen it can do all of
this crazy stuff that no other Universal
can do it is $500 no it is it's huge
just like look at it it's monstrous but
the best part yeah you can choose your
favorite would finish it's real silly
what does this one call this is like a
maple
HTR support in future so this is the big
problem with it does not support HDR
what about pork it supports 4k but not
hgr it doesn't support dolby atmos
so for five hundred dollars you're
walked inside pretty limited if you
can't grow with you and to where people
are the way I understand that this is
almost like their trial run like this is
just like a look at what we can do but
they're going to make something with a
little more yeah so I you know I
interviewed their CEO and their CTO much
times really cool dudes they're very
excited with this product
they have backgrounds in like audio
components and they work for speaker
companies i i've asked them that you
know their goal is to get this product
and the technology out in the market
they're only selling 5,000 of them they
don't think it's a midget acquired i
don't think they're trying I think
they're trying to get their stuff
smaller I think they want to make a
newer one that's cheaper that's smaller
most people do not need eight ports or
whatever what about like I was rushing a
brushed metal cover everybody that's
everyone's next move obviously I think
they're gonna make a sound bar I think
they're interested in receiver I think
that's true if you solve the complicated
parts of your home theater so if you
have a smart TV you can't control your
TV apps cuz you can't see the screen so
like you know they've got some like
limitations but if you're sort of but if
you are like me and you have a
chromecast you've an Apple TV and give a
Roku mm which is true at my house
they're a monster monster this thing was
just like any other cable walks over
cable walks to this thing will just like
it is easily the best funeral sermon
I've ever used except when it breaks and
then it's a computer and then it's an
Android computer and it's like and then
your loss and then your wife is mad at
you she does not like it I'm sold the
other thing that's cool I'm not on this
network crate now I think you might be
honest I work if you just launch a cast
stream yeah it'll just like click over
automatically in this remote complaining
pause of castering
which is not true of all current like
that's the chromecast pain yeah my big
thing is volume every different app that
can cast to my chromecast has a
different way of doing volume yeah it's
real pain yeah so this is just like do
it it is again this thing is very
finicky it wants to being controlled
everything it reads your power state on
your TV okay it I mean it requires you
to have a relatively new things that
support HDMI CEC but it will go talk to
everything over the network it'll talk
to your app
your Bluetooth if you just airplane an
Apple TV I'll figure it out and light it
out of him because it's watching the
screen all the time what are these
buttons for this play hit all three of
them their arm up beeps Oh find the
something why the remote it's enhancing
but yeah I think if you hold down all
three of them Ramona peeps not today
Paul people are saying there's a buy
patch HDCP no it doesn't it lives in the
interesting my chain look at the signal
that it has to decode at all yeah it's
all kosher so I wouldn't want to put a
game console in this channel all latency
you would probably get some additional
latency out of this yeah my xbox into it
video games so it didn't make a
difference to me this is a sort this
device is like why we have circuit
breaker I don't think most people should
buy this but it's fundamentally so cool
it's such an insane gadget here's the
craziest thing so I saying it logs in
your services for you so here it's got
Netflix on the screen it's every night
it's displaying this screen right but
virtually over here it has a web browser
open and at night it logs into Netflix
for you and it looks at what you've been
watching in that flick so it can update
its watchlist crazy it logs into
whatever the api's yeah some of these
services don't have api's so every time
they hit a wall they built this like
intense solution to get over the wall
which is wild this is what this is what
hackers do yeah this thing is a huge
hack this is how like people expresses
where we are as universe this is why I
lost every eBay auction people know it's
like all of everything is out of control
okay
it's wild mmm but every time they hit
one of these walls that prevented them
from controlling something they weren't
supposed to well they built a solution
what would the Roku's amazon's google's
cable boxes have to do to make this just
irrelevant like not even necessary I
don't know I mean I you just cast it so
yeah so Creighton just casted from
because he's on the right network it's a
just it just switched it just did its
thing and now I can just say
and you see in the corner here it says
chromecast that's so it's just doing its
thing man no it's no it's not well push
play so to me this is just one of the
most complicated products that I've seen
mmm but if you know like I said if you I
might buy one for my parents
you're not gonna get like I want to get
a 4k HDR TV and I swear I put this I
have that nice like it runs into walls
for me right I used to my TV apps on my
LG my parents just had this like super
complicated setup right they're having
trouble wrangling everything like just
that's cabo yeah when she okay box plugs
into it when we had I had this plugged
into my house during the Olympics mmm
watch NBC and it would switch over and
change the channel and because it can
see the screen I got the channel right
every time which not every University I
have YouTube TV and I can't even just
say a watch what about flex so yeah if
you are running plex on you know one of
these devices it's not a plex server
alright it doesn't have a Plex app built
into it it has no apps built into it the
apps have to run on your Roku or your
Apple TV or what have you
yeah control plex just fine but if you
just have an Nvidia shield I don't think
it won't do all the smart stuff with the
shield I don't think it doesn't work
with Android TV
I don't like it won't do that the API
control the way but if you have an
Nvidia shield you don't need anything
else is what I always say they told me
that fire TV was the hardest one yeah
Amazon sighs doesn't think you're gonna
you know I think Amazon's world view is
like you're gonna plug this into your TV
and that's it yeah and that's the end of
that yeah I think it's true of all the
other devices too all right so that's
the combo thank you for your questions
on it it's the most complicated product
I really appreciate you bringing this
and said I really wanted to do this was
like a lot of work did you even get it
working you know it took I would say two
days in particularly it are set up right
or we have like our switchers and our
HTMI this is gonna be in your house yeah
it's a oh good so here on our network
with our switcher and all that stuff it
was pretty difficult but I'm glad it's
here it's very gadgety I'm eager to see
what the next version of it looks like I
think this version there's a reason I
only saw on 5000 of them right because
they can't make enough of those what the
wood panels they also told me that the
HDMI hardware in here is so hardcore
that there was only one ship supplier
that could do it
ooh so if they have to ramp up the chip
design to do HDR to do all the other
stuff we'll see all right
here's what happened Ash's gonna do a
quick ask circuit breaker we're gonna
field report from MWC from Jake and then
we're gonna come back here Ashley's
going to show us about some smart lights
as Neil I mentioned it's me Ashley hello
how are you guys Jake is not here today
so I'm doing a circuit breaker
all by myself all right we're gonna do
one question today the question is do
you think Huawei can ever make a splash
in the American market so it's been an
interesting year for Huawei this was
supposed to be the year but you guys
weren't aware they're a massive Chinese
smartphone maker they're huge they're up
there with Samsung and Apple it's just
in the US most of us maybe don't even
know who they are we probably can't name
a single device so this year was
supposed to be their year with the mate
10 Pro they've been selling phones
online for years but this year they were
going to get a carrier deal here we're
going to find out who all way is in the
u.s. is going to be big they even at CES
when we were there we saw tons of
banners with the mate time Pro Huawei
was seriously on some serious hype game
and then while we couldn't see us was
really sad
AT&amp;amp;T who was supposed to be their
carrier partner dropped the partnership
and Huawei was kind of just left out to
go to Amazon now add on I believe the
phones sold through Best Buy
so after that happened we've kind of
established some context here for your
question
the NSA the CIA and the FBI were all
like hey also I know a teens he dropped
this carrier thing but you shouldn't buy
a huawei phone or ZT or any other
Chinese smartphone because we don't
trust it
so while we've had a really tough year
even though the mate temp row is
technically available in the US do I
think
the phone will make earth the company as
a whole will make a splash in the US I
think it's possible I think they could
become a household name if they get
those carrier plans because carrier
plans are essential if you want
marketing if you want salespeople to
push your phone you need to be in AT&amp;amp;T
Verizon Sprint wherever those carrier
plans are essential and without that I
don't think Huawei can make a splash and
even if they do get those carrier plans
I am Not sure their devices will be
enough to capture the US market there
you go
that's a circuit breaker make sure you
leave some comments with questions
because next week Jake will be back he
and I will be together once again to
answer questions also you can tweet at
us and ask us questions there okay gonna
send it over to Jake now who is in
Barcelona hey it's Jake I'm here at
Mobile World Congress I've been walking
the floor all day checking out the news
stuff I'm actually here in Samsung's
booth right now you can see it's super
crazy in here this place is huge the
first thing I want to do is show you the
Galaxy S nine I don't want to show you
too much of the phone I just want to
point out this new lilac color because
it is fantastic
more companies needs to make phones in
really bright fun colors like this
because it really stands out and it
looks really good
I want to tell you about a few of the
other really cool things I've seen so
far yesterday I met with Lenovo they
have a new Chromebook that you're able
to use anything as a stylus and so I was
able to take a pencil just a normal
pencil you'd write with and start
dueling on the screen and it works it's
fantastic it's super natural use it that
way the other favorite thing of mine at
this show is that Nokia has
the 8110 which is the slider phone from
the matrix as somebody who was a huge
matrix fan years ago the the nostalgia
is just overwhelming it was so fun
getting to play with this I will say I
wish the sliding action I've been a
little more snappy it was not you know
maybe it's the full extent of my dreams
but it was still super fun and I'm glad
it exists so now we're here at huawei's
booth and I want to show you one of
those ridiculous things that has been
announced here it's really fantastic so
this is the mate 10 Pro it's a laptop
with super thin bezels to thin to put a
webcam in and so the webcam is instead
built into the keyboard as you can see
it pop in and out like that it's
extremely satisfying is extremely weird
the angle is awful for your face but hey
it's the future of laptop webcams it's
wonderful we're gonna be at the show all
week so stay tuned to the verge comm for
more coverage that's it for me back to
you Jake just vlogging his face off put
a camera in the keyboard I love it so
much we saw that one and then there's
that the vivo phone the motorized like
this problem was solved you were just
unsolveds going to get us one way or
hello here is my thought yes we actually
did a story earlier this year I think
there's a trade Auto Show but all the
craziest headlights the Auto Show
because car makers are using LEDs and
now they're just going crazy smart
lights it really just like looked like
regular Oh bulbs because they're trying
to like Trojan horse into your house
Wi-Fi everywhere listening but now it
appears that you have crazy LED smart
lights for us wait like design naturally
I really want to talk to you an expert
about these lights but I want to be
clear realize your theory that cars did
weird lights and someone was like
we can do that in the house I feel like
if your card is on him your job is to be
crazy to work everyday and you're like
hey mr. Ford he's like you're doing any
crazy stuff today Steve like I better
get on it right I think home lighting
designers are like light bulbs we're
good but now now okay that's right
that's why okay
I'm gonna actually start with the most
boring one okay guys we're gonna save
the party stuff for last okay this is
the GE C by GE soul C by GE Soul
yes so like the Sun is just there like
just the letter C just the letter C he
starting on IG P two letters okay so
this is just an LED light it doesn't do
funky colors or anything it is a smart
light it has a LexA built-in and the
base you got some controls here yeah so
you can use voice control it doesn't
play Spotify or anything who doesn't
know this occurs atrocious so I've been
I've had this in my room for a few
months now
Alexa play some music here's a station
you might like just clinton from amazon
music just stop that did sound that it's
really bad like it's horrible um so you
can use one i don't know that
please stop Alexa Alexa stop stop so
you're right that's the other thing is I
turned on the music just one time I was
like I'll try the music I had to scream
at the top of my lungs next cancel yeah
so anyways it only does white light I've
been keeping in my room I don't actually
use Alexa at all because the commands
are totally unintuitive I don't think in
percentages
when I think about lights I'm not like I
want my light at 52% today so I can't
use voice commands for lights this
changes temperature yeah so I'll show
you guys also I had a really fun
notification out here that was telling
me to sync my Sonicare brush with my
phone from last week anyway so here's
the app Paul do you want to you can Paul
cam this is tournament my way just so
you can have different scenes which
seems kind of for one life I don't know
why you can also use the problems other
bulbs but the thing is the only colors
it can do are like you could do warm ok
so you can view like Hospital really
bright so you can see like a yellow
yellow ok so here's like the warmer it's
really bright sorry and then here is the
cool yeah am like super basic these
colors here on the inside are actually a
clock which I could never figure out we
read what does that mean what time is it
Paul I'm looking at this from I only
learned the microwave I mean it appears
to be 645 I'm telling you I couldn't
figure out what I couldn't figure out
how to use this clock ok um anyway this
is now on sale for like 115 dollars just
by a dot it's a lot yeah the thing is I
love the look of it which is why I'm
into it I don't need a LexA hmm I use
the app anyway just give me this no
Alexa and I'm good for maybe 50 bucks I
only paid 50 okay all right I'm gonna
turn this off because it's very rich oh
I see solji so now wait if you don't
have the G it's called the Cecil they
have their own bulbs that are C by GE
okay the sole is a subunit all right
what does it use see this is nice when
the lighting designers are crazy the
LEDs you got a you got to live through
some of this yeah this is why I'll tell
you look angry now alright so what's
going on here alright so now we're
getting a little funkier this is meant
to go on a wall this is from a life ex
it's their beam lights so OH
Adams
someone who's bought a see light it's
far and away the worst product I've ever
yeah thanks
so I don't want to take this apart
because it broke last time but I'll show
you guys this is the beam you can see
the connectors they stick together
through magnets and then these little
pins here talk to each other so no it's
one unit so that the computer is like
down here right and this it's just
sending power and data where's the
computer it's just a little way it's
plugged brick that's this is all the
smarts so that connects over Wi-Fi or
whatever yeah none of these have a hub
and I will say just you saw the Wi-Fi
issues arriving at Aqaba earlier mm-hmm
great okay yeah again this works with
Alexa Google assistant homekit I have
TTT but for demo purposes I'm going to
focus on the app because I think the
apps are where you really get the full
experience so here's our little light
here alright we're gonna dive right in
you can change any color you want
yeah we demo'd am yes we could do that
also
ya know like is our rehearsal or this
thing was very precarious I want to just
yeah gel says pogo pins yes what we're
gonna be showing you for the next
segment of the show is a bunch of hard
work okay so you can see I'm changing
the light here on the actual light yeah
but then it gets fun when you move you
alright well so here is you have to pick
different scenes
okay that's mellow this is mellow which
isn't really mellow this is not mellow
is this like a popsicle there's intense
so you can make any shape you want right
right it can have up to eight beams but
a kit comes with six and they don't sell
them individually so I don't know where
you would find someone else would tell
what that is let's see that is an iPad
Mini let's see I know it it's an ancient
archaeological
I clicked was this energizing yes nope
that wasn't that was energizing okay
it really just affects the palette and
it randomizes where it shows up yeah but
then you can make it like raised right
so in addition to just having these
light effects you can do different
things with it so I can do move which
right now it's really fast you can
change the speed and the direction like
I guess this is correction this is a
thing I've always wanted now so I'm
changing the direction and you could see
is just moving or you can also just make
it go really fast oh no that was really
slow okay because you want to see do not
give anyone to seizures now I'm sorry if
I did Oh apologies um okay
swear spooky what's spooky let's try
spooky let's see spooky says it will
flicker or black out scary I mean I'm
really into these I cannot think of
where everything oh no I'm pretty scared
right now
like forthcoming baby room rave yeah
highlight the crib yeah but you should
use this to highlight things how much
does it cost
this one is two hundred two hundred you
get you get six of them six of them in
two corner PC corners how much is
another set of $600 oh they don't sell
anything separate it's just one set they
don't sell anything by itself seems like
that defeats the point of modularity
right yeah I mean I think they just this
is a new product for them and I think
maybe as they become more established
it'll start flying and you make this
rock to the beat yeah so the next
product will do and then this one is
well both do miss music visualizers so
I'm gonna try that on here I'm turning
it on here is it I really wants us to
plug it into the cup our iPad is
recording right now because it's using
your iPad yes it doesn't have a
microphone built-in so for the music
visualizer part it uses your device's
microphone alright so I'm thinking what
I can play here just hotel cafe that
migas on a console India she'll never
see us
[Laughter]
okay all right I'm gonna go back to the
app it should be on in the bag I'm
trying you can see it's recording up
here no what are these other ones good
and you can obviously Alexa these up
right yeah
Alexa home kid yeah I feel like most
days apps are really bad because
everyone realizes like you set them up
one so then you just want to use Alexa
so they've stops trying to like see I
don't use Alexa though that's my whole
thing is I'm like I like the apps I feel
like I have better control yeah but
that's like if someone says like we
don't have to do a good job on this
bridge cuz everybody's gonna take the
tunnel they're saying that about
everything alright should we try Alexa
to turn these ideas definitely Alexa
turn the lights on in the lounge how do
these attach opens see here there are
these little pieces right and then if I
grab a panel so this can have up to 30
panels okay and you can buy an away and
you can use work so yeah you can slots
in and you just like clip them together
and then you clip them together and
unlike immediately lose those yeah keep
them in a safe spot and unlike these the
lifx ones you have a separate music
visualizer component that has a
microphone built in you can also plug
through a headphone jack
bring back the headphone jack so let's
let's take a look through the app yeah
let's look through this side okay what's
neat about this is
I've worse I can't talk the APUs low or
iPad Mini is just it's really hard to
tell honestly here you can paint again
your panel so it automatically detects
the engine
this one's 230 and that includes I
believe it's I don't know how many
panels that close but includes a music
visualizer
okay these are all for college students
I can't imagine you can make them look
classy so you can sleep with them
okay well now it's all why I'm picking
colors I can put them there it's
beautiful you can change how you do any
color so you have to pick a palette I'm
trying to remember how to get like
web-safe colors yeah they have them can
you enter any arbitrary here they have
I'm how and you can so you can choose
from a bunch of these where if you want
like more of a hunter green approach and
I really have some colors in here now
bunch of these and just make up brown
light on my wall so now I think it will
look better if I do like a scene because
they have it okay so if I go to rhythm I
want to show you guys the dynamic part
which is kind of what we saw over there
where it can move there's like this flow
aspect where it changes you can
alternate the direction it's and how it
goes so this is more for if you want to
be a passive user and just have it
continuously you can affect how fast it
moves things like that see now it's
really cycling through yeah a bunch of
colors now the rhythm part this is
actually what I want to turn off this
yeah okay cause I'm yanking I'm yanking
this guy there it is it's gone gone see
you later okay we're gonna do paint
splatter okay oh so it's reacting to our
voices actually yeah what uh it's
working because we have a little song to
it you sing a song - I'll take Paul cam
hits your eye like a big pizza pie
that's amore Wow
Gordon red nose nose there's differ
effect you can do this is like would you
buy any of these well a lot of money
this is cool I think this is I was just
having it rat to me when I talk I'm a
set this up my didn't work
you're like a master computer and Tron
yeah when I start speaking everyone
knows right here's what I like about
these though is I never wanted a smart
bulb but I like functional lights that
do cool things and add something to your
space like if I'm spending that more
penny more money I want it to look cool
and I wanted to do something different
than just a regular light Ronna bass is
just the video or the panels lag when
they change colors I I don't know it's
gone on your side of this experience it
doesn't feel that light no I don't think
it is I think when you actually play
music it gets weird
wait go over there and do like the snap
or something I don't know if it's in
visual I think I might have just turned
it off visualizer mouth no we're playing
with it earlier it seems these look good
they do look good umm my favorite thing
is that both companies suggest that you
stick these on your wall using 3m
command strips of which feels precarious
well everyone thinks you very good job
singing oh thank you
they want your sound Club oh there's an
amazing karaoke I was hoping you do
you're Taylor Swift I've heard you sing
Romeo and Juliet several songs called
love story which one of these is one to
get Emily Natalie Nana leaf if you want
to go for the party route I actually
have really enjoyed my time with the
soul yeah again if they just got rid of
Alexa I made it a little bit cheaper I
would legit buy it because I'd like to I
think it's a cool piece for your house
put it right next to your Dyson fan yeah
I put it by my circular mirror and it
looks great well I for one cannot wait
for my daughter be a teenager so I can
buy these the coolest 13 years ago it's
gonna be great
we are gonna watch a quick video of Dan
Seifert with the phone with the s9 which
is a Joe well you're all here for ask
your questions about the phone that Hans
him join us we're talk about the
one-year anniversary
show you the switch or answer your s9
questions when I look at a bunch of
switch accessories so check this out
thank you very much Ashley hey this is
Dan from The Verge and this is the new
Galaxy S nine and the galaxy s 9 plus
from Samsung now if you're looking at
these you probably think they look
pretty familiar and that's because they
do they basically look exactly like the
Galaxy s8 from last year except for one
major difference we've been complaining
about the placement of the fingerprint
scanner on the galaxy s 8 since it came
out so for the galaxy s 9 Samsung fixed
it and moved it from next to the camera
to below the camera which is way easier
to reach even on the larger model now
otherwise they are very similar in
design you've got a five point eight
inch display on the s9 six point two
inch display on the s9 plus there's
still Super AMOLED screens there still
have the same high-res displays they
still have the curved sides that Samsung
calls this infinity display that spills
over the edge and simply has actually
made the bezels to say that specials are
the same size but they're a little bit
better mask than last year's model so
they don't quite stand out as much you
still have the power button on the side
you got the volume rocker over here and
then of course there's the big speed
button that hasn't gone anywhere and on
the bottom there's still the headphone
jack which you get on both models a lot
of the new things you can't actually see
but they are appreciated it's got stereo
speakers now so the earpiece speaker
works in conjunction with the bottom
speaker to produce stereo sound the
camera has been new and improved they
don't get into that in a minute it's got
a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor
inside of it there's four gigabytes of
RAM in the small models there's six
gigabytes of RAM in the bigger model
3000 milliamp hour battery here thirty
five hundred million power battery here
both of them a fast charging both of
them FS wireless charging both of them
have ip68 water and dust resistance both
of them have 64 gigabytes of storage
both of them have microSD card slots and
both of them have gigabit LTE so a lot
of those things are familiar to SI
owners
we're back so I my question for you I've
an answer for you max on Twitter asks
will the Galaxy S to have a better
camera than pixel - I'm just putting you
on the spot judging based on what
Samsung has done with these phones my
guess is probably not even with the
aperture stuff I feel like it's not
going in crew I'm really on this - walks
backs walks back it's processing yeah I
think I think they're at the point now
where they make some of the best
hardware yeah a lot of people it's all
on the software side yeah
and Google Google I mean has been
dominating the software side for a while
like they just need a little toggle but
it says process the hell out of it yes
all right
Meccano and our chat says iPhone 6 plus
I'm dying for a smaller phone pixel - s9
or iPhone pixel - if they want the
camera still the best camera out there
yeah I don't know where you are if you
are in the States you're not message
person just slide into that life picture
- is nice because it's one of the few
Slyke typically the big phone gets all
the best camera stuff Google's like we
can do cameras on small phones - also I
mean - Excel has kind of that OLED like
the nice Angeles we can't pretend like
small phone isn't valid desire
okay so Anthony says I think this
conversation interesting cuz every
question we're like the pixel - Anthony
says is just me as a very little talk
about the s9 and I think the answer is
yes well they first off though they
reinvented the photo camera you know
they've got the new Dex thing Adam says
coming from stock Nexus if you've got an
old phone dog here's what you wanted to
you want to load
to touch get out of the we have a
duopoly here they are controlling our
lives and they're taking all of our data
and terrible leaders in a chat he's
asking what color of shoes to spics
beware here's the thing I'd like if
you're watching this wherever you're
watching it hmm in my mind Bixby you
know Samsung's assistant they have
literally read a hardware button on the
phone for but he's not a voiced
assistant it's a dog wearing shoes so if
you could draw a picture of dicks feet
like a cartoon mascot your Samsung send
it to me tweeted me Twitter at reckless
hmm next week we'll show it on the show
the picture has to be family friendly
and the best picture show them all on
the show next week we'll send you
something from the closet if you win
it's up to me I'm I'm the dictator of
this small right Snapdragon 835
Snapdragon 835 new year new Snapdragon
that's that's what we're dealing with
right now if you wait for a camera lens
don't worry about all this these Nokia
phones there's the new 88n a matrix
phone the matrix phone Nokia is just
cashing in on nostalgia to hype up the
fact that HMV global license the name
and they're trying to build some hype
because every launching there's only one
true matrix phone by the way which is
the one from the second Matrix movie
which is a Samsung phone that looks like
a cyborg explode I think this is a good
time to tell you that we do not discuss
any matrix the first matrix opened our
minds to philosophy of reality in the
second and third or what made us grow up
and learn that we can't always have my
station capitalism
anyway speaking of that look we are
obviously going to cover the hell out of
the switch cover the hell is 9 that that
team is still in Barcelona we have way
more covers on the site you can watch
Dan's whole video on YouTube it's
already up Vlad has a piece up he
already has some judgements about the
camera already calling it maybe it's not
so we'll see so keep tuned for that
coverage we have a bunch of other
coverage from MWC Chancellor Mobile
World Congress people are asking in the
chat check that all on the site well I
want to talk about is stuff actual stuff
it's the one-year anniversary switch on
Saturday huge hit for Nintendo games are
just coming out as surprises now for the
switch like just ports of games yeah all
kinds of games you would not normally
see and there's like an accessory
ecosystem because it's a mobile device
so what do we got all right we got lots
of stuff yeah first up this is kind of
your basic most vanilla switch second
accessory this is the pro controller
you've seen this yeah it's not it's like
weirdly disassociated any of the switch
because when you think of as much you
think of you know the switch with the
bright colors and the slide off
controllers but it does make like a
regular controller for it this is like
the this is like the home console
expansion pack yeah this is this is the
alternate universe where this is not the
switch yeah and this is the controller
on the Nintendo so you're really high on
this thing yeah yeah I I almost never
use this I know I've used my switch on
my TV like three times in the entire
year that I've owned it and two of them
were to play Mario Kart with friends
yeah and one of them was to play the
finals absolutely great for Mario Kart
but this is great for my record if you
want to beat your friends
Mario your poor friends either one if
you want the controller advantage that's
great for that here's what I think the
switches on you turn on one of those new
Netflix series they take about six
episodes to ramp up into having a plot
check in yeah I got heirs it's like
it's plot buffering yeah iron-fisted
still walking around doing nothing all
right
I played I played the first switches on
phone yeah you can play switch any
Netflix series goes okay that's per
controller but what if we're actually
not matter yet we're gonna try but our
next step is to try and solve one of
these switches main and biggest flaws
which is the kickstand which is possibly
the worst kickstand ever put on the
technology device what's happening here
so what's happening here this is a third
of the chat is not trolling Deeter and
asking if the switch Hall wrote a piece
someone has hacked Linux on to a switch
true you would like it to be vastly less
functional so this is actually a third
party case we had this in our gift guide
if you wanna like spruce of look your
switch they have them in all sorts of
clear plastic they also make them for
the controllers but they are much harder
to put on yeah you also have voided your
warranty but we're actually looking at
here though is a metal kickstands any
regular kickstand on the switch is awful
it is flimsy plastic it feels good to
use so
Nyko this is literally just a five
dollar piece of aluminum it's metal I
just yanked it out there when it feels
slightly sillier this should be
everyone's first like 3d printing
project yeah I want to get into 3d
printing I don't know what to do it's
such a kick stands but so here's my
thing so this is the other this is the
stock switch kick stock switch to be my
problem is actually not that it's flimsy
it's that it's like yeah it pops out of
here do they solve that problem so no
you can actually just get right off and
you can see when you when you pop this
one off this enough you can kind of see
oh it clicks into this metal thing
know that every time we demonstrate this
we are just breaking off little pieces
of plastic on this one - metal yeah yeah
so if you look on on our on our skeleton
switch over you can see you're literally
just flying into this giant black chunk
of plastic which is why this falls off
every time and there's nothing really
can do about that Nintendo just needs to
build a better one honestly until the
switch gets sailfish OS all right the
kickstand next up is batteries so switch
is great you can use on the go it's gets
you know two three hours of battery life
but that's not enough to get you through
like a flight you know runs out so we
have this which is the Nyko power pack
which shows battery case the battery
case are you kidding what is this
nonsense
it's a chunk of plastic and we're gonna
swap this in charge I usually why don't
you just leave that off why do you need
that cuz I don't know I guess it'll fall
out all right so we're gonna I need I
need the battery to be secure
so it turns on it actually charges by
USB see you nice wonderful
we're finally getting like you may go in
a bold move use this metal kickstand the
metal kickstand is incompatible with
this other Nyko products okay it is
actually worse than they've somehow done
it I scientists have been wondering what
caused this costs like thirty five
dollars
scientists have been wondering could you
build a worse extend than the switch
Nintendo has put basically an Xbox 360
inside of a portable tablet you can know
they can't make a picks I feel like the
people who made this kickstand like this
team was like I wish those kickstand
engineers would come by it's like a we
have no idea what but surprisingly this
actually delivers enough
Howard you charge the switch while
playing games yeah so you're gonna get
an hour to two hours extra battery life
but it's you know kind of small it slips
onto the backyard device you're not
getting like through the roof battery
but if you need a couple you know extra
you get about another extra charge okay
now if you need a lot more charge you
want this this is a full-size anchor USB
battery pack is you are a TV executive
is a USB power delivery is one of these
subsets of the USBC spec for power
it supports much higher rates of power
than other specs it can support up to a
hundred watts us USB CPD you can run
your switch off it and then some that
you're gonna want to see for for switch
or basically any USB see device coming
forward the switcher proof when the
switch came out people kind of surprised
like oh I was charging my phone just
fine but now I can't check my switch
with promises I realize the effort the
surface team putting the kickstand until
I saw the switch you're right but also I
could tell you the iMac g4 is the best
surface accessory that is ever existed
kick stands just as an idea like check
out a cool guy on a cool bike sometime
look at the bike see if he has a
kickstand never has a kick night we're
just talkin oh we hit step how much is
this battery this battery is 120 dollars
here's my concern is a lot can you take
that on a plane because there's a lot of
an argument with the away smart luggage
people yesterday on Twitter because
Delta is
I take the batteries out of your luggage
you there's no weight suitcase is
probably fine yes so this is if you look
closely the fine print over here this is
a ninety six point four eight watt hour
battery pack the limit is a hundred watt
hours you got three ports over here so
when you're not it when you're also on
the go though you're gonna a want to
recharge this and be power of your
switch from a wall
you also want one of these which is a
twenty seven watt anchor twenty seven
twenty seven so it's just under the
tweeters twenty nine yes network charger
cost fifty bucks though this cost likes
for thirteen come on oh you can charge
like the bigger MacBooks that needs just
slow and it'll charge a little slower
but yeah I was using my switch charger
to charge my macbook for everything
again because my charge on my desk which
is like the one time USB C has so it
seems like the interesting accessories
are all about charging this thing yeah
right we have a headphone cable over
there so this is this is a life hack for
the switch because the switch has a USB
CPT but does not have Bluetooth audio
support so the only way to listen to you
know switch music if you want to use
your switch on your TV from a distance
ya can't use bluetooth headphones
unspool this 20-foot cable oh my god and
you're golden
alright not truly a switch accessory
just a very circuit breaker yeah I got a
bunch of cases ranging from the sock
that thing is nasty
so this is our producers like switch go
mag I think everyone understands what
what is this thing this is one of my
biggest disappointments this is a switch
third party switch dock this is the
regular switch dock yes it's big its
bulky it does the job but like it's a
it's a statements to put in front of
your TV there's no like you can't put
this under your TV you can't provide
yeah it's big this is a third party one
that is much smaller it offers more
ports because this is like a giant chunk
of plastic this is all that it does this
is a giant dongle for this huge chunk of
plastic all you're getting is
pass-through power one USB port and HDMI
port its USB ports on the side three USB
pay I I stand corrected
yeah only one of them is use it's a
giant uncle this is the first expression
of the dongle line so what do we got
here so this is miniaturized same port
selection but it's like 1/6 of the size
real there's tons of like hacks out
there this is a real product that ships
No okay the problem is is that it is not
licensed by Nintendo and there were
multiple reports of this yes you can use
usb headphones on the switch you can't
power but you cannot use Bluetooth
headphones the only way to use bluetooth
is if you have headphones that have a
bluetooth USB C dongle and you plug it
into the bottom then you can use
Bluetooth audio through the dongle there
is bluetooth the controller's connect by
bluetooth there's bluetooth on here it's
just Nintendo has blocked it for the
headphones back to this thing so the
problem is is that this has a slight
issue where it has damaged some switches
irrevocably and broken them I mean
people are saying people in the comments
says the official dock easily scratches
the screen I've read this everywhere
yeah has not been the case with my
solution so I know people really care
about this the leader is saying that
there's an hdmi dongle called the fast
snail that works really well over there
deeply cares about this Kenneth says a
super mario odyssey we're buying yes yes
it's really good even okay that goes on
there is this terrifying thing here this
is art this is the company this is
becoming a switch that we've like we're
not gonna break someone's pretty sweet
smile this is horrible
you wanted to take a switch stock on a
go and hook it up to TV it's
Hey did you say that you want a dongle
just I don't like this we've broken
Eli's yuck
right it's not the worst it's the worst
also because you can if you want I'm
gonna break something doing this you can
use that as a stand and actually see the
screen and place width while you're
charging it like this it's an option
looking all this stuff it seems like
really where you want the action to be
is this yeah it has maybe pretty low a
year though and and we're still it's
still very emerging console us PC as the
spec is still young and I'm honestly
happy that Nintendo went with that
instead of just like doing their own
thing which is a very future standard
which is such an uncharacteristic
Nintendo moved you to embrace the future
ahead of schedule is a company that I
still think is honestly not entirely
sure how the internet works
I feel like their Gameboy advanced
multiplayer cables or somehow associated
with the firewire spec if I recall
yes they're in a weird with yes and and
Varon was the issue yes we just gotta
wait for a few more kick starters come
on through John says the back of my
switches horribly scratch because of the
official dock yeah but if the official
dog scratches our screen that's one
thing if this breaks our USB ports so
you can't charge it that's the different
issues yeah this is last one actually
this is the 8-bit
gamepad this actually connects via
bluetooth unlike headphones connects to
the switch it's honestly like a pretty
good portable thing if you want a full
gamepad yeah so the joy come on setting
on the go it also works with Android
Windows and Mac charges by USB C so you
got that see this is this is what Apple
didn't do with the Mac folks like the
switch only has USB
see and it's driving us BC accessories
books on the USBC and that's nothing
yeah so no is driving the USBC
revolution deters us up he would like us
to compare deer bone would like us to
compare this accessory market so one
that existed for the Wii U which is
unfair because no one bought it we you
couldn't really the screen head would
like you were carrying around you
weren't taking it outside also no one
bought over you I bought it with you
okay the best thing I think of is like
the weird Wii Remote accessory market
where you could just get like plastic
things to slider me is it gave me a
years-long
head start practicing for Mario Kart 8
market Mario Kart 8 deluxe get off with
a switch my ringer I just want to see
more battery cases more battery stuff
because that's really what I need out of
this I want to see kickstands big sans
just keep kickstand but then I did buy a
screen protector and I do use a screen
protector on his hands like the first
thing you should I traveled mine
everyday I don't keep the screen
protector here lives live life live life
dangerously Ronis ah here's my question
yeah Nintendo loves to come out with new
slight variations on that on the D s and
the vs they really benefited from the
fact that they were using something kind
of like mobile hardware that kept on
getting smaller and cheaper so they were
able to come out with better versions
the switch is basically mobile hardware
is there is there gonna be a switch you
can have like a mode for like better
graphics or for a longer battery life I
can see it happening it would be a very
gender thing to do yeah alright well we
have gone way over because I love
fighting with this stuff and there's so
much MWC news we have to bring it all up
