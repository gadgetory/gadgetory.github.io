coffee cup and that's how the phone
we're experts jokes
hi I'm Paul Miller hello Ashley and hi
I'm are gonna join us a little bit later
but we're gonna get right into it it's a
gadget show live gadget show we're in
the chat with you we want to answer your
questions so ask away
but there's one gadget this week one
it's in Barcelona it's called the
Samsung Galaxy S 9 Samsung makes phones
now they've done it again for the ninth
time the eighth one they were like no
way both can't get better than this so
we know you all probably a lot of
questions on the s9 we've got a whole
crew of people mm-hmm at Mobile World
Congress but just give me some quick
answers about it stop tracking 8:45 it
looks exactly like the sa but there are
different color ways different it's a
different screen ratio yep 5.0 inch
screen sm + s 6.2 6.2 almost as big as
the node a much bigger cenote it's got a
headphone jack still Hey mmm Samsung can
figure that out no one else can
it's some crazy camera tech no I really
thought it was gonna fingerprint sensor
under the screen this year no we're not
ready for that but they moved the
fingerprint sensor from a weird spot
next to the camera - under the camera
and then like you're saying the bigger
phone has a crazy dual camera system but
it's not doing lots of funds of dual
cameras obviously I have an iPhone
tenure of the dual camera but this one
the second camera has a mechanical
aperture right so it's a wide-angle on a
telephoto and then it can it can go down
from F 2.4 to f1 from F 1.5 to have 2.4
so you get more light in get more or
less shallower depth of field which the
what everybody wants
I think it's mostly for a little I think
they're moved to get more light into the
camera mmm it's to open that aperture to
go to F 1.5 mostly if I tried it Dan
tried it most of what you it runs an F
2.4 it automatically switches there's a
pro mode in the app that you can set it
manually but it mostly automatically
switches and mostly in low light it'll
just open up to F 1.5 to get more light
into the sensor but data it's all right
a few point four here's the thing that's
interesting and I want your questions
about this phone we're gonna be a video
from Dan that we're gonna run later well
answer your questions as best as we can
later on the show like the big open
issue for me
mmm we've done a lot of camera tests
this year mmm the pixel to you by far
the best camera on the market iPhone 10
Sutton in there I have been consistently
saying Samsung's cameras are not as good
because their software processing is so
aggressive well Google is almost doing
the least with the camera the most with
the software and they're getting the
best results right now yeah so will that
be continued to be true so if you're
gonna do all this fancy actual camera
stuff moving your apertures around is
your software just gonna crush that
difference away I mean there's got to be
a point where hard I mean that's why I
have like a digital SLR like a mirror
list but interchangeable lens camera
because I want a big sensor if I can get
low aperture and fancy low depth of
field and it's great I love it but if
phone hardware is not even anywhere
close to that then maybe software still
is the answer
so we'll see the phone just came out
came out we our videos published it like
yesterday basically the teams in
Barcelona they're using it we're gonna
run all evening fingerprint off going up
to every phone of the show just touch
them all so we don't have it it's again
just came out we're gonna run some
hands-on video of the s9 a little bit
later in the show ask us questions both
in the chat and on Twitter use hash tag
sir you're alive we'll try to answer
them throughout the show as we get them
about s9 everything else happening at
MWC but we have a lot of stuff here to
actually show you we've got a packed
show today so we've got the Cobo here
Ashley's gonna join us we've got this
smart light situations very precarious
we just left it set up she's gonna show
us like the future of what's happening
to LED smart lights
hymens going to show us the switch
antenna switch wreaths one-year
anniversary's on Saturday the whole
ecosystem and accessories we're gonna
play with a bunch of those want to take
your questions we're gonna do floor
report such a good show it's a lot going
on and I will say all of our demos are
very precarious starting with this one
so what's this Neal I so I wanted to
have this on the show last week okay but
it was too hard to set this just gonna
get back here this is the Cabo actually
I'm sorry says you push the recommend
moving from si to the s9 I don't know
that's like we got to get it we got to
review it I don't think it's enough
anyway this is the answer more questions
later so keep that's 9 - so this is a
Cabo it's a universal remote system
mm-hmm
they want they want to say a lot of
other things about it I will say just
all things aside having a HDMI switcher
is a very nice yeah so basically the way
I think about it is to solve the problem
of controlling multiple devices you
can't just like have a remote that's
smart anymore or hub you actually have
to control them all so this is an HDMI
switcher it connects to the network and
connects over Wi-Fi mmm it logs into
your services for you it keeps track of
what you're watching on what device mmm
it's just it's amazing like a little
Butler it's like asking your friend to
do complicated remote procedures right
so this is the remote okay we got a plug
in on this TV back here knows what it's
doing
so right now it's ringing this is Amazon
fire TV the CB has emotion smoothing on
this demo is over there's this is the
combo you can see it's got this
interface over the top I can just like
press can cabo turn off motions moving
cabo cannot turn off motions really okay
so this remote it's just like a
universal remote okay it's controlling
this fire TV right which is okay now
here's the crate so it's just basic
universal remote stuff
here's Grayson we've got a Roku what I'm
gonna plug a Roku into this comment okay
see these like crazy posts chromecast
let's plug that why not
so the cabo is smart two new devices no
this should so i set those up okay it's
gonna think about what they are it's
gonna recognize them okay automatically
figure out what they are it's gonna
automatically map this okay and then oh
next this thing is by the way it's
insane it's five hundred dollars this is
so complicated it's this artificial
intelligence or did they just like
painstakingly just so the reason that
you want to plug things into here is it
watches the screen alright so it looks
at what's on the screen so I'll show you
so so you can see here it figured out we
plugged it working on chromecast then I
plugged them into just random ports okay
next you'll test control of all
connected device so that's just switched
over to the Roku keep thinking this
process takes a minute so now it's got
to find the Roku in the network because
it's gonna try to this is probably where
this is gonna fall down okay good I'll
be here
so the way it doesn't just control it
with like IR the way a harmony does and
doesn't just control it with CEC the way
that which is remote messages passed
over HTML right it controls it over
everything so it has an IR blaster it
checks it checks the commands or a CEC
it watches the screen to make the
commands get take in how does it work
with the chrome trust the the chromecast
is a it's never gonna find this Roku
crate and our previous just by freaking
out because we knew this is where I
would fall down or sorry we're we're not
a like a home environment right like in
our office but you set this up in your
home oh wait it just took awhile you
didn't trust it yeah so now it this is
actually great you can see the screen
right now of the room yeah it says test
it it just took a while cuz we're on the
office Wi-Fi here so I kept it works
creating you're going to do this back
there man you got a Cabo Cabo count to 1
7a everybody type in ready to go on the
back so this is logged in to all of your
services so now when you watch a show on
Netflix you pick it up on another device
it'll remember done ok so whatever so
yeah so now we're in ok and you have
like a hybrid interface there's woke ooh
there's Road can act but cabo pops up I
was here so now I can be like watch
altered carbon this is the kaavo search
it's gonna show me the Cabo thing ok and
I can do that or I can push this button
and I can decide which device to search
on this is Blanco so I can say search on
a Roku it what it's doing in the
background because it can see the screen
mmm it's opening the Roku interface and
it typed altered carbon into the Roku
search for me which is insanity
so I can also I don't know why you would
do this on this device but I can go into
settings the Roku and the fire TV are
like very similar ok but I can set if I
only want to watch Netflix on the Apple
TV I can set it to run the Apple TV if I
only want Amazon
so now if I go and set this to Roku I
can do that that's at that one to Roku
so now what's the show on the Amazon is
like the Grand Tour
watch the Grand Tour so at the car show
it's the car show I just know it's on
Amazon so it's you saw that was on on
the Roku interface at that now it's just
operating everything the background and
so switch to the fire TV click through
the fire TV interface for me mm-hmm
it's Barger's to me like I've tried to
fight I'm trying to find just regular
websites like help me find what I can
watch on my different services yeah not
even like a solve problem just like I'm
so impressed this thing is actually
working and then the other thing you can
do
so now here we are in the Amazon we got
this Alexa here okay this echo here it's
listening listening likes to stop
because of because it's bridging and
controlling but you can use Alexa to
control devices that don't normally
support it oh thank you guys actually
control Apple TV you can also control
Roku so you like Alexa tell kaavo to
play stranger things and because we set
playing stranger things because we set
that to happen on the Roku it'll do it
there it is do you have to push the
button oh you have to do a profile it
knows about your Netflix profile so
it'll ask you so now let's push back to
the Roku and play it so these how much
it's doing like it's doing it just fall
over maybe so it could it's very brittle
okay so it fell over for me a bunch the
setup is crazy my wife hates this thing
oh because when it falls down and just
falls down catastrophic ly wait and if I
just if I just press pause it's gonna
pause it for me
yeah the other thing is if you have a
cable box you wanted to support okay
watch comcast x1 box the Dish Network it
will support it it does all that it will
also at night just scroll through your
DVR and read the screen of what's on
your DVR so it has an index of what's on
your DVR so it's just like meta
interface universal remote well it's
like because it can watch the screen it
can do all of this crazy stuff that no
other universal law can do it is $500 it
is it's huge just like look at it it's
monstrous but the best part yeah you can
choose your favorite would finish it's
real silly what is this one call this is
like a maple
chancel get HTR support in the future so
this is the big problem with it does not
support HDR what about 4k
supports 4k but not HDR doesn't support
dolby atmos so for $500 you're locked
inside
pretty limited if you can't grow with
you and to where people are the way I
understand that this is almost like
their trial run like this is just like a
look at what we can do but they're gonna
make something with a little more yeah
you know I interviewed their CEO and
their CTO much times really cool dudes
they're very excited about this product
they have backgrounds in like audio
components and it works for speaker
companies I asked them that you know
their goal is to get this product out
get the technology out in the market
they're only selling 5,000 of them they
don't think this is very midget acquired
I don't think they're trying I think
they're trying to get their stuff
smaller I think they want to make a
newer one that's cheaper that's smaller
most people do not need eight ports or
whatever
what about like a brush a brushed metal
cover everybody that's everyone's next
move obviously I think they're gonna
make a sound bar I think they're
interested in receiver a thing that's
true if you are TV solve the complicated
parts of your home theater so if you
have a smart TV you can't control your
Smart TV apps cuz you can't see the
screen so you know they've got some like
limitations but if you're sort of if
you're like but if you are like me and
you have a chromecast you have an Apple
TV and you have a Roku mmm which is true
at my house they're a monster monster
this thing was just like any other cable
walks over cable walks to this thing
will just like it is easily the best
universal remote I've ever used except
when it breaks and then it's a computer
and then it's an Android computer and
it's like and then your loss and then
your wife is mad at you she does not
like it I'm sold the other thing that's
cool I'm not on this network crating I
think you might be honest Network if you
just launched a cast stream yeah it'll
just they click over automatically in
this remote complaining pause a cast
stream which is not true of all current
like that's the chromecast pain yeah my
big thing is volume every different app
that can cast to my chromecast has a
different way of doing volume yeah it's
real pain yeah so this will just like do
it it is again this thing is very
finicky it wants to be controlled
everything it reads your power state on
your TV okay it I mean it requires you
to have relatively new things and
support HDMI CEC but it will go talk to
everything over the network it'll talk
to your
to your bluetooth if you just airplane
an Apple TV it'll figure it out and
light it out of him because it's
watching the screen all the time what
are these buttons for this play hit all
three of them their arm up beeps oh to
find the something why the remote it's
enhancing but yeah I think if you hold
down all three of them herbs not today
Paul people are saying there's a bypass
HDCP no it doesn't it lives in the
interesting my chain look at the signal
it has to decode at all yeah it's all
kosher so I wouldn't want to put a game
console in this channel all the way and
you would probably get some additional
latency out of this yeah they know Xbox
into it I'm bad at video games so didn't
make a difference to me this is sort
this device is like why we have circuit
breaker I don't think most people should
buy this but it's fundamentally specific
it's such an insane gadget here's the
craziest thing so I was saying it logs
in your services for you
so here it's got Netflix on the screen
it's every night it's displaying this
screen right but virtually over here it
has a web browser open and at night it
logs into Netflix for you and it looks
at what you've been watching in Netflix
so it can update its watchlist crazy it
logs into whatever the api's yeah so
many services don't have api's so every
time they hit a wall they built this
like intense solution to get over the
wall which is wild this is what this is
what hackers do yeah this thing is a
huge hack this is how like people
excrescence is why I lost every eBay
auction is people know it's like all of
everything is out of control
okay it's wild mm but every time they
hit one of these walls that prevented
them from controlling something they
weren't supposed well they built a
solution what would the Roku's amazon's
google's cable boxes have to do to make
this just irrelevant like not even
necessary I don't know I mean I you just
cast it so yeah so Creighton just casted
from because he's on the right network
it just it just switched it just did its
thing and now I can just say
and you see in the corner here it says
chromecast that's so it's just doing its
thing man
no no it's not well okay push play so to
me this is just one of the most
complicated products that I've seen mmm
but if you know like I said if you I
might buy one for my parents you're not
gonna get like I want to get a 4k HDR TV
and I swear I put this I have that nice
like it runs into walls for me right
I used to my TV apps on my LG my parents
just have this like super complicated
setup right they're having trouble
wrangling everything like just s kaavo
yeah which she okay box plugs into it
when we had I had this plugged into my
house during the Olympics mmm watch NBC
and it would switch over and change the
channel and because it can see the
screen I got the channel right every
time which not every University I have
YouTube TV and I can't even just say a
watch deal says what about flex so yeah
if you are running plex on you know one
of these devices it's not a plex server
alright it doesn't have a plex app built
into it it has no apps built into it the
apps have to run on your Roku or your
Apple TV or what have you
yeah control plex just fine but if you
just have an Nvidia shield I don't think
it'll it won't do all the smart stuff
with the shield I don't think it doesn't
work with Android TV
I don't like it won't do that the API
control the way it can with these other
devices but if you have an Nvidia shield
you don't need anything else it's what I
always said they told me the fire TV was
the hardest one really yeah it's just um
Amazon doesn't think you're gonna you
know I think Amazon's world view is like
you're gonna plug this into your TV and
that's it yeah and that's the end of
that yeah I think it's true of all the
other devices too alright so that's the
Cobo thank you for your questions on it
it's the most complicated product I
really appreciate you bringing this and
said I really wanted to do this was like
a lot of work do you even get it work
you know it took I would say two days in
particularly it are set up right or we
have like our switchers and our HTMI
this is on to be in your house yeah it's
a oh good so here on
network with our switcher and all that
stuff it was pretty difficult but I'm
glad it's here it's very gadgety I'm
eager to see what the next version of it
looks like I think this version there's
a reason I only saw in 5000 of them
right because they can't make enough of
those with the wood panels they also
told me that the HDMI hardware in here
is so hardcore that there was only one
ship supplier that could do it
ooh so if they have to ramp up the chip
design to do HDR to do all the other
stuff we'll see all right
here's what happened Ash's gonna do a
quick a circuit breaker we're gonna
field report from MWC from Jake and then
we're gonna come back here Ashley's
gonna show us about some smart lights as
Neal I mentioned it's me Ashley hello
how are you guys
Jake is not here today so I'm doing a
circuit breaker all by myself
all right we're gonna do one question
today the question is do you think
Huawei can ever make a splash in the
American market so it's been an
interesting year for Huawei this was
supposed to be the year but you guys
weren't aware they're a massive Chinese
smartphone maker they're huge they're up
there with Samsung and Apple is just in
the u.s. most of us maybe don't even
know who they are we probably can't name
a single device so this year was
supposed to be their year with the mate
10 Pro they've been selling phones
online for years but this year they were
going to get a carrier deal here we're
going to find out who always in the u.s.
is going to be big they even at CES when
we were there we saw tons of banners
with the mate time Pro Huawei was
seriously on some serious hype game and
then while we could see us was really
sad
AT&amp;amp;T who was supposed to be their
carrier partner dropped the partnership
and Huawei was kind of just left out to
go to Amazon now add on I believe the
phones sold through Best Buy so after
that happened we have to kind of
establish some context here for your
question that NSA the CIA and the FBI
were all like hey also I know 18 he
dropped this carrier thing but you
shouldn't buy a Huawei phone or ZT or
any other Chinese smartphone because we
don't trust it so always had a really
tough year even though the mate temp Pro
is technically available in the US do I
think the phone will make a
the company as a whole will make a
splash in the US I think it's possible I
think they could become a household name
if they get those carrier plans because
carrier plans are essential if you want
marketing if you want salespeople to
push your phone you need to be in AT&amp;amp;T
Verizon Sprint wherever those carrier
plans are essential and without that I
don't think Huawei can make a splash and
even if they do get those carrier plans
I am Not sure their devices will be
enough to capture the US market there
you go
that's a circuit breaker make sure you
leave some comments with questions
because next week Jake will be back he
and I will be together once again to
answer questions also you can tweet at
us and ask us questions there okay gonna
send it over to Jake now who is in
Barcelona hey it's Jake I'm here at
Mobile World Congress I've been walking
the floor all day checking out the news
stuff I'm actually here in Samsung's
booth right now you can see it's super
crazy in here this place is huge the
first thing I want to do is show you the
Galaxy S 9 I don't want to show you too
much of the phone I just want to point
out this new lilac color because it is
fantastic more companies needs to make
phones in really bright fun colors like
this because it really stands out and it
looks really good I want to tell you
about a few of the other really cool
things I've seen so far yesterday I met
with Lenovo they have a new Chromebook
that you're able to use anything as a
stylus and so I was able to take a
pencil just a normal pencil you'd write
with and start dueling on the screen and
it works it's fantastic it's
supernatural use it that way
the other favorite thing of mine at this
show is that nokia has re-released the
8110 which is the slider phone from the
matrix as somebody who is a huge matrix
fan years ago the the nostalgia is just
overwhelming it was so fun getting to
play with this I will say I wish the
sliding action have been a little more
snappy
it was not you know maybe it's the full
extent of my dreams but it was still
super fun and I'm glad it exists so now
we're here at Huawei's booth and I want
to show you one of the most ridiculous
things that has been announced here it's
really fantastic so this is the mate 10
Pro it's a laptop with super thin bezels
to thin to put a webcam in and so the
webcam is instead built into the
keyboard as you can see it pop in and
out like that it's extremely satisfying
is extremely weird the angle is awful
for your face but hey it's the future of
laptop webcams it's wonderful we're
gonna be at the show all week so stay
tuned to the verge comm for more
coverage that's it for me
back to you Jake just vlogging his face
off put a camera in the keyboard I loved
it so much we saw that one and then
there's that the vive foam the motorized
like this problem was solved we were
just solving it he's gonna get us one
way or hello here is my thought yep
we actually did a story earlier this
year I think it was a trade on a show
but all the craziest headlights the Auto
Show because car makers are using LEDs
and now they're just going crazy smart
lights and really just like looked like
regular Oh bulbs because they're trying
to like Trojan horse into your house
Wi-Fi everywhere but now it appears that
you have crazy LED smart lights for us
wait like design actually I really want
to talk to you an expert about these
lights but I want to be clear realize
your theory that cars did weird lights
and someone was like we can't do that in
the house I feel like if your card is on
him your job is to be crazy show up to
work every day and you're like hey mr.
Ford he's like you're doing any crazy
stuff today Steve right like I better
get on it right I think home lighting
designers are like light bulbs we're
good
but now
but now LEDs are everywhere okay that's
right that's why LEDs are okay I'm gonna
actually start with the most boring one
okay guys we're gonna save the party
stuff for last okay this is the GE C by
GE Sol C by GE esel yes
so like the Sun is just there like just
the letter C just the letter C he start
not an IgE to letters okay so this is
just an LED light it doesn't do funky
colors or anything it is a smart light
it has a LexA built-in and the base you
got some controls here yeah so you can
use voice girls it doesn't play Spotify
or anything it doesn't know this occurs
atrocious so I've been I've had this in
my room for a few months now Alexa play
some music here's a station you might
like just clinton from amazon music just
stop that did sound bad it's really bad
like it's horrible um so you can use one
i don't know that
please stop Alexa Alexa stop stop
that's the other thing is I turned on
the music just one time I was like I'll
try the music I had to scream at the top
of my lungs next yeah
so anyways it only does white light I've
been keeping in my room I don't actually
use Alexa at all because the commands
are totally unintuitive
okay I don't think in percentages when I
think about lights I'm not like I want
my light at 52% today so I can't use
voice commands for lights this changes
temperature yeah so I'll show you guys
also I had a really fun notification on
here that was telling me to sync my
sonic hairbrush with my phone from
last week anyway so here's the app Paul
do you want to get Paul cam this is
tournament my wages so you can have
different scenes which seems kind of for
one life exactly I don't know why you
can also use the problems other bulbs
but the thing is the only colors it can
do are like you could do warm ok so you
can do like hospital really bright so
you can see like a yellow ok so here's
like the warmer it's really bright sorry
and then here is the cool yeah am like
super basic these colors here on the
inside are actually a clock which I
could never figure out we read what does
that mean what time is it Paul I'm
looking at this from I only learned the
microwave I mean it appears to be 6:45
I'm telling you I couldn't figure out
what I couldn't figure out how to use
this clock ok um anyway this is now on
sale for like 115 dollars that's just by
a dot it's a lot yeah the thing is I
loved the look of it which is why I'm
into it I don't need a LexA hmm I use
the app anyway just give me this no
Alexa and I'm good for maybe 50 bucks I
only paid 50 okay all right I'm gonna
turn this off because it's very rich oh
I see solji so now wait if you don't
have the G it's called the Cecil they
have their own bulbs that are C by GE
okay the soul is a subunit alright what
does it use see this is when the
lighting designers and crazy the LEDs
you got a you got to live through some
of this yeah this is why I'll tell you
look angry now alright it's going on
here alright so now we're getting a
little funkier this is meant to go on a
wall this is from a life ex it's their
beam lights so Oh
Adam says if someone who's bought a see
light it's far and away the worst
product I've ever yeah thanks so I don't
want to take this apart yes
it broke last time but I'll show you
guys this is the beam you can see the
connectors they stick together through
magnets
mm-hm and then these little pins here
to each other so no it's one unit so
that the computer is like down here
right and this it's just sending power
and data where's the computer it's just
a little light it's plugged in our brick
that's this is all the smarts
so that connects over Wi-Fi or whatever
yeah none of these have a hub and I will
say just you saw the Wi-Fi issues
arriving at the Kaaba earlier mm-hmm
great okay yeah again this works with
Alexa Google assistant homekit I have
TTT but for demo purposes I'm going to
focus on the app because I think the
apps are where you really get the full
experience so here's our little light
here all right we're gonna dive right in
you can change any color you want yeah
we do madam
yes we could do that also yeah no my
good our rehearsal with this thing was
very precarious I want to just yeah jal
says pogo pins yes what we're gonna be
showing you for the next segment of the
show is a bunch of hardware phone okay
so you can see I'm changing the light
here on the actual light yeah but then
it gets fun when you reviewed all right
well so here is you have to pick these
different scenes okay that's a mellow
this is mellow which isn't really mellow
this is not mellow this is like a
popsicle this is crazy
here's intense so you can make any shape
you want right right it can have up to
eight beams but a kit comes with six and
they don't sell them individually so I
don't know where you would find someone
else what that is that is an iPad Mini
let's see no it's an ancient
archaeological artifact yes that wasn't
that was energizing okay it really just
affects the palette and it randomizes
where it shows up yeah but then you can
make it like raised right so in addition
to just having these light effects you
can do different things with it so I can
move which right now it's really fast
you can change the speed and the
direction like I guess this is
correction this is the thing I've always
wanted now some changing the direction
and you could see is just moving or you
can also just make it go really fast oh
no that was really slow okay because you
want to see do not give anyone to
seizures now I'm sorry if I did Oh
apologies um okay swirl or spooky what's
spooky
let's try spooky let's see spooky says
it will flicker or black out scary I
mean I'm really into these I cannot
think of where I'm pretty scared right
now
like forthcoming baby room rave yeah
highlight the crib yeah but you should
use this to highlight things how much
does it cost
this one is two hundred two hundred you
get you get six of them six of them in
two corner PC corners how much is
another set of $600 oh they don't sell
anything separate it's just one set they
don't sell anything by itself seems like
that defeats the point of modularity
right yeah I mean I think they just this
is a new product for them and I think
maybe as they become more established
it'll start flying and you make this
rock to the beat yeah so the next
product will do and then this one as
well both do miss music visualizers so
I'm gonna try that on here I'm turning
it on
here's it I really wants us to plug it
into the cup our iPad is recording right
now because it's using your iPad yes it
doesn't have a microphone built-in so
for the music visualizer part it uses
your device's microphone alright so I'm
thinking what I can play here just hotel
cafe that make this on a console Indian
show mercy
okay you know I'll put me goes on all
right I'm gonna go back to the app it
should be on another circuit ringing
them out in the bag I'm trying and if
you can see it's recording up here what
are these good good you can obviously
Alexa these up right yeah Alexa home Kay
yeah I feel like most days apps are
really bad because everyone realizes
like you set them up once and then you
just want to use Alexa so they've stops
trying to like see I don't use Alexa
though that's my whole thing is I'm like
I like the apps I feel like I have
better control yeah but that's like if
someone says like we don't have to do a
good job on this bridge cause
everybody's gonna take the tunnel
they're saying that about everything all
right
should we try Alexa to turn these on
yeah just for fun yeah definitely
Alexa turn the lights on in the lounge
yeah how do these attached see here
they're these little pieces and then if
I grab a panel so this can have up to 30
panels okay and you can buy an away and
you tell these works yeah you're
speaking slots in and you just like clip
them to go and then you clip them
together and unlike immediately lose
those yeah keep them in a safe spot and
unlike these the lifx ones you have a
separate music visualizer component that
has a microphone built and you can also
plug through a headphone jack headphone
jack so let's let's take a look through
the app yeah let's look through this app
okay
what's neat about this is that worse I
can't tell if the app is slow or our
iPad Mini is just anxious it's really
hard to tell honestly here you can
paint okay your panel so it
automatically detects the engine this
one's 2:30 and that includes I believe
it's like I don't know how many panels
that includes but includes the music
visualizer okay these are all for
college students I can't imagine you can
make them look classy so you can't eat
with them okay well now it's all why I'm
picking colors I can put them there
beautiful you can change how can you do
any color so you have to pick a palette
I'm trying to remember how to get like
web-safe colors yeah they have them all
can you enter any arbitrary so here they
have I'm Howlin thinkin so you can
choose from a bunch of these where if
you want like more of a hunter green
approach and I really have some colors
in here now bunch of these makeup brown
light on my wall so now I think it'll
look better if I do like a scene because
they have it okay so if I go to rhythm I
want to show you guys the dynamic part
which is kind of what we saw over there
where it can move there's like this flow
aspect where it changes you can
alternate the direction it's and how it
goes so this is more for if you want to
be a passive user and just have it
continual you can affect how fast it
moves things like that see now it's
really cycling through yeah a bunch of
colors now the rhythm part this is
actually I want to turn off this yeah
okay cause I'm yanking I'm yanking this
guy there it is it's going done see you
later okay we're gonna do paint splatter
okay oh so it's reacting to our voices
actually yeah what uh it's working
because we have a song to it you sing a
song to it I'll take Paul cam hits your
eye like a big pizza pie that's amore
Wow gorgeous red like a nose nose
there's different effects you can do
that's why this is like a rave would you
buy any of these well a lot of money
this is
cool I think this is I was just having
it react to me when I talk i'ma set this
up my best work you're like a master
computer and Tron yeah when I start
speaking everyone knows right here's
what I like about these though is I
never wanted a smart bulb but I like
functional lights that do cool things
and add something to your space like if
I'm spending that more if I'm spending
more money I want it to look cool and I
wanted to do something different than
just a regular light Pranab ass is just
a video or the panels lag when they
change colors I I don't know it's gone
on your side of this experience it
doesn't feel that light no I don't think
it is I think when you actually play
music it gets weird
wait go over there and do like the snap
or something I don't know if it's in
visual I think I might have just turned
it off visualizer mode no we were
playing earlier it seems written these
look good they do look good
my favorite thing is that both companies
suggest that you stick these on your
wall using 3m command strips of which
feels precarious well everyone thanks
you very good job singing oh thank you
they want your SoundCloud oh there's an
amazing karaoke okay I was hoping you do
you're Taylor Swift I've heard you sing
Romeo and Juliet
several times the song's called love
story which one of these is want to get
definitely Natalie Nano leave if you
want to go for the party route I
actually have really enjoyed my time
with the soul yeah again if they just
got rid of Alexa I made it a little bit
cheaper
I would legit buy it because I've liked
it I think it's a cool piece figured
I'll put it right next to your Dyson fan
yeah I put it by my circular mirror I
know it's great well I for one cannot
wait for my daughter be a teenager so I
can buy these cool 13 years ago it's
gonna be great we are gonna watch a
quick video of Dan Seifert with the
phone with the s9 which oh well you're
all here for ask your questions about
the phone that Heinz him join us we're
talk about the one-year anniversary of
the switch or an answer your s 9
questions when I look at a bunch of
switch accessories so check this out
thank you very much Ashley
okay this is Dan from the verge and this
is the new Galaxy S nine and the Galaxy
S nine plus from Samsung now if you're
looking at these you probably think they
look pretty familiar and that's because
they do they basically look exactly like
the Galaxy s8 from last year except for
one major difference we've been
complaining about the placement of the
fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy s8
since it came out so for the Galaxy S
nine Samsung fixed it and moved it from
next to the camera to below the camera
which is way easier to reach even on the
larger model now otherwise they are very
similar in design you've got a 5.8 inch
display on the s9 6.2 inch display on
the s9 plus there's still Super AMOLED
screens there still have the same
high-res displays they still have the
curved sides that Samsung calls us
infinity display that spills over the
edge and simply has actually made the
bezels the same that's puzzles are the
same size but they're a little bit
better mask than last year's model so
they don't quite stand out as much you
still have the power button on the side
you got the volume rocker over here and
then of course there's the big speed
button that hasn't gone anywhere
and on the bottom there's still the
headphone jack which you get on both
models a lot of the new things you can't
actually see but they are appreciated
it's got stereo speakers now so the
earpiece speaker works in conjunction
with the bottom speaker to produce
stereo sound the camera has been new and
improved they don't get into that in a
minute it's got a Qualcomm Snapdragon
845 processor inside of it there's four
gigabytes of RAM in the small model
there's six gigabytes of RAM in the
bigger model 3000 milliamp hour battery
here thirty five hundred million power
battery here both of them at fast
charging both of them fast wireless
charging both of them have IP 68 water
and dust resistance both of them have 64
gigabytes of storage
both of them have microSD card slots and
both of them have gigabit LTE so a lot
of those things are familiar to s8
owners we're back so I my question for
you I have an answer for you max on
Twitter asks will the Galaxy S to have a
better camera than pixel 2 I'm just
putting you on the spot judging based on
what Samsung has done with these phones
my
is probably not even with the aperture
stuff I feel like it's not going to
improve I'm really ivory on listens to
walks backs walks back it's processing
yeah I think I think they're at the
point now where they make some of the
best hardware yeah a lot of people use
it's all on the software side yeah and
Google Google I mean has been dominating
the software side for a while like they
just need a little toggle button it says
process the hell out of it yes or no
all right Meccano and our chat says
iPhone 6 plus I'm dying for smaller
phone pixel 2s9 or pixel tube than what
the camera it's still the best camera
out there yeah I don't know where you
are if you are in the States or iMessage
person just slide into that life
pixie to is nice because it's one of the
few like typically the big phone gets
all the best camera stuff Google's like
we can do cameras on small phones so I
mean the Excel has kind of that OLED
like the nice we can't pretend like
small bone isn't a valid desire
okay so Anthony says I think this
conversation interesting cuz every
question we're like the pixel - Anthony
says is just me as a very little talk
about the s9 and I think the answer is
yes well they first off though they
reinvented the photo camera they were
invented you know they've got the new
decks thing someone has it Adam says
coming from stock Nexus if you've got an
old phone dog is any better than
TouchWiz here's what you want to do you
want to load it to touch get out of the
we have a duopoly here they are
controlling our lives and they're taking
all of our data and terrible leaders in
the chat he's asking what color shoes to
spics beware
here's the thing
if you're watching this wherever you're
watching it hmm in my mind Bixby you
know Samsung's assistant they have
literally read a hardware button on the
phone for but he's not a voice assistant
it's a dog wearing shoes
so if you could draw a picture of big
speed like a cartoon mascot your Samsung
send it to me tweeted me tweeter at
reckless hmm next week we'll show it on
the show the picture has to be family
friendly and the best picture show them
all on the show next week we will send
you something from every closet if you
win it's up to me I'm I'm the dictator
of this small right Snapdragon 835
Snapdragon 835 new year new Snapdragon
that's that's what we're dealing with
right now if you wait for a reason
camera lens don't worry about all this
these Nokia phones there's the new 88n a
matrix phone the matrix phone Nokia is
just cashing in on nostalgia to hype up
the fact that HMV global license the
name and they're trying to build some
hype because every launching there's
only one true matrix phone by the way
which is the one from the second Matrix
movie which is a Samsung phone that
looks like a cyborg explode I think this
is a good time to tell you that we do
not discuss any matrix the first matrix
opened our minds to philosophy of
reality in the second and third or what
made us grow up and learn that we can
always have many way speaking of that so
look we are obviously gonna cover the
hell out of the switch cover the hell
out of that that team is still in
Barcelona we have way more covers on the
site you can watch Dan's whole video on
YouTube it's already up
Ladd has a piece up he already has some
judgments about the camera RDS is
already calling it may be that it's not
so we'll see so keep tuned for that
coverage we have a bunch of other
coverage from MWC sensor Mobile World
Congress people are asking in the chat
check that all on the site well I want
to talk about this stuff actual stuff
let's chat it's the one-year anniversary
switch on Saturday huge hit for nintendo
games are just coming out as surprises
now for the switch like just ports of
games yeah all kinds of games you would
not normally see and there's like an
accessory ecosystem because it's a
mobile device so what do we got
alright we got lots of stuff yeah first
up this is kind of your basic most
vanilla switch tech accessory this is
the pro controller you've seen this yeah
it's not it's like weirdly disassociated
any of the switch because when you think
of as much you think of you know the
switch with the bright colors and the
slide off controllers but Nintendo does
make like a regular controller for it
this is like the this is like the home
console expansion pack yeah this is this
is the alternate universe where this is
not the switch yeah and this is the
controller on the Nintendo so you're
really high on this thing yeah yeah I I
know I almost never use this I know I've
used my switch on my TV like three times
in the entire year that I've owned it
and two of them were to play Mario Kart
with friends yeah and one of them was to
play the final bosses oh absolutely
great for Mario Kart but this is great
for my record if you want to beat your
friends or your poor friends either one
if you want the controller advantage
that's great for that here's what I
think the switches on you turn on one of
those new Netflix series they take about
six episodes to ramp up into having a
plot it's like it's plot buffering yeah
Iron Fist is still walking around doing
nothing
alright I played I played the first get
to work switch the switches are switched
the switches on the phone yeah
as the Netflix you can play switch well
any Netflix series goes okay so that's
for controller but what if we're
actually not matter yet we're gonna try
but our next step is to try and solve
one of these switches main and biggest
flaws which is the kickstand which is
possibly the worst kickstand ever put on
the technology device what's happening
here so what's happening here this is a
third of the chat is not trolling Deeter
and asking if the switch Hall wrote a
piece
someone has hacked Linux on to a switch
it's true you would like it to be vastly
less functional so this is actually a
third-party case we had this in our gift
guide if you wanna like spruce of look
your switch they have them in all sorts
of clear plastic they also make them for
the controllers but they are much harder
to put on yeah
you also have voided your warranty but
we're actually looking at here though is
a metal kickstands any regular kickstand
on the switch is awful it is flimsy
plastic it feels good to use so Nyko
this is literally just a five dollar
piece of aluminum it's metal I just
yanked it out there when it feels
slightly sillier this should be
everyone's first like 3d printing
project yeah I want to get into 3d
printing I don't know what to do it's
social kickstands but so here's my thing
so this is the other this is just the
stalks which cake stocks which my
problem is actually not that it's flimsy
it's that it's like yeah it pops out of
here do they solve that problem so now
you can actually just write off and you
can see when you when you pop this one
off this enough you can kind of see oh
it clicks into this metal thing every
time we demonstrate this we are just
breaking up little pieces of plastic on
this one - metal yeah cuz the metals
harder than the plastic yeah so if you
look on on our on our skeleton switch
over you can see you're literally just
sly into this giant black chunk of
plastic which is why this falls off
every
and there's nothing really can do about
that Nintendo just needs to build a
better one honestly until the switch
gets sailfish OS alright so it's the
kickstand next up is batteries so switch
is great you can use on the go it's gets
you know two three hours of battery life
but that's not enough to get you through
like a flight you know runs out so we
have this which is the Nyko power pack
which does a battery case the battery
case
are you kidding what is this nonsense I
saw chunk of plastic and I'm gonna slap
this in charge why don't you just leave
that off why do you need that cuz I
don't know I guess it'll fall out all
right so we're gonna I need I need the
battery to be secure so it turns on it
actually charges by USB see you Oh
wonderful we're finally getting like you
Mako in a bold move use this metal
kickstand the metal kickstand is
incompatible with this other Nyko
products okay it is actually worse than
I mean they've somehow done it I
scientists have been wondering this
costs like 35 I just have been wondering
could you build a worse
extend than the switch Nintendo has put
basically an Xbox 360 inside of a
portable tablet you can I feel like the
people who made this kickstand like this
team was like I wish those kickstand
engineers would come by it's like a
we've no idea what but surprisingly this
actually delivers enough powered you
charge the switch while playing games so
you're gonna get an hour to two hours
extra battery life but it's you know
kind of small it slips onto the back of
your device you're not getting like
through the roof battery but if you need
a couple you know extra you get about
another extra charge out of it okay now
if you need a lot more charge
you want this this is a full-size anchor
my friends you are a TV executive is a
USBC power delivery is one of these
subsets of the USBC spec for power
it supports much higher rates of power
than other specs it can support up to a
hundred watts us USB CPD you can run
your switch off it and then something
that you're gonna want to see for for
switch we're basically any USB see
device coming forward the switcher proof
when the switch came out people kind of
surprised like oh I was charging my
phone just fine but now I can't check my
switch with promises I realize effort
the surface team putting the kickstand
until I saw the switch you're right but
also I could tell you the iMac g4 is the
best surface accessory that is ever
existed kick stands just as an idea like
check out a cool guy on a cool bike
sometime look at the bike see if he has
a kickstand never has a kick night we're
just we hit step how much is this
battery this battery is 120 dollars here
is my concern is a lot can you take that
on a plane because there's a lot an
argument with the away smart luggage
people yesterday on Twitter because
Delta is like take the batteries out of
your luggage you there's no weight
suitcase is probably fine
yes so this is if you look closely at
the fine print over here this is a
ninety six point four eight watt hour
battery pack the limit is a hundred watt
hours
right under the wall you get this you
can power your switch switch power your
laptop you got three ports every year so
when you're not when you're also on the
go though you're gonna a want to
recharge this and B power your switch
from a wall
you also want one of these which is a 27
watt anchor 27 27 so it's just under the
tweeters 29 yes network charger cost 50
bucks though this cost likes 413 come on
yeah oh you can charge like the bigger
MacBooks that needs just slow and it'll
charge a little slower but yeah I was
using my switch charger to charge my
MacBook for everything again because my
charge on my desk which is like the one
time USB C has so it seems like the
interesting accessories are all about
charging this thing yeah right we have a
headphone cable over there so this is
this is a life hack for the switch
because this which has a USB cbt but
does not have Bluetooth audio support so
the only way to listen to you know
switch music if you want to use your
switch on your TV from a distance ya
can't use bluetooth headphones unspool
this 20-foot cable oh my god and you're
golden
alright not truly a switch accessory
just a very circuit breaker yeah I got a
bunch of cases ranging from the sock
that thing is nasty
so this is our producers like switch go
mag
I think everyone understands what what
is this thing this is one of my biggest
disappointments this is a switch third
party switch dock this is the regular
switch dock yes it's big its bulky it
does the job but like it's a it's a
statements to put in front of your TV
there's no like you can't put this under
your TV you can provide the TV yeah it's
big this is a third party one that is
much smaller it offers more ports
because this is like a giant chunk of
Placido this is all that it does this is
a giant dongle for this huge chunk of
plastic all you're getting is
pass-through power one USB port and an
HDMI port two USB ports on the side
0:03 USP pay I I stand corrected
yeah only one of them's use it's a giant
uncle this is the first expression of
the dongle line so what do we got here
so this is me trying st. port selection
but it's like 1/6 of the size there's
tons of like hacks out there this is a
real product that ships no okay
the problem is is that it is not
licensed by Nintendo and there were
multiple reports of this yes you can use
usb headphones on the switch you can't
power but you cannot use Bluetooth
headphones the only way to use bluetooth
is if you have headphones that have a
bluetooth USBC dongle and you plug it
into the bottom then you can use
Bluetooth audio through the dongle there
is Bluetooth the controller's connect by
bluetooth there is bluetooth on here
just Nintendo has blocked it for the
headphones back to this thing so the
problem is is that this has a slight
issue where it has damaged some switches
irrevocably
and broken them people are saying in the
comments says the official doc easily
scratches the screen I've read this
everywhere
yeah has not been the case yet so I know
people really care about this dieter is
saying that there's an HDMI dongle
called the fast snail that works really
well I would need or deeply care about
this Kenneth says a Super Mario Odyssey
worth buying
yes yes it's really good even okay that
goes on there is which this is
terrifying this is art this is the
company this is a company switch that
we've like break someone's smile this is
horrible
okay you want to take a switch talk on a
go and hook it up to TV it's not did you
say that you want a dongle just I don't
like this we've broken you eyes yuck
right it's not the worst it's the worst
also because you can if you want I'm
gonna break something doing this you can
use that as a stand and actually see the
screen and place switch while you're
charging it like
yeah it's an option all this stuff it
seems like really where you want the
action to be is this yeah and it has
yeah I mean it's so many pretty low a
year though and and we're still it's
still very merging console us BC as the
spec is still young and I'm honestly
happy that Nintendo went with that
instead of just like doing their own
thing which is a very future standard
which is such an uncharacteristic
Nintendo move to to embrace the future
ahead of schedule is a company that I
still think is honestly not entirely
sure how the internet works
I feel like they're Gameboy advanced
multiplayer cables or somehow associated
with the fire where I recall yes they're
in a weird with and and varan was the
issue yes this is we just gotta wait for
a few more kick starters come on through
John says the back of my switches
horribly scratch because of the official
dog yeah but if the official dog
scratches your screen that's one thing
if this breaks your USB ports so you
can't charge it
that's the different issue yeah this is
last one actually this is the 8-bit OH
gamepad this actually connects via
bluetooth
unlike headphones connects to the switch
it's honestly like a pretty good
portable thing if you want a full
gamepad yeah so the droid con on
something on the go
it also works with Android Windows and
Mac charges by USB C so you got that see
this is this is what a sittings to with
the Mac books like the switch only has
USB see and it's driving us PC
accessories us PC and that's it nothing
yeah so no is driving the USBC
revolution split port
deters us up in the chat he would like
us to compare dear Brown would like us
to compare this accessory market so one
that existed for the Wii U which is
unfair because no one bought it we you
couldn't really the screen head would
like a 30 you weren't carrying it around
you weren't taking it outside also no
one bought over you I bought it with you
okay the best I can think of is like the
weird Wii Remote accessory market where
you could just get like plastic things
to slider me is it gave me a year's long
head start practicing for Mario Kart 8
market Mario Kart 8 deluxe get off with
a switch my ringer I just want to see
more battery cases more battery stuff
because that's really what I need out of
this I want to see kicks dance big sands
just keep kickstand but then I did buy a
screen protector and I do you know has a
screen protector on his hands like the
first thing you should I traveled mine
everyday I don't keep the screen
protector here lives live life live life
dangerously Ronis my questions yeah
Nintendo loves to come out with new
slight variations on that on the D s and
the vs they really benefited from the
fact that they were using something kind
of like mobile hardware that kept on
getting smaller and cheaper so they were
able to come out with better versions
the switch is basically mobile hardware
is there is it gonna be a switch you can
have like a mode for like better
graphics or for a longer battery life I
can see it happening it would be a very
