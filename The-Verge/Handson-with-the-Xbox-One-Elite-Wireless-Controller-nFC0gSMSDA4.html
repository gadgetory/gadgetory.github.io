controller this is the high-end
controller that Microsoft will be
releasing later this year and it is nice
all of the parts are interchangeable
magnetized released the joysticks are
and they feel surprisingly great you
would think that when you're able to pop
them off like that that they'll be loose
while you're actually playing the game
but now they're they're pretty sturdy
the d-pad is also removable so if you're
into fighting games or retro games you
can swap it out for that little
doohickey all of the traditional buttons
that you may use you can be assigned to
these paddles on the back so if you use
say the select button or whatever
they're calling it now a whole lot you
can assign it back here so it's easier
to use there's an option to change the
sensitivity the triggers right here and
one more thing you can do a whole remap
of the controller and assign it between
different modes on the controller so
maybe one is your traditional controller
mode and qu is where you keep your
presets overall it's really nice it's
also a 150 dollars is $150 nice for
someone like myself who maybe has a
problem and plays video games
shoot too much yeah yeah you know what I
think it is it's the the lambo of
controllers I guess and I am going
through my quarter life crisis and I'm
going to buy this if you want to see
more things like this and knights and
children go to the verge calm we have
sucked all week about e3 2015 or go and
