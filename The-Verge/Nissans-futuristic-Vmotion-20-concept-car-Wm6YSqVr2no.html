the 2017 Detroit Auto Show and behind me
is Nissan's new sedan concept the
vmotion 2.0 this isn't a typical concept
car full of amazing but ultimately
meaningless specs and crazy power
numbers instead it's all about design
and what nissan says will be the design
direction for its next generation of
self-driving cars this looks straight
out of Minority Report or iRobot new
screens designed for self-driving
systems have been a theme of recent
concept cars and this is no different an
ultra-wide one-piece instrument cluster
and infotainment system are designed for
Nissan pro pilots self-driving system
and both driver and passenger can see
everything that's displayed rear seat
passengers have a smaller screen on the
back of the center console that can show
similar information the lighting around
the Nissan emblem on the front grille
and the rear diffuser glows when the car
is in autonomous mode signaling to other
drivers and pedestrians that the
computer is in control it's something
we've seen before as car makers try to
figure out how self-driving cars will
communicate with the outside world right
up front is the V motion grille but
instead of being limited to just the
nose Nissan's designers have stretched
the veal on the entire length of the car
the crease creates a sharp edge that
runs along the doors and right to the
rear deck suicide doors which likely
won't make it to Nissan's next line up
up sedans give the cabin an airy
spacious feel and most importantly makes
it easy for photographers to see the
entire interior Nissan describes the V
motion with designer language like
emotional geometry and gliding wing
design theme but my reaction is more
basic I just think it looks good for the
first time last quarter Nissan's trucks
and SUVs outsold it sedans I'm a fan of
the current Nissan Maxima and if this is
the future of that bar and it looks like
it will be sedans might not be on the
way out after all
