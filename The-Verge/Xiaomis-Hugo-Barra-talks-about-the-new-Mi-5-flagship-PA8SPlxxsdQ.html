World Congress 2016 in Barcelona I am
supposed to be talking to Hugo Barra
from Xiaomi but he is yeah hey lad hi
sorry I'm running a little bit behind
everyone loading for me 5 so you know
it's been a busy day this is uh this is
the ninebot meaning it's actually one of
our products it's right now only
available in China but I figured I would
bring one along with me helps me get
around you don't call the hover buddy
this is not a hoverboard to be clear
this is an eyeball good but that's not
what we're here to talk about we had
talked about the me five but also it's
it's a menses occasion for you guys
because you're at Mobile World Congress
in Barcelona and you're primarily
Chinese company so first I wanted to let
you guys introduce yourselves like who
is yummy tell the world about Soze sure
first of all thanks for coming here and
for having us so show me it's an
interesting company that's a combination
of hardware software services as well as
ecommerce so we started off as a company
making and mobile operating system
called me UI which is built on top of
Android and it's been around for almost
six years now it was a very first thing
we did a year after launching new UI we
launched our first phone and the thought
there was simple how can we get new UI
into the hands of as many people as
possible so we have always been thinking
about hardware as a distribution vehicle
for the software software which includes
platform services which of course we
monetize so think of us more as an
Internet company a mobile Internet
company that monetizes on digital
content advertising instruments
and then ecommerce is our sales job in
fact it's our own e-commerce we are the
third largest e-commerce company in
China and we only sell our own products
through that channel yeah that allows us
to sell direct to consumer we have a
direct relationship with a consumer we
don't have intermediaries so we don't
have to pay commissions and so on and so
forth so all of it supports this one
business model which is to be a mobile
internet company let me ask you you
mentioned that your hardware store isn't
built into the phone and that's a big
deal for you but also browsing around
the interface there I noticed that your
serve Google's Play Store in there
that's right which doesn't figure in
China in China is your biggest market so
in a roundabout way what I'm trying to
get at is you have the Play Store on
there because this isn't just a phone
for China
we know you have India's the second
market and you said there will be other
markets and then the crowd kind of
laughed because you're hinting at
something more and I think your presence
here at MWC is hinting at something more
and something more global so can you
tell us more on that front
sure so to be clear on Google Play and
Google services we are very close
partner of Google's and we distribute
GMS as we call it in every market
outside of time yeah which is wherever
they are available we don't include
Google's apps in our China build right
so what we're what we're playing with
here today is our international build
which is what goes to India and all
these other markets of course our main
focus for me five are our existing
markets including India and other
markets you know Hong Kong Singapore etc
etc there's quite a few of them because
those are the markets were already
present we already have fans they are
clamoring for this product and of course
we have other markets on our radar
screen but it's far too early to make
any statements you know me five is not
launching outside of our of our core
markets but we're starting to keep our
eyes open we're starting to build our
brand we came to NWC as a global
platform because we're building up to an
eventual launch and we have no idea when
it will happen
still working towards that really very
very very sharply focus on a few markets
or no especially India but one day one
day yeah
one day Europe one day the United States
hopefully it will get to both of those
it's just too early to tell me okay and
and I actually don't know I am not
withholding information but it's it's
too early in the process to even be able
to predict when it might happen I
understand well just from my perspective
I feel like you've had a successful
debut here at MWC you've wowed a lot of
people you impress me and I felt often
talking about the phone because we
already did a big hands-on video and
people can go and see it on the verge
calm internet so me five
you know Xiaomi has heard this
reputation which you're not happy with
I'm sure for copying Apple products but
you know I look at this phone and there
is none of that like you've done your
own unique industrial design you did a
whole excellent presentation you know we
love the fact that he got really geeky
and down into the details if anything it
reminds me more of Samsung's designs
with the Galaxy series so yeah tell us a
little bit about how you came came up
with the design you also said it took
you two years to put it all together
yeah so the story started thank you for
saying that by the way it is actually
very touching to hear that I'm from own
industry expert like yourself it started
with me note which was a 5.7 inch
flagship that we launched almost exactly
a year ago romina which was me know was
the first phone the first smartphone to
introduce a 3d curved glass back design
which some phones this year have but to
be very clear that was a design that we
need to reduce last year with me notes
the other thing that we had with me note
was this notion of even though you have
a very thin body slim body you can still
have a flat camera that's flush you know
on top of the the rear part of the
device and it's also tucked in on the
corner so the the main design lines for
me five are the ones we introduced we
mean of course we made them better but
we also had to work extra hard to fit it
all into a much smaller form factor
so this you can safely now say is our
signature design right it is curved 3d
body in fact there's a ceramic version
which are holding right there the way
that we integrate the camera it's not
sticking out it's not in the center of
the device it's very very elegant and I
think people are really gonna start to
look at phones out there and say huh
that looks like a xiaomi phone
really I do believe that I do believe
that this is going to happen because we
are pioneers with this particular kind
of design we're already seeing it this
year yeah I mean I am not aware of
Sherry's recognition in China I don't
spend that much time in China so I'll
take your word for that on the ceramic
playing around with it it feels a bit
more substantial than the class version
pursue the dimensions of it are
unchanged and this is going to be a pro
model so that comes with 128 gigabytes
of storage yeah 4 gigabytes of RAM but
otherwise it's unchanged is there
anything about the ceramic material that
makes it different other than the fact
that it just looks different so it's if
you look at the hardness moss scale the
ceramic the zircon ixora m'q that we're
using is an 8 diamond is of course a 10
it's the hardest on that scale and but
still is only a 4 glass regular glass is
somewhere in between but ceramic is much
much sort of more resistant to abrasion
than any of the other materials it's
more expensive to make and you can
imagine how expensive heavy even a 3d
surface like this would be especially
more so with Zurich it's 75% more
expensive but it's also takes a lot more
work to make it the process takes hours
and of course there's the first time
we're doing it so we are hoping that
we're going to perfect it and perhaps
make it cheaper for future models but
you're right it just feels pretty unique
and that's the thing like you just
described a very involved process but
even this the pro motto is something
like 350
that's right which is crazy to us and
and I think is from a Western
perspective I think I've been speaking
for a lot of our readers when I say that
we want that price and we want that
quality and those materials and
everything else yeah just somewhere
where we can actually buy it so I mean
that builds up to really the final
question we want to ask of you which is
what should we expect from gem in the
future so I think first of all you're
going to continue to see us taking a
leadership position in areas where
perhaps people weren't expecting us like
mobile phone design industrialism this
is just one product this year it's our
first flagship of the year we have more
products coming I think they're gonna
continue to raise the bar when it comes
to design in many ways it takes a couple
of years for a company that's not even
six years old to get to the point right
where it has a rhythm it has a pace I've
pushed a lot of people around internally
over the last couple of years to really
find a design language because we want
to be the scene as an industry leader in
every way including design I think we're
finally getting there well that's a good
season thank you very much again here
you go thanks what thanks for having you
want to go for right okay I'll just lean
forward slightly</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
