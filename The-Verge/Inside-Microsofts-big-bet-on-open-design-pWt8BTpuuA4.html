that might not be super
obvious from the outside.
But this huge company shift will impact
exactly how their products
will look like in the future.
I visited Microsoft's
headquarters recently
to learn about what the
company calls open design.
It's basically a way for Microsoft
to build hardware and software together
in a way that makes it feel like it
was built by one company.
Before we dive too deep
into some of these changes,
let's look why Microsoft
had to try something new.
Over the last decade,
Microsoft has learned
the hard way that having
small teams working
independently doesn't always
produce the best results.
Everyone was kind of
working on their own,
prototyping their own areas.
And, at best, you were kind of showing
pictures to each other.
The company has suffered
a series of product flops
like Kin, ultra mobile
PCs, or even Windows 8.
Most of these products
failed because they were
either way too early or
Microsoft just didn't
give them the full backing
of the entire company.
Just look at the Courier tablet
that, after years of hype, never launched.
Or even the Surface Mini that was canceled
just weeks before its announcement.
Microsoft is changing the way
they develop and design products
because not changing is far riskier.
Teams would incubate products.
They would go to try to build
sort of that product themselves.
And to build a product, they would have
to just try to build the entire product.
The other big motivation here is speed.
The old way of doing things
meant an idea took years
before it was even ready to launch.
Back when we used to ship software,
client software every two to three years,
we had to imagine what was
going to happen two years
from now in the industry and
be right about a solution.
And that's really tricky
because the industry
keeps moving faster and faster.
Microsoft has been moving
to a more agile approach recently.
And that means software
updates every few weeks,
rather than a big, splashy
release every couple of years.
Working in an agile way
means creating something
in its simplest form and
then building on top of it.
So think of a pizza.
You create the base to start with.
Then you add toppings over time.
This means that the value is seen
a lot sooner and before the
whole project is finished.
This new open design philosophy applies
the same set of rules
across the entire company.
It prioritizes experimentation
and collaboration,
which helps employees share the workload.
A design piece built for one product
should be easily
incorporated into another.
Every product doesn't need its own
search box or chat bubble.
Instead, think of these
designs like toppings.
They're centralized and just reused.
Sharing internally is only
one part of the puzzle.
Microsoft is also embracing open source
far more across the company.
Microsoft has even spent
$7.5 billion
to acquire GitHub and allow its own
developers to share and
collaborate even closer.
I don't know what percentage
of our code we write per product,
but one app team can take
all of the Azure Stack now
and not have to write that entire service.
Each team doesn't have to
write 100 percent of the code,
and they're not anymore.
That's a shift toward the
success of working in the open.
For a company as big as Microsoft
this all sounds like
a multiyear challenge,
and there's no guarantee
this will even be successful.
In fact, Microsoft has tried
to align its products before.
Windows Phone pulled in a bunch
of different teams at Microsoft
to try and win at mobile.
And it was an early
example of how the company
could tightly combine
hardware and software.
Compared to now, this
same collaborative process
is being applied to all
of Microsoft's products.
Where we learn, at
least on phone, is that,
“Hey, to have a great design system,
it cannot just be for one product.”
It's like, how do you actually scale that
to hundreds of products
serving millions of customers,
in some ways billions of customers?
Microsoft's big drive
here is being far more agile
and speedy with the products it creates.
We've seen Google push rapid
change with Chrome and Android.
But there's not many other
companies as big as Microsoft
that have transitioned to
a fully agile approach.
Spotify, Atlassian, and
Facebook are some good examples
of companies that are rapidly
pushing software development.
That said, there are some early examples
showing that Microsoft
is on the right path,
like monthly updates to
Office or icons in webpages
across Microsoft's software products
all looking very similar.
The company calls this fluent design.
It's a pretty subtle approach
with motion and blur effects
that are designed to scale across any device.
There's even cartoon-like
people that Microsoft's using
across its online services
that all look very similar.
In the future, Office,
Skype, Surface, and Xbox
could all share the same software design.
The challenge now is to
take ideas from Microsoft's
100,000-plus employees
and then create a design
that will scale and feels
coherent to the billion people
that are using products
like Office and Windows.
If this open design
doesn't really work out,
we could be looking at hardware and software
that's been well-designed
but that just reminds us
of what could have been.
Okay, thanks for watching.
We also did a Surface
Hub 2 hands-on recently.
