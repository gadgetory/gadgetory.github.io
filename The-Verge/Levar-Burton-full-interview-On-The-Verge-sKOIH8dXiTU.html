introduce our first guest but I'm going
to I mean you guys know who he is you
know Miz Geordi LaForge from Star Trek
Kunta Kinte from roots which is you know
crazy that he's here doing this and
doing stuff like that and of course
reading from Reading Rainbow please
please welcome the amazing levar burton
very careful
so much
so these are live human beings yeah we
have real people Wow we've convinced
humans to come in here good job
levar thank you so much for coming I
you've been now I know you've been on a
whirlwind tour in New York yes in
sightseeing
indeed know you've been to like
everywhere you were on late night last
night you were at CNN today you get all
over the place and this is your last
stop in here this is my last stop on the
on the Reading Rainbow app launch press
tour and I wanted to spend it here with
y'all that is I appreciate that I
appreciate that and work and we're very
glad that you did
no I so I mentioned before you came out
yeah you have some very iconic roles in
your history and talking about the
Fantasy Island I did and Fantasy Island
I did Love Boat too you know and of
court well of course Love Boat
I mean no one no one can forget the love
those I have no one but you but but I
was thinking I feel like you've got
these their roles are so iconic and they
have such a fan base around them
particularly Star Trek that you must
walk down the street people like hey
Jordy mm-hmm does that drive you crazy
no really no it really doesn't it
doesn't bother him it's not like my fans
are like Gary Busey fans you know what I
mean he's Gary Busey yeah he does and
they tend to put cigarettes out in his
arms really yeah but he's into that he
loves he loves me yeah yeah Wow so that
doesn't bother you at all so then that's
great
would you be annoyed if I conducted the
rest of the interview as if you were
Jordy and being Hornet and before you
answer at Kui get some mood music on for
this when you are serious
well it's this is the sound from the
bridge I know what that sound is
but you would be in engineering so it'd
be a little louder could we bring up the
sound a little bit more and that sounds
about right to me okay that's fine you
cut I'm not actually gonna do this I'm
not gonna subjective no no no I was
really getting in time very you're ready
to go in Jordan right I was I was almost
in character we were talking backstage
the whole time you were on Star Trek who
the visor you really couldn't see very
well in the visor actually took away
about 85% of my vision when I put it on
and there's a tremendous irony there
right because the visor gave you on the
show gave you all kinds of extra
abilities you could like see what they
give what the makeup of the room was and
yet in reality you were at sty I was
stumbling around that's uh I didn't know
that by the way and it was brought up
backstage and I was I was shocked too
shocked to find this fun Star Trek facts
to know and tell so so besides being an
actor your director you you hosted
Reading Rainbow and obviously still
Reading Rainbow Watchers in the huh I
don't want to make you feel old but I
grew up on Reading Rainbow I'm lying I'm
actually I'm quite all of myself and no
but no Reading Rainbow was yes I mean
that was like a huge deal 26 years on
PBS 26 26 years and you you you want a
bunch of Emmys mm-hmm you won a Peabody
hmm so 26 seasons yeah do you feel the
story's over
nowhere you know like there could be a
movie in the offing Oh a movie a Reading
Rainbow movie not like a narrative film
Wow
have you considered we could get some
butterflies
go on maybe a sky yeah that's probably
pretty easy to do yeah they have sound
stages where they can recreate a sky I
understand in Hollywood I would probably
want to do it all CGI though yeah
absolutely so we're gonna I want to talk
with you of an app you have this happen
oh yes we all heard about the Reading
Rainbow app that's out in the App Store
so it's out right now it's out now it's
out now how am i how much is it it's a
free app two three it's free what are
you waiting for
why are you downloading the why fighting
here's pretty bad okay but but but so so
before we talk about that I want to talk
about your life on the internet you've
become very active on unit I love the
internet you you are you're on reddit
we've one of the cofounders of reddit
here you're not correct me if I'm wrong
your username on reddit is Kunta in the
house is that correct it's absolutely
true okay that is true and true and
you're pretty active I mean you're
fairly active on there oh yeah
you're also a mean you're aware of this
the yerba memed I have been yes well we
had Neil deGrasse Tyson on who's also do
you know he's astrophysicist absolutely
and he's been memed heavily and we asked
him about it I just want to kind of show
you one of my favorites here this is if
you're having hall problems I feel bad
for you son I've got 99 problems but a
breach ant one apologies to jay-z does
this does this weird you out as a
strange for your I love this stuff he
just randomly appears
yes you're into it wouldn't you yes I
would yes
I wish I wish people did more creative
means with me I'm going to put that out
into the world please do more creative
memes so so let's talk about the app
okay I actually have it here you do on
an iPad let me see if I can get this up
so it has can we get this on on camera
I'm still talking
yeah so check this out it's got islands
that you can fly through and we were
reading a book you have a backpack right
I thought was great
reading pirate boy one of my favorites
and who is the narrator a pirate boy I
don't know no you tell me I don't I
don't know isn't there one hundred and
fifty percent oxygen what if there are
sea monsters it's not you know that is
Jim mess common who is one of our
storytellers I read about 20 percent of
the titles
the app you know you are reading the
titles alone oh yeah absolutely
that's it it seems like a lot of time
big time sync I work cheap for myself
okay
but it's a cool app we were putting
around that it just it has interactive
it does it's got this you can see
dragged in here can you can touch it and
it starts doing that it is like very
much like a pop-up book on an iPad oh
I'm incredibly proud of what we've been
able to do in terms of translating a
television show into an app experience
there are a lot of challenges involved
and I think we've we've overcome a lot
of them not the least of which is is the
fear of disappointing those who really
know and are familiar with the brand it
can be dangerous to you know go to the
well too many times with the same
franchise just just ask paramount yeah
we're Star Trek is oh oh well but I mean
I don't know Star Trek has been pretty
successful it has in Harry and they had
to give it a long rest before you know
JJ rebooted the franchise do you feel
bummed that there's not gonna be any
more next generation movies
I'm tired Josh first contact was on TV
last night but was it completely random
it I had to watch it obviously and you
had to watch it well I mean it's really
good yeah wouldn't you wouldn't you stop
and watch it I whenever I'm on TV is
great no but it's no good I miss the
next generation crew yeah do you do you
keep in touch with those guys do you
think we all keep in touch and this is
the 25th anniversary of next gen coming
on the air so we are having sort of a
reunion tour of conventions we started a
couple of months ago in Calgary and and
we have others coming up there's one in
Austin
in a couple of months and so it's great
Patrick lives over in England now
michael dorn is spending his money
there's Wharf money Wharf on next Janney
was Wharf on deep space right God he had
a long run michael Dorn's got more money
than God really yeah
after the show can I get his contact
information cuz I need you do we do to
you know get some budget in here you
know we try we're no we're no CNN but
we're doing that we're doing the best we
can so let me ask you about that the the
Reading Rainbow and though it's clearly
for kids it is have you ever thought
about how our young at heart have you
ever thought about adding more adult
titles like Fifty Shades of Grey
Lolita would be something you might put
in there maybe some of the Anne Rice
novels people have asked me for years
about doing an adult version of Reading
Rainbow and I know and I I think we
should get around to that in in the
fullness of time because why not be a
lot of fun yeah I mean adults need to
read I let's hope I mean what are what
are the goals for you with the app like
what do you want to do with this
happening obviously you want to
encourage people to read yes but it does
read for you in some way you're almost
encouraging people to not read does that
seem fair to the kids
seems a little counterproductive it does
are we raising a generation of lazy kids
who won't read
I think we're raising a generation of
overindulged kids and with iPad they all
have iPad I don't know I mean you know
this is a generation that you know gets
rewarded for everything you know if
you're on a sports team everybody gets a
trophy you know whether you suck or not
and true you see professional sports
players they're really good mm-hmm
most people are not that good you should
not be in an award if you're not really
good at sport I think that my generation
of parents in an effort to really give
our children the the sort of of
childhood that we feel we ourselves
never had have really gone way overboard
in in terms of indulging this upcoming
generation and I just think they're
they're a little spoiled yeah yeah I
agree we should be hitting them a lot
more
right spare the rod spoil the child is
my so so look I know I know your hit
regarded we Barberton advocates leading
children's you heard it here first heard
it here Babar says hit your kids often
more becoming frankly they had it coming
I know you're very tired I'm not gonna
keep you too much longer but I was
thinking so they rebooted the old Star
Trek I started to keep going back to
start no no but I can just tell you I'm
a little bit of a fan I couldn't tell
and so they rebooted the original Star
Trek they put a bunch of new young
actors in the roles of that you know the
Shatner had and Leonard Nimoy right if
they were to reboot next generation
which by the way seems weird to reboot
the next generation but do they were to
reboot the next generation who would you
want you is there anybody out there who
you feel like would be a great new
Geordi I really put you on the spot now
woman no Gary Coleman's not here no he's
not gonna work you know why cuz the cat
needed a job man I'll tell you what I
spent years watching you I had no idea
you were as funny you're like so serious
on Star Trek and so much horrible
always happens to you you know like you
never get a chance to just cut loose on
starts right now that wasn't part of
Georgie's character he always had to
hold it together yeah you were you know
everybody was countin on him right it
was always like everything is falling
apart right you just whip up some new
way to fix the warp core and you always
did sure captain let's get right on it
that's so amazing
so no no actors in mind that you would
want to let's see who in this current
crop of actually I think Sam Jackson
would make a noise yeah yeah yeah
don't you think no why does
yeah Geordi like shot stuff all the time
right the next the next generation of
the next generation Geordi LaForge
badass total bass you know what I'm
gonna leave it there the BART thank you
so much for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
