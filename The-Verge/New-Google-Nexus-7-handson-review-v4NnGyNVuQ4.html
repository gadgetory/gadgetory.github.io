Google's new Nexus 7 last year at
Google's first Nexus 7 immediately
became the best Android tablet on the
market but in the last 12 months it's
become plotting ly slow and buggy and
just outdated so Google's back with
another this time for 229 dollars
bringing the device way up to date it
starts with the hardware made by asus
the new Nexus 7 has a 7.0 2 inch 1920 by
1200 IPS display that is way better than
the last model or even something like
the iPad Mini it has fantastic viewing
angles and gorgeous color reproduction
and it's just insanely sharp at 323
pixels per inch it's good enough that
you can even read tiny text I could
actually read a book through the
screenshots in the Play Store and
everything from movies to books is just
more pleasant to look at the screen gets
incredibly bright and absolutely
destroys the battery when it's turned
all the way up but it's overall one of
the best tablet displays I've ever seen
maybe be best even while improving the
screen Google managed to make the Nexus
7 a little bit thinner and a lot lighter
it's a little taller now and it feels a
lot taller the bezels on the sides are
thinner in the last year's model but the
top and bottom bezels are still big and
fat it makes the device feel kind of
asymmetrical which the office in our
camera lens on the front doesn't help
either but the Nexus 7 is even more
comfortable and usable in one hand than
ever it's still soft touch and
comfortable but it feels much more
grown-up somehow I could see James Bond
using this Nexus 7 Google and Asus also
added stereo speakers which are great no
matter how you hold the new Nexus 7 you
get genuine stereo sound that's pretty
loud and pretty clear there's a new five
megapixel rear camera as well but it's
not very good or very interesting for
$229 you can only expect so much but
Google did make bigger promises this
time the new Nexus 7 runs on a faster
processor and a GPU that Google says is
more than four times as powerful there's
double the RAM now too which is a big
upgrade and it's fast other than the
fact that Google has somehow not figured
out how to animate scrolling properly
there are basically zero performance
issues with this Nexus 7 games look
great even intensive ones and the
operating system flows smoothly
part of that is definitely due to the
fact that the Nexus 7 runs Android 4.3
it's still called jelly bean but it does
bring a few new things to the table
restricted profiles basically just gives
you parental controls for the tablet you
can pick and choose which apps certain
users can access it's a future lots of
tablets have had though it's just now
baked into the OS one genuinely cool new
feature is Play games which is
essentially a not hideous game center or
Xbox Live for Andrew
it tracks your achievements and high
scores shows you what your friends are
playing and so on Google's talking a lot
about tablet apps and how many of them
look good and work well on the Nexus 7
there are definitely signs of life for
the Android ecosystem here apps like
Flipboard and Evernote and pocket work
great on a 7-inch device and Netflix can
now play in gorgeous 1080p but there are
still plenty of examples like RDO which
is just a blown up phone app and looks
pretty bad
particularly for game players - there
are just many more great apps on iOS
than on Android but for most things
androids caught up and on a 7-inch
device even the blown up phone apps
don't look quite so terrible the new
Nexus 7 is far more powerful than the
old there's no question about that
but I'm still a little nervous in our
benchmark tests its raw numbers are much
better but relative to the competition
they're about the same as the Nexus 7
was a year ago I was hoping for insane
crazy power so this tablet would be able
to hang around for years but that may
not be the case I guess we might just be
stuck paying $229 a year forever which
does make the more expensive models like
the 32 gig model for $269 or 32 gigs
plus LTE for 349 dollars a much harder
sell better life is another thing that
was odd about the old Nexus 7 at least
the one I bought it was great for a
couple of months and then basically fell
off a cliff for now the new model easily
lasts through a full day of pretty heavy
use even with some gaming and movie
watching and it burns almost no battery
on standby which was not true of the
Nexus 7 I bought a year ago I'm hoping
that holds up so yes I'm still a little
worried about the future but in some
sense such as the price of progress and
the Nexus 7 has such good build quality
such a gorgeous screen and finally such
a good selection of tablet apps that for
as long as the processor can hang around
this is going to be one of the best
Android tablets on the market Apple may
well come out with an iPad Mini with
Retina display and it may well continue
to have a big ecosystem advantage
especially for gamers but if you want a
tablet that's great for reading watching
movies browsing the web and checking
your email the new Nexus 7 for all of
$229 is pretty much unbeatable
