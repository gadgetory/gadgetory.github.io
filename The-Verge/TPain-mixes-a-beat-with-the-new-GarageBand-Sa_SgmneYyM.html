releasing a big update to GarageBand
today that adds in a brand new interface
is supposed to make it much easier to
start making music that's always been
its pitch that you don't need a big
studio and you can just put it together
in your bedroom but this new interface
makes it much easier you just fire loops
and put a song together I could do that
myself to show you how it's done but I
thought that musically inclined so
instead we're gonna have t-pain do it
yes sir this is the new interface and
the big thing is it's not linear it's
like a grid of loop all right right I
mean is this make it easier for you do
you this makes one dealing with the loop
sales it makes it easier to compose the
track this is if you're feeling a bit
feeling a bit of Randy and want to go
ahead and you know I'm saying I want to
want to go in and have some have some
help and how do you use this track let's
say I mean you can go any one of these I
mean randomly and that's already
recording into GarageBand so and boom
yeah there it is it stops the bar after
and you get that gun and that is already
recorded into your garage man so now you
get that going and you go you build your
track right after that you go to keys
and and you can build right on top of
that and you know I'm saying and that's
something that if you're in a place to
where you can't really start a track
that you want to do and it helps to have
at least that I did and it's good to
have it or you can take it away later
and say there any of the stuff that I
add it was pretty cool I really need
that first thing I did that was just uh
it's an idea it's an icebreaker for you
know example sometimes when I do it but
it's always good to go go back into
these things and go back to the grid you
can start to add more stuff it's always
fun man I love just going around and
just touching all to say oh this is it
all right you go and play a whole roll
of sound the whole column you don't
saying is just it's about it's about
what you want and how many
things you want to get gone even if I
wanted to I can just go here BAM get a
whole rug on that interface and then my
favorite part man this will be the best
part for anybody who just doesn't like
to do drums drummer you know it's been
such a help within logic can also use
logic you know to integrate things and
man drummer the addition of drummer to
logic has been the biggest help but to
see it in a like a mobile version and
something we can carry around and take
around that's been the best part of
GarageBand so far for me
so what I like to do BAM hit up drummer
and Dez opens up his dad's is my
favorite person he's the he's a trap guy
so it's got to have death and it kind of
looks like me from a long time ago so
that's all so that helps a lot
so basically drummer drummers effortless
it's already started I did not do
anything
drummers just there he's hitting he made
it he made the whole thing for me I have
nothing to do you can make it more
simple and that's just jobs and guy here
and this changes as you change as you
change this the waveform change
you can make it as complex as you would
like you can add instruments
different versions of it it's very very
very simple and that's all she wrote
that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
