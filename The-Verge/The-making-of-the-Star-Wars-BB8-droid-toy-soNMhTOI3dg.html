there's probably one thing you've wanted
more than anything else
two things I mean there's two things
this is bb-8 the adorable pixar s
controlled as usurped r2d2 as a robotic
hero for the new film zero a startup
conveyed as perhaps best known among
tech circles has managed to make a
miniature version that can run around
your house no strings attached
the collaboration began last summer when
Sparrow joined the Disney accelerator
program and met with none other than
Disney CEO Bob Iger himself and so the
story goes when essentially they pulled
out cero and showed Bob and let him play
around with it
said uh you know I want to show you
something I'm working on this thing that
might be interesting for us to have a
conversation about and funny enough it
kind of operates like this and by the
way do you think you could make it like
actually work considering you're so good
with this ball and it was it was about
one day before Adam Andy and who are the
co-founders the company came back and
had kind of a concept of how to bring it
to life since the very beginning the
Star Wars universe has been as much
about merchandising as it has been the
films that inspired in the 70s and 80s
that meant Kenner action figures with
over 300 million sold during that time
today Star Wars license toys games
costumes towels but virtually anything
you can imagine are all produced by
dozens of companies and this year's an
exceptionally busy time the force
awakens hits theaters December 18th in
an army of movie tie-ins awakens today
September 4th an event that's being
advertised as force Friday
spero is offering something a bit more
premium than most companies the first
time he plays bb-8 in his charging
cradle the droid comes to life lights
flicker its head twists and turns I also
could swear it was looking at me at one
point but to be clear the head is really
just plastic held on by magnets it's a
bit jarring at first but it's also
perhaps the best introduction to what
Sphero really wants its droid to be you
know when we when we designed the
product
we did a lot of it in animation first
and so we actually wrote some software
that would allow us to you know create
certain emotional moments that bb-8
would have like what happens when bb-8
gets scared what does he do when he's
surprised what about when he's mad
and we basically rendered those all out
and software you have him go I you know
BB maybe that's been around and then we
had a mechanism to push that to the
robot bb-8 can be controlled by your
smartphone for driving and other
puppetry but also can be put in an
automated patrol mode left to its own
devices bb-8 seems rather curious albeit
a bit pissed whenever it hits a wall and
as just might take at least also I
wouldn't recommend letting him on tables
or other elevated services but if you do
it's worth noting as things been pretty
durable so far Siro makes a lot of bold
claims on the packaging chief among them
holographic communication which the
probably guess is just a nifty AR trick
but for all the added bells and whistles
the BB aids primary directive is really
just to be a ball of cuteness to make
you feel something in ascribe emotion
algorithmically driven device and it
speaks as heroes future goals we think
that this is probably the first step for
sparrow we think that ultimately there
will be a robot in every house that
everyone will own a companion that isn't
we're out today
spiros bb-8 isn't the kind of joy that
I'd have a beer with nor is it the kind
that could fetch a beer for me that
isn't its point anyway
but there's something earnestly exciting
about singing go off on its own I can't
say how long that novelty will last but
I could easily see myself just turning
on autopilot enjoying the occasional
moment where I catch it doing something
weird you know kind of like a cat in
that respect maybe a Roomba at $150 this
is definitely among the pricier tie-ins
for the film and Sphero is wisely
marketing it as a premium product even
manages a carry coveted spot on the
Apple store shelves among other places
and yes it'll work with Android - this
is just the first volume what's
assuredly many years of Star Wars
merchandise the force awakens is just
the first of several films coming out in
the next five years
not to mention spin-off properties TV
shows comic books games get the idea and
who knows by the time the Star Wars
write is over we might all actually have
robot companions
I may need a beer for us release wait in
line a concession stand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
