silver focus it's a solar lighted case
for kindles as you can see the outside
cover has two solar panels solar panel
is that these are called amorphous
silicon okay so they're actually soft
flexible panels less than a millimeter
in thickness as the new one in a bit the
the panels transfer energy from the Sun
into an internal battery built into the
case there's a lithium battery in the
case okay the internal battery powers
this led reading lab so the advantages
you're not drawing power from the
Kindles internal battery for throwing it
from our own battery we've been a 1500
milliamp hour lithium battery okay the
other cool feature is that I can
actually transfer power from the cases
internal battery with the push of a
button now when it starts blinking I'm
actually charging my Kindle great from a
case okay how much charge to get for the
kindle with them i can fully charged
this kendall you pull it from the case
with the filter
that's correct how long does it take the
church from the just as long as it would
take on your USB on your computer it's
the same bull that's going in with a
push of a button it'll charge from one
hour that's going to give you about
three days reading time and it will turn
off automatic need to keep some reserved
for the light but I can push it again if
I want to get another hour in charge of
a USB or via solar they're linking green
so simply simply exposing the coverage
of the Sun it will charge the cases
internal battery which then runs daily
dlab or charts as a candle if I wish to
wendar where we'll be able to get this
well this new version does it's the
solar version is also a non solar
version see all the same features minus
the panel so is USB chargeable ok this
is 5995 7995 they're available online
now now let me let me correct myself the
non-solar version is available today the
solar version is going to be about a
week ok
and you've also got the the kindle
touches in the works this is a working
prototype and this will be coming down
the pipeline late Bart's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
