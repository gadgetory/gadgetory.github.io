today the pebble and Google's new
android wear platform but if you're
looking for one which do you buy the
pebble which has been around since the
beginning of last year as an
easy-to-read black light display and a
fairly traditional digital watch design
the steel version is the one you'd want
it costs 250 bucks but it's all metal
and comes with both the leather and the
metal wristband the two Android wear
watches today that two hundred dollars
Samsung gear live and the two hundred
and thirty dollar LG G watch our
plasticky and geeky looking compared to
the pebble and certainly don't look as
nice as a classy dress watch both
Android wear watches and full color
displays that light up when you get
notification or move your arm up to look
at the time but they're not easy to see
in a daylight and they suck down a lot
of battery power you need to charge
these things every day with your
smartphone or you'll have a dead useless
gadget on your wrist by the next day the
pebble on the other hand can last about
four to five days between charges
Android wear and pebble can both show
you all of your notifications on your
wrists including email text messages and
social alerts but this can get quite
noisy especially we have an iPhone end a
pebble since every notification that
hits your phone is now going to come to
your wrist there's other things that you
can do to such as control music with
your phone and count your steps with a
pedometer one of the coolest things
about the pebble is the ability to
customize a watch faces on your wrist
you do everything from a traditional
analog design to text based displays to
standard digital watch face you can also
install different apps to extend the
capabilities that watch over on Android
wear the real promise here is the
integration with Google now to show you
relevant information when you need it
are you at the airport and need to get
your boarding pass out no worries your
Android wear watches displaying it right
on your wrist you can also control the
thing with your voice to send messages
perform Google searches and more android
wear also supports apps the developers
can make it work with their existing
smartphone apps that do things like
order pizzas call a cab or turn your
smart lights on and off or more if you
use an iPhone you really have no option
except for the pebble but even if you
use an android phone Android wear
watches are tough sell at this point
they're still too plasticky you have to
be charged too often and are too clumsy
to use to really be beneficial to most
people if you must buy a SmartWatch
today you're better off getting the
table it looks nicer last longer and is
easier to use than the Android wear
watches but that doesn't mean you have
to do anything right now chances are
smart watches are going to get
better really quickly they may very well
be the next big personal gadget it's
gonna take some time to figure them out
before they're on everyone's rest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
