photographer and food artist
all my aunts and mum and her sisters all
did art in one form or another my mother
was an embroider one of the answers also
hid at the art department at the sister
school - where I went to school at so in
the weekends I would go and use their
photography darkroom and so there was a
lot of that kind of creative stuff going
on when I was growing up and so it was
always kind of you know really
encouraged so this was when I was at
high school and I won the independent
schools festival of music poster
competition when you're young you kind
of have a thought that good art was
almost realistic and so everyone was
trying to draw great pictures of
instruments or musicians and I just did
this little collage made out of you know
notes but it's winds things started to
connect where it was ideas were kind of
stronger than the execution after high
school I really didn't know what my
direction was going to be and so when I
graduated from university I got a
one-way ticket to London but on the way
to London I got a stop in Bangkok I got
approached by a guy who was a stylist
and they were looking for models for a
shoot and asked me if I was a model and
no I wasn't would I be interested and I
did three shoots while I was over there
one of the great things about modeling
was kind of gave you a very privileged
view of a lot of cities and places my
travelling occupation that I always had
when I needed money was a bartender so
I'd also had this experience working in
restaurants for a long time so when I
first started doing photography I
started trying to shoot fashion because
that was what I knew I come from the
fashion background but still life was
something I enjoyed much more and I
started to get asked to shoot food for
the restaurants I was working in for
friends who open restaurants to do it
everyone has all these emotions tied up
with food and I think there's all these
narratives that can be used to be told
with food and you know just showing
people food in a different way than they
used to seeing it becomes much more
and I'm really attracted to things that
are that are humorous and playful and
fun and I also feel that stuff is
successful if it puts a smile on
someone's face if they smile laughs
they're engaged and if they're engaged
they remember as a photographer you want
to be the most proud of your most recent
work you know because I feel that's the
way you know you're always evolving and
to get a response from things online is
just kind of validates what you've done
I'm Henry hi graves and this is my story</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
