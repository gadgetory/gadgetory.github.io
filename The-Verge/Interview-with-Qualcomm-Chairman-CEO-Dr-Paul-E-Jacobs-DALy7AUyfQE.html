we're here with dr. Pauly Jacobs the
chairman and CEO of Qualcomm and we're
gonna talk a little bit about what
they're working on right now a little
bit of history and just see what the
future holds so Paul thanks for taking
the time thanks for having me
so Qualcomm was founded in 1985 right
right by your father
that's right my father and a few other
people and they had worked at a previous
company called Linc a bed
the really cool thing was Linc a bit
used digital communications theory for
like really expensive stuff like
military and space applications but then
Moore's law came along and made it
cheaper right so Qualcomm even though
they didn't think about it at the time
really was all about taking that really
complicated technology and putting it in
consumer and commercial applications so
like our first thing was messaging
satellite messaging to trucks and
imagine that they had little antennae
Miller's exactly with little satellite
antennas that tracked where the
satellite was and that's how you did
messaging interesting and then we came
on the cellular system you know CDMA
technology a little bit later but it was
the same kind of thing how do you take
this really complex technology and stick
it in something that people can carry
around with them that's cheap enough
right but welcome hasn't been a real
household name until pretty recently I
mean people have no I think welcomes
been in you know people know the company
they know that you're involved and these
2n devices they use but in the last few
years there's been a real explosion in
mobile and you guys were there obviously
you're there on the comp ground
literally on the ground floor of that
yeah and well not literally but you're
there very early yeah how is that how
does that changed how how you do what
you do I mean has it changed it at all
in the sense that you're now
consumer-facing you're making product
Snapdragon has become a kind of
household name when it comes to mobile
devices has that change the rate of
innovation that you feel like you need
to have has it changed in your pace yeah
I don't think so I mean we really had
been trying to drive the wireless
internet for a really long time in the
very early days of CDMA we actually put
the internet protocols inside the phone
now people didn't know it was in there
because it looked like it was one of
those Hayes modems the 80 dt blah blah
blah and made all the noises and stuff
right but we actually had the Internet
inside it and so in the end we've put a
browser on the on the front end and just
connected in the Internet on the back
end and that's how we ended up with
Internet on on cell phone so we've been
doing that since really the early
nineties yeah and that now what's cool
is because smart phones are so popular
now there's other ways that we can
innovate so we used to innovate a lot
about the radio technology we still do a
lot of that because there's so much data
demand but now we're innovating on the
you know the CPU you know the
microprocessor technology the graphics
technology Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
connectivity technology just all these
different areas where we can add like
extra functionality into the device and
now we're actually going up another
level so we've been doing augmented
reality for example so kind of platforms
of technology still enabling other
people to build their stuff on top of
our stuff right but it's kind of another
layer up if you think of it how are you
integrating that with I mean you guys
are doing like you know you're talking
about radio technology and processor
technology how is augmented reality a
piece of that I mean is that is that a
software layer is that an actual
hardware layer oh is that yeah it's
interesting because there's some
software obviously and there's a
developer's kit for the developers to
use it but then to actually make it work
well it integrates into a lot of things
like sensors in the phone whether it's
the camera or the accelerometer makes us
have to make the graphics processor work
really fast so that you know when you
move the phone around and the image on
the screen changes you got to change
exactly how that 3d object that you're
compositing in their ranges to so you're
basically creating this almost
off-the-rack combination of things you
can say if you're doing augmented
reality we've got we've got the combo of
things you need to make it really work
in a device exactly and then we the
triangle and then we try and optimize we
say yeah that's gonna work better on a
Snapdragon chip even though you'll get
it to work on other devices because we
want to cover all the different
platforms the developers really want you
to you know kind of cover the whole
landscape yeah they don't want to be
locked in right yeah which makes sense
so so speaking on mobile devices you
guys really have a lot more consumer
facing stuff now then then you've ever
ever had I think so you've got
snapdragon and mobile phones and in
tablets and that's what the pace of that
is insane I mean you guys are every it
feels like every few weeks there's
new Snapdragon there's you hear of a new
model number and it's faster and it's
got you know it's smaller or is that do
you feel a lot of pressure from the
competition I mean you guys aren't the
only people doing harm associations
right so it seems like there's an
immense amount of pressure from other
companies because you see you'll see
this you know it seems like the same
phone with this with a different chip on
it right how much is that how much of
that is is it's burning innovation how
much of that is making you guys kind of
think faster I mean there's definitely a
lot of pressure to innovate quickly and
we have a lot of products sort of lined
up in parallel so that they can come out
that quickly because obviously we don't
do them in that short sort of a period
of time so there's you know there is a
lot of pressure to drive technology for
but I think we've always felt that way
because we always felt even from the
very beginning that in the end the phone
was going to be the computing and
entertainment platform for everybody and
so to get from where we were which used
to be you know text-based phones and it
really cruddy screens and stuff I got to
where we are today
there was a long way to go so we've been
pushing ourselves pretty hard for a long
time and I do agree that there's you
know there's definitely more competition
and there's probably competition that's
gonna come from you know the likes of an
Intel from above and right you know some
of the other guys from below I mean
exactly for mobile so exactly but but
these are the incremental changes that
we see are they are they happening
because the allit maybe challenges a
little bit here are they happening
because the industry wants to just see
an uchi you know a new chipset every so
often or is there real innovation
happening in those iterations and those
small iterations of these sets
there's definitely new stuff going on I
mean we completely changed the
architecture of our microprocessor from
the last generation of chips to this
generation because people want stuff to
happen really fast I mean you care that
when you touch the screen stuff animates
quickly and you know things like
augmented reality take a lot of
computation and voice recognition all
these different ways of interfacing with
the phone take a lot of compute
capability and so we are innovating
there when you look at the radio
technology I mean we're going from three
to 4G to a completely different kind of
signaling technology and I don't want to
get into all the details of it but it is
fundamentally different right and then
you've got to make those things I'll
work backward and forward compatible and
then you say okay well from there what
do you do next because we're you know
we're planning for a thousand times
increase in data demand over the next
few years and we got to do some pretty
serious innovation to make that work
right so you feel that they're not then
these are baby steps these are real real
steps every time we spent three billion
dollars in R&amp;amp;D last year and it's mostly
yeah in one years like a change
yeah and it's mostly focused on how do
we drive all these different vectors
whether it's the radio or the you know
computer the graphics or Connacht it you
know how do we drive that stuff faster
and faster right so I want to talk about
2012 and what you guys have planned for
the future I mean mobile everybody knows
you as hey you're doing sound drag
you're doing mobile stuff but you're
going other places too
now that Windows 8 is there's an ARM
version of Windows 8 this changes your
place in the industry a little bit in
the sense that you have not been the
company that's making chips for laptops
and for you know devices there are you
know Windows devices right you know how
this is a big deal for you I mean are
you looking at this as a big opportunity
yeah no I think it's gonna be really
cool and I think people are gonna be
amazed by the kind of form factors that
they get when you use a mobile chip but
you use it for a full computing
environment and so we're gonna see
really thin light devices gonna be
pretty cool so we're we're really
excited about it
and we're working with a lot of
companies not just our traditional phone
companies but the traditional PC
manufacturers are really interested in
this too because they get it I mean
everybody wants to be connected all the
time you want to have your device you
know always synchronizing your email and
your calendar and your Facebook and you
know all that stuff that you come to
depend on right and the funny thing too
that I always found was when you have it
with you you're sort of less ponent of
delay you don't want to wait open the
thing up have it boot up have it then
you know synchronized
yeah now you just want to touch it and
have it work and obviously on yeah and
obviously iPads a great example of that
I mean it became so popular because it
did provide that this is gonna provide
that Plus you know office and
that computing environment the
impression I get from Microsoft and I'm
sure you're getting a similar impression
and you guys are probably I mean you're
not probably you're definitely working
on this stuff we're gonna see devices
you tell me if I'm wrong that are act
like a tablet do everything that a
tablet does you know it's kind of a
touch optimized not just windows with
touch but a touch completely touch
optimized experience but then you go
home you dock it somewhere and suddenly
you've got a full-featured laptop I mean
that's that is really kind of the future
of those devices and you guys are gonna
be there making the chips for those
devices yeah I mean we're absolutely
investing heavily to make sure that we
have a lot of compute power but focus on
you know power consumptions so it isn't
a thing that just runs out of juice
right away it isn't a thing that needs a
fan to cool it off and that kind of
stuff and that's that to me is what's
really important take the kind of the
the way that we made smartphones make
them so easy to use and simple and light
and always-on and that's a and bring
that to the full computing environment
and by the way I mean Microsoft's done a
great job on that we did this demo with
them at their build conferences their
Developers Conference of connected
standby mode and so people are thinking
okay is Microsoft gonna be able to lower
the power consumption of Windows so they
can't act like a smartphone but they did
and we showed it off and it's cool you
know when you stop using the thing the
power consumption goes way down it goes
into kind of a hibernating state but it
wakes up every so often to synchronize
and when you touch the screen boom
everything comes back on yeah that's
gonna change the way people use our
computer I think so you know we talked
about Intel before but this really puts
you in a big way into competition with
Intel in a place where you've never been
in competition with I mean they're
coming into mobile doing mobile chips
now right you guys are going the
opposite direction here you're gonna
start doing laptop systems so I mean
that's a shift for you I mean you're
competing in a space you're competing
with a lot of big players and in a new
spaceman you've been competing with big
players in the mobile space right you
know does that change the way your
business though just does that change
the business model or is Qualcomm a
different company after a Windows 8 and
it was before I'm for those customers
that have a certain way of working we
will adapt to their
way of working meaning that Intel had
provided certain technologies and sort
of reference designs and products and so
forth to those manufacturers and if
that's the way they want to work with us
we'll adapt to that I mean we're one of
the things I think we've done pretty
well is go to different kinds of
companies in the various industries you
know you take in the very beginning
Samsung and LG we're consumer
electronics companies we worked with
them to become you know big telecom
companies right and you go to China and
you have a ZT and Huawei I mean they
really weren't consumer electronics
companies but we figured a way to work
with that then now we're working with a
lot of companies that are like these
real small companies that just they have
a distribution channel they have some
manufacturing we give them almost a
complete phone design so we've learned
how to work with them so I just think
it's an evolution of how do you manage
to the relationship with the customer
how do you get them up to speed and then
also for us to work with them whatever
way is comfortable for them right and
another way you're adapting is your I
mean we said it's more your more
consumer facing now but you're doing
smart TV stuff you're doing connected
homework can you tell me a little about
where you know where you see that going
and where you see Qualcomm being being
involved in that yes I mean it's kind of
an evolution of the vision of what the
phone should do so for a long time we've
been working on the idea that the phone
was gonna be the center where all this
stuff came in and you did your
entertainment and computing and stuff on
the phone right now we've put so much
effort into the phone and those chips
are so capable that they can actually
power purpose-built devices so we see
them going out into consumer electronics
devices into things like TVs into game
consoles into printers and access points
all these different things that you
might have in the house and then you say
okay well what's the phones role in that
well we look at it as a phone will sit
in the center it'll kind of sense that
you have opportunities to interact with
things around you maybe there's content
you can download or a screen I can use
or a speaker I can use or things like
that so it'll sense that and it'll be my
remote control to so I can actually
interface with those things turn the
lights on and off turn the screens on
and so forth this is this the Internet
of every
yeah those are calling it yeah this is
everything is talking to everything
everything and it's not always wire
lamps lamps duffel books what books I
mean we're really into that because the
ebooks right yeah not like a paper book
well okay so a paper book we're doing
stuff with augmented reality so you open
up a paper book and you point you know
your phone or your tablet at it and
stuff comes out I mean take like a
physics textbook it's just bizarre that
there's little diagrams in a physics
textbook when we all have computers you
could just point your thing at it and
actually have the experiment run in real
time for you right although the textbook
may be going away right it really gonna
happen one hope you just open up your
iPad or your take your Windows a tablet
or something and you get a look at it
you're gonna be able to manipulate it no
I mean one hopes we'll see how fast that
happen but I mean but you see you you
think that we're getting to a point now
where the standards are coming together
so that we can actually do connect at
homes and the right way you know have
your phone be the center of that I think
probably we were gonna get a few
different silos of things hopefully it
all comes together I mean if you look on
the like application side at least we're
getting things like html5 that work
across a bunch of platforms we're trying
to do a thing that works across you know
across a bunch of operating systems but
there may be an Apple version of Google
version of Microsoft version and so on
and so forth and you know we'll see how
that works out and obviously the
wireless operators and the cable
companies they'll all have a say in this
too because they got stuff in there
laughing yeah so well I think this
stuff's gonna shake out for a few years
yet so you guys are doing this
tricorder this XPrize tricorder thing
can you tell me what that is and what
the thinking behind it is now so we've
been really focused on mobile health and
like how do you make it cheaper simpler
more consumer friendly so the idea with
this thing is that there's gonna be
teams that are gonna compete to build a
thing like the tricorder which can
actually diagnose diseases hopefully
better than a doctor might even do it
and do it not just for developed
countries but you can imagine it for
emerging markets as well where they
don't have as much of a developed
healthcare system so the idea is that
people will come up with sensors they'll
come up with a device there'll be some
artificial intelligence associated with
it to help do
the diagnosis and we're gonna see how
close we can get to that you know vision
that Star Trek had of waving this thing
over you and then you actually imagine
doing one of these you know have a scan
of somebody and getting that kind of
information back on the device so
there's you know the question of how
invasive of a thing is it does it take a
bit to suffer that's one be pretty
invasive I think okay but it's actually
not that far-fetched because there are
guys right now working on sensors that
would actually get embedded in your body
and as an example they can find certain
cells that start circulating in your
body 24 hours or more before you have a
heart attack so the notion is that you
have a sensor that's actually lodged in
the vein in your wrist that's watching
for that DNA coming by now if you
imagine the phone acting as the
tricorder oh it's doing is interrogating
that sensor that's already inside your
body right and if you think that's weird
by the way use of the word interrogating
is always you know the sensor inside
your body is being interrogated
interfacing I think that's it's kind of
an incredible idea but I mean it's
exciting that you're trying to push that
forward
I mean sure there there could be abuses
of that sort of thing very easily but I
mean when you think about the kind of
healthcare problems that we have not
just here in America but around the
world yeah that could be a tool that
would save a lot of lives yeah and and I
mean we're really focused on how do you
use the technology for you know the good
of mankind I mean it it honestly is the
biggest technology platform that
humanity's create them in wireless
systems are six billion subscriptions so
great almost everybody has access to
these systems and it gives you a huge
opportunity but also feels like a big
responsibility like what are we gonna do
as an industry to use this technology
and improve people's quality of life and
standard of living and this seems like a
really obvious one because we all know
you know countries are going bankrupt
trying to support their health care
systems yeah we've got to make them more
productive more cost-effective you know
we've got to get this technology and
really focus it in on these kinds of
problems now you know it's obviously
gonna be a long road it's hard to get
things into the healthcare system
there's a lot of issues about safety
when you talk about things that might
even be inside your body so the
gonna be a lot of work that goes between
here and there but if we don't get it
kicked off it never happens this is an
idea to focus attention get a lot of
teams from around the world focusing in
on it over the next three years we'll
have a bunch of different sub
competitions and hopefully we come up
with something that's like the tricorder
at the end that would be really amazing
I know you have to run I have one final
question you you know you you guys stand
right at the you're right at the
forefront of innovation in terms of our
industry what is what's going to be the
sea change you know we saw the iPhone
and the iPad kind of explode and maybe
they became that moment of change for
art for the industry what's the next
thing is it motion is it voice is it
something you know is it that you know
connected home I mean where is the next
big wave coming from where do you see it
happening I mean I think it is Wireless
as an enabling technology to these other
things and it is this notion that you
know you'll have the phone as a digital
sixth sense it'll tell you what's around
you and you'll be able to interact with
those things and to deal with this
thousand acts increase in data demand
that we see we're gonna have to do stuff
like not just new radio technologies in
the wide area but also peer-to-peer
technology so I think devices are all
going to be talking to each other and
we're starting to see some of that stuff
happen now but if I walk into a room and
on an ad-hoc basis I can light up the
screen there and take control of the
speakers or I get in my car and my car
says to my phone hey these are the
buttons I have these are the screens I
have this speaker that I have in the
phone says this is the content I have
and this is the map I have and these
things just all talk to each other I
think that will be a really cool world
and it'll make things happen in a much
simpler way than they happened today
it sounds magical and it'll be cool well
I really hope that that happens we're
trying Paul thank you so much thanks for
the time
