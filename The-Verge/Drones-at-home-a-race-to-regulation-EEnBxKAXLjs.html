industrial technology extremely
expensive some of it classified and then
what happened over the last 10 years
that basically the revolution in your
pocket has made that technology so cheap
and easy and ubiquitous that regular
people can do it you know with the right
cable you can basically fly a plane with
a smartphone the truth of the matter is
is that for a long time now surveillance
technology has outpaced privacy law but
part of the issue is that it's really
hard for Americans to picture what a
privacy violation looks like maybe
pieces of data are being correlated
someplace in some server it's just it's
hard to visualize but drones but we have
this really visceral reaction to drum so
we can really picture what it's like to
be watched by these by these flying
robots and as a consequence I think it's
really sparked a conversation about
surveillance that we haven't had in some
time some of the uses are going to be
scary there's a technology called Argus
which can view an entire city at once
and it automatically tracks when it sees
a vehicle or a pedestrian moving it
traces where it started and where it
ends up and where it goes in between and
save that data and so it has the
potential to build up a real database of
people's comings and goings and location
and movement which is a very revealing
thing about you a lot of the
technologies to a pilot a drone used to
be covered under what's called export
control which is to say they're
regulated as military technologies but
there is a provision in the laws of
export control laws that exempts public
domain and you know no when I thought
you public domain drone technology and
yet and yet here it is because the stuff
becomes City came so easy and so cheap
it's suddenly regular people could do
the stuff that only defense contractors
to do before sky catch is a security
company that uses drones to secure
private property it's basically a rather
than having multiple cameras going
around in your backyard or your big
private property do you spread out
sensors around
as soon as they're triggered the drugs
deployed and they fly out to the
location to start streaming video and
sending pictures to your iPhone app or
your Android or any endpoint people have
been putting cameras on remote control
helicopters for going on 20 years now I
don't think that there are hundreds of
thousands of would-be criminals that
have just been waiting for the perfect
technology to go spy on their neighbors
I mean there's so many positive uses for
these that I think we will see far
outweigh the negative uses once you
start seeing them being used for some
function agriculture I think it's going
to be the most likely and you and you
drive down the road with farms on either
side and you see the drones serving the
crops or spring you're like oh that's a
drone and then you start to associate it
with farming rather than military use
and that's how we change the narrative
what we've learned is that a lot of
people who are in government it's just a
matter of Education a lot of them don't
know with what these drums are capable
of and they don't know much about our
community and what we're planning on
doing so part of it is working with them
and letting them know what these guys
are capable of what we don't want is
really strict regulations that prevent
us from automating and creating an
opportunity for the drone market the
fact that that you know drones are
capable of doing a lot of aerial
surveillance at low cost wouldn't be
that big a deal but for the fact that
you know privacy law isn't largely up to
the task respondent for instance there's
a famous case involving a helicopter
that was flying over someone's property
and in fact looked into not you know not
even their yard but looked into some
missing panels in a greenhouse and
spotted the fact that they were growing
marijuana right when the Supreme Court
said that that wasn't even a search
because you have no reasonable fiction
of privacy of something viewable from a
public Vantage people don't have to know
that but that kind of doctrine is going
to be plied likely to Jones as well with
drones because of the very serious
safety issues they raised the FAA's
really been holding back the deployment
of drones you know commercial uses band
it's very difficult even for police
agencies to get permission to fly drones
and they can leaves in very limited ways
I think the people in the industry have
no problem with regulations we actually
want regulations so that we don't just
have anyone going out grabbing remote
Joe helicopters and flying around you
know we're using full scale helicopters
you know to get a tight shot on the
Santa Monica Pier for a movie and
backing away we could easily have an
unmanned system doing that same shot and
is it backs away if the unmanned system
fails and crashes and falls in the water
who cares right but if I have three guys
in a helicopter doing that same shot and
they're hovering outside the velocity
chart and their engine fails while
they're hovering outside the chart
chances are all three of those guys are
dying so I think what's happening right
now is just that the technology is far
outpacing the regulatory process
