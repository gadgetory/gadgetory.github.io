this is the biggest thing we've done
since we introduced the Mac in 1984 you
are going to kill yourself if you're not
at this thing you've got to trust me on
this so I went I'm Walt Mossberg I have
been reviewing tech gadgets since the
early 90s and collecting them since the
80s and I wanted to show you some of my
collection this is the original iPhone
2007 I was in the room when Steve Jobs
announced this this is one device and we
are calling it iPhone
today Apple is going to reinvent the
phone and it just upended the entire
mobile phone market it offended the
computing market really because today 10
years later and in my opinion are the
new personal computer and for Apple this
is now about 70 percent of their
business this is their principal product
they don't even call themselves Apple
computer and anymore and it's partly
because of this as a three and a half
inch screen at the time it was
considered to be really vivid color you
couldn't see color like that on any
other phone even though there were some
color phones and the big deal here was
ten finger multi-touch in a software
keyboard so that you got the use of the
whole three-and-a-half inch screen the
week as part of it ironically was the
phone even though it's called an iPhone
you know one of the things that struck
me and I think struck users and and
other reviewers immediately was the way
it felt in your hand the beauty of it
the perfection of the of the way the
metal and glass went together it was not
just high-tech it was not just powerful
it was beautiful this was like jewelry
and this was like a Swiss watch and that
was of course Apple's aspiration with
everything to do and I think they
achieved it with this I think the thing
that connects this to the current iPhone
in the next iPhone thing that that makes
this seminal is it's a window into the
whole world of what the internet and
digital technology can deliver but you
can put it in your pocket</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
