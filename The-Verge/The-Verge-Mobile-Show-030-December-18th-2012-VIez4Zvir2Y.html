this is the virtual show for the week of
December 17 2012 there's been a
remarkable amount of app news to talk
about so we're going to jump in I think
really really really fast my name is
dieter bohn i'm dan seifert and i'm
chris sigler and i'm still using a nexus
4 wait years when did you get that thing
was it like connecting it was like a
week week and a half ago yeah it's a
review unit from google and i know you
guys tease that I had lots and lots of
thoughts and feelings about it but yes I
listen to the show and you've expressed
most of my thoughts and feelings I'm
totally nervous about dropping it all
the time but on that I will say that I
dropped mine at least two or three times
a day and actually the chamfered edge
gentle- all scratched up now but it's
not cracked not correct no I've not yet
Craig the screen I appreciate how you
called it the chamfered edge it's like
you bought you bought Matisse's phrase
my pine and sinker he's running with it
I creation oh he took that from Apple oh
I totally took that from Apple ya know
it's it that only did they take the
glass design from Apple they took using
the word chamfer all over the place from
Apple used to be in you know maybe they
took via the glass from Apple but the um
you know the pattern on the back is very
unique to this device you have to give
it that yeah it looks it looks really
great when it's going to spider cracks
too yeah I the first Nexus 4 i had i
dropped unfortunately but it did not
crack just like you Dan I just busted up
the edge and I am also using a review
unit right now and this one I have not
dropped and as far as Google is
concerned I will never drop it if if I
if I do I will not tell Google yeah it's
fast I'm and so data speed not being an
LTE like that's hard but AT&amp;amp;T is better
in San Francisco on HSPA then I
remembered it being
before I made the switch to LTE phones
like I'm getting like seven down yeah
it's like that it's like that where I
live in the suburbs but in New York City
like Manhattan it's definitely still bad
right if you guys had like random quits
random crashes random reboots no but my
nexus 7 does all the freaking time like
twice a day with 4.2 it randomly reboots
I don't think I had anything on on the
latest patch I don't think I've had any
big problems there was a pretty
significant problem with the first build
like you know when you got the device
like you would immediately get an update
and and that first patch was the one
that I was having trouble with were like
um there were a lot of apps where like
you you tap on a text field the keyboard
would come up and then like you know
you'd be able to tap on the keyboard but
nothing would show up in the text field
and then you would discover that that
was happening in every app and then the
only solution was to reboot the device
if that was a pain in the butt I haven't
seen that happen on the latest patch
that's a good sign yeah so I mean you
know i wish i had more feelings that you
guys hadn't already said but I mean it's
if you don't need LTE it's kind of a
no-brainer like it's so but but define
so define don't need LTE because I think
that's a very like you know that's
becoming an increasingly important
question to answer and it depends on a
lot of factors where you fit well if you
live in a place where you don't have LTE
for example or if so here's my conundrum
is like I'm actually most of the time in
a place where I have Wi-Fi like mm large
percentage of the time so it's really
not killing me but the problem is when
I'm not I kind of unhappy if I tappa to
hit the dead zone or I'm oh I need it I
need it and so for coming up on CES
right and I am positive i'm going to
desperately want LTE at CES i'm not a
percent positive your HSE a possible it
won't work anyway so right and hopefully
the LT will we'll see what happens this
year but so like i'm going to need to
switch away from the nexus 4 and
week or so because I can't be like used
to using that phone and then switch
right for CES I need to have a phone
that I know is rock solid and LTE and
I'm thinking that it's going to end up
being an iphone 4 55 then that's that's
true dieter but keep in mind that this
year for the first time at CES there
will be tens of them tens of thousands
of people walking around with
lte-enabled iPhones right but I mean
what can I do I'm not going to switch to
verizon for CES well no what I'm saying
is that we might actually have crossed
that that at that point where HSPA
utilization is now on the decline and
you're actually gonna be able to send a
text message this year at CES unlike
previous years now now to be fair I've
every LTE smartphone that's currently on
the market is still using UMTS for for
voice and texting anyway but you know
that the real problem is the data
utilization and and I and you know a lot
more will be offloaded l to eat this
year than in years past well if you run
into a problem with LTE you can just go
in turn off LTE and you can use hspa+
assuming that's working that's true
that's true um in years past I've had
very little luck turning off HSPA and
using edge yeah I was always kind of
hoping that that would be my my fallback
but very rarely does that actually work
and I think the problem might be the
back hall in that case where it's you
know is it right regardless of what
spectrum you're connecting to on the
back end you're still going through the
same pipe and that gets clogged but I
don't know I don't know how much our
listeners care about the BC intricacies
of us gaap RCS experience maybe they do
I don't know I think they care about
having four score data and Apple maps ah
so I have many feelings about this oh ok
well let's hear them so if you didn't
hear the the rumor has gone out and wall
street journal reported that Eddy Cue
the savior of all things that happen to
be broken at Apple over the years is
talking to foursquare to possibly
include foursquare locate
data and the maps and that would
supplement Yelp and you'll notice it on
the off-chance you happen to
accidentally open Apple maps instead of
google maps on iOS right yeah so my
problem with force I use foursquare
pretty religiously actually um not
because I want other people to see where
I am yes sir because because I know it's
not because of the badges even it's
because I'm like having i like i like
having i like having a record of where
I've been how many times have been in
different places and it's kind of the
most convenient way to do that and you
know keeping track like what airports
I've been to what cities I've been to
one in airships do you have yes how many
mayorships I have what I'm asking you
know don't pretend like you don't know
if the top your head no I I just lost
one so i think i'm down to two now let
me I I remember the days when I had like
15 or more concurrent mayorships back in
like one thousand eight or 2009 before
everyone discovered Foursquare and
oldest more phone in their pocket and
now I might have like two or three tops
and I can never hold on to them I have a
hold on i'm looking my stats oh my god i
have to Mayor ships I bet you have zero
but I don't use it as religiously as you
because I'm not obsessed with getting
badges I i know i have the super mayor
badge from when i had like 10 or more
how do you find how many mayorships you
have from the stats menu if you go into
to me and then stats I've got badges you
got 21 badges I have way more than that
I don't have there's no stats menu here
I'm on a android phone I'm what bogus
version of the app you're using I have
39 badges which still isn't that many
actually um the seaway totally not
interesting yeah I don't know yeah what
are you what are your feelings about
maps uh so so here's my problem with
that I do enjoy Foursquare and I use a
pretty religiously but it is still very
much a problem today that no matter
where you are in the city and this I
mean
Chicago but I'm sure this holds true for
pretty much every major city and you get
a lot of like bogus uh p 0 is just you
know random things that people create it
because it's free for all right and it's
it's less protected yelp has that
problem too right I mean we talked about
what's-his-name the pot dealer few weeks
ago yeah but but I think the problem is
ten times worse with Foursquare because
the barrier to entry for creating a
bogus pui is much much lower and what
that you know normally I would say well
who cares like if you create a bogus Pia
why I don't you know doesn't have any
effect on me but it does because then
when I go to an area of the city that
has a bunch of legitimate POS around me
want to check into one of them your
bogus p oh I gets mixed into that list
along with the real one so I need to
sort of sift through it and I try to be
pretty good about flagging bogus venues
but I don't know how quickly force where
it gets its around to actually curating
those know how many people are flagging
as aggressively as I do so this is a
major problem for Apple right or anyone
else who wants to take four square dance
seriously they're gonna need to just
apply you know some top-level level
filters of you know it's got to have a
certain number of check-ins or something
in order to be legit maybe probably I
don't know I don't know about that
because it could just be whichever one
of the wrong locations or inaccurate
locations got popular first and then
everyone checks into that and everything
yeah and so unless someone is like
manually going in and editing them like
Foursquare has these super users that
can edit location data and make sure
that the address is correct the phone
numbers can all that jazz unless
someone's going in and doing that for
every single one ah I don't know it's
it's the whole problem of crowd-sourced
data that's inaccurate crowdsource dated
like Google Maps has crowd-sourced data
that based on your actual gps location
of your phone which you can't really
like spoof for altered but for squares
not that way right when you're adding a
location right so i think that that on
the whole d values I you know I'm sure
that four squares database has immense
monetary value to a variety of
institutions and no one more so than
Apple right now because they're in
desperate need of a reasonable yeah base
map in pio pio I database but that well
so it has the thing like your concern
about the data not being accurate I'm
sure that these negotiations are like
we're going to need to be able to mess
with your data however we want in order
to make sure that we don't have more
problems because I mean four squares got
an API I've gotten SDK like
theoretically Apple could just go in and
start using it so like they clearly need
more access to go in there and mess with
stuff right and they're there there's
probably I mean I you know I don't know
the details of the terms of service for
using four squares API but there are
probably some limits on how commercial
you can you can take it and and or how
heavily you can use it like I know that
with some of Google services there's a
trigger where if you go beyond a certain
number of hits per day or per week or
per month or whatever it is then you
need to start paying per per use and and
it could very well be that four squared
is structured the same way i'm not sure
but but regardless you know i'm sure i'm
sure that database has monetary but
monetary values the question is how much
is it devalued by the bogus p lies and
what can Apple do about it to your point
dieter you know like what kind of you
know crazy algorithm can they develop to
make it cleaner I don't know but but
they need to do something I still
believe and I know we've talked about
this in weeks past I still believe that
matched has significantly improved since
launch since iOS 6 launch and that's
that's purely as you know like just got
check like you know my feeling just
casually using the app I don't have any
empirical data to back that up but it
feels like it's getting better and then
of course there's the 800 pound gorilla
in the room which is google maps yeah
which makes this entire conversation
perhaps moot movie yeah I'm and I love
google maps on the iphone i think it's
great did you guys talking about it last
week I don't remember no it was before
the launch yes well we should so Google
Maps that's a much
thing I guess we could talk about it
assume that that was last week yet no um
it's great uh I think that there's some
issues with it not them not being like
immediately intuitive and like there's a
little bit of tapping and swiping and
whatever but once you get past that and
they've got a couple prompts when you
first launch the app to do that for you
it's great it's super fast and 10
minutes 10 million people agree with you
crandall eight is the download yeah yeah
that's right ten million in 48 no just
in the first 48 hours so right right
yeah anymore since then and if you go to
a penny and look at you know the top
downloads by country I think it's in the
top app in like 48 countries top free
app and like then the top five and like
the rest of they are they offer the maps
app in there are some countries where
they don't have all the transit data and
stuff yet so some people are yelling at
me a Twitter about that but I mean
whatever its if you've got it it's good
and it's really nice to have that
transit data back on an iphone as i've
been using transit I've been using
hopstop i've been using I have a whole
folder full of mass transit apps and I
hate them all I hate them all alive
they're more like terrible my navigate
folder that's got 10 apps in it right
yeah like it's it's great finally moved
it to my second suite like Oh hopstop
razzi pro transit CD transit embark I
bar caltrain and then I've deleted like
like eight others that I'd gave up on
already nice they're the worst like it's
like it's like I need to rename this
folder like like broken broken dreams
dreams sorrows it's like it's almost
like I'm turning into Dan with weather
apps that's really yeah yeah dan what is
it with you in weather apps I was nobody
how many weather apps are installed on
your main phone right now um well my i
seeso iOS 6 made me really happy because
i can now have more than 12 icons in a
folder I forget to feed my weather app
obsession so I've got 15 on my iphone
right now and
think i have four or five on my android
phone right so what you're saying that
the built-in weather app in iOS is not
it doesn't meet all your comprehensive
weather needs because they said your
comprehensive app it not only does that
it also is really ugly so I have this
like obsession with finding this like
the perfectly designed weather app that
gives me all the information and data I
want and need well need uh and but still
looks beautiful at the same time and so
I'm constantly spending money on weather
apps I think if i budgeted how much I
spent on weather apps in a year it would
be really embarrassing to find out put
it would put my kids through college or
something ah but yeah I mean and I'm
never satisfied so and the thing is like
I use like multiple at the same time
because I never trust one of them I'll
open up one it'll say it's 42 degrees
out and I'll rain in the next hour then
I'm like well now he must be lying so I
open up another one to double check well
you need to start saving up your money
dan because a company called dual just
released a Bluetooth adsb receiver for
iOS which allows you to download like
real-time FAA like radar like you know
like Noah radar to your iPhone well
designed for aircraft not for you but
you've yeah if you always been so it
just meets it's gonna be really ugly I'm
not gonna like it is a huge ugly gray
box that you need to pair to the phone
so it's probably not worth your time
this came up and chat but I want to
mention here yeah I guess you can have
it launched google maps from Serie if
you add by transit or via transit to the
end of your Siri query although well
chris welch said that it worked
intermittently for him i haven't tried
it yet but there's that so you can get
to it from Syria i I don't know maybe
I'm turning into a Google services
fanboy and we're going to get to that a
minute but man google search is just
faster and better on the iphone google
maps is better you know has more
comprehensive data gmail is better than
a for gmail stuff anyways and apples
built in stuff and
like I've got like I've got this like
little mini like Google world on my
iphone now like my whole screen is got
three google things I believe yet gmail
and think of Google Maps it really
torpedoes the notion you know I mean
people would obviously naturally like to
believe that Google has it out for all
phone platforms mobile platforms that
aren't Android but I think this you know
good this this latest release really
torpedoes that notion and and tells you
it you know it gets back to the core of
Google's business model which is
spreading and services as far and wide
as possibly can but maybe not there's
there is the windows phone situation
which we should talk talk about shortly
I'm going to take a moment here to see
if I can so uh you know with this to
your point Chris about how everyone says
out of head that Google attack is not
concerned about other mobile platforms
except for android just yesterday this
app for YouTube called YouTube uh-uh
what is it called no I totally blanking
on it right now Oh capture youtube
youtube capture right you capture yeah
which allows you to upload videos
directly from your iphone to youtube is
being launched on iOS first and which
google says it's coming to android and
they will be released on android at some
point but the fact that it's being
launched on iOS first in google went
through the effort of getting it through
the app store and approved and stuff
like that before launching it for
android just goes to show how much and
how important iOS is to google yeah yeah
it's not important enough to continue to
offer exchange activesync protocol
support to iphone users yeah but but
that's I mean that's it's a secondary
thing for iOS I mean that you know we
will all hold a funeral for the death of
push but at the end of the day this this
doesn't have as significant and impact
on iOS users because done Windows Phone
users yeah it simply because they can
get something like push although
true push from the gmail app you can get
notified but you can't get push and it
is really convenient to just even if you
don't have connectivity to know that you
can go into your email app and do some
email right and so I don't know like I'm
thinking I might be on my iPhone I might
set it up to just sink every 30 minutes
and not alert me just so I've got it
there in case I need it um instead of
having a not sink at all which is why
I've got it set up now and then use
gmail from push alerts but it is it's a
nice thing and so if you don't know
gmail has their google has is pulling
support for activesync exchange to sync
contacts calendar and email from its
services and this primarily they're
still going to leave it there for
professional Google Apps users but so it
affects consumers but it's going to hurt
the iphone and it's going to hurt a big
one and tom has written a great piece on
a Windows Phone and what kills me about
this is like the Microsoft not ruin
Microsoft's you know basically said
there was there their quote were
surprised yeah II yeah they were
surprised by the mid Microsoft was only
one no surprise with right yeah somebody
a Microsoft is not doing their job if
they were genuinely surprised I mean
they really had read the photographing
this for Google have been telegraphing
this for at least three or four months
if not longer yeah i mean like one of
the reasons we wrote that whole like
ecosystem wars piece was because we saw
this coming I mean I i was talking to
Kevin Mitchell I from crackberry com at
the last blackberry world like a few
months ago like he saw it coming um
Google is presumably paying millions
probably millions of dollars to
Microsoft and licensing fees for
exchange activesync you would think that
like whoever like has that contract and
manage that relationship might give them
a heads up that maybe something's gonna
change the near future yeah maybe like
it's insane how could they not be ready
for this I mean the PlayBook is ready
for this right rim was ready for this I
mean even to
even webos works well is still going to
work just fine because it's using like
the straight gmail sync protocols and
CalDAV and it does imap idle for push
like webos will do native gmail and
google services better than Windows
Phone starting on january thirtieth or
whatever it is they're killing like
that's insane oh that's that yeah that
is extremely depressing to hear that the
pre yeah I mean in although it's a
really fix for Microsoft to correct it
they just have to pump out caldav and
carport you're right you're right Dan
you're right do I throw it into you know
their regular updates that they've been
pushing out from windows phone 7 and
well they've got a couple out for
Windows money but like we're 7.8 like
what's the story oh yeah well yeah so
much yeah that's one concern I have is
that it's going to take a while to get
this update out they're gonna have to
pass it through all the carriers
obviously there's I don't think there's
any way they can get it done by the
january deadline but what I'm worried
about is that Microsoft is going to
mistake this as an opportunity to just
say well no we're not going to play ball
and push everybody into outlook and and
you know the remainder you know SkyDrive
etc etc um which I mean I'm not to knock
these services they're good products but
you're alienating a huge contention of
people who really don't have the time or
energy or desire to move out of the
Google ecosystem myself included but who
want to try windows shown so that they I
don't have the luxury of doing that
right and to be clear Jadakiss asus in
the chat is so as Google just gonna make
a gmail app for Windows home no they
said we're not really planning on doing
anything for windows phone we're not
really interested like that's hot right
that's harsh right and so um Tom Warren
you know Mike top guys like you know if
you think about it android is really
like competitive with Windows Phone
almost more than it is with with iOS
because it's the same business model
right it's you know get the OEMs on
board convince the carrier's to work
with you allow some customization
ah like the whole reason android even
exists if you go back and look at the
testimony from that oracle court case i
think it was was they were afraid of
windows mobile back of the day right so
it kind of makes sense that they're just
not gonna help Windows Phone become a
second ecosystem at all or third
ecosystem at all because you know why
should they they are they've already
lost you know they're not going to get
rid of iOS they they're they're not
going to like get those numbers way down
really quickly so they might as well
play on that but like I don't split see
incentive for them to be on Windows own
right or rim or you know whoever me go
forget the what's the name of the Allah
oh Allah Ya Ya Ya it bums me out because
I was you know it's just starting to I
I've been testing a illuminate 22 this
week and I it has made me appreciate its
give you a sneak preview of my review it
has made me appreciate the 8x much more
than i had and i love this i knew i knew
when you were like guys to say 22 is the
best like yeah talk to you a week you'll
see how you I have some thoughts which
you will read interview but no I you
know I I would seriously especially
after seeing the yellow and red a texts
in person which are like super awesome
and hot colors yeah I would strongly
consider having another goat Windows
Phone 8 perhaps after this this next
update comes out that fixes a few issues
but this this is a total deal breaker I
know that that is an overused term but
in this case it's not an exaggeration it
is a complete deal breaker if they don't
implement def and allow me to sync my
google services with the device I just I
I can't I can't move over to an all
Microsoft stack especially since it
becomes much more difficult to then go
back to other devices which all
inevitably have to do yeah it's a crappy
situation and again like I said before I
think there's a 0% chance then Microsoft
even if they work through the holidays
uh get the the you know the updates
squared away they can't push it through
all the OEMs and carriers in time for
this deadline i think it just doesn't
work that quickly I yeah I don't think
I'll say they just they just they'd like
they need to fix it and if they don't
like they're going to their you know
people still use i think is yahoo's
still more popular to sell more users
than than gmail worldwide i don't think
so i think gmail surpassed it in gmail
is finally surpass it yeah like it's
it's a big important service and it's a
big important service of amongst people
that you know you need to get liking
your platform and like it they just got
to make it happen and the fact that they
didn't see it coming is there either
straight applying for some you know
strange PR play or that's the only
explanation that can make any sense that
they're like no we don't know what's
going on so this summer gmail past 425
million users to be number one past
hotmail so yeah that's that contingent
that could be ignored people always tell
me you know whenever I complain about
something gmail related I always get a
bunch of tweets saying you know what
everybody uses gmail and I'm like that
may be true but but guess what a lot of
people do this is not a group of people
that can be readily ignored when you're
trying to build a platform yeah so I
guess we should we're probably going to
let Neil I get into this in depth in the
verge cast but we should at least touch
on this drama about instagrams terms of
service you know you've got I mean we
talked about until Twitter's grab
filters and now Instagram Facebook owns
them is updated the Terms of Service and
everybody's freaking out they're going
to sell your pictures and then they're
going to put ads on them baba and what's
weird to me is that the backlash against
what are relatively innocuous and
unsurprising terms I mean they're not
great but I don't know that they
actually go all that much further any
further than I would have
expected from facebook own company but
the base a I strongly agree yes I
totally agree with you and be people
need to stop flattering themselves your
your pictures aren't good enough for
Instagram to sell them like does it just
stop the illusion that that your your
pictures are you know were taken by God
himself and Instagram is now going to
sell them on the open market I think
what really blew me away here was uh the
vast majority of people i know that use
Instagram have public profiles I know
it's possible to make them private but
most people don't most we will have a
public profile and I'm seeing all these
tweets that are like oh I'm going to be
really careful posting pictures of my
kids and posting like my house and stuff
and I'm like you had no problems posting
it to a public service before and now
all of a sudden this sentence changes it
now you're you have no you're gonna have
taken issue with posting a picture of
your kid to a public internet service
which I find to be very amusing at least
yeah so if there's one part of me kinda
wants the drama to continue and get
worse because part of me is still
rooting for Flickr to come back and like
they just released their new iOS app
it's pretty good and the thing that is
underappreciated about Flickr is for
years for a decade they have had really
clear well established Creative Commons
licenses that you can apply to your
photos like as you upload them and so
you could say these are the rules for
this picture and it's right there on the
site was right there in the picture all
the time and that's great I would really
like to see flickr come back as a photo
service because it does a much better
job of archiving and you know keeping
your photos and searching and so on like
the yeah we know that flickr has is way
behind the times but if they could if
marissa meyer at yahoo is doing anything
other than walking into the flickr
division and throwing money and
resources at them then I don't even know
what to say because there's a huge
opportunity there why does nobody ever
talk about the cop I like picasa casa
sucks what why
tell me why it's picasa is the google
wave of photo services now if there's
nothing wavy about it it's it's just
straight forward as you can you know its
way about it nobody uses it nobody cares
oh yeah but-but-but photo photo archival
and like if I need to drop a link to
somebody to like show them a picture or
if I need to like upload and store my
photos in the cloud I don't need a
service that everybody uses I just need
a service that works and witnesses would
like to have some sort of social element
built into that but picasa is integrated
well first of all it has Google+
integration second of all I just thought
that was how do I take you off of the
hangs like I have the power how do I let
us just let us say no and and secondly a
picasa is integrated into android so you
can go into gallery and upload a photo
straight to picasa from there don't care
so I really think that I know there's
been a bit of talk about this and I
think there's been some rumors or
whatever about how different services
could be applied here but a Dropbox
seems like the perfect service to me
because I already have a ton of storage
for dropbox my phones all automatically
upload all of my photos to dropbox so if
i wanted to share it with somebody very
quickly and easily i can do that but the
only problem is right now everything
goes into this crazy camera uploads
folder which is disorganized and a mess
unless you are writing a script to
organize it which I think I know someone
who actually did that but if Dropbox saw
the opportunity where it's got users
that have 50 gigabytes 75 gigabytes or
100 gigabytes of storage and it was
offered some sort of organizational
system where you could directly upload
your photos into specific folders
automatically and things like that I
think it would be great like that's
exactly what it sounds like you're using
picasa for Chris it's just drop boxes
yeah wait are ubiquitous yeah so I just
had a dream I mean I know that I think
because Jagran were doing farvel is
talking about Dropbox again then that
Apple should have bought them back when
the back of the day when they tried or
they were considering it or something I
don't know
imagine if Yahoo about Dropbox why am i
all pro yahoo today I don't know but
like that would be like that would show
that they're like smart and they get it
and they're back and like integrating
job dropbox flickr in some way I don't
know be on board Sam why um so I'm a
total flickr amateur can somebody
explain to me why everyone in the world
has a flickr pro account so i used to
have a flickr pro account and i needed
to like actually yours and you needed to
get back to your old photos and to like
up there was a cap so back in the day
like storage wasn't free unlimited and
easy to get and so they needed to have a
cap on the number of photos you know the
amount of space you could take up and so
it's just sort of a legacy from that but
if you let your pro and slaps apparently
so like say i think that the the free
account has a limit of something like
200 photos and like four sets or
whatever and if you let your if you make
a pro account and you upload all these
extra photos and create all these other
sets and you let it lapse you can't
access more than 200 of your photos
unless you renew your pro account and
then somehow download all your photos to
your heart well at least it doesn't like
just get rid of them it could be without
it just holds them for you it holds him
ransom until you renew your froat you
guys uh you know actually I'm holding
out for text America to come back you
guys ever used text America like before
flicker I can't say like share photos
yeah yeah it was you was uploading
pictures from my um my treo 600 on this
thing and you know there were like
literally like 200 x 300 and that i
could post him on to my weblog time your
livejournal yeah i'm not i'm i'm reading
up on text America right now it was an
amazing service and like nobody like I
was like you guys this is awesome
they're like okay whatever and now you
know the same kind of idea has turned
into you know some like get bought four
billion dollars was oozing that that
text America next text America is the
friendster of photos
that's what you're saying goodbye it's
like what it coulda shoulda it's like
the live journal of photo sharing yeah
yeah oh yeah hit the Dead Pool on
December first 2007 wow that died early
yeah tragic ah what other app news I
mean there's just been a ton like
snapchat added video facebook is rumored
to launch a snapchat thing so you can
send self-destructing pictures and
videos to people you mentioned that
youtube capture thing facebook is native
on android now which i'm really happy
about because it was so terrible before
and then facebook is apparently going to
try again with nearby which is based on
gowalla right or like it's like the
people that work on gowalla when i was a
show yeah I believe the integrated the
team if not the technology when they
bought go all of ya so you know are they
going to make break that up into a
separate app how many like we've got a
bunch of apps from Google we've got a
bunch of apps now from facebook it's
like it's not enough just to have like a
popular app you need to start trying to
take over the whole screen right yeah I
can totally envision a world you know
five or ten years from now we're
facebook basically resembles google in
almost every way with with deep search
with you know not just across people but
across the entire internet and then all
these other services that like you save
you are broken out on your device
they're all going that way apple's going
that way and so i think it's going to be
it's going to be a very challenging
environment for google and ways that
they're not accustomed to being
challenged the other jennifer mercat is
all up in your your junk chris about not
understanding flickr crow that's awesome
i'm at picasa man i don't know what to
tell you so there was even rumors that
facebook could be going for for google's
bread and butter in advertising
rightfully the purchase of microsoft's
whatever it was called which is an ad
plan at displaying platform just like
Edwards so and they were going to move
to
no that was amazon that was going to
move to a bidding model which also goes
off that that's another thing entirely
let's look hardware yeah so the HTC m7
4.7 inches 468 PPI since five hope since
five is like you don't make sense we're
just not doing it anymore this is called
sense 5 it looks like it's right for
point to any any manufacturer that
doesn't do a 4k sub 5 inch display and
13 is dead to me like 4k or die I enough
of this 1080p garbage I've moved on well
we've got the Sony you go uh uh coming
over 81 great game maybe now I hope
that's the the retail name or Xperia you
got I guess it would be so and then so I
think what we can expect is like Sony's
probably going to show their stuff at
CES and then HTC is going to show their
stuff at Mobile World Congress and then
Samsung is going to be later in the year
again because we we know that the s4 is
not it's not definitely not going to be
CES I'm betting it that's not going to
be overlooked Congress again I'm hoping
that Samsung brings a sequel to the
Galaxy Beam to mwc their showstopper at
mwc last year so well they just
announced the grand which is a 5 inch
device but its mid-range so welcome to a
world where giant android phones can be
kinda sucky galaxy grand is is another
winner of a name I think we're not gonna
be able to escape 5-inch devices next
year it's just gonna be like every
single manufacturers gonna have them
between um you know HTC has already got
as Samsung's already's got it samsung is
moving it down market there's this rumor
there's this rumor of a six point three
inch on a note 3 galaxy note 3 yeah
which kind of has some some credence
it's not salad at this point but there's
some credibility to it so that's scary
dreams like that like the note 2 i I
think both of you guys have had played
with a note to this file right guys it's
it I can just barely
like it you want to handle it like a
like a phone but you have to
realistically you have to handle it like
a tablet otherwise you're going to drop
it and at 6.3 there's there will be no
getting around it even if you like i
said my post last week about this rumor
even if you took the current chassis of
the note 2 and extended the screen out
to the very edge you'd only be at
something like five point seven five
point eight inches and that's assuming
they can completely eliminate the bezel
like on the the razr m yeah so they're
they're gonna they're gonna have to
expand the size of the chassis any way
you slice it and that's that's a very
scary thought it's a vid this is that's
a frightening thought well just as you
just think about all of the phone like
that's the one when this thing comes out
of it's this big we're just it's a small
tablet just leering says I gotta be
that'll be in that thing though it'll be
four thousand billion our minimum yeah
uh well HTC is not gonna make a big
screen windows phone speaking of big
screens I mean that makes sense but it's
a bummer like the whole point of Windows
Phone 8 was we were supposed to let
manufacturers go crazy and weird specs
how many Titan tues do you think they
sold oh my god I mean well they sold
enough Titan ones to make a Titan to
know and I mean and it's all it's all
relative I guess right because HTC
hasn't released like a 4.5 or 4.7 inch
Windows Phone 8 but no keys got a 4.5
inch one and yeah you know Samsung's is
how big is the samsung Display 4.6 or
4.7 or 4.8 something like that so yeah I
think hmm what would you say about nokia
oh I was like Nokia's got the 4.5 inch
920 yeah and then the the the the atty
VES display i think is sourced from the
galaxy s3 round society 4.8 inch so
right at e speaking of speaking of the
ax t VES where it's out somebody in her
for somebody in our forms has one in the
US or in Europe I don't know I just saw
I think Tom said they went on sale in
the UK for like half a second and they
sold like two of them and we're like
we're out of stock as I know you're
trying to get one
I want an atty vests Oh as it's
difficult to get that's the thing i want
it if l1 Chris it's like it's like a
crappy galaxy s2 is what it feels like
ouch the galaxy s2 yeah it feels like a
crappy GS 20 interesting we don't I Sam
but like what do you think Samsung's
motivation is for like half assing a
single windows windows phone 8 device I
don't know you know what it was a
samsung really wants to be on you know
in with Windows RT for convertibles and
tablets and stuff like that I bet
Microsoft was like yeah well you gotta
throw us a bone with Windows Phone 8
yeah no that's exactly what happened and
in my instance I was like okay packaging
ship yeah we'll put our b-team on that
right away yeah yeah and you know how
Samsung like it you know Samsung can you
know if they put their mind to it they
can probably turn around a new phone
from quote-unquote scratch and probably
like 10 days well it's its parts bin
right like this is the GI model from the
90s when like GM buick pontiac yeah and
everyone else like they all had the same
car with like a different badge of this
is the the the what is what was that car
called uh the cake are no the Cadillac
Sumerian of what I've never heard of
this exactly the Catholic some errand
was the Cadillac version of the Cavalier
in the eighties you are lying to me
cannot revenge i would i would engage
Chris on this to be good my my my mother
has to work for GM for 45 years I know a
thing or two about GM vehicles which
which Cavaliers were they rebadge about
see one yeah cuz I own like three of
those so so you know what this really
reminds me of is if you're familiar with
the pontiac solstice which is literally
a sports car for Pontiac that GM went
and dug into its parts bins and was like
we're using a suspension from this an
engine from this and like you know
interior from this and then we're just
going to wrap a slightly new shell
around it and that's that's exactly what
the Solstice was and that's that's what
like the a-team
feels like yeah I just I just I just
dropped a link to the Samiran in our
hangout chat by the way which I don't
have open how many chats so many chats
put it in the postman then we head out
at some errand I don't know how you
pronounce that's tomorrow it's gotta be
soon Ron no it would have to be 2 m's to
be cimarron or two I don't know I'm not
good with English language but you can
see what I'm talking about it's a
cavalier anyway uh yeah this is such a
dumpster fire of a car oh my no it is it
it's one of the this is the car that
literally destroyed you like GM's path
to destruction started with this vehicle
and it culminated and I'm going bankrupt
but up but so anyway the t VES i think
is the kid like samara knows oh my god
this is hideous well yeah okay um so
yeah I the only reason i will be buying
an atty best is because it's hard to
find not because actually how much will
you pay to import it that's the question
yeah no one not a penny more than 800
that is where I draw the line was so
let's talk about the nexus 4 and the
supply issues there they're putting the
blame squarely on LG yeah but then he
took the the Google+ post down didn't he
oh did he yeah I think he did so this
google guy posted he basically is like
I'm totally sorry that we suck at
shipping Google pluses or Nexus force
wow they suck a ship is 20 what does
that come from peter hasn't woken up yet
if you notice we're a little bit earlier
than than usual so that hour and a half
no but you are absolutely right they do
suck at at shipping google+
statement yeah I don't know if the
comments still there not any way I mean
yeah so it's LG's fault for not being
able to get it to them the supplies to
the manufacturer are scarce and erratic
like that's pretty damning yeah I'm
totally not surprised by it but I mean
that's just it just makes it worse not
only our supply is scarce and erratic
but like Google can't get their
storefront together like we've been
complaining about over and over again
yeah they have no idea how to run a
retail yes supply chain its retail 101 I
mean especially since the hardest part
with retail is customer service right
you're face-to-face dealing with the
customer and Google barely has to do
that because people just click by and
they have to deal with a problem after
the fact if it happens and like the
simple part is making sure that you have
enough of Product X 2 cells and
customers and telling the customer
whether you have it or don't have it
it's not right I mean at this point I
don't even know that the nexus program
is for they can't sell devices they
don't push it they're not trying to be
really serious about getting big volume
with it they say that they want it to be
no show to showcase what the best of
what Android can be but every single
Nexus device is just some slightly
repackaged version of an android phone
that's already out there from another
OEM it's like it's nerved its nerved in
some tragic way galaxy with the Galaxy
Nexus it was to the camera yeah with the
nexus 4 obviously it's LTE what will it
be with it with the next one so probably
it's like what's like the only thing I
can think of why the Nexus program even
exists is they're like well we need some
harp some modern hardware to develop
stock Android on because that's what we
do so we'll have somebody give us
something we can put stock Android on
and well what the hell we've already got
to make five thousand of them for Google
employees we might as well make a
hundred thousand because screw it again
that's that's what the Nexus is it's
like yeah it's it's a quick round off
retail strip yeah it's a playground for
the
android stock android developers because
like where else do you see stock android
except for on the nexus devices you
don't exactly so yeah as tragic as it is
maybe we'll start to see it more with
motorola beginning in 2013 maybe with
motorola but we won't from HTC we
recently uh Jeff one of our guys out in
Japan interviewed one of HTC's design
directors and he pretty much flatly said
that sense is the way that we're going
yeah yep and hey I mean you know I give
them credit for you know developing a
plan and sticking to it I do not give
them credit for being able to make a UX
that is that doesn't make you want to
throw the phone at the wall I mean I and
I get you know a lot of people love
sense or at the very least tolerate it
you know I know a lot of people a lot of
normals with HTC devices and they you
know they've just come to understand
expect that this is how their phone
works so the fact that you know the
craving experience that can be
comprehended by normal people is is good
I guess yeah but there's nice bits but
it's just like I at this point I can't
get over the feeling that like there's
something slow here and there design
aesthetic and like sort of big big huge
gradient buttons doesn't help with that
either so I think the problem is that
all of us know what stock Android is
really like and how much better it is
and how much more intuitive and nicer
looking and faster the person going into
the average phone sort it doesn't
because they never see it because it's
only on Nexus devices so that's why
sense works for God you guys take
Motorola's gonna do it do you think
google motorola are gonna like here it
is motorola well remember we buddies
wait it out well okay yeah when i
interviewed them you know back in the
day and not when i went to the droid m
launch event not the launch of it but
like them really giving review units out
to people event they're basically like
yeah you know verizon makes us do it
I've got to find the exact quote but
like they just don't have a power
and I don't know if they will not with
Google and I'm better I I gotta find
this thing somebody to chat find me this
post crowdsourcing I like it moto with
ya know motorola calls stock android the
right thing but vows to verizon
customization going forward we're going
to try and be as close to the base as we
can be because we think that's the right
thing for users well i gotta wonder
though how much Verizon's customizations
that that means because like if you look
at motorola's android 4.1 phones now cuz
they've got the HD Maxx and the HD up to
4.1 and the em they're still like these
UI tweaks that are definitely motorola
they've got that special access bar on
the left home screen the home screen
layla is actually really different
because you only start with one and the
launchers a little different and things
like that I don't think any of that is
mandated by Verizon I think verizon is
like we want the my verizon app on there
we want VZ navigator we want our suite
of apps and if we're getting paid by
Emma's I only want you to put all these
amazon apps on as well so i think they
really could do a essentially stock
android by just and just shove the
verizon apps on there cuz that's that's
more than likely what verizon is looking
for yeah um yeah I you know I I'll of
motorola's hardware I love with you know
the directions they've been going I mean
I don't love it what does I love it no I
mean I think yeah love is the wrong word
I am encouraged by the direction you
know the things that they've been trying
to pursue in the past 18 months with
their devices not at all them the atrix
HD is kind of a stinker yeah but but the
you know I think the razor series is a
very promising line but you know I I
think it you know Google's CFO made a
point there last earnings call they made
a very very specific point of saying
that you know when they bought the
company they had this long pipeline of
pre committed devices that they needed
to get out before they really started to
take control of what was right now that
division so I think that that was a tell
I think they were trying to
you know point out to people that there
would be a very different kind of
motorola motorola device coming up in
ansal 2013 so a litigator whether the
partnership with verizon continues i
think is another question altogether i
think it would be pretty amazing to see
uh you know a nexus looking device come
from motorola because it it's well-known
that google has a very influential
design directive on the nexus devices
and you know the galaxy nexus and the
nexus 4 are virtually identical looking
until you get really close to them and
it if that's google's like design ethos
for smartphones and it like makes the
motorola team do that that'd be kind of
cool yeah yeah yeah I I would love to
see like they continued the thing
verizon and verizon gets the droid but
they're like you know what we're just
making the same thing and releasing it
gsm unlocked and it's with LTE and it's
the same thing but stock because that's
what they did it you know they did with
the milestone i think back in the day
remember that yeah as a droid just fan
uh yes yes I do yes I need to wrap my
brain for a minute but yes I do yeah you
you know old crappy Cadillacs I know old
crappy motor okay well I hate to say
this guy's but we actually have got some
stuff we need to run and do in like two
minutes so we got to keep this podcast
short so you won't get to hear us
complain about lawyers and Samsung
injunctions which have been lifted or
darn aren't happening they're not going
to get banned in the US or blackberry 10
or sprint by and clearwire but those are
all boring stories anyway so you know
perfect re blackberry 10 I've got a file
so Twitter you should I'm back lon dan
is DC seaford chris is e power vladislav
we will hopefully see him again soon we
will see you next week thanks for
watching hey guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
