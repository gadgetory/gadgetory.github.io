you did and you went out a little bit of
a travelogue give a travelogue of Ross
and I went on what I would call it a
fantasy adventure through party town
okay that's what you call i did take a
look at this it's it's quite interesting
let's go south by southwest South by
Southwest is a place where everyone on
Twitter gets together and uses Twitter I
just want to choir the job as the girl
in the battery code you have to work for
fedex what you say the average
percentage points are charging you give
to people um I provide 10 minutes of
free power to all South by Southwest
attendees who need it is it cool to go
from from battery to battery person like
a white guy can I walk you to the next
battery lady there's no transmitted via
music um no good cuz I'm not I mean I do
have this rubber on there are no rules
here because everyone is their own boss
what are you the co-founder i'm the
founder of scat oh i'm the co-founder of
grey p 0 with co-founders of grip no
calm i'm looking front of silicon
students and I'm part of the sterilized
team we're 10 co-founders and I'm one of
them Wow what Steph my stuff was like
for you as a start-up founder I'm pretty
overwhelming so much going on
everybody's here lots of it was am a new
friends old friends I mean in terms of
being over stimulated do you think the
combination of music talking to me
Mountain Dew green tic tacs and bright
blue shoes it's maybe a little too much
hi shows you people within a couple
blocks of where you are so everyone that
shows up on here is near me right now
there's a lady here we have one mutual
friend what how do you find her let's
just call that Jo Jo Ann honey Casey
Chuck Chuck Herman Matt Garbutt I have
to say highlight kind of feel it out
right now good batteries entertained
though
komsan don't like it here you guys have
a start-up to pitch me you came here on
a bus yes I came here and start a bus
what is the sort of us none of us we're
on the bus from San Francisco all the
way down to South by Southwest what
happened on the bus startups get created
on the bus I help lunch to startups one
of them is called Tex wrote txt Roo com
it's Yelp for underdeveloped countries
is the co-founder of texture and GRL oh
hey guys how's it go I can you keep
smelling it txt ro is it is it txt ro
calm guys it's txt ro com what is self
myself was to you it's a great place to
meet awesome people from all different
walks of life and let serendipity take
its course and I have some business
outcomes come out of it we say
serendipity take this course do you mean
like the actual concept or the movie
with John Cusack the actual concepts
last time I was here I got about a
quarter million dollar deal out of just
being at some party like this and
meeting the right person what are you
thinking the movie serendipity with John
Cusack I'm sorry Silicon Valley and I
this conference I think is test injured
they believe that they stand apart they
are capable of building anything the
barriers to building anything
zero right any kid what graduate they'll
have $99 descriptions today I funded
whatever program that's great it's
awesome that part of it is amazing right
but they believe that they don't exist
in society we believe that the rules do
not apply them in any way and that they
shouldn't even be kind of angry about
the rules because they exist completely
separate
I think what I learned is if you want to
enjoy south west southwest you just have
to let go and do the same stupid is
everyone else
good this is this is going to ruin my
career wha
I was taken to the heights of enjoyment
and the terrible name and then just
dropped like a demon drop the depths of
unhappiness yeah by you did you take us
start up bus back to New York did you
like to start I rode the startup train i
co-founded it oh really start up turning
that way ha no ha ha is that is it like
a start-up train or is it like a train
where you do start that's both no no we
we're pivoting really the train are you
interested in any people going around in
come back yeah I would love to because
co-founders everybody everybody thought
of train yes startup trade</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
