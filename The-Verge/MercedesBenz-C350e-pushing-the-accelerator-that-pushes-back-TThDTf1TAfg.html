the beautiful Bay Bridge here in San
Francisco and we are here for a
mercedes-benz event now the main event
is the fon 5 luxury in motion the
self-driving car we saw at CES but we
are also driving the C 350 e that has a
plug-in hybrid drivetrain and can run up
to 20 miles on electrical loan we had a
chance to drive the C 350 e down the
coast aways and there are a few
interesting features about this car the
most interesting is the accelerator it
has haptic feedback which means that as
you put your foot on it it applies
resistance against your foot so that you
know when you're about to engage the gas
engine so if you don't want to engage
the gas you can avoid it just by not
overpowering that resistance and then
also when you're coming up on a car in
front of you it sort of pulses the
accelerator very quickly twice it feels
like someone's tapping on your foot and
that indicates that it's time to take
your foot off the accelerator now you're
not going to buy this car over a Tesla
Model S but then again it's not designed
to compete with the Model S it's a very
different card a very different price
point it's smaller the performance
envelope is different really it's
designed to compete with a BMW 3-series
which the c-class is always designed to
compete with BMW has hybrid versions of
that now and now Mercedes has a version
of the c-class to match it's going to be
coming out in the US later this year and
now I'm go get driven around in a
self-driving f015</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
