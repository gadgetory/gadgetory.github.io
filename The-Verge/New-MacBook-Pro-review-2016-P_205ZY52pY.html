laptop was once the benchmark for
balancing power portability price and
epic battery but his design display
haven't changed for six long years now
and those years are started to show we
used to be the best mobile computer in
the world is now an outdated relic it's
time for an heir to the air and this is
if the $14.99 metal pro 13 inch without
is the thinnest and lightest macbook pro
that apple has ever made and a first
blush it looks like everything that air
users have been asking for much nicer
display and much better specs without
any sacrifice of portability but what
Apple is created here isn't really a
MacBook Air or macbook pro as we've
known them for so long what this
computer represents is the
professionalization of the 12-inch
MacBook from last year a pro MacBook if
you will the design is a perfect match
for the Mac right down to the metal
bottom of the display the space gray
color option and the Apple logo on the
lid that no longer luminate also like
the MacBook there are almost no ports on
this new MacBook Pro get a headphone
jack on the right to use BC connections
on the left and that's it this is the
most drastic change Apple's made to
smack computers in a long time and leads
to a ton of compromises want to upload
pictures from your camera
there's no SD card slot so you need a
don't want to backup your data to an
external hard drive you need either an
adapter or whole new Drive he'll even
plug in an iPhone requires a new cable
adapter yes ok the new port support on
the boat 3 which has a gajillion
gigabits of bandwidth but that's the
tech of the future not the present the
MagSafe charger is another victim of the
USBC revolution which is handling
magnetic latching being replaced by a
stiff connector it's much harder to
attach and detach and doesn't have an
LED status light if you can get over the
shock of losing every useful port in
your laptop and I'm still not sure that
I can this new MacBook Pro is a classic
work of aluminum art from Apple the
hinge is strong and just glides open the
bezels around display a tiny there are
stereo speakers frame the new keyboard
and the touchpad is downright enormous
that limousine size touchpad may look
excessive but I love it and because it's
for such I can click the top of it in a
way that can't do with a mechanical
switch of a MacBook Air the keyboard has
an upgraded version of the MacBooks
butterfly mechanism and it really has a
much better feel I didn't like it at
first and many people might never like
it's shallow key travel
but once I stopped testing the keyboard
and just started typing naturally it all
came together nicely the biggest upgrade
with this MacBook Pro is the display
which is just stunning
we're the same wider color gamut of the
iPhone 7 and 5k iMac it looks great from
literally any angle I want to say it's
obviously better than the preceding
MacBook Pro but it is in technical terms
but 67% great contrast and 67% higher
brightness photographers will love this
display for editing once they figured
out the suitable work around for the
dongle situation magnet pros performance
won't let you down either as a handles
both Photoshop and Lightroom nicely this
might look like the ultra portable
MacBook but it performs like a real pro
laptop battery life on this new MacBook
Pro doesn't rival the s 12 hours but it
does achieve Apple's claimed 10 hours
I'm a writer so my typical use may be a
bit more forgiving than other
professionals however I keep seeing a
perfect match between remaining
percentage and hours of battery life 90%
is nine hours 40% is four hours and so
on Apple seems to have deliberately
targeted 10 hours as the benchmark but I
have little to no worries about the
battery it lasts a consistently long
time as new and future facing as this
MacBook may be it embodies a lot of
familiar Apple strengths great
industrial design and touchpad economics
reliable performance and solid battery
life but it's also taken away user
friendly features like the SD card slot
USB ports and the MagSafe charger with
Windows rivals catching up fast and this
new laptop costing $14.99 as a starting
price I'm inclined to give Dell Lenovo
and razer a shot before deciding on my
MacBook Air upgrade if you're determined
to stick with Mac OS this new MacBook
Pro is the obvious and easy choice for
step up from the air it's also much
better and more powerful than $12.99
MacBook
but even if ordered existed with Apple
laptops there's still the temptation of
the more expensive MacBook Pro with the
touch bar which actually is something
unique about it so where does that leave
this new touch list MacBook Pro it's a
good computer price like a great one
it's the future
crammed into the present but it's also
the most affordable new macbook pro and
therefore the one if any that most of us
will buy as such it's a beautifully
designed very thin and light unibody
slab of Apple branded compromise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
