Facebook's oculus is coming up next year
and it's going to be big but is Google
even in this game they have this thing
called cardboard that's well made out of
cardboard and you stick an Android phone
in it and you can look around to stuff
you can play in VR there's people that
are doing a lot of really cool stuff
with it but it's mostly just a bunch of
little tech demos so the question I have
is is this for real
or is it just an experiment first of all
not at all an experiment in a sense
first of all that we have a large team
working on cardboard and the things
around cardboard so certainly inside
Google it's not viewed as an experiment
the thing that's important and powerful
about cardboard yes it's made out of
cardboard but that's also its strengths
that for a couple bucks anyone with the
computer in their pocket there that they
already have can have a taste of VR this
kind of bite-sized via our experience so
Google's making a new version that's
announcing this year and the big deal
with this is that it works with larger
phones it can work with phones up to six
inches or work with an iPhone 6 plus or
Nexus 6 and they also got rid of the
magnet and instead it has this crazy
little button inside with conductive
foam that actually uses an interior
hinge mechanism to in essence tap the
screen it kind of moves your finger via
some conductive foam inside the
cardboard and it's as if you're pushing
on the screen one of the things Google
is doing with cardboard is this project
called expeditions it's this giant
cardboard box it's full of these visors
and some nexus phones and a tablet and
it lets teachers lead virtual field
trips for their classroom so instead of
wheeling in the old VCR and CRT TV it's
a little bit like Magic School Bus kids
can go on virtual expeditions it
basically can turn any teacher into Miss
Frizzle all right I am looking at some
woods and there's some people standing
off yeah then there's and if you look to
your left and I can actually see where
you're looking here that is the wave
rock and
huh so the wave rock it's in Perth
Australia
okay honest this rock shaped like a tall
breaking ocean wave and if you look up
well I see there's an arrow in my view
that's right so I was actually pointing
out one interesting feature of the wave
rock as I move around the arrow like
gets less like hey stop well here what
you're doing so what's interesting is
these are these two guys are sort of so
actually since I started a gonna stop
class for a second because it sounded
like you're gonna ask you a question
yeah we're gonna connect the last row
second since these started at two
different spots they both are looking in
the same space but like relatively
speaking they were like different
positions so like this one saw the hills
over here and this one saw it over here
so as a teacher you're looking at 30
kids all looking at the same thing they
all like you've got a classroom of like
38 year-olds going in totally different
directions it must be hilarious the
footage is wonderful okay the reaction
you get from your students in these
classes is if they're they're looking up
at something like wow that's big or
looking right oh my god we're scuba
diving right on it from from our
classroom there's something pretty
special about it and so these are
actually sandstone formations that have
been eroded over many many thousands of
years sorry limestone so tell me the
truth - do do you know all this or do
you have a cheat sheet on your tablet
that is giving you all this information
I have a cheat sheet okay and in fact
that's one of the one of the features of
expeditions we found students would
never know I sound as a teacher right
like I've actually been here it's really
important because I think you know just
just as a tour guide in the place would
know all about that place when you're
the tour guide as the teacher we want to
make sure that you're able to take the
class through the things that matter
right and of course you could write your
own tour as a teacher another thing
they're doing is VR is they're releasing
a spec Celyn anybody can build their own
360 degree camera with 16 GoPros it's
pretty wild so the camera has 16 lenses
oriented around the circumference
of a circle all looking out and we use
those 16 images the images from those 16
cameras we upload those to Google Data
Center and then we have a set of
algorithms which use pretty deep
computational photography techniques to
from those 16 images create on the order
of a thousand images so it's as if you
had a thousand cameras instead of 16
around the circle you know stitching
them together you're actually making
like a continuous exactly right so
you're not just trying to jam two images
together but instead if you think about
okay I need to I need to see what the
left eye and the right eye would see
here you're taking these two images on
the circumference and then when you're
looking here you're taking these two
images and then these two images and
when you have a thousand images to take
from you can get perfectly smooth and
and perceptually accurate in a sense
that you have correct uniform stereo and
no stitching artifacts throughout the
entire sphere you're in essence creating
something from nothing you're create
it's as if you had built a camera made
up of a thousand cameras but of course
that would violate the laws of physics
but we've done that in software and the
results are really stunning where you
can just step into a video into a place
and experience it like you're actually
there so like how much like for like 30
seconds of VR footage like how long does
it take to process that I know there's
no exact answer but guys are starting a
ton of yeah so for 30 seconds of VR
footage well the nice thing is we can
always point more computers at it who
will has a few computers so we can point
more computers at it and do it in real
time if we want it we could do a live if
we want it it's just a matter of
spinning up more and more computers so
did you catch that bit about Google
needing to use its servers to process
all the video from that camera those
servers are actually a sign they're a
tell that Google has way bigger
ambitions and virtual reality than they
let on so far with their little
cardboard projects so it's a really cool
rig but it requires all this processing
power and while I'm willing to go out
and buy a bunch of 16 GoPros it's good
why not create a new kind of super
camera that could just do it without
having to do all this insane stitching
power on the back
is that is that a thing that is even
possible that's a great idea
it was just software and atoms and so on
right and one of the many things we're
thinking about
so that's cardboard the new version
works on any size phone and it'll even
work with an iPhone if you can find the
apps for it it's fun and you can play
lots of little games and you could even
take kids on a virtual field trip but
it's obvious that Google has way bigger
ambitions they're not gonna let Facebook
and HTC and Sony have VR all's of
themselves but for now they're sticking
with this because I think they believe
that the best VR is that when you have
with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
