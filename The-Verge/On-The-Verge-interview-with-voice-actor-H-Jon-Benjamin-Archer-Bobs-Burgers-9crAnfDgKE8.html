actor what do you see yourself first and
foremost a Jew you may not recognize
John Benjamin's face but you almost
certainly know his voice from home
movies dr. Katz Archer he played a can
of vegetables in what hot American
summer we had a chance to sit down with
prolific voice actor just as he was
wrapping up this past season of Bob's
Burgers how can you recognize and is it
by sight or sound it's by smell
basically yeah you'd get that a lot yeah
that's definitely John Benjamin yeah
I'm not thronged by people but said
daily do you ever like you do you ever
like go to like a crowded burger place
it's like I'm just gonna very quietly
tell you my orders no one can overhear
this not many people have recognized me
to just by voice a couple times though
hello
sterling sterling listen very well boy
smell you know what to do oh damn it god
damn it what wait for it
hahahaha leave it I mean people ask you
to do voicemail I've very frequently how
often do you actually do those
voicemails very infrequently there's a
lot of legwork and getting the voicemail
up on a phone and a little they'll stop
asking you the voicemail and I go
through the menu I wait yes there was a
kid who followed me for while I was
walking to the YMCA for three blocks
while he said it was setting it up
without asking me like he decided just
noticed I'm going to have you do my
voicemail so that he walked with me and
he was like hold on like I got a I just
got to get it oh my god that's great
walking with me oh no I just gotta
set it up
okay says it and I'm like I'm not doing
it I'm on my way to the gym I can't do
it no no no hold on no press too you
know doing that for like but yeah
wouldn't go away
until I walked in the why and then he
wasn't a member that was that was the
escape route he wouldn't even know his
car sorry just can't get in not doing
your voicemail he's over in the entryway
despite his numerous projects John
bedroom has never actually ventured to
what many argue is the next big boon for
voice actors video game roles you're one
of the few voice actors who have not
even touched those why is that yeah I
don't know I've never been asked and I'm
a player I've played them what do you
play well I I play a lot less than I
used to but my son now plays so there's
he's he's pulling me back in so we've
been playing Red Dead Redemption oh
really yes which is not a great game for
a ten-year-old to play but there are
moments he's learning about morality yes
and about the West yeah and about rape I
didn't know that about Red Dead
Redemption did you know that no I
haven't played it actually there is a
rape apparently a rape okay a prompt
like you actually you want to rape her
press X to rape
yes okay that's what he said I can't
find that okay so I'm not sure whether
either way that's bad
yes if he made it up that's really bad
right like he has right so even that the
fact that that scene is lexicon is crazy
when he gets there he'll he'll know so
this is rape yes oh dear john benjamins
curling the mists of two hit shows Bob's
Burgers on Fox and our turn FX with two
fundamentally different ways recording
dialogue the archer sessions are very
efficient and sometimes very quick like
about an hour and a half usually for a
full episode for a full episodes they do
an episode and day I'm on the in the
studio with headphones everybody has an
headphones are right yeah so so are you
at that moment are you in a booth alone
are there other people with you I'm in a
booth alone and there's an engineer
outside yeah so nothing is that I mean
so you how often you interact with your
cast members in we're actually recording
are the on the telephone as well no they
don't if they Archer they record
everybody's part separately okay so
occasionally I will bump into a cast
member but most of them live in LA I
live in New York I think Jessica Walters
who plays my mother lives in New York so
I saw her a couple times how does that
compare to Bob's Burgers well Bob's
Burgers is done with everybody usually
together so it's much more unruly and
much more funky the way it smells feel
so how much ed Lavin can you do on that
show how much is in well that's
encourage to do a lot of ad-libbing and
it's not that Adam Reed doesn't
encourage it it's just sort of not
called for but in Bob's Burgers we'll
we'll do a lot of improvisation when you
are doing the different roles how do you
differentiate the voice well with the
chosen presently doing not much
difference I thought I did suggest which
was I think quickly shot down by Adam
Reed like an effete accent for the spy
which what would that sound like
I think I don't mind I can't remember he
might have the tape but you know I saw I
was sort of doing this or something you
know like doing a voice like make rights
a spy right I don't know but he was like
no no no no like dough stop like if I
wanted that I would get somebody way
better at doing that accent than you
your to do I had to ask you know you go
by John Benjamin mostly you're also H
John Benjamin the Henry when did the H
go silent uh at Birth you just you just
stopped using it for your mom I was not
told about the H for a long time and
then it was sprung on me like I was
adopted like I am son we have something
to tell you your name is John but it's
not just John there's an H in front of
it so what Y was and I was like I was
what so why was it picked in it like it
was never like to be used it's not Henry
though by Henry well that's what
Wikipedia I'm not gonna tell you what it
is but I'm gonna let them think I'm just
kind of saying humdinger then that's
about humdinger though that would be
crazy I mean what is a humdinger no idea
it's just when those words you hear like
shenanigans it's just a blowjob right in
the 20s you know they would call it I'll
have a humdinger so the H is gonna be
intentionally just a mystery uh yes I
keep it that way by the only reason I've
had the H was Laura Silverman who was a
was on dr. Katz filled out my credit
okay and she did it just to make fun of
it ultimately though john benjamin is a
comedian and even when interviewing him
you're never quite sure if he's being
serious
or if you're just part of one of his
really big elaborate jokes
my name is actually H John Benjamin man
dude there is a name attached to the H
it's not just a lot but you just like
the mystery like to keep people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
