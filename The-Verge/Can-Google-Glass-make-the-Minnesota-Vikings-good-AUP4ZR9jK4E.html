I'm Spencer haltom recipe nation and we
just wanna have a little conversation
about some pretty hilarious news and my
opinion today which is that the
Minnesota Vikings are wearing Google
glass a training camp which is not going
to help them not suck this year but I
think Spencer has some ideas on what it
might help them accomplish it really
does like before we just start making
fun of the Vikings which is going to be
the point of this whole thing if there
is actually a modicum of useful
information and it sort of forward
thinking in this which is a lot of
football's about the eyes and a lot of
the coaching that people do particularly
in the defensive secondary and for skill
positions on offense involves looking at
people frightened looking off the safety
going through your reads now Google
glass probably can't but the technology
they've got actually do I tracking I'm
just assuming that's probably not
something that's not yet yeah not yet
however what it can do is that it can
give you the perspective so if they
really are turning their head to look at
receiver one two three four then you'll
be able to follow along with them and
while that's probably not as valuable
for veterans who are certainly doing
this already um it's a matter of getting
your number two and your number three
and guys who are just coming into the
pole trained up on that so this might
actually make some sense for the AFL
yeah but not for the Vikings because
they're terrible uh so the Rams did this
last year right do you that like take
the sports world on fire the Rams we saw
this first first engineer from training
camp make an impact and how you think
about sort of sports and sports
journalism and what you're seeing from
players not really because the Rams are
bad and today be safe you know they're
not they're not a particularly great
team however it's cool that they're
playing around with it because I think
one coaches just want information if you
want to talk about the information
environment that they work in you know
ideally coaches want perfect information
everything they do is sort of a step
towards getting that and if you can
actually get what they're looking at and
seeing on the field right because
typically a play will say well I saw
this and I saw this well you'll
literally be able to go to the data and
say no you didn't you
actually get the safety at all or you
didn't see the receiver coming across
the middle and didn't react and once you
get past a certain level of football
once you get past the college level when
you're really sort of pattern reading at
every single opportunity that will
actually help so it didn't necessarily
rock the world I don't I think it might
if you saw actual improvement based on
that but here's the other trick the
people wearing Google glass have to be
good ha right and I think that's the key
challenge for the Vikings right is
they're not very good what do you think
if you're I mean I don't know what which
are there many bad quarterbacks do you
think we'll most benefit from google
glass let's see our Vikings quarterback
roster now I primarily do college but
we're still dealing with Christian
Ponder yeah i mean i know for
improvement there as far as i can tell
okay there there won't be any
improvement there because again the raw
material inside the inside the helmet
has to work and ponder is just hotter
this is another thing that sucks for
them okay I don't want to take pity on
the biking but pottered arm is only so
strong right and he came into the league
of somebody who had some nagging
injuries to begin with so it might not
go that well now who can actually help
would be Teddy Bridgewater hey
Bridgewater Teddy Bridgewater coming in
is going to have to go from chris
peterson recurrently University of
Washington head coach is fond of saying
that there's this learning curve for
quarterbacks at you know middle school
high school college and pro and once you
get to the pros he's talking about not
only going through multiple options like
in high school it's like you're throwing
to that guy yeah he's up he's on foot
taller than everybody else and he weighs
50 pounds more and he's really mean so
just give him the ball and we'll watch
everything happen right you get to
college like well we have like two or
three options you so know what you're
looking at and know what you're throwing
into and then when you get to the pros
it's like okay you have a full moving
spectrum right like moving chest and
blows up right and we need you to know
exactly where to put the broken we're
but the night right we'll we'll script
the plays you just need to know how
everything's moving for fruit water
that's going to be really useful because
he played very well in a very collegiate
offense with some pro elements in it so
I think it's good actually like I think
as a learning tool it's got a lot of
potential firm that's awesome so last
question yes or no is there any chance
the Packers don't beat the vikings twice
this year no no the Patrick will beat
the vikings by awesome i'm eli patel
that's been Spencer hall this has been a
lengthy troll of dieter bohn the new
executive editor of The Verge and I will
talk to you soon
