out with Justin Bieber but for your
illegitimate bieber baby we decided to
get you this for moms origami stroller
thank you for that and this is the most
high-tech stroller I think you can buy
yeah I want to really have another real
baby turn this drama the main feature on
this thing is this dial here on the back
and this push button and if you give it
a second it does that which is pretty
impressive without knocking over the
soda yes or beer yeah the soda is still
here which is actually a beer but that's
okay obviously it goes back it has a
safety mechanism and has sensors in the
in the carriage here if you put the
Bieber babby back in mama bibra Bobby if
this was a real baby with some actual
weight cuz this thing weighs about one
pound you would see on a sensor that's
back here a monitor that there is a baby
in the stroller and therefore it will
not collapse anymore what's it called
power powerful power-folding power
folding hi would you mind watching the
stroller and my baby for a second I
would love to
actually do you manage to take her out
of the stroller yeah what am i doing
just feed her yeah thank you so much
I'll be right back sure so there's
obviously a battery in here the battery
gets its charge from these wheels on the
side as you move it charges the battery
and you can actually see that on the
display in the back by four minutes all
right here uncle Keith white / mouse /
Mouse there's also a set of running
lights on the front and even better yet
for gadget nerds it has a USB cable
charge in the back that'll charge your
device as you move it doesn't charge
when it's an in stationary mode right
right the guy kissed her on the lips
that was weird so how's your battery
should be charged by now it is charging
you can see on the meter that it's
charging it's too so a little more than
fifty percent I guess I mean how far we
begun there's also a odometer and a trip
meter and so does that leave every step
actually when you oh it does you've done
point one something doesn't tell you
what that's pretty much it it's the
origami it's amazing it costs 800 bucks
and it's available now soon yeah they
said very soon soon
she peed then put the baby in and then
we catch our breath no for real she peed
okay she feed everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
