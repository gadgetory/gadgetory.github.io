we're going to go cio safes new drives
with Thunderbolt input apparently they
are also Thunderbolt proof did anyone
get to see million-volt tesla coil this
at the CES yet we we wrote on our
application that we were demonstrating
some computer products and there was
going to be a static discharge display
as well and we just left it at that this
is the world's most rugged fastest hard
drive on the planet it can it it's it's
machine from a solid billet of aluminium
it can withstand 5,000 pounds of crush
force so you run over it with a truck or
what not it can also survive underwater
fully immersed salt water fresh water
and some fuels and chemicals that we've
tested with as well so with the
Thunderbolt connection and twin raid 1
SSD drives this is very fast drive it
can move 400 megabytes per second so
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to put some data onto the rugged
portable thunderbolt and then we're
going to stick the Thunderbolt drive in
a cage with dr. mega volt and expose it
to a million volts of Lightning power
that's awesome so awesome all right now
he's going to grab the io safe driving
and we're going to test this drive
iosafe style with Thunderbolts
this part always makes me a little
nervous I don't know why but okay we're
good so that's pretty hardcore right see
if we can get this baby to pop back up
so the good thing about this point is
the displayport controllers work in its
passing through the video signal and I'm
not getting a disc this has happened
before bummer okay this has happened a
couple times I need a number one number
one blade small blade screwdriver right
now I'm going to see if I can see
anything in disk utility this is I'm
popping up this way either and try the
second disc I'm going to try and recover
with a replacement controller board
that's a good sign
so the Thunderbolts back I hate when the
demos go this way but I do like it when
we can get the data back so so that that
that was by far one of the more
stressful a day two recoveries that
we've done we we subjected the drive to
quite a bit of stress and we recovered</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
