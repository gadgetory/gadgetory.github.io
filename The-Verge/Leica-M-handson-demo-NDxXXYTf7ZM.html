Photokina 2012 and taking a look at the
brand new Leica M this was anticipated
to be known as the Leica M 10 following
on from the n9 but the company decided
to simplify its branding to just be like
I am that's what all the future cameras
in this range are going to be like there
are quite a few new changes and
innovations thrown in here first of all
you have the brand new Live View mode
which is total novelty for these like a
rangefinder cameras you also have a new
1080p HD movie mode and there's a 24
megapixel CMOS sensor which is a change
from the former 18 megapixel CCD sensor
a lot of people are prehensile about
what that will mean for image quality
would that mean for color fidelity and
all of those things but like assures is
that it's kept image quality right up to
the same previous standards just enhance
things other changes include a new free
inch LCD on the back it has Gorilla
Glass covering it used to be 2.5 inches
on the like m9 otherwise physically
you're still very much looking at the
same design it's kind of like Porsche
they don't really change the look and
feel they're cameras they're really big
and bulky you have a brass top layer and
a brass bottom layer then you have a
magnesium alloy frame and you have this
full leather covering on the sides like
a will actually provide you with a
genuine level side if you prefer to
order that there is also a new hand grip
which is available as an extra
attachment this has a GPS module inside
it that replaces the bottom brass layer
at the bottom there is because most of
the construction of the camera is
metallic there is a glass window down
here the bottom if you have an eye fire
or any other wireless SD card that's
where this come out of course you as he
cause so you can send your pictures off
wirelessly from it
aside from all this with new Live View
mode like has added a couple of tweaks
by pressing this button over here on the
front you enable a live view peaking
mode
and when that is turned on you get red
highlights on the thing which is in
focus this camera can only do menu focus
we just double via the lens on the front
and the red highlight tells you when you
focus and then you also have like a zoom
which is done here with by rolling this
button and that lets you get in right up
close you can get a really good idea of
which part of the image is in focus so
as a first look at Leica M it's the
brand new rangefinder from a company is
going to cost just under 7,000 dollars
body only in the United States</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
