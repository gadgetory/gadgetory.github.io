like Monday morning 10:00 a.m. just
walked out of a meeting with Apple and
I've got it see iPhone 10 this is gonna
be a weird one it's not how it usually
is I've only got 24 hours for me this
phone that's all they're giving us so
here's what gonna do we're gonna publish
a first video today as quickly as we can
of all the features wicked stuff take
our impressions then I want your
questions put them in the comments below
I'll publish a much longer video
answering all those questions in a
couple of days all right well roadblock
number one I need to put my sim in here
and I don't know about you but I am not
in possession of a paperclip currently
nor would I want to do that operation in
the bathroom moving car but the screen
looks nice so we're here in the studio
I'm gonna give you some quick
impressions of the big stuff the screen
the cameras and face I need this screen
there's not no getting around it it's
right there at the top of the screen I
will say that even just using it after a
few hours I've stopped thinking about
the notch or caring about the notch you
will notice it in two places
right away the first is an apps to play
video so we run the Star Wars trailer on
YouTube YouTube is optimized for the
phone it looks weird because you can
either go fullscreen and the notch sits
over the left side of the video or you
can shrink it down so it doesn't but
then the video is piller boxed and
letterboxed and that means it's really
small which is just not great so you've
got two not great options the other
thing is apps that aren't optimized for
this display are kind of broken so like
dark sky has a weird black bar at the
top Google Docs which is an optimized
yet has huge borders the top and bottom
they're basically fake bezels other apps
that use auto layout like my news reader
app news if I it's just broken there's
lines cutting across the status bar
usually Apple developers are really
great about fixing their apps for new
versions of iOS but the last time Apple
made a change this big was the iPhone 6
and it took some developers years to
make their apps work on I
six ice cream so we'll see how it goes
the screen is a 5.8 inch OLED display
and I would say the experience of using
it so far is actually somewhere in
between the iPhone 8 and the iPhone
eight plus it doesn't act like a plus
size display it doesn't have tabs in
Safari and landscape the keyboard is
about the same size of the iPhone 8 the
reason is it's got the notch at the top
in this control area at the bottom where
the home button used to be so the
vertical real estate of the screen is
actually little bit smaller than you
think so you get a bigger screen than an
iPhone 8 and it will look bigger but in
terms of usable area it's not as big as
the 8 plus it's right in the middle so I
know there's been a lot of controversy
about the pixel 2xl display and that's
led to a lot of controversy about OLED
screens in general and I'm just gonna
tell you looking at it for a few hours
this display is great it's made by
Samsung but Apple is really insistent
that they actually designed and
engineered it themselves so Samsung is
just manufacturing it and it's a pentile
arrangement if you're that kind of nerd
I know I am but Apple is doing a lot of
custom work to eliminate some of the
problems spent all this Way's have had
in the past the colors are vibrant
they're not muted like the pixel 2 they
are not super exaggerated like the s8 if
basically it looks like a much brighter
version of the iPhone LCD I know I said
in the iPhone 8 review that I think the
iPhone LCD is the best screen ever made
and people don't really mad at me but
this looks like an even better version
of that and I think that is really great
as for cameras it's basically the same
setup is the iPhone 8 plus a big
difference is that both the wide and the
telephoto lens have optical image
stabilization here on the 8 plus only
the white has optical image
stabilization this will probably be a
way bigger difference in videos when
you're shooting with the tele lens but
we've got to do a lot more testing to
find out right now and just some quick
tests pictures basically look like the
A+ and if you watched our A+ review you
know they're pretty competitive with the
pixel and the si in the node 8 I think
the pixel looks a little bit better and
now that the pixel 2 is out we've got to
do a deep head-to-head and we're going
to be doing that test coming up soon the
front camera because it has the true
depth system can now see a portrait mode
selfies which is fun and you get to use
an emoji which are super silly and I
think are probably the best feature of
the phone so face ID that's the big one
now Bo got rid of the home button they
got rid of the fingerprint sensor get
rid of touch ID
changed all the gestures on the phone of
how you use it because now you unlock
the phone just by looking at it and I
got to be honest with you it's been a
little bit inconsistent for me so inside
it basically works all the time
sitting at my desk walking around in
dark places mostly when I'm walking
around it works fine the problem has
been when I go outside into bright
sunlight particularly when I'm walking
around in bright sunlight or when I go
into places with weird fluorescent
lighting like hilariously the deli
across the street and I think the reason
for this is that when you're in the dark
it's shining the IR light on your face
and the camera can just see it it's like
a flashlight in the dark when you're
outside there's tons of IR interference
from the Sun or from those crappy
fluorescent lights and the camera is a
harder time seeing the IR beam
illuminate your face this is just my
theory right now but it's kind of what's
been happening so we got to do a lot
more testing I'm gonna ask Apple what's
going on we're gonna figure it all out
or and have all that information in the
full review but right now I'm just gonna
tell you it hasn't worked great all the
time so that is what I know after these
first few hours of playing with the
iPhone 10 I think it's a really good
iPhone I think there's some big
questions we answered around face ID
consistency perfectly outside I think
there is some deep camera testing I want
to do especially against the pixel - I
can't really tell you about battery life
yet because I just haven't had it long
enough but I think if you've pre-ordered
this phone you're gonna be pretty happy
you're gonna be on the face ID journey
of discovery with the rest of us as we
figure out where and when it does and
doesn't work if you haven't pre-ordered
and you have questions ask us because I
want to hear from you so leave questions
and a comments on this YouTube video hit
me up on Twitter hit us up on the
website we're going to take all those
questions we're gonna go back to Apple
we're gonna ask them some additional
really hard questions and we're to
answer them all in our full review
coming in just a couple days hey Joanna
how's it going it's good I just got my
iPhones and do you have one yet I'm
special
get back here Stern</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
