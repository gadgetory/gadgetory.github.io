here the 2013 san diego comic-con
international this is ground zero for
anything science fiction or fantasy one
of the most anticipated projects is the
film adaptation of orson scott card's
ender's game adi robertson visited the
Ender's Game fan experience looking at
sets from the film and talking to some
of the cast
were you a fan of the book before you
came to the movie what was it it's one
of my favorite books and I'll I mean I
love sci-fi so it was quite on my street
yeah what did you like about the book
what drew you to it I think I mean as I
said I've really enjoyed sci-fi but one
it is a really exciting action filled
story but there's a lot more to it than
that it's very complex and deep there's
a lot themes inside story present in
today they always have been and i'm sure
they always will be yeah a lot of the
book is sort of about being the smartest
kid in the room and not being able to
express the things that you think to
anybody else how do you translate that
to something that's visual yeah I mean
Gavin me and gavin talked a lot about
how we're going to transfer the book and
end his character into the story in the
film and visually it looks stunning I
mean the all of the visual effects and
everything
incredible Oh sort of do you see your
character and how do you make a movie
that's about children but is not a
children's um my character is very
independent and very strong and you know
it's that's an interesting question I
think it's it really focuses on these
intelligent minds of you know teenagers
and it's sort of the next generation and
it's it's you know a lot of the a lot of
what's in the film is very relevant to
today and a lot of the you know the
stories theme of sort of teamwork and
coming together at the end of the day
and it's interesting that's a good
question ender's game was published in
nineteen eighty five but has taken this
long for the film to come to the big
screen we sat down with writer-director
gavin hood and producer roberto orci
talk about what they need to do to make
that possible I think we both landed on
it that decision that yeah I think
Warner Brothers headed for about seven
years but this was before us we were
blissfully ignorant and then at some
point I got a call from my agent saying
you know there's this book called ends
game they're looking for a rider want to
take a meeting what I thought it was
stuck at Warner Brothers was told so yes
so I took a meeting and then at some
point Bob was approached me and they put
us together that I loved the book and
had been wondering about it for years
and then we got in a room together and
he's like hell I'm gonna write it you
you go girl that's gonna be a challenge
right let's see what happens there hmm
and when he wrote the script I think
that gave us all the confidence to know
that this actually was made me finally
going to happen and that may just go get
the additional partners you know we went
and got international partners to help
us with the financing we got lionsgate
mauled summit we met with Eric fight
will actually uh I think he didn't he
didn't know the book particularly not at
that stage and then became a fan of it
himself so we just found that everyone
we'd approach as we go around try to put
together there were so many people who
had fond memories of the material that
we were able to kind of took a village
to put it together and that's what we
did the first things that had some fun
doing those with everybody obviously
interested in Seoul battleroom 0g in
that very special environment and so one
of the first things we did was make this
little 45 second teaser because
everybody was saying like how are you
gonna do remember we had to get a can
and like we got to try and sell because
the studios you know Warner Brothers it
passed and so the studios were a little
bit nervous and it can it be done and
how on earth is the zero-g gonna work
domain on spec right yeah data version
of we did a 45 second thing yeah I'm and
we made this little thing and then Bob
and I kind of went to can like to
traveling salesman and we kind of hopped
up in front of you member hi foreign
buyers um we're here to show you 45
seconds of something we hope you'll love
and a script would you please invest and
you know what they did which was very
very bold of them and we should say
we're very grateful to our foreign
buyers because this movie would not have
happened okay to see it as fastly you
cooking through the booking of cerebral
in a lot of ways you know and the you
know the trails would very heavy on the
action in the element you know is that
representative the finished film was
their decision to make it or an action
ride or you said you didn't want to
bring in both of those elements yeah I
mean it's in them it's in the book so
right it's just you know we're saying
before we never no one ever had the
technology quite do this right yet and
so we didn't want to shy away from the
spectacle of it in a way the the
spectacle is what makes it a unique
property audiences have seen everything
and actually have kind of a giant movie
that actually is something you can talk
about afterwards and it actually makes
me think and that that's actually you
have young protagonist that they're
having a great time and doing things
we'd all want to do like float in that
room right but they're doing it for
potentially a more adult purpose and in
preparation potentially for four
and for leadership and for growing up
and to have that in one movie is I think
part of the appeal and so and so both
sides of it should be celebrated both
its cerebral pneus and its spectacle yes
yes I didn't talk down to kids no I
agree with beau it's unusual for a big
popcorn movie which this has to be to
achieve the kind of audience impact that
it needs to also have these great
characters and these dynamics now
obviously when trailers come out you
know you don't want to spend two minutes
watching some sort of cerebral on strike
so the marketing part the department is
likely to say look at how cool stuff
don't worry this is super cool and it is
and at the same time when we go to a
movie which is not a two-minute
experience it's a two-hour experience
we've also all been there go okay you've
showed me 10 minutes of super cool stuff
is there a story in here anywhere
because I don't need to be sitting here
for two hours and looking at cool stuff
so trailers and movies are kind of like
their little bit odds in some ways so I
promise you that we have been true to
the core emotional and moral dilemmas
that the book is so famous for and we
have also i hope delivered on the
spectacle that the book is also in this
battle room so our invention that's in
the book and that's what makes it such a
great property is this combination of
really original environments with great
story and great characters who are not
stereotype to are not just good versus
evil these are complex characters who
are struggling with their own demons and
trying to find a way to define
themselves as leaders of both others and
of themselves and that's what I love
about Ender's Game you go on the
spectacular journey and you come to a
place where character really defines who
he is in a good you know intelligent way</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
