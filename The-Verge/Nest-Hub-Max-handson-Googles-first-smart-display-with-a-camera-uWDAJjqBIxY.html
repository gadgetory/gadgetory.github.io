- This is the Google Nest Hub Max.
It is a smart home display that
also uses Google Assistant,
shows your photos.
Actually, if you're familiar
with the old Google Home Hub,
it's the same thing, just
with a bigger ten inch screen
and a camera for doing video calls.
The Google Nest Hub Max
has a ten inch display,
and it's an HD display which
means it's probably not
ultra high resolution, but it's HD.
More importantly though,
is that it has this magical
color temperature matching
thing that they did
with the original Google Home Hub.
So, photos look like actual photos,
instead of just a TV screen
sitting on your counter.
(soft relaxation music)
So you look at the front of the device,
you'll see there's a
couple of microphones.
It only needs two.
And then there's the
color temperature sensor
which does the magical
color temperature thing.
And then of course, there is the camera.
If you're wondering, there is
a physical switch on the back.
- [Device] The mic and camera are off.
- Which disconnects the camera
and the microphone physically
even though you don't see a
little shutter on the front.
It's a six point five megapixel camera,
but you shouldn't care
about the megapixel count
The important thing is that
it's there for duo video chats.
It has a 127 degree field of
view, which is super wide,
so it'll pick up the whole room
and even though this thing is angled up,
it should pick up little
children down near the counter.
It does another neat trick
where it will follow
you if you want it to,
so it'll try and keep faces in frame
and zoom in on them just a little bit,
so it looks like a nicer video chat.
All of that's kinda table
stakes for a smart speaker.
We've seen all of that stuff before,
even ones that have a display.
What's new here?
I mean they've got a couple
of front-firing tweeters
and a 'woofer, but I wanna
go back to that camera,
because that is why this
is a Google Nest product,
not just another Google product,
'cause it does a bunch
of Nest-like things.
One, it can become a best security camera.
So you can, from your
phone, open up the Nest app
and turn this thing into
a Nest security camera.
So, that's cool.
But the Google Nests sort
of tie up the rebranding
the whole division into Google Nest now.
Means that this does a few
things that Google thinks
is really forward looking
towards what ambient computing
in your home is gonna look like.
And one of those things is this camera
can recognize your face.
You set it up in the phone
and then it stores your facial
recognition data locally,
on the device, so it doesn't
have to go up to the cloud.
And then, when you walk
in the room it sees you,
shows a little icon showing your head,
and then it's able to give
you your personal information
instead of just general,
random Google information.
Oh, there's one more thing
the camera lets you do.
It lets you play and pause
videos with a gesture.
You just kinda hold your
hand up and it'll pause.
And then you can hold your hand up again
and it will start playing again.
(soft relaxing music)
So the Google Nest Hub Max costs $229
and it's coming out in July.
And if you're curious,
the little guy is also getting a rename.
It's gonna become the Google Nest Hub.
But the rest of the Google Hub products
aren't getting renamed.
This is a new division,
new tie-up inside the company,
and so they're gonna release more products
under the new branding as time goes on.
Anyway, we are excited
to try this thing out.
It comes in both charcoal and white,
even though the bezel is always white
because it looks like a photo frame,
and honestly, photos look great on it.
Hey, thank you so much for watching.
Would you buy a Google Nest Hub Max?
Let me know in the comments.
And also, Google I/O is happening
and we have a ton of
Google I/O content coming,
so keep it locked to The Verge.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
