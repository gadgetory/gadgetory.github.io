iPhones out there thank you our team's
work so incredibly hard to make all of
our products accessible to everyone
we're launching a new accessibility
website we believe that technology
should be accessible to everyone so as
you can tell it's been a pretty busy
week around here
but we have more to the nounce today and
I'd like to start with Apple TV with
Apple TV we want the experience on your
television to be as great as this
experience across your Apple devices we
believe the future of TV is apt and in
just a year we now have eight thousand
apps and over two thousand games and
there's a very popular one coming before
the end of the year that is minecraft
and in fact we now have over 1,600 ABS
from video content providers for you to
enjoy you can watch live and on-demand
news you can even watch live sports in
fact there's a new category of apps
emerging that combine the power of Apple
TV to make watching video more
interesting interactive and social I'd
like to invite Ryan Troy from Twitter to
show us what we're talking about why
today we're going to show the future of
video made possible by Twitter on Apple
TV fans love watching their favorite
live sports on the largest screen in the
house with a simple swipe we can bring
that conversation in to make viewing
more entertaining with tweets from
athletes and more insightful with stats
from journalists in addition to NFL
Thursday Night Football Twitter is very
excited to offer free premium sports
content from the NHL and NBA news from
Bloomberg and election night coverage
from BuzzFeed we're merging live video
social sports and news and an
interactive format not possible before
Twitter on Apple TV we want Apple TV to
be the one
to access all of your television so
today we're announcing a new app and we
simply call it TV it will completely
change how you watch TV with your Apple
TV as well as your iPhone and iPad the
new TV app is the first place I go when
I turn on my Apple TV it brings the
shows and movies from all my video apps
all into one place so I start up and
watch now where the focus is on up next
when I want to discover something new I
just swipe down so let's switch to my
iPad so here's the new TV app it has
everything that was in the previous
videos up right here in my library
now of course Siri works great with the
TV app or shows that I'm watching I can
just say play Brooklyn nine-nine
okay here's Brooklyn nine-nine I'd like
to talk about another important category
and that's live and today Siri is making
it easier than ever to watch the live
content that you want so now I can say
things like watch CBS News browning to
masterpieces by Jerry toons and straight
to what's live on CBS
so it's theory live tuned in and the
unified experience of the new TV app
Apple TV is the best place to watch TV
shows movies sports and more thanks so
much
we're gonna make the TV app available
for free with a software update for TV
OS and iOS beginning in the United
States by the end of this year next
thing we'd like to talk about is
something dear to all of us at Apple and
that is the Mac the Mac is more than a
product to us we continue to push the
Mac experience forward with Mac OS we
launched the best version yet Mac OS
Sierra you may not realize it but this
week happens to be the 25th anniversary
of our first notebook for 25 years we've
been defining and redefining what a
notebook is and what a notebook can do
and today we're going to do it again
this is the new MacBook Pro and it is
absolutely incredible it has a whole new
to
design it is metal on all sides it comes
in a 13 inch and 15 inch sizes and
silver and Space Gray and it is simply
the thinnest and lightest MacBook Pro we
have ever made but here's the new 13
inch MacBook Pro yes it is just fourteen
point nine millimeters thin that's
seventeen percent thinner than the
previous generation and it's smaller to
23 percent smaller in volume almost a
quarter less that's a huge difference
and it weighs less - it weighs just
three pounds almost a half a pound less
than the previous version here's the new
15-inch pro next to it fifteen point
five millimeters thin that's fourteen
percent thinner and it is smaller as
well twenty percent smaller in volume
than the previous one one-fifth less and
it weighs just four pounds again a half
a pound less everything is all-new
there's a new trackpad a force touch
trackpad it is twice as big as the
trackpad in the previous generation a
lot more room for your gestures now this
is only possible because of the force
touch technology in order to have a
great quick feel it was a mechanical
click mechanism it would not be possible
it's just really state-of-the-art and
the best trackpad we've ever made the
keyboard is all new as well it uses the
butterfly switch mechanism that we
pioneered in our 12 inch MacBook but now
we've applied it to a professional
notebook and in this case is a new
switch mechanism a second-generation
butterfly it's more responsive and gives
an even greater sense of keyboard travel
as you press on it you're probably
looking at that area just above it it
replaces the standard system functions
were used to so if you want to set the
brightness or the volume it's easier
than ever before with just a slide or
tap the touch bar adapts to whatever
software you're using we're in Safari
and now the touch bar is showing us
buttons for our favorite websites the
touch bar can show you quick type
suggestions you can just tap on and type
even faster well next to touch bar is
another technology touch ID we're
bringing touch ID to the Mac for the
very first time it's supported by a
second-generation touch ID sensor so
it's really fast and it's supported by a
brand new chip the Apple T
chip the display in the new MacBook Pro
is simply the best display we've ever
made on a Mac as a 67% greater contrast
ratio
it displays wide color with a 25%
greater color gamut all this in a
display that consumes less power and is
as thin as a 12-inch MacBook display
inside every 15-inch MacBook Pro is an
Intel Core i7 6 generation quad-core
chip it's paired with faster 21 33
megahertz memory it has faster graphics
as well
Radeon pro graphics this is the AMD
Polaris architecture up to four gigs of
video memory and it delivers graphics
power that's now 2.3 times faster than
the previous generation 15-inch MacBook
Pro and a storage is faster too now up
to 3.1 gigabyte per second you can
figure it with twice as much up to 2
terabytes and it's 50% faster as well
now all this performance a faster CPU
faster graphics faster memory faster
storage in a device that's thinner took
creating in a whole new thermal
architecture now let's look at the
13-inch MacBook Pro can be configured
with dual core 6 generation Intel i5 or
i7 chips as faster Intel iris graphics
and it also has the faster flash storage
in this case that now delivers twice the
storage performance of the previous
13-inch MacBook Pro the system's much
faster and so is the i/o it is the
fastest most versatile IO we've ever
built into a macbook pro both the 13 and
the 15-inch have 4 Thunderbolt 3 ports
dr. Bober is an incredible 40 gigabit
per second of bandwidth this also
supports USB 3.1 gen2 and of course
DisplayPort 1.2 any one of the 4 ports
can be a charging port plug it in to
whichever one you want left side right
side and that's your charging port and
the hardware and software working
together in these super thin and light
notebooks deliver all-day battery life
up to 10 hours of battery life in both
the 13 inch and the 15 inch now we do
have other customers who choose other
products in our line like MacBook Air
and they choose them for how thin and
light they are and we're going to
continue to offer a MacBook Air in a
13-inch in our line
but we challenged our team to take this
new design this 13-inch MacBook Pro and
could they make a model that would be
really exciting for customers who would
traditionally pick a MacBook Air
so we're making a model of the 13-inch
MacBook Pro with traditional function
keys and two Thunderbolt ports and we
think that a lot of potential MacBook
Air customers are going to be very
excited about this product - so how does
it stack up remember we told you the
MacBook Pro is fourteen point nine
millimeters that is thinner than the
MacBook Air the MacBook Pro is smaller
but better in every way the pricing for
these three configs are $14.99 $17.99
and $23.99 the macbook pro authorities
start shipping today the two models with
touch bar and touch ID start shipping in
two to three weeks but of course you can
get in your order today the new MacBook
Pro lineup are the best notebooks we
have ever made and they're the most
advanced notebooks ever made who worked
so incredibly hard on creating these
products and building them thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
