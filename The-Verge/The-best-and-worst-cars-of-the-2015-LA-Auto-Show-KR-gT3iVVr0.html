the verge i am chris sigler we have
Jason Harper with me and also Tamara
Warren my beautiful lovely colleagues
and we are perched high atop the show
thanks to BWW we're here in their booth
on the second level if you have two
floors for your boots I would say you're
balling let's talk about these cars what
what cars do you guys like what car did
you not like there weren't that many
like huge introductions here right it's
kind of a slow show we might as well
just jump in with that viet yeah yeah
that thing's a polarizing I mean like
look the Miata is not a controversial
car everybody loves the miata who's
driven it it's cheap it's good it looks
all right this Fiat is not look all
right well you so you like I like it but
I feel like it's a good time because
what it shows is that we can get back
into the era of small sports like the
spiders yes which has been missing ya 30
years right right it's may be coming
back some degree and you know and I mean
even if you think about there were a lot
of like great inexpensive convertibles
you even think about Saturn for a minute
like no bad right so here we are with
this new model and I kind of feel like
well that indicates a trend which means
we'll see more of them which means less
boring cars which i'm always a fan of
that's what will also say nice
lightweight cars we talk about ways to
be efficient and you know as we add
complications Yugi end up with heavy
cars that you need more and more
complications the great thing about the
mazda and the Fiat platform is it's like
it hang on natch
has for an efficiency he doesn't take no
power to rate weight ratio is naturally
fantastic yeah that's nosing for
shooting for and you know that people
talk about lightning as a concept that's
the way to start it is a light small
cause any time by the way we're seeing
so many crossovers everything
everybody's got to cross over there
their SUV is certainly the trend and if
somebody was making point to me that you
know it takes more than one card to get
a high-power car there's five of them it
doesn't hurt the segment it helps a
segment and I was just gonna say i mean
the auto industry is full of imitators
everyone is skeptical until one jumps in
and there's some positive sales numbers
and then which might bring you to the
bfoq the capital a is it an unusual
beast timer you saw in the flash yeah i
love the weird cars at the LA auto yeah
I'm young thank you I'm no more jaan
symphony at the Auto Show please give me
give me some weird shapes yeah and you'd
mentioned something to me before that I
thought was interesting which is that
it's la la is a drop-top city and so
they're showing drop that person you
know it was said you know la shows a
green show why we didn't see a ton of
green stuff here I didn't see anything
in mind blowing or certainly also know
for gt's drops here a little bit of a
cornet show it isn't this was not a show
like that did you seen nobody who walked
up when you say I saw the coolest thing
right I saw a couple cool sports cars
there is a BMW race car right behind us
and we're gonna get the m4 GTS which
kind of looks very race harsh that's
exciting yeah porsche did their club
sport it is a key
actual race car this is a show when they
show those kind of things because you
actually pay attention to them where is
something like Detroit or Geneva they're
not going to get so much attention
because they are releasing big things so
right its kind of the end of the year
they're there they kind of just dropped
the cup those things that aren't such a
big deal right yeah the evoke
convertible they're not going to be
selling a million apiece right they're
going to be selling a few thousand maybe
Wow and also in the subtracter worn in
LA in the just the product cycle car
manufacturing is not in the sweet spot I
mean it originally started out to kind
of get the jump on Detroit when we are
really thinking about North America but
it's a global automotive market and the
reality is what happens here is not
necessarily the most important to these
automakers top it my roof
I would say one interesting thing today
is out Scott Key oh that the President
did actually mentioned the TDI scandal
which I think was interesting and they
are talking about their electrification
programme which they are talking about
by twenty-five percent by 2015 will be
20 25 20 25 times arguing I did um but
the idea is they basically said he said
we're all in on this William haven't
been innovators we will we will
acknowledge the people come for us but
this is what we see as our efficiency
program I thought it was interesting
that they did indeed acknowledge a GDI
and they talked about the electron the
electric program and that is going to be
important they have to do something well
in its timing right so turns out this
was a show that was time to address
those problems to me that was one of the
more evocative things of the show
because you know to do they basically
they talked about it and they get
I have a question and that is how
important are no shows these days do we
need I mean the auto makers themselves
drop the news before the show's
themselves I mean very rarely few are
you shocked i mean if the 4g teen was a
shot but very rarely do you get some
compelling piece of news anymore then it
sits well I think I mean auto show
started this the history of auto shows
has to do with car dealers so they're
about selling cars so the press piece is
sort of something that got tapped on
along the way when automotive
advertising became a thing and a
profitable industry to invest in this is
the one place we actually get to see
cars before they're on the roads before
they're available for consumers you try
them out and to see how they look side
by side I don't like that and there is
this interesting thing exactly that you
see you actually see design language as
you walk through or or the lack of
design language it is interesting a look
at alpha and then look at Mercedes and
see other commonalities sometimes brands
would expect every common knowledge
there are I think it's great point that
cheek by jowl like oh my God look at
this yeah well look at that where and
that brand is just right boring right
now yeah I mean you're right well yeah
I'm excited about cars and they want to
touch them and see them in the flesh
it's important and it's important to
continuing people's fascination with
cars I love cars i love different kinds
of cars you know mobility is absolutely
interesting but there's something about
touching car emotionality are that I
think it's one of the reasons that I'm
in this business so I want other people
to be back side about this part well and
not to go out east coast on you guys but
the New York show is the most publicly
attended auto show yeah really yeah so
so actually that's like I have new one
ironic considering many New Yorkers that
I know don't drive so oh there's
something about cars that still captures
the imagine what are they coming down
from upstate are they where they going
around they're coming from everywhere so
we're we gonna do this again at Detroit
I assume the three of us will be some
news to be broken there will def are
driven so yeah we I mean this is the
busy this is the crazy season right we
have CES which is now a car show then we
have Detroit the following week and then
we kind of hit the ground running
through like the middle of the year you
know we have new york in april or Geneva
yeah so more cars more verge more fun
times all of the above yeah so stay
tuned we're gonna have more coverage
here from the show we're going to have
more reporting hopefully you've seen
some for other videos a few things that
I need you to do for me go to the
version com select transportation that's
