this is 90 seconds on the verge it's
president obama vs the patent trolls
today the administration issued five
executive orders with the goal of making
patent ownership more transparent and
mitigating the number of lawsuits by
holders of broad software patents and
their shell companies the term patent
troll refers to a company that acquires
patents not to build products but just
to rack up licensing fees by threat of
litigation funny story the guy who
coined the term patent troll is actually
now himself accused of being one the
irony HTC has lost its third major
executive in as many weeks the company's
chief product officer in Asia CEO
departed last month as well as a number
of other high-level employees it's not
all bad news though the HTC One has
reportedly sold around 5 million units
since launch which is impressive but
still a long ways off of the unbridled
behemoth that is Samsung in the galaxy
even the best Draw Something players
couldn't have predicted what would come
next a pink slip social gaming companies
Zynga announced yesterday that it would
be laying off eighteen percent of its
global workforce of the five hundred and
twenty or so employees let go was the
entirety of OMG pop Zynga bought the
developer in March 2012 just after Draw
Something became the most popular game
on Facebook only time will tell if these
cuts can pull Zynga out of the
bankruptcy trenches and that's it for
today's top stories coming up tomorrow
we find the exact origins of the
electric slide the answer may shock you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
