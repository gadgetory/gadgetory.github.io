office I can find a robot that will make
me a latte serve a quinoa bowl and now
there's one that will make me a custom
me to order hamburger and it kind of
makes sense when you think about it San
Francisco is a hub of food enough
technology so having new businesses that
want to tech fi their restaurant concept
makes a lot of sense but when I talk to
my co-workers about it they had two
distinct opinions about robots making
their food one I think it sounds cool I
would definitely go and the other so how
does that affect people working in this
city both of these opinions are
completely justified but that jobs one
is where things get complicated
typically robotic restaurants employ
plenty of people they're just doing
different jobs than before so instead of
flipping burgers or making pizzas
they're stocking machine greeting
customers and just keeping everything in
working order but I wanted to see this
for myself so we are going to head over
to creator that robotic burger place
that I was telling you about and I am
going to see how robots might impact the
future of how we order food so crater is
a new type of restaurant one that has
one of the most advanced culinary
instruments so this baby back there it
makes literally the freshest burger ever
we sliced tomatoes pickles onions the
bun to order but my favorite part
actually grinds the meat to order which
means to make an amazing burger and a
six bucks
this robot isn't what I had imagined
instead of one mechanical arm flipping
burgers as we've seen in the past
creator has built a 14 foot all-in-one
burger machine that uses 350 sensors and
20 computers it takes five minutes to
make a burger start to finish and with
two machines the creator team can make a
hundred and thirty burgers per hour here
at their first location so in designing
the system we
have a principle where we wanted to
design a device that would be nature
where it is and not kind of make food
conform to a robot but that causes all
kinds of engineering challenges because
food is so different so for instance
with the hamburger buns each one is
slightly different size and so on the
bun system alone there are seven
different laser distance sensors that
are watching every little aspect of it
seeing where the buns are and how
they're moving and so forth
a burger is a composed dish which means
you need to be able to accurately
control where everything is where it's
going and how it kind of comes together
and for that we had to build advice with
a pretty impressive amount of dexterity
so we didn't want something that would
make just one kind of burger we look at
this sort of like a platform for
different recipes we wanted as much
culinary creativity as possible there is
also a proper kitchen where employees
prep burgers and make sauces insides
but since the robots cook and assemble
the burgers creator needed less space
meaning less rent which leaves more room
to invest in their ingredients it's one
of the great things about our operation
is because it's so efficient we spent so
much more on the cost ingredients which
definitely comes through in the flavor
so it's an example the beef is whole
chunks of chuck and brisket its steak
it's pasture age there's no antibiotics
no hormones so how did it taste well I
can confidently say that it was the best
six dollar burger that I've ever had but
I am NOT a food expert so I asked Ellen
from eater who was one of my co-workers
what she thought about the burger I
think it's a good burger it's meaty it
has fresh toppings the bun is nice it's
the freshest possible burger and there's
way fewer times that people are touching
your burger
so think about another restaurant where
every single thing that you're eating on
the burger has been touched by multiple
people in this case the bun goes in the
tube but it gets shot through the
machine it flies the saws it cuts
vegetables to go on the top really
freshly and makes it and at the end they
hand it to you in a box and at that
point no one has touched it except for
you
so yeah robotic restaurants are cool and
interesting but there's still that whole
job thing it turns out that the average
cook makes thirty thousand dollars a
year salary and that also happens to be
the mean average rent of a single
bedroom in San Francisco not a
one-bedroom apartment just a single
bedroom San Francisco is notoriously an
expensive place to live and that is now
creeping into every part of our daily
lives so that includes restaurants of
course but specifically it's making it
hard for restaurant workers to even have
a place to live here
so people are edging out into the
surrounding areas
that makes commuting long and expensive
it makes it hard to even want to work in
the city a lot of restaurants are
experiencing a big struggle to find
people who are even willing to do it so
in some cases robots
can kind of pick up that slack and do
those repetitive tasks that Cubans don't
really need to do as it stands today
there are very few restaurants testing
this technology so there's little threat
of robots taking over anytime soon but I
can see a world where robotic
restaurants becomes a thing with robots
on the line owners can afford to pay
their staff and make ends meet and the
matches might make more sense even if
you can find staff we've got like very
expensive permitting processes that go
on forever hugely expensive rents which
are not going down anytime soon
and then minimum wage is also rising so
people who are operating restaurants
have to pay their staff more they have a
whole lot more overhead and that's
really reflected in the menu prices
which is part of the reason people are
finding it so expensive to dine out in
San Francisco and to date the robot
restaurants we've looked at here in San
Francisco
are charging around 20 percent less than
their human powered competition and in
there lies the hope that maybe just
maybe these robots are a solution it is
an exciting future when you think of all
the stuff you can do with better
technology and the restaurant space
which frankly hasn't seen a lot of
improvement over the past several
decades my expectation is that we're
gonna
some pretty exciting new dishes coming
out maybe even new cuisines using the
dexterity that you get from some pretty
advanced instrumentation in your kitchen
a future with more robotic restaurants
might not be all that bad we'll have to
wait and see what do you think about
robot restaurants be sure to leave us a
comment below and also check out our
friends over at eater Ellen and some of
the reporters are doing some amazing
coverage behind the scenes of some
really cool restaurants</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
