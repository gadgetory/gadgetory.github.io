we're looking at nests newest hardware
products this is a nest outdoor camera
its shipping this fall it's going to
cost $199 let's take a closer look maybe
you're familiar with nests indoor camera
called nest cam that came out last
summer this is in a lot of ways very
similar but it happens to be something
that goes outdoors it shoots 1080p HD
video it has 130 degree wide-angle
viewing lens all glass lens it is 24/7
video streaming and then if you pay for
a nest aware subscription you can also
look back at historical clips of
movement that might have happened it
also has a two-way microphone which you
could music for example if someone's
going to drop a package off at your
place and you're not home you could talk
to them or in my case you could talk to
your cat when you're at work all day not
saying that I do that the difference
here is that this is waterproof so you
can put it outside you can stick it on a
gutter or anywhere else that will hold
the magnetic mount and it will withstand
all of the elements comes with 25 feet
of cable this first part here is 10 feet
and there's another 15 feet here another
difference between this generation nest
and last year's indoor nest is that the
app has been updated to include some new
features so you imagine if you're
pointing this thing outside there's
going to be a lot of movement whether
it's people walking down the street or
cars passing by the new nest app will
have a feature that will tell you when
it has identified a person it will
either say it has spotted a person and
frame or it thinks it has spotted a
person in frame and that says it
actually worked with Google and Google's
deep learning team to come up with the
software that would recognize people in
the frame so here's one thing you might
want to consider though while the camera
and the app will tell you if it's
recognized a person it still doesn't
really have any kind of alarm system so
if you're looking for something that's
more of a serious high-powered security
system it's going to sound an alarm or
call emergency services when you need it
to the nest camera is not for you so
this is nest 4th Hardware product and I
started out making a smart thermostat
then they went on to nuts
a smoke detector and carbon monoxide
detector they then came up with nest cam
which was basically an iteration on
Dropcam that they acquired and now there
is nests outdoor camp and I really just
love this magnet so stay tuned for our
full review once they start shipping in
the fall and thanks for watching this is
a nest outdoor camera that's a magnetic
mount so that's what I'm just gonna have
a little fun with that right now okay
and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
