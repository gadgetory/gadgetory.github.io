effort trying to sell everyone on the
idea of a tablet that can replace your
laptop last year's surface pro 3 was the
culmination of that effort it was the
best execution on that idea yet with the
new servers Pro for Microsoft isn't
trying to convince us anymore it's just
making it better for the true believers
I'm just going to cut to the chase the
differences between the surface pro 3
and the surface pro 4 are so minimal
only the most well trained I would be
able to tell them apart the pro 4 has
the same overall shape and design same
magnesium finish the same infinitely
adjustable kickstand hinge hell it's
even the same color as last year's
computer it's slightly thinner
imperceptibly lighter and has a new
processor and slightly larger screen but
it's still a full-featured Windows 10 PC
in a light and portable package that
works better on your desk than on your
lap but while the main design and
appearance of the pro 4 remains the same
Microsoft did make some important
updates and they all revolve around how
you actually interact with the computer
the biggest change is the new type cover
it features redesigned keys and a new
trackpad the keys are greatly improved
they're more spacious more comfortable
to type on and have much better travel
it's still not like typing on a laptop
there's that weird hollow sound and you
hammer away on the keys and the whole
thing flexes a bit too much for my
liking
but I don't hate it as much as I used to
the new trackpad is much larger it
finally has a smooth surface making it
much better for those multi-finger
gestures used in Windows 10 but the
service trackpad has always been pretty
lousy so it didn't really have a high
bar to beat like the keyboard it's still
not as good as the best laptops and
scrolling and navigating with it it's
still a cramped experience there's also
a brand new surface pen which has a
redesigned tip that works with an
updated touch sensor on the display for
better writing experience there's an
eraser enough on the back which does
exactly what you'd expect an eraser to
do and writing and taking notes with a
new pen is much better than before it
really feels like I'm writing with real
ink I've actually enjoyed taking notes
with a new pen but unfortunately can't
do anything to fix my terrible
handwriting maybe the coolest new thing
with it is that it magnetically snaps to
the side of the computer for storage but
don't expect it to stay there when you
toss the pro 4 in a bag and that's
really it about the surface pro 4 it's
the same experience as the pro 3 but
with enough improvements make it better
overall if you aren't sold on the idea
of a surface being the tablet that
replaces your laptop with last year's
computer this year's model won't do
anything to change that the pro 4 still
is a shortcomings and compromises of
this
up it's really awkward to use on your
lap or an airplane trade table and it's
really clumsy to pick up from a desk and
go it's also still not a great
standalone tablet when you pull the
keyboard off there's also the matter of
the price the pro force starts at almost
nine hundred dollars but if you really
want this to be your main computer you
want to pony up almost $1,300 for a
faster processor usable amount of
storage and decent amount of RAM plus
you'd be a fool to buy it without the
type cover which adds another 130
dollars to your bottom line at that
point you're in the price range are some
truly fantastic laptops which means you
have to really think hard if you're
bought into the whole idea of the
service or not if you're not Microsoft's
even happy to sell you a true surface
laptop now but if you are into this idea
and the tablet laptop hybrid is your
dream of a perfect computer the pro 4 is
a little bit more perfect than before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
