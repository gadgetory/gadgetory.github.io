have no idea how well my muscles are
working or why sometimes pull my back so
bad it takes a week to recover so I
headed to the Mandel School in Upper
Manhattan to meet with athos a start-up
building high-tech workout gear that
looks inside your muscles and analyzes
the way your workout is going in real
time to help me test them was Jermaine
O'Neal six-time NBA all-star and
investor in athletes being involved with
Atos really it's something I really
believe in because it puts your health
and your entity in your own hands you
understand the body better you
understand and you know when you're
doing the exercise and things are not
working as well it basically tells you
we make workout apparel much like other
companies and that was always the goal
was how do we make normal shorts and
let's reverse engineer the technology
into them so it uses a science called
electromyography or EMG for short
basically what that means is that we
record the little electrical signals
your muscles produce and we can tell how
much of each muscle you're using so
we're able to translate in a way where
you can pick up your phone so they've
got it and go back to what you need to
do naturally I proposed a quick game of
one-on-one
I wore the Atlas gear for our basketball
game and a quick weightlifting session I
was very impressed with how detailed the
data was and how easy it was to
interpret on the squats for example I
could see that I was using one leg way
more than the other and also notice how
changing my for impacted which muscles
were being activated allowing me to
better balance the stress on my joints
and if you're in the gym take the squad
example again and you can look like you
have the best form in the world going
down perfectly straight but when in fact
you're using the right side more than
the left or using all quads and the
glutes you're not get the benefit we
take a summary of what just happened and
show you that key map of the body and
then show you muscle by muscle by the
specific number how much you actually
work these muscles this would this
enables you do is have a virtual
personal trainer on your phone that can
instruct your every step of the way
I thought the core values of what this
brand represented and something and I
went through a lot as poor athlete had a
lot of struggles late living in my
we're with trying to figure out how my
body was starting to break down being
able to understand the body understand
the changing reaction how to body ties
in you know to itself you take a you
know a brand like pathos it tells you
that versus having to go and see
different people to try to figure that
out so it's definitely something I
really believe in not only as a
professional athlete but as a parent as
well for now athos seems best suited to
professional athletes for performing
sets of weightlifting or weight-bearing
exercises and want to perfect their form
and avoid injury in the future I could
see them being integrated into everyday
clothes and helping me to measure how
well my muscles were working as I climb
the stairs to work or head out for a
quick bicycle ride to the grocery store
it would definitely improve my
performance and maybe help me avoid
injury they aren't going to transform me
into a professional caliber athlete but
hey a guy can dream right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
