Pierce and the word of the day is
caffeine this is 90 seconds on the verge
brought to you by motorola a meteorite
exploded above russia early this morning
residents have posted numerous YouTube
videos showing object streaking across
the sky accompanied by a series of
massive blasts and blinding light the
incident occurred about 1,500 kilometers
east of Moscow according to reports as
many as 1,200 people may have been
injured as windows and glass shattered
after the explosion the Russian Academy
of Science estimates that the meteorite
may have weighed as much as 10 tons
before entering Earth's atmosphere and
in somehow unrelated space news there's
another rock headed our way an asteroid
known as 2012 da14 is passing within
about 17,000 miles of Earth today it's
the closest pass we've ever seen for an
object of its size and approximately a
hundred and sixty-four feet across it's
equivalent to the rock that was
responsible for the Tunguska blast of
1908 you won't be able to see it with
the naked eye but the flyby is streaming
live online right now unless you're
watching this over the weekend in which
case there's always youtube and finally
what's a week without more Star Wars
rumors Harrison Ford is reportedly set
to return as Han Solo Latino Review is
reporting that the actor will be playing
a version of his smuggler character in
star wars episode 7 we're guessing a
much older one the news hasn't been
confirmed by either Lucasfilm or Disney
just yet but rumors have been swirling
that the actor was interested in
reprising his role I love you enough and
that's it for today's top stories join
us next week when I'll spend every
episode learning how to square dance
it's really underrated and a lot harder
than you might think</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
