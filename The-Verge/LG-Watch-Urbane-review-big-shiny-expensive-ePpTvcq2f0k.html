that does a bunch of clever things but
thankfully doesn't over complicate the
watch it's actually pretty good but
right now it's only available on one
watch the LG watch urbane this thing
right here and yeah it's huge the urbane
is slightly bigger than last year's G
watch our with basically the same specs
it's way bigger than the Apple watch
it's shiny and silver and to me it looks
like a cheap watch pretending to be an
expensive watch but at three hundred
forty nine dollars it is not a cheap
watch some people like the style but I
am NOT one of them and if you have small
wrists forget it the urbane has a round
face and an always-on OLED screen and it
does the usual Android SmartWatch things
you'd expect it to it easily lasts a
full day it accepts spoken commands it
plays music over bluetooth for your
workouts it shows you your notifications
and Google now cards Android wear is the
same on all the watches it's on and so
it's the same here except that right now
the urbane is the only watch running the
newest version of Android so it does a
few new things Google isn't sitting
still now that the Apple watch is here
you could say that these new features
are the sort of thing any wearable needs
but you can also kind of see how some of
them are designed to match apples
features it gives you faster access to
apps either by tapping the watch face or
holding down the side button those apps
are getting better too you can start a
run or check your heart rate you can
record audio and then shop for gatorade
on amazon you know for the next run it
also gives you faster access to a list
of recent contacts by swiping over from
the main menu it puts your favorites and
your most contacted people there but
since this is a google product and
Google is terrible at context you're
going to see duplicates it lets apps run
on the ambient screen so you don't have
to activate the watch to see them but
only a few apps support this for now
like Google keep but we should see maps
and more app support it soon it adds
Wi-Fi support so your notifications and
voice commands sync over the cloud even
if you're not on the same Wi-Fi network
as your phone which is really impressive
but the new feature that's the most fun
is that it lets you draw emoji when you
send a text message you literally draw
the emoji you want to send on the screen
and then Google guess is what it is and
gives you a list of options to choose
from I sent a lot of poop emoji anyway
that's about it I
did experience some weird crashes and
slow downs but hopefully those will get
a dress soon overall it is a really nice
update for android wear it keeps things
simpler than the Apple watch but it
moves Android wear beyond just being a
watch with Google now Google says that
the update should be coming to every
Android wear watch soon but for the
moment you really have to like big kind
of ostentatious watches to get it
because it's only on the LG watch urbane
which is big and ostentatious</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
