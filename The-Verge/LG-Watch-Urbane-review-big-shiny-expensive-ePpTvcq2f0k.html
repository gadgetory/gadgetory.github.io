that does a bunch of clever things but
thankfully doesn't over complicate the
watch it's actually pretty good but
right now it's only available on one
watch the LG watch urbane this thing
right here and yeah it's huge
the urbane is slightly bigger than last
year's G watch are with basically the
same specs it's way bigger than the
Apple watch it's shiny and silver and to
me it looks like a cheap watch
pretending to be an expensive watch
but at $349 it is not a cheap watch some
people like the style but I am NOT one
of them and if you have small wrists
forget it
the urbane has a round face and an
always-on OLED screen and it does the
usual Android SmartWatch things you'd
expect it to it easily lasts a full day
it accepts spoken commands it plays
music over Bluetooth for your workouts
it shows you your notifications and
Google now cards Android wear is the
same on all the watches it's on and so
it's the same here except that right now
the urbane is the only watch running the
newest version of Android so it does a
few new things Google isn't sitting
still now that the Apple watch is here
you could say that these new features
are the sort of thing any wearable needs
but you can also kind of see how some of
them are designed to match apples
features it gives you faster access to
apps either by tapping the watch face or
holding down the side button those apps
are getting better too you can start a
run or check your heart rate you can
record audio and then shop for Gatorade
on Amazon you know for the next run it
also gives you faster access to a list
of recent contacts by swiping over from
the main menu it puts your favorites and
your most contacted people there but
since this is a Google product and
Google is terrible at contacts you're
gonna see duplicates it lets apps run on
the ambient screen so you don't have to
activate the watch to see them but only
a few apps support this for now like
Google keep but we should see maps and
more apps support it soon
it adds Wi-Fi support so your
notifications and voice commands sync
over the cloud even if you're not on the
same Wi-Fi network as your phone which
is really impressive but the new feature
that's the most fun is that it lets you
draw emoji when you send a text message
you literally draw the emoji you want to
send on the screen and then Google
guesses what it is and gives you a list
of options to choose from I I send a lot
of poop emoji anyway that's about it
did experience some weird crashes and
slowdowns but hopefully those will get
addressed soon overall it is a really
nice update for Android where it keeps
things simpler than the Apple watch but
it moves Android wear beyond just being
a watch with Google now Google says that
the update should be coming to every
Android wear watch soon but for the
moment you really have to like big kind
of ostentatious watches to get it
because it's only on the LG watch urbane
which is big and ostentatious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
