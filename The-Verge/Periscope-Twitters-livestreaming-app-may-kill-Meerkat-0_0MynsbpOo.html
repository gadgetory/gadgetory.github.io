Verge recently Twitter purchased an app
called periscope it's a live streaming
app that's very similar to meerkat but
the app came out today so let's take a
look at how it works
so this is periscope as soon as you jump
in the app you are brought into the
watch page there are three big live
streams here and then there are a bunch
of other live streams below you can't
sort through any of these I don't even
know who these people are
and they seem to be completely random
and change upon refreshing and then on
the bottom here you have your recent
streams these are mine and some of my
friends then you have the people tab and
these are the people that I'm following
on Twitter you've got a search function
here and you've got your profile page
here very similar to a twitter has but
then obviously you've got the broadcast
page here so let's do a broadcast right
now testing start broadcast so this is a
live periscope we are live now we have
one person five people and we are
filming a live hands-on video hello
everyone watching this so these hearts
here are people tapping the screen to
like show love basically and in the
profile you have your heart count which
i think is kind of interesting and you
can see the chat here on the side you
can see who joined and you can see the
chat hello Charlie
so let's go ahead and stop this
broadcast
and what's neat is it gives you stats so
it gives you duration time watched and
it shows you who you viewed it and then
you can save it to your camera roll as
well and one of the best parts about
periscope is that your broadcasts are
saved for 24 hours which is something
that meerkat doesn't have overall it's a
really well polished app streams are way
less clutter than meerkats are and I
like it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
