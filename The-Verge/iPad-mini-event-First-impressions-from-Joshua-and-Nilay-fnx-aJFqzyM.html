this working yeah we can hear that's a
great year peace she's around 20 theater
the majestic California behind us are
you commenting on my earpiece i did and
i want to see how time-delayed it was
yeah I told Sam I told Sam this wasn't
hanging properly but he ignored me
completely now you look like you're like
so we're at the california theatre it i
am in the Secret Service I didn't tell
you did I a lot of time so we're outside
the california theatre in in San Jose if
you guys would shut up that'd be great
I've got a lot of stuff to say um and we
just got done with the event we just got
done handling all of the new gear
jam-packed event jam tagged event and
act like stuff so also full of people
very tight inside the event yeah um so
so what do you want to know what do you
what's on your mind now what's the
heated discussion that's happening right
now in living rooms across America well
we can argue numbers and specs and
status only one and we have and also
lame is raw but we'll get to that later
Josh dealer but I want to know is how
does it feel look let us live
vicariously through you you said you
said it's like a level above the Nexus 7
and Kindle Fire HD like that's a that's
a big claim and what does that even mean
question yeah it blows away the Nexus 7
and really any other 7-inch tablet or
something in this range that's on the
market I mean it's thinner it's lighter
it feels like extremely salt I mean hey
imagine if Apple made a 7 inch or so
ipad yeah and you get an idea of what it
feels like thing is it's a it feels like
a the build quality is like the iPhone
like they made a much bigger in a same
technique same material he's kind of a
hybridized design in between the ipad
the last generation ipad and the iphone
it's got the chamfered edge and it's got
the black backing like the iphone but
the actual body design feels a lot like
that this rounded off yes rounded off
its like the 3rd gen ipad or a 4th gen
ipad it just feels really nice and the
screen looks really great i will say
this you know the screen resolution
looks better than it does on the ipad 2
you know smaller screen you get tighter
pixel density i think it looks a lot
better i did get a chance to hold it
next to my Nexus 7 and I think the
screen quality is better but you
definitely see more pixels on the
the mini on the ipad mini then on the
then on the nexus 7 so I mean you know
it's not as high resolution it's not as
high pixel density as as some of its
competition but I want you know I will
say the Nexus 7 has a pretty okay
average screen yeah very it's very
pretty washed out and the the actual
quality of the images on the the new
ipad ipad mini the blue yeah the blacks
were much deeper the color is popped a
lot more I mean quality wise
qualitatively speaking it's a nicer
display but but pixel density wise as I
wish Paul Miller can hear right yeah it
definitely suffers a little bit you know
a little resolution bigger screen as
long as a little bigger but i will say
like the device feels like an apple
product you know it feels nicer than
something like even the ipod touch what
you guys have played with the new ipod
touch it feels higher quality than that
yeah it feels like a step above that so
I think in terms of materials and design
weight and and just general quality like
it gets its way beyond what they're
doing with the nexus 7 or even with it
with the kindle and why they feel they
do feel like toys in comparison but you
know what what's interesting is that at
329 it doesn't feel like they're
necessarily competing against the nexus
7 directly or the kindle fire HD
directly yeah because i think there's
still a huge market for 199 products i
actually yeah i actually think that that
in a lot of ways and avi Greengart is
here with us i'm looking at it right now
who's going to join us in a second
talked about we were just talking about
the price point and i do think that
there is something to this is almost
like you know when I was gonna buy an
ipad 2 or maybe I was even thinking
about getting the big iPad but I don't
know if I want something that big but I
do want to have all the apps yeah and I
feel like that's a different question
than if you say well I want a
two-hundred-dollar tablet I can throw in
my bag or like use for reading it's
definitely it feels bigger to hold and
use than the next descent like I could
be because it's actually it is actually
bigger but physically you know what's
thinner just a small it is thinner can
something be bigger and smaller at the
same time those laws official as of
physics are more like what happens right
yeah but I mean but you you'll see I
mean I think people are gonna freak out
for just when we are here at the event
it's hard to capture how
honkers the crowd went when phil
schiller you know cued the video that
showed the Bing iPad rotating yeah we
should apply that behind people freaked
out yeah there were a lot of Apple
people there were a lot of in defense of
the audience during effects of an apple
person who was like I could not restrain
herself here's the I wanted to continue
amoeba start applauding but I do think I
I do think there is something you know
this is a new product for them you know
we've seen iterative products for a
while now the iphone was an iterative
version of the previous iphone this is a
different product it has different uses
it's a new form factor for them you know
they haven't done yes it's an iPad and
yes it's just a smaller iPad but it is
new and we haven't actually seen a lot
of new stuff like even the macbook pro
with the retina display the 13-inch is
just an iteration an iteration of the
15mm actually want to sale of the day
it's that admission question I think
this is yeah but so here's I think the
most important question for Apple
they've got iphone apps and they've got
ipad apps and they're saying it's every
inch an iPad you can just run all these
ipad apps on this new screen size but
the one thing that they've proven is
that targeting apps towards a particular
screen size is like the path to success
yeah right that's the problem app
android tad yeah where the apps working
at your screen size are not completely
targeted it's kind of a mess right do
you think they're gonna start targeting
apps towards the the ipad mini screen
size or it will just always be a
slightly shrunken i think me let me it's
interesting question and I think that
lenia we have actually interesting thing
we talked about this with a I don't you
know I can I can talk now this is this
is fun actually get to control this
little bit ahead yeah so uh we talked to
Andrew Allen 53 designer Ross has gone
mad with power you've missed the last
hours and wonderful we talked to Andrew
Allen the 53 designer he does the paper
app he made interesting point that the
touch the touch spots on the apps are
smaller you can't obviously design
different from the ipad mini to the ipad
retina displays all you can do is change
the assets so we are touching is now
much smaller for every ipad app do you
think it's gonna be an issue yes
actually oh i was actually going to
comment on that to your point and to
that point and i mention it in my in the
right up
of the hands on the keyboard in portrait
feels really squish it feels really
little I mean it's like they've just
scaled down that keyboard so it's not as
tall and as a result it does feel like
the touch points are a little bit harder
to get out at least in that case sorry
i'm getting a call of course huh that
makes sense um but i do think that
there's going to be some touch points
and some stuff to consider that are
going to feel a little bit awkward on
this smaller yeah on the smaller device
but when you think about think about
your favorite ipad apps how many of them
involve you hunting around trying to tap
on a little button right it's really
like oh the back button or a couple of
the interface buttons at the bottom I
mean most of the ipad apps I use and no
are relatively spacious and sometimes
even to spacious yeah thank God that
I've had many exist I'm saw the sake of
the screen real estate of the ipad the
third-generation ipad it really is gonna
be a breath of fresh air to not have as
much to look at Thank you Thank You
Apple ah i know but i do think i do
think that's a concern and i think that
look people are gonna complain about it
but i don't think it says i think it's
less of a concern than having to take a
phone app and put it on a 7 inch or 10
inch tablet and i think like if androids
problem is that like you have to scale
up a phone app and apple from is you
have to scale down an actual ipad app
for a slightly smaller ipad I'd rather
have apples problem than than the
Android problem yeah I get the feeling I
was surrounded by developers actually at
this event Apple brought a lot of
developers here and I get the feeling
that they're all that they're priming
them to map the apps work better across
devices I me the pump priming the pump
yeah I mean they you know at the Apple
spent a lot of time today Tim Cook in
particular so in a lot of time hyping
the app advantage to apple has 275,000
ipad apps at one point you know very out
of character for Apple he compared the
ipad mini directly the nexus 7 was
pretty brutal uh he went right at it
he's like well he came all you went all
the way to this is a piece of crap yeah
and stop well they did he was like
waving at that line from across i will
suppose of this they did the comparison
of the twitter app on android yeah a
couple of events ago maybe when they
announced the new i renew new old ipad
only six months old and I did it was
actually kind of surprised I thought it
was really telling that Apple was
directly responding to the nexus 7 I
mean this product is saying they said
without question on during the
presentation here's our competition
here's the best and here's the best
android tablet and here's what we're
competing against it here's where it has
deficiencies and here's we're working a
win I'm actually surprised that they
weren't able to step in and say like
Apple has has this kind of bravado where
they can walk into a market that already
exists and go like it's the first ever
in this you know that's ever been
designed you know like they will tell
you they created the tablet market you
know which they basically did the modern
tablet market they would never mention
there have been yeah oh we're tablets or
older tablets or there was something I
mean let's not even think about the old
tablet but but I do think it's
interesting they had to respond and that
this is a response in some way to the
desire in the market for a smaller
tablet right and I think again you know
the pricing stuff it's they made
whatever product they wanted at this
size and so people are gonna buy 2 329
instead of trying to get to 199 yeah and
I feel like Google with a nexus 7 spent
a lot of time and energy getting it to
199 yeah because that's how they mean
that's how they had to come I think 129
dollar gulf between these two products
is not insignificant I think they're
still gonna be people and the fire HD is
well there's so many people who say i
don't want to spend they're gonna
looking to go like it's almost like 400
bucks to buy this you know 330 is that's
not almost 400 but you know what i mean
but some exposure to 400 and 200 the
vibe k is agree with that you could not
did either but the vibe of this event i
mean uh this is compared to the iphone
event much bigger it the iphone event
was bigger but it was far more snow this
is bigger i think this is with you I
felt this was a bigger event I thought
that it was a lot more stuff I thought
that it was a more exciting event for
them yeah they seemed more energized
about this I mean Phil Schiller was like
excitedly yeah he's actually moving
quickly for truth we were rushing so in
Ross on the last time we at the iphone
event I you know when you take pictures
you get a very keen sense of how fast
they're moving right so I took pictures
they often event and they move very
slowly yeah they rushed through some
things was very like on they drew it out
this one was they were moving so fast
that I couldn't take a picture of every
slide they showed
with just an absolute rarity for an
apple event yeah cuz usually they
actually just go through all the boys
I'm n Tim Cook is usually very good
about standing in front of the slide and
smiling at me so I can take the fun like
none what happens they were moving
considerably faster or not and I thought
that like the general mood first if I
think this space was it was very
obviously very dramatic you know big
theater big old theater like this but I
just felt like that the mood of
everybody on the Apple team and onstage
yeah just seems to be like everybody's
really excited about this product yeah
um I feel like more excited in the
iphone 5 I think and maybe it's because
this new maybe it's because it's a
different place maybe they're loosened
up by doing two events within a month of
each other they're just ready to go but
I thought the excitement was palpable
and in the hands on here was just out of
control I mean it was a smaller because
it's a theater or not one of the more
traditional conference venues it was a
really small like packed hands up they
basically built an apple store yeah
upstairs narrow out very small apple
store yeah uh and it was like Lord of
the Flies yeah I guess yeah in a New
York subway yeah if you can imagine not
not the restaurant an actual subway are
but no I mean there was just this
enormous flood of people to go to see
this thing and in a much more like
excitable way than I think I've seen
with it was another product it was
frankly terrifying and I figured if I
kill the man yeah I I killed toes I was
trying to get a what up here um so I
actually have to get again I have to go
unfortunately I may be back but I I have
to break away for a moment and we also
want to bring aviao so I'm going to
switch off any any questions for me
before I before I Jed you guys want to
know anything is there anything that
Josh Topolsky can tell you that another
person couldn't I think we're good Josh
um I think Neal I can't use everything
oh we're still on uh I do want to ask
you a little bit about maps later since
we didn't get to hear about that make
you can range before you done with me
yeah yeah we're never done go away come
on you don't you don't care at all get
out of here Josh that's no Lee come over
