verge here at CES 2015 I'm checking out
some new products from parrot the h2o
and the parrot pop as my wife can tell
you I have accidentally or perhaps
intentionally murdered many a houseplant
so these are the second and third in
parrots line of plant care products the
h2o is a sensor that goes into the soil
it measures temperature it uses this
little conductive section here to tell
you what's going on inside the soil
whether you have enough fertilizer it's
got a light sensor up here that tells
you if you're getting enough sunlight
and also obviously whether or not
getting enough water if you are not
getting enough water you can press a
button on your tablet on your phone and
water your plant from home or from the
road so the h2o is kind of the
bare-bones version you can put in a
regular pot you insert just a standard
water bottle and it takes all the same
sense or measurements and when you're
ready you push a button on the app and
boom it starts watering now the
difference between that and the parrot
pot is that in the parrot pot everything
is self-contained so this has the light
sensor the temperature the fertilizer
and the moisture it works with the same
app you can see here we're at about nine
or ten percent of our optimal water 72
degrees points 1:5 sunlight and if I hit
try watering water rises up comes out
and four different plants they require
different amounts of water and so you've
got some different plants here in a
section called my garden and they'll
tell you not enough sunlight to be
growing a lemon tree here
sunlights okay for a ficus you know this
is how much water you it should have how
much fertilizer and you've got a little
to-do list here where you can see you
know what would be best for your various
plants your sweet basil probably need
some water
your
citrus lemon isn't getting enough
sunlight here so maybe move it to a
different spot
so parent won't say exactly how much
these products are going to cost but
they will say that they're both going to
be coming out this year the parent
flowerpower which was the predecessor to
these is available for amend $59 and if
you want to see more awesome videos
about technology from the near future
