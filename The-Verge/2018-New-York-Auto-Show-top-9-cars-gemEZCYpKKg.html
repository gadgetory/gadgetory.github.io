at the 2018 New York Auto Show this has
been the year of trickle-down technology
we're seeing a lot of tech previously
exclusive 270 plus thousand-dollar cars
making its way into cars that you and I
can actually afford the most notable
byproduct of this trickle-down
technology is the new Nissan Altima it
has a nice exterior refresh but the
interior and what's under the hood is
the real big deal here for the first
time Nissan is offering an all-wheel
drive option to the base 2.5 liter
engine it's a really big deal because
the Camry and the Accord which are both
direct competitors for the Altima don't
offer this second Nissan's dropping the
v6 for a 4-cylinder turbo which is kind
of the move across the board for all
mid-size sedans but what's important
here is this engine has variable
compression it's essentially the vc
turbo engine from the Infiniti qx50 this
means the Pistons can adjust travel in
real time changing the engine's
compression giving you the option of
both better performance and greater fuel
economy it's really advanced engine tech
however Nissan says you can't optionally
all-wheel drive with the vc turbo
Nissan's also offering pro pilot assist
as an option for the new Altima this is
their level two self-driving tech
essentially it's cruise control on
steroids the car can maintain speeds
like radar cruise control but it'll also
keep the car in lane with minimal driver
input we saw Pro pilot on the leaf in
rogue and adding it to the Altima just
continues to push self-driving tech
forward of course like most 2019 model
cars you have apple carplay and android
auto Nissan has yet to release pricing
which you can expect the price to start
around the low 20s and mid 30s for the
top-end model Nissan's offering a launch
edition VC Altima this summer and the
rest of the models will be available in
the fall
Volkswagens here with our new Atlas -
nope it's a concept but Volkswagen is
pretty specifically listed the specs
which is not something most companies do
unless they plan on actually making this
concept to reality
it's powered by VW's 3.6 liter v6 engine
4motion all-wheel drive and an 8-speed
automatic gearbox like the Atlas it's
based on you have Volkswagens digital
cockpit replacing the traditional gauge
cluster also a simplified version of the
dual touch screens from the new Audi a6
and a7 the top screen for your media and
the bottom for your HVAC controls it's a
really nice interior as it should be the
Atlas is at the higher end of
Volkswagens lineup but just looking at
it this is the Volkswagen pickup truck
for the modern era and Volkswagen
definitely needs to make this thing real
way mo and Jaguar are here with their
new all-electric ipace fitted with way
Mo's fully autonomous tech the IPS was
announced earlier this month it starts
at $70,000 offering 240 miles of range
with nearly 400 horsepower the new deal
with Wayne Loeb claims will build up to
20,000 units with a plan to start public
testing by the end of 2018 the Wavell
integrated IPS won't be available for
anyone to buy rather it will be used as
a luxury option for wingless commercial
ride hailing services like every
American Auto Show many of the big
announcements came in the shape of a
truck crossover or SUV Toyota debuted a
new rav4 with updated styling the new
dynamic fours 2.5 liter engine found in
the Camry and an 8-speed automatic it
looks great Toyota is gonna sell a ton
of these things Cadillac joined the
small SUV market with the XT 4 starting
at $35,000 which is surprisingly low you
get a 2 liter 4-cylinder turbo with a 9
speed auto I think it looks weird that's
just my opinion
Subaru released an updated Forester it's
larger and come standard with Subarus
eyesight offering adaptive cruise
control playing keep assists and a few
other safety features what's most
important is that eyesight is standard
even on the base model so any family
that's wanting to pick up this car
you're gonna be getting all of this
safety features at the lowest possible
base model price
finally and to my surprise I was really
impressed with the new Genesis 270
before I dive in it's worth mentioning
that Genesis debuted the new essentia
concept it's all electric it looks crazy
and beautiful at the same time as it
should because it is very much a concept
car anyways we've seen bits and pieces
of the g70 since last september but the
New York Auto Show is the official 2018
u.s. debut so I'm gonna use the rest of
this video on this gorgeous car the G 70
is set to compete with the 3-series a4
and c-class you have two engine options
a 2-liter 4-cylinder making 252
horsepower and 260 pound feet of torque
and a twin-turbo 3.3 liter v6 making 365
horsepower and 376 computor tour both
come standard with rear-wheel drive but
you can option all-wheel drive on both
engines most importantly you can option
a manual transmission
if you're a car nerd and you've been
following the news you probably knew
this already
however the manual can only be fitted to
the rear wheel drive four-cylinder
variant for everything else you get an
8-speed auto with paddles and launch
control
you can also option a limited slip
differential Brembo brakes and pilot
sport for tires and like most of the
Genesis lineup you have Alexa support
and alissa driver assist features we
should see the G 70 later this summer
for around 30 grand it's exciting to see
this big push for advanced tech in all
cars across the board and when everyone
has these tech and driver assist
features available to them it'll be
really interesting to see what
trendsetters like Tesla and
mercedes-benz decide to do next there's
a ton more to cover here at the show so
