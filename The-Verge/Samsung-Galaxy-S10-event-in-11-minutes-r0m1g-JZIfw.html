(applause)
- It is my great pleasure to
welcome you to Galaxy Unpacked.
- Galaxy Fold is a device unlike
any that's come before it.
With the Galaxy Fold we're
creating a new dimension
for your phone and your life.
With the Galaxy Fold you
get a powerful smart phone
and a revolutionary tablet all
in a single premium package.
When it's folded, it
has a 4.6 inch display.
It's compact and perfectly portable
but when the device opens
up, your world does too.
With a massive 7.3 inch
infinity flex display
that transforms the Fold into a tablet.
One of the biggest challenges
was building the backbone of the device,
something that could hold strong
even after hundreds of
thousands of folds and unfolds.
The hinge's multiple
interlocking gears are hidden,
giving the device a seamless elegant look.
We also gave you four galactic
colors to choose from:
Cosmos Black, Space Silver,
Martian Green, or Astro Blue.
(loud cheering and applause)
Thank you.
Depending on the color you
choose, you can make it your own
by personalizing the hinge color too.
And the interior screen is so large
that it powers a truly
next generation experience.
One never before seen on a smart phone.
Three app multitasking.
You can watch a YouTube video of Hawaii,
text your friend about it,
and browse travel options
all at the same time.
And the key to making this possible
is called app continuity.
And what that means,
is that you can switch
between the screens
without missing a beat.
So, when you stumble across
an interesting Facebook post
on the front display, you
can simply unfold your phone
to see all the details
on the bigger screen.
The Fold has a state of the
art, seven nanometer processor
and 12 gigabytes of RAM.
There's 512 gigs of onboard memory
and for the first time on a mobile device,
support for universal flash storage 3.0.
How did we build a battery into a phone
that folds right down the middle.
Well, the answer is we built two of them.
One on each side of the device.
Our engineers have
developed special technology
to combine energy from both batteries
into a single power source.
In fact, it's actually
a system of six cameras.
Three on the back, two on the
inside, and one on the front.
The Fold comes in both
an LTE and a 5G version.
Starting from $1980 depending
on your region and carrier.
(audience chattering)
And, you can get your very own Galaxy Fold
starting on April 26th.
(applause)
- Ladies and gentlemen,
please say hello to the Galaxy S10 Plus.
- Today we're introducing
the world's first
Infinity O-Display on AMOLED.
The S10 delivers peak
brightness up to 1200 nits
and can produce more
than 60 million colors
at 100% color volume.
This display also supports HDR 10+.
Embedded directly beneath the screen,
is the world's first
ultrasonic fingerprint scanner.
The S10 comes in a variety of
stunning new prismatic hues
or you can choose one of two
premium ceramic finishes:
Ceramic White and Ceramic Black.
For capturing everyday moments,
you have the wide-angle camera
with a 77 degree field of view
you can take amazing crystal
clear photos, day or night.
And when you need to zoom in,
the telephoto camera's optical
zoom gets you twice as close.
Now finally, let's say you come
across a beautiful landscape.
At 123 degrees, its field of view
matches that of the human eye.
We've combined the
powers of the wide-angle
and the ultra-wide cameras to
give you better perspective
when using live focus.
They're more artistic
too, with new effects
that let you change the lighting
and the background blur.
You can use the color point feature
to fade the colors around the edges
or mix it up with a fun
zoom or spin effect.
Because the S10 can process more data,
it can recognize more scenes than before.
The S10 can even provide
composition tips for your photo
like where to place a subject in the frame
or whether your photo is level.
The S10 is the first
mobile device in the world
capable of recording video in HDR 10 plus.
The S10 shoots super steady videos
on par with what you'd find
in most action cameras.
It also helps you take exceptional selfies
because of the significant improvements
we've made to its front camera.
We've added dual pixel technology
which lets you take better
pictures in low light
and significantly improves auto-focus.
With the S10 Plus, you
get two front cameras
that work together to
capture depth of field,
meaning you can take
beautiful live focused selfies
just like these.
We made sure that the S10's
front camera supports UHD video,
so you can capture high quality content.
- And all these innovations
are built on a new foundation
of top of the line
performance capabilities.
And today with the Galaxy S10 Plus,
you can get up to 12 gigabytes of RAM
and one terabyte of base storage.
- [Audience Member] Woo!
- And if that's not enough,
it also comes with our
standard MicroSD slot
so you can expand your memory
up to a terabyte and a half.
Its new processor enables
up to 29% faster CPU speeds
and 37% faster GPU speeds than the S9.
The S10 Plus is equipped
with an all day battery.
Lasts up to 25% longer
than the previous model.
That's because we added a
new layer of intelligence
that delivers even more
efficient power management.
By learning how you use your phone,
the S10 identifies the apps
that you use less often.
Then it automatically
optimizes their CPU settings
to consume less power.
In fact, it's so powerful
that it can power more
than just your phone.
That's why we built the same technology
we use in our wireless
chargers right into the S10.
Transforming your device
into a wireless charging pad.
When it comes to charging your own device,
our S10 lineup supports fast
wireless charging two dot O.
We're pleased to announce that the S10
is the first ever mobile
device compatible with Wi-Fi 6.
And we've designed three different models
so you can choose which
version is right for you.
The S10 offers a premium
Galaxy experience.
With all the features you've come to know
and love over the last decade.
The S10 Plus supercharges that experience,
giving you more screen, more
cameras, and more battery.
And the S10E has all the essentials
in a more compact form factor.
The S10 is an incredible phone
but it's even more powerful
when you connect it
to the rest of the Samsung Galaxy.
First up, the all new Galaxy Buds.
These wireless earbuds deliver
a premium audio experience
with sound by AKG.
We built them with
Adaptive Dual Microphones,
one on the outside, one on the inside.
When it's quiet,
the outer mic captures
the sound of your voice,
and when it gets louder,
the Buds switch to the inner mic
to pick up your voice directly from you.
They're 30% smaller than
our previous version,
making them our lightest, most compact
and most comfortable wireless earbuds yet.
You can even use your Buds
to control Bixby on your S10.
The Galaxy Buds come in an all
new cord free charging case.
This case supports wireless charging
for the very first time
and they'll be available
starting March 8th.
We're expanding that
ecosystem with new wearables:
the Galaxy Watch Active
and the Galaxy Fit.
We rebuilt the watch's body
with a sleek new aluminum
that's super light.
Galaxy Watch Active is
also 5ATM water resistant
so you can wear it while you're swimming.
But if you want a wearable
dedicated just to fitness,
like checking your heart
rate or counting your steps,
then the Galaxy Fit might
be the right fit for you.
At 23 grams, the Galaxy Fit
is about as light as a single strawberry.
And just like the Galaxy Watch Active,
it's durable and water resistance.
And with a long lasting battery
you could keep it going for
about a week on a single charge.
They include heart rate monitors
and offer continuous stress tracking.
(applause)
Whether you want
a premium smart watch or a
straightforward fitness band,
there's a next generation
wearable that's perfect for you.
If you're looking for a new tablet,
you can pick up the Tab S5e,
our thinnest and lightest yet.
- We've talked a lot
today about the future,
but to make that future possible
we need one more essential element.
It's my pleasure to
introduce the Galaxy S10 5G.
The S10 5G comes with a stunning
6.7 inch Dynamic AMOLED Display
as well as a 4500 milliamp-hour battery.
(applause)
And your device will charge quickly too
because it comes with a
special 25 Watt charger.
To power these experiences,
we outfitted S10 5G
with a cutting edge camera system
that includes a powerful
new 3D depth sensing camera.
It's designed for a hyper connective world
where everything and everyone
is right there at your fingertips.
(ethereal music)
- It has been so great
to introduce a new family
of Galaxy devices today.
Thank you all so much for being here.
I look forward to working with all of you
to make the next era of mobile innovation
even more amazing than the first.
Thank you!
(loud applause and cheering)
(electronic music)
- Kay, so just like that, take a selfie.
We can add maybe a hashtag.
That's actually shared, so.
- Okay.
- Sounds good.
(laughter)
I hope that's okay.
(laughter)
- Really!
