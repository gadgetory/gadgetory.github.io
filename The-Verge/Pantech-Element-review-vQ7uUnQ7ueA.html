this is the pantech element it's an AT&amp;amp;T
tablet you can buy it with or without a
contract but either way you're going to
be paying 80 for a data plan
hardware-wise it's a pretty average
honeycomb tablet it's not the finished
we've ever seen but it's certainly not
particularly thick and it's tapered
nicely so that it's actually pretty easy
to hold it's really glossy on the back
so it picks up fingerprints and
scratches pretty easily but that's
pretty standard to a lot of phones we've
seen it actually feels just like a
blown-up smartphone has a sim card slot
and a microSD card slot along with micro
USB and micro HDMI they're all covered
by these sort of annoying flaps but
there's a reason for them it's got
volume and power controls right up at
the top next to each other you're
definitely meant to hold this tablet in
landscape mode it's a 43 aspect ratio
and it's an 8 inch display it's a TFT
display and generally it's fine it's not
as good as some of the ones we've seen
it's only 1024 x 768 resolution and some
small text is hard to read and it's a
little it has some jaggies on the
display but for the most part it gets
the job done fine one of the best things
about the element is actually the
speaker most tablets have speakers that
either go out the side or at the back so
audio is always being pushed away from
you but the element is actually the
speaker's right on the front so even
though it's not the loudest speaker it
actually works really well because it's
blasting the sound directly at your face
as you looking there are two cameras on
the element there's a 2-megapixel
front-facing camera and a 5 megapixel
camera on the back the back camera takes
decent pictures but it's pretty much the
same as every other tablet the camera is
also a little slow and it can take like
a couple seconds to autofocus before it
actually takes a shot the front-facing
camera is actually kind of terrible it's
a two megapixel camera which is more
than most that you see on tablets but
it's located off to the side here so
it's kind of hard to frame whatever
you're trying to get in the photo since
it's located in such as odd spot you're
definitely meant to use it in portrait
mode which works a little better but
this isn't really how you'd want to be
shooting photos the element runs Android
3.2 honeycomb and it performs pretty
much like every other honeycomb tablet
we've seen the operating system has some
definite issues with bugginess and
sluggishness and some things just
occasionally not working at all as they
should but it's certainly no worse on
the element than any
device I've used the browser on the
other hand is is actually worse than a
lot of honeycomb tablets we've seen it
has trouble rendering fonts and stuff so
sites will look a little different than
you expect them to and it also does this
thing where it will it'll load about
eighty percent of the page without
showing anything actually on the display
and then all at once we'll just load the
entire page so it looks like it's frozen
before it loads every single page which
is just kind of strange generally the
element is as I said just like most
other honeycomb tablets but there are a
couple of things that set it apart a
little bit it runs on AT&amp;amp;T LTE network
there's also a piezo actuator inside the
element which gives it a little bit of
haptic feedback for virtually every
action every time you swipe home screens
or do much of anything it gives you a
list a little bit of vibration to let
you know that you did something and it's
designed to be kind of a more immersive
experience to make it feel like
something is happening and generally
speaking like in a game it's it's a neat
trick because it actually feels like
you're hitting the pinball when you're
hitting the pinball but otherwise it's
it's kind of jarring it actually makes
it feel like there's a hard drive
worrying inside the element which is not
exactly what you want from your tablet
overall it's pretty much just like every
other honeycomb tablet we've tested it
has some serious performance issues that
we're hoping an Ice Cream Sandwich
upgrade will solve but generally it's
pretty much the same except for this
it's waterproof it's rated ip57 which
means it can sit in up to a metre of
water for up to 30 minutes but it
becomes pretty unusable as soon as it's
wet you can't really do much and often
drops of water will actually press
buttons so the screen just becomes kind
of chaotic so you can't exactly like
read in the bathtub but you can
certainly drop it in the bathtub and not
really worry about it at two hundred
ninety nine dollars with a contract or
449 without one there's really no reason
to recommend the pantech element ATT's
data plans get expensive quickly and
there's really nothing about the
elements hardware or software that makes
it any better than any of its
competitors from the kindle fire all the
way up to the ipad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
