dollar smart camera that uses AI to
detect and capture important moments in
your life now if you're a parent or pet
owner you're probably familiar with the
frustration of trying to capture great
candids of your kids or pets activities
or maybe you're familiar with having a
ton of photos and video of your family
members but you're not in any of them
because you're always the one behind the
camera now Google thinks clips can solve
that frustration by providing a camera
that can do all of the shooting for you
the only problem is well the clips just
doesn't really work that well at its
core the clips is a simple automatic
point-and-shoot camera that's similar
looking to a GoPro but it's considerably
smaller it has a fixed focus lens with a
130 degree wide angle field of view a
single button and a few LEDs but no
displaying your user interface of its
own it connects to an iPhone Google
pixel or Samsung Galaxy s7 or s8 through
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi direct to download
the images it captures and control it
but inside is what supposedly makes the
clip special it's running Google's
People detection algorithms to recognize
familiar faces and interesting activity
and then capture those moments that you
care about automatically but this is a
big but the clips isn't recording video
or sound it's technically shooting a
bunch of still images at roughly 15
frames per second which it then stitches
into seven second clips from which you
can edit or pull stills Adam it's
basically making high resolution gifts
out of the sequences of images now you
can use a big button on the front of the
camera to force a capture or you can use
the app on your phone to see what the
camera is viewing and take shots there
but the whole point of Clips is to let
the camera and Google's algorithms do
all of the heavy lifting so you can just
enjoy your time and then look at the
memories it captures later on now the
facilitate this the clips comes with a
silicone case that makes it easy to prop
up almost anywhere or yes you can just
clip it to things but it's not designed
to be a body camera you're supposed to
just set it down and leave it alone for
the most part there are other
accessories you can buy like this case
that lets you mount the clips to a
tripod for more positioning
options but otherwise using the clips is
as simple as turning it on and then
putting it where you want it you can
adjust the frequency of captures in the
clips app and you can also train it with
people that matter to you by linking it
with your Google Photos account the
clips can we're supposed to learn the
faces of important people by who it's
exposed to most often but by using the
photos data it's supposed to speed
things along you can also push the
button on the front of the camera to
take a direct portrait of someone that
you want the clips to prioritize now
Google takes all of that data and then
tries to figure out whenever your kids
are in the frame and doing something
interesting or photogenic like say
dancing or smiling and then
automatically capturing your clip now
pets work a little differently because
Google's camera algorithms can't
actually tell these individual dogs
apart it basically just looks for any
time it has an animal in the frame and
then opens its shutter
now Google stresses all of this is
happening locally on the clips camera
itself nothing is happening in the cloud
and in fact the clips doesn't even have
a way of connecting to the internet good
now once the camera has captured a bunch
of clips you use the app to browse
through them on your phone you can edit
them down to shorter versions grab still
images out of them or just save the
whole thing to your phone storage for
sharing and editing later the clips app
is supposed to learn based on which
clips you save and deem important and
then prioritize capturing similar clips
in the future you can also hit a toggle
to view suggested clips for saving which
is basically what the app thinks you'll
like out of the clips it has captured
I've been testing the closest of my two
kids for the better part of the past
week and while I appreciate what
Google's trying to do here I can't say
that I'm terribly impressed or happy
with the results I'm used to being the
one to take the photos of my family
whether they're candid or posed moments
which means it's been very hard to trust
that the clips camera is going to do
what I normally do for example I found
it wasn't taking shots all that often so
I tweaked the settings in the app to
increase its frequency but it still
seems to be very conservative with what
it will actually capture the Google says
that the clips is supposed to let you
not worry about taking photos and videos
and just let you enjoy your time and
your family but it also admits that
putting the clips in one spot and
leaving it there is an ideal either you
really have to move it around and put it
in different places and angles to get
the best results frankly at that point I
might as well just be using my
now on top of that the clips camera
hardware just isn't very good the images
that captures a flat grainy and often
have a lot of motion blur especially
indoors where I'd use it the most the 15
frames per second animations don't
really make for smooth video and I
actually missed the sound from many of
the clips at the end of the day there
just really weren't any clips that I
felt were better or more authentic than
I could capture with my phone and in
most cases the image quality was bad
enough that I had just wish I used my
phone to begin with now I'm sure I could
get better at using this I could use
some practice and get a better idea of
its ultra wide-angle field of view find
the best angles and positions it works
for and so on but I'm not convinced that
the effort involved here would be
rewarded with really great results and
that makes it tough to justify buying
and using the clips camera beyond its
cost there's also having to bring it
along make sure it's charged and then go
through transferring its images to my
phone when I could just use the phone I
already have and get better images and
video to begin with Google is definitely
onto something here and I hope it's
eventually able to make it easier to
capture pictures of light kids in the
future right now the clips just isn't
doing it
