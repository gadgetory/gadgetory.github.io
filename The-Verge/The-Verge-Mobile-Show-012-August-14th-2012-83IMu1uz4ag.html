are represented by two separate yet
equally important groups the
conglomerates who claim to provide
innovative new products and the verge
bubble show hosts who call them out on
their shenanigans these are their
stories hi I'm dieter bohn a blast hello
i'm chris sigler and this is the verge
mobile show this is this is a virgin
mobile lon lon verge episode of 12 week
of August thirteenth thank you very much
to the in decimal shot hollister for our
introduction this week I thought that
was pretty special he's the man with the
voice of gold and by the way dieter I
think I speak for Vlad when I say that I
very much missed you last week not to
say Ross wasn't an amazing guest host
but I personally missed you I I missed
you guys as well it was a it was a sad
time I instead of you guys I had I had
Dan Hesse who is very cool and very tall
but not as uh not as fun also we are
strongly or anything yeah we're in all
beard podcast today we are we are
actually I'm being this is a little
embarrassing but I haven't actually
looked at the live feed yet so I have no
idea what led looks like is this beard
lush is it is it glorious its glorious I
don't know if I'd call it lush though
now it's uh it's in the process of
growing it's in the process it's getting
there finally I'm not looking at a live
stream either but i don't think that i
mentioned this to you before but when
you I think you tweeted a picture of
yourself with like a handlebar thing
going on and it was I mean to look
absolutely amazing and I have no idea
why you didn't keep that I don't know I
I i kinda ended up feeding wrong like
this was just a bra appearance
having a mustache you mean I grew that
out especially Kris as you know I
appreciate that you meant to having a
mustache is wrong I don't want anybody
to be right just sign oh I feel the same
way I hope you look that good the same
way actually this we're going down that
topic I came across this website I think
it's askmen com which okay the website
isn't that random were weird but the
article was it was like the top 10 web
not websites top 10 countries with the
most massages in them and so here
actually ranked in the top 10 tells
relevance of Sasha's yeah i think it
probably isn't like absolute numbers its
mustaches relative to men or relative to
males but I still impressive and
surprising and would you say that
they're like they're really nice-looking
mustaches are they like Ron Swanson
caliber mustaches or they kind of thin
could they use some work I mean I think
most of them a pretty strong fine
mustache is it's it's the is that
Mediterranean stock we were never short
of Fisher or any other sort of that but
anyway mobile devices yeah we think we
have got it I got it I've got a we are
broadcasting on the internet showing you
our facial hair live for many of you
using flash and flash is going away on
Android ki Lee like that that so
basically they're there they're gonna
stop providing it in Google Play nay
android market tomorrow as we record
this and I want to say I'm not sad to
see it go but a tiny tiny wee bit sad
that it is going before we have like
good reliable consistent mobile
experiences on Android for video I just
wanted to watch this morning actually a
vimeo video didn't work on the nexus 7
and it's like oh well that sucks then I
tried it on the ipad no problem so I am
sad that I'm not sad to see flash go on
Android because it was never any good at
all ever but I am sad that it does mean
that like that last fall back solution
for watching certain content is just not
going to be there well this I think it's
an important thing though because it
puts really puts the pressure on the
entire industry to step up and and
replace it right you know as long as
flashes around and available on all
these new devices that that kind of
lessons the impetus to make things work
correctly and I think that you know if
you'd asked me in in 2008 I would have
told you or even 2010 I probably would
have told you that I I deeply deeply
despised Apple her steadfastly refusing
to support flash on mobile but in
retrospect I think it was the right move
and it helped move the industry along
and now this is going to be the next
step to push it to the next level where
we are completely a you know not a
reliant on flash I agree we're not there
yet but hopefully this will take us
there wait Chris didn't like did it did
you not like it when Apple didn't want
to support flash because I then can lay
claim to being right at a time where she
was so terribly wrong because i was in
support of apples decision i SD to just
said flash on android or any sort of
mobile device has never really worked
properly and where it's worked its
consumed power both in terms of
processing power and battery life in
ways that just don't fit mobile devices
at all so it hasn't really been a useful
or functional addition at all so apples
decision not to support it not to get
into that entire mess was absolutely the
right one but I also also thought that
was the case at the time you know when
when Steve Jobs was writing his thoughts
and flash and he had like what was it
like six reasons why it was a nightmare
it was it was flesh that he broke there
but was
a six reasons flash is a nightmare i
don't i don't remember he wrote his open
letter hot flash yeah oh yeah i think it
was six reasons for those oh yes it's
not opened on some web reliability
battery life touch and growing dependent
on third-party tools those were six yeah
so I don't necessarily agree with every
single point on his list but at a time a
lot of people divided that is just you
know a bit of arrogance or whatever one
apples part and just trying to be
different from everybody else and it is
absolutely true that if flash could be
made to work with mobile devices it was
the idea of standard because which so
ubiquitous on a desktop every video
hosting service a video sharing service
we've had has been flash-based from the
start people are doing html5 video
streaming as an add-on as a secondary
option and again as leader said is still
in the experimental stage not everybody
has or I don't know if anybody has
really good play like that for html5 so
it would have been great if it worked
but it never did so why should we be sad
no I never worked on mobile it worked
fine on the desktop with the exception
of the two rendus you know prop dessert
matter like there's a whole lot of
reasons it didn't it didn't work you
know in the past few years but initially
it was great my problem is that that
html5 just isn't there I mean there was
my you know the experience I have every
day trying to watch video on Android
devices that don't support html5 or
rather the way that the app developer
the website developer coded their html5
version of the video it doesn't appear
on Android and that's really the issue
is I feel like there's not a de facto
this is how everybody should embed video
now solution on html5 I know that there
were there's this this fight with Google
than Mozilla was in an apple was the in
the debate about what exactly the html5
video standard should be in terms of an
coding the video and serving it you know
the way that you embedded at a page is
relatively simple and I don't know
exactly the statuses on that battle but
I do know that when I'm on a mobile
device and there's video that I want to
watch from Comedy Central or Vimeo or
whomever that I just cannot assume that
it's going to work it works on usually
iOS because it's so ubiquitous and
everybody knows how to code for it but
on Android and you know other platforms
you know it's just I can never really
know and I find myself saving stuff to
pocket and then going back in my desktop
later so I can watch it and that's
annoying I also think that the html5
experience not just with video but in
general like you know there are there
are some things we have like an html5
experience and a flash experience and
the flash experience is still a little
bit better or richer and we need to get
to the point where we can completely
supplant flash we're not there yet a
good example is light row which I have
right here in my hands you guys probably
aren't seeing it but the the Lytro embed
to do the interactive depth of field 4-h
for the vm just the web-based version is
not nearly as good as as the flash embed
and so you know that that's one of many
examples where we need to we need to
improve that ok ok that's fair enough
but seriously the portable flash and
indeed to said it works for a necessity
that's what farm that stuff just today I
published this article / editorial where
I embedded a number of flash videos and
I could tell you that while I was
composing it and looking at it in our
layout editor the number of times at the
flash video just completely blanked out
and I was seeing a white space on the
page and it sometimes it will come back
sometimes I would hover over the white
space in the video pop up and sometimes
I would need to refresh entirely in
order to see the video again so that's
one thing it was happening with me on
chrome but you could you can see those
issues in every browser and all of us
have had this issue of having a flash
video playing somewhere in a tab
somewhere on your browser and then your
mouse pointer jerz disappears right
maybe this is again chrome specific but
we've all had this issue
before cried and moaned about this issue
Adobe's never fixed it and I mean we
already know that a dog is you know
abandoning flash everywhere um which
again to me is good riddance but I don't
want us to UM speak a flash in overly
positive terms just because it's dying
and that's a habit not to speak badly of
the dead right to drive me nice I I just
don't want us to sugarcoat flashes
sucked was such a such a long time um
and it's really it's really time for us
to just accept that we've got the
internet we've got things like video
that want to stream and it's up to
people coders to figure out how to do
that in the best way flash wasn't it so
move on but I have no problem speaking
terribly Oh symbian I don't know what
you're talking about Chris's email
address is Chris at the verge com if you
want to talk to him about your thoughts
on sybian oh man yeah uh I mean I guess
we will see if it would be nice if there
were a clear open standard to replace
flash with html5 video that everybody
sort of knew but i knows i feel like
it's just gonna be a mess for a while
and that's fine it's better better to
have that I guess that flash um but you
know I mean Adobe should be that company
they said they were gonna be they were
they made comments like they were going
to help solve this problem but who knows
if they're actually able to pull it off
because adobe hasn't they're not exactly
firing on all cylinders right now if if
you know what I mean I know I mean and
yeah um which we talked about so
motorola Google's gonna lay off twenty
percent of motorola's workforce which is
Yankee more people has decided that it
doesn't want all of Motorola cylinders
yeah it's like you know you guys go we
don't need you yeah and they're gonna
kick out fewer phones to right right so
so these are I was trying to figure this
out earlier in the week are these
Google's first publicly announced
layoffs in the company's history ooh if
if if they aren't it then then it's one
of the very few I know that they've
they've quietly pushed some people out
of the door in the past but I don't know
if this is ever really happen on this
scale before um it's it's yeah I'm this
game definitely and this is some 4,000
employees to being right by it right yes
it's a big deal for these guys and I
think you know I have mixed feelings
about it as I think we all have mixed
feelings about motorola I don't think
that if Motorola had stayed an
independent company they would have gone
this route as drastically and as quickly
as they have uh and and I think that
Google is really anxious to push the non
Android hardware out of its portfolio
really that's what what it's all about
right Motorola has a lot of low-end
devices still that it sells in emerging
markets Brazil and China and India where
you know if they aren't android-based
that that just isn't that doesn't play
into Google's business model for
motorola at all so it's getting rid of
those right at the top one thing but
that I heard yesterday that's kind of
interesting at least to the the local
economy since I'm chicago-based here is
that they had specific incentives uh to
I believe to move their headquarters to
downtown Chicago it's right now they're
they're actually based way out in a
suburb but in order to qualify for those
incentives they had to maintain local
employment of at least 2500 this this
round of layoffs pushes them below 2,500
so they actually are now disqualified
for incentives that they had had before
so I don't know what that means in terms
of uh you know where their headquarters
is going to ultimately be I think
they're still moving downtown here but I
see you know I've said for many months
now and I still think this is true that
in the long term it makes a ton of sense
for them to be either co-located with
Google or at least in the same
neighborhood and they do have an office
on the west coast but you know they've
got most of what i heard is that most of
their local employees in chicago our
engineers those are the kinds of people
that you want on the west coast so i
wouldn't be surprised to see them
about West sooner or later I would guess
it would take a while before they move
out west I think that at some point Mel
annoy or even Chicago would be like well
you know we really do want you to stay
you'll see if we can change our tone on
those incentives yeah yeah I mean I
personally like the idea of there being
innovative you know technology company
not located in California I think that's
you know that's good for the diversity
of thought and what goes into
smartphones and I'm now giving motorola
praised for its diversity of thought
which is a weird thing but nevertheless
I'm doing it I don't know I mean I look
at photon q I wonder just what's going
on over there but i agree with detail
does absolutely need to diversify the
sources for our designs and our ideas
for phones whether it be you know
outside of the west coast of the United
States or entirely outside of the United
States it is good to have fresh ideas I
mean one of the most innovative phones
which never actually materialized if you
guys remember it was the first else and
that was thought up over in Israel and
the innovation with it was that the
whole you I was supposed to be done
based so you only use one hand one thumb
I know kinda like the UI grows around
your fingers and your interaction with
it which probably was like too ambitious
a project and that's why I never
materialized but you know it didn't come
from a san francisco area it didn't come
from the bay area so i agree i also go
to Toluca Motorola and I need to mention
this I got a droid razr maxx here
because I wanted to see it good for
motorola i want to see it for the first
time and the first thing is this thing
is a mess better inside it but i can't
tell that it doesn't feel fat like I
expects you to be smushed thicker than
it actually is and I just unplugged it
from charge at the moment we started the
show so I love that you guys
somewhere somehow the victory is not
going to decrease during the course if
if you actually see the battery go down
while we're podcasting that means we've
been podcasting way too long no no I was
talking about the the podcast of the
show I'm talking that in general like
during the week because I also I've also
given my slack we took vaca for a week
so I'm not tweeting for a week just see
that I can do it so I can't tweet when
the battery runs out but maybe again I
her on Google+ so I mean yeah really I
don't mean any disrespect Vlad but that
really isn't as ambitious of a project
as Paul is undertaking hmm well what is
Chris after well stop going up against
the pyramids and a be less ambitious oh
this is true this is true yeah the droid
that my concern with the droid razr maxx
i just tweeted this yesterday is that i
don't know if they can repeat the feat
of that device with a better display
right because the the reason they were
able to do that is because they took the
razor chassis which is only 7.1
millimeters and the way I got down to
7.1 millimeters is by using a really
crappy self-illuminating explain AMOLED
and and just bumping it back up to the
regular thickness of a regular like
modern smartphone and then using all
that rebet remaining capacity for
battery I think it's what 3,000 milliamp
hours or something so the question is
good and a hundred yet yeah so the
question is can they take that concept
and put in a display that doesn't suck I
don't know I mean that thing I don't
last a month i mean the the razr maxx
has got incredibly good battery life
with LTE i mean if you're just running
this thing just straight HSPA i mean i
can't imagine what you could do to it to
kill a batter you would you literally
have to like put it in an oven and run a
flash video before it goes away tomorrow
constantly and maybe you could drain the
battery will find that yeah find out but
I mean look what I'm saying is is such a
fat battery that you could easily have
fat phone and feel justified in the
phone being chunky like
the sample is the PureView 808 which
I've had plenty of recent experience
with it feels about yeah twice the size
of this like the Rays max kind of feels
it just feels like a regular size but it
is an extra super slim and skinny like
the original Ray's oh yeah the new HTC
and Samsung phones but I actually don't
need it to be like it feels like it's a
great size and there's no compromise but
as chris says the nerves compromises
emphasize is down to the amal to display
now which is okay no it's actually doing
a better motor oil itself because this
is interesting to me um I mean just look
at this particular phone which I don't
know why I'm carrying on about it so
much but nobody else has really tried to
match that yeah we'll just go crazy with
a battery thing Samsung has done I stuck
a pretty big battery inside to get it
here it's free but I just part of the
whole package and sounds like an HTC
like I've been complaining for a long
time keep going for bigger and bigger
displays and trying to crank out specs
but all is doing something different so
if the company is now going to focus on
a few good phones uh maybe hopefully
that diversity that dieter and I spoke
about will help and then we'll see some
hyuga phones that are actually different
from the good phones that everybody else
trying to build what do you guys think
right yeah I would like to see something
you know inspiring i mean i mean the the
razor it's a cool design and I like the
aesthetic of the hardware of course you
know the software I don't know whatever
but I mean it just it didn't catch my
attention because I was more focused on
the Galaxy Nexus and the innovation that
was happening there and it you know took
them forever to get ice cream sandwich
on the razor and you know we've
obviously seen samsung just dominate and
we've seen HTC at least try to sort of
reinvent itself but I'm interested to
see if Motorola can
I don't elucidate a similar vision for
you know fewer phones and this is what
Motorola is this is what it means to buy
a motorola phone now because right now
if you ask somebody what does it mean to
buy a motorola phone they'll tell you
what do they tell you they'll tell you
it me it's a start tag or razor the
original razor or the tell you that oh
yeah that razr maxx has got ridiculously
long battery life and those are cool you
know features and that's you know
there's people still know motorola but
nobody thinks about motorola as like
having a corporate identity as an
android manufacturer I don't want to see
if they can actually pull that off I
want to pebble too that's all I want
double to that the original pebble was
amazing device then yeah the
spring-loaded hinge the way that you
opened it by like sliding it off the the
magnet I think I've I've wax poetic
about this phone three or four times in
the past but it's worth doing again
century since we're talking about
motorola my question is you know we've
heard google say on many occasions that
they're going to run motorola at arm's
length which i think is good for many
reasons one is that there's less an
appearance of you know favoritism among
other android oems but then also it
makes it easier for google to offload
motor oil in the future if they want to
which i wouldn't be surprised if he or
two or three down the road that happened
but by the same token you can kind of
tell you definitely get the impression
that google is not a fan of OEM skins
and and they are probably not a fan of
the fact that they're there really isn't
anyone other than google doing anything
with the stock android experience with
the nexus series and we've heard these
rumors about the wall street journal
rumor about a series of nexus devices
coming out later this year nexus found
specifically so i'm wondering whether
motorola is going to continue to develop
a blur whatever it is that they're
calling it these days or if they are i
mean is that going to rub google the
wrong way enough that they kind of steer
motor oil in the direction of going
stock the raisin nexus I'm just
thinking of the name yeah that sounds
uber my mother that's good i'm on a pond
on record as what I could what did I
commit to buying a hundred razors if
they ship it with a stock Android is
that that what I said this is like from
up two months ago three months ago I I
hope it happens but then you know I
guess motorola becomes the company that
ships stock Android that could be cool I
could get on board with that actually
I'm shadow just waiting for the next
Nexus device I am sticking to death
about not having a stock Android LTE
device on AT&amp;amp;T I'm running cyanogenmod 9
i'm HTC One X developed by a guy over at
XDA and it's running pretty well but
it's still not quite you know fully
stable so I'm gonna be seen by eating a
Galaxy Nexus and oh oh oh you switch it
back to the guys I'm gonna get back to
that but let me just say that quote from
you was just the perfect distillation of
a first-world problem I'm sick to death
of not having an AT&amp;amp;T LTE phone with
such as such specs in such as such
capabilities as the Android not having
that is literally making me sick I am
getting closer to death because this
thing whatever I learn look okay europe
europe and asia lead uh led the entire
wireless industry for a solid 20 or even
30 years and now it's America's turn
freedom prevails bald eagles flying over
in fact Creighton Brennan if you guys
can add some bald eagles behind me right
now I'd appreciate that it sort of CGI
thing maybe a flag maybe some fireworks
it is our turn to to leave the world
with LTE and I am reveling in it and I
know deters as well and you know I'm
just gonna go out and buy PS veto on
behalf of the Euro Japanese tea just
really good job sitting here because I
really want to deal with it but I don't
have my sunglasses nearby so the surging
to make the point though theory
switching back to a Galaxy Nexus Chris
granted Oh weekend
switching power Galaxy Nexus I mean you
got this temporarily until I is
temporary would both of you I know is
temporary until the next next spy okay
uh but seriously I'm the guy who wrote
the piece against Chris's piece saying
the guy's a nexus is the best and remote
and then you guys I use in the guys next
again I can't speak for themselves no
listen Vlad but I'm just gonna put an
end to this rampant and baseless
speculation right now okay yes my sim is
in a Galaxy Nexus everything yes but the
only reason I did it is because like
there is no good reason I just like yeah
I'll switch phones sure cuz I to be at
very honest I haven't played with 4.1
that much on the outside I played with a
nexus 7 a lot but not 4.1 on a phone I
only used it on the galaxy nexus for
like 15 minutes before I put it back in
the gs3 before so I wanted to give it
like an honest and fair shake although
AT&amp;amp;T HSPA in Chicago is just as bad as
ever it's completely non-functional
during weekdays so this isn't going to
Stanford very long I I'm sure that by
the end of this week I will be back into
another device so the fact that we
started a conversation on motorola and
ended talking about the Galaxy Nexus is
a perfect example of where companies
right now we have I want to talk about
this new mobile payments committee which
I want to say sounds really ominous but
maybe it's not so I've been complaining
at length about the fact that mobile
payments as fragmented and there's no
unified ecosystem and you never know if
you're gonna be able to use it and
apparently all the big players listen to
me to me specifically and in reaction to
my specific complaints because I'm so
influential and powerful in the industry
they have formed the mobile payments
committee which consists of Google Isis
paypal verifone into it ATT Sprint
t-mobile and Verizon beacon and I just
drop a quote in here just very very high
I believe
I'm quoting correctly from civilization
here and co is the bureaucracy is
expanding to meet the growing needs of
the bureaucracy that's how this fiercely
let's have a committee to organize the
organizational bodies but it is hey it's
an laugh about it all you want but it is
a very important step it is a step that
was needed because it was starting to
look like you know this was just going
to devolve into a really consumer
hostile fiefdom that served nobody's
benefits or best interests Cuse me and
and I have to say after using google the
latest version of google wallet on the
Galaxy Nexus the past couple days like
it's starting to congealed starting to
really come together and I want to see
all of these carriers and Google and
Apple I want to see all these guys get
on the same page because this is
something that has to happen yeah I mean
uh the what was the takeaway at CTI
forget what what that big you know
article about fragmentation what we call
but one of the one of the original
headlines was you know mobile payments
nobody's winning but we're all losing
and it's all you know everybody was
trying to win and that just meant that
you had no way of knowing if you know
your particular wallet would work and in
theory anyway all these guys being out
of committee together sure it's more
bureaucracy and it's all star chamber
and there's going to be back room deals
and blah blah blah but you know what if
the thing that gets kicked out of this
is here's the standard you can have all
these fragmented solutions but here's a
baseline standard that they are all
going to use so that you can trust that
your wallet will work when you go to CVS
or 7-eleven or Tiffany's or people shop
that's good and I hope that that
actually happens now the interesting
thing about this crazy committee is that
there's one company that's not on it
that you would expect to be on it and
that square aka the company that's
actually doing the best job at mobile
payments right now yeah I I wouldn't
actually expect Square to be on that
committee and just very briefly to come
back to the the reason I was flippant
with the point about your
ma cracy was the es is a beautiful dream
that they were organized themselves and
have a cogent plan that applies to
everybody but I kind of feel like we've
seen this with a whole bunch of such
loose voluntary organization swings like
the open handset alliance me what does
that stand for with Android like who who
does what there how does that contribute
to the overall landscape I don't think
it does anything and I kind of feel like
this is going to go the same way but
also this committee that has now been
gathered seems to be exclusively focused
on enabling mobile payments via the
mobile phone itself we're square is
focused on its own service and also on
its own appendage for a phone right so
in order you need the square card reader
in order to have you cards read out of
things square has a master's square has
square has geofencing where you walk in
and the the cashiers got an ipad and
they're like oh Vlad just walked in and
you're like hey I'm glad like hey Vlad I
would like this coffee and now here's
your coffee and then you say thanks and
you walk away and that's the whole
transaction that you don't pull out your
phone you don't swipe a card you don't
tap an NFC thing they just they know who
you are they have your picture pops up
and you know because you walked into
their geofence and then you ask for what
you want to buy and they sell it to you
and you're done okay so i had like
completely missed this business model
pivot from square i still remember the
square card reader oh no they stopped it
still exists it's still the most popular
option in fact they recently I want to
say like six months ago they they
finally switched it to being encrypted
it used to be that would just send the
credit card data unencrypted but now
it's encrypted so it'll only work with
squares app which was the thing that
paypal and Intuit were yelling at them
about or saying or better at anyway so
like but the thing about square is like
you know you want to root for them you
know Dorsey is that his name and you
know little startup and is it an
exciting story and that's great but
that's not what gets you at the checkout
register at you know Macy's but then
got him in the checkout registered
starbucks so maybe I'm which is a big
thing just really big deal yeah well it
looks a little my exception of square
from the very beginning was like if you
looked at their business model number
one of the on the list of goals with
Starbucks it was just obviously I think
even the initial pitch was like here's
how you pay for a cup of coffee it's
like where do you go to bring that sort
of functionality other than Starbucks
which is outlets so far and wide and so
many of them it's it's a huge coup for
them but just to savage quickly my
initial point about not expecting Square
to be part of this committee chameleon
organization again the even with
geofencing that their business model is
different you know that they're not
trying to do mobile apps for phones in
the same way that everybody else is kind
of trying to do like Google Wallet well
yeah but do they need to I mean you know
they don't think I don't the argument
that we've been making is that mobile
payments in order to not suck need to be
ubiquitous and is square on a path to be
Vic with us like you know yeah
ubiquitous games I gotta get in the
dirty dirty mess of talking to these
gigantic players they control the market
Visa and MasterCard and you know any
scene whoever else makes a checkout
registers like that whole thing like
square could disrupt it and they've done
it a little bit with their their little
dongle and you know direct payments on
devices in yada yada yada but you know
these other companies aren't gonna just
go away and they're going to fight back
and so I would like to c square go ahead
and get its hands dirty and corrupt its
ideals just a little bit to get us all
on the path to you know a single
ubiquitous solution that's you know
maybe it's a meta solution but it's at
least something that you know we know
will work and like that's been my thing
for you know since i started talk about
mobile payments what's the little
surprising to me is that starbucks i
feel like starbucks is in the process of
seating its own very advanced mobile
payment system i mean they have one of
the most successful mobile payment
systems in the world already right i
think there was some
that came out earlier this week or last
week that what 40 or 50 or 60 some
ridiculous percentage of all
transactions at starbucks currently in
the united states are our our mobile
based which is insane and i don't think
there's any other major retailer that
can claim that it be you know because
they have their their Starbucks app that
that is on iOS now right right and you
just you know you link up whatever card
to it and it displays that that 2d
barcode and these they have those those
2d scanners in every Starbucks already
so I mean it's really cool that the
starbucks is being so proactive about
this in advancing the cause but at the
same time they were already there so I
don't quite understand why they were the
ones to step forward and support this on
a really broad scale when they already
had that capability and they've been
pushing that capability for four years
that's a really good point then III
can't even come up with a good answer
that situation I'm a surprise as d2
that's a high number but then we also
have to consider that you know starbucks
outlets aren't going to be you know park
next to motel on the highway in
Montana's on some place I their most
style box are you know anybody urbanized
central city areas where people already
have smartphones and techies tend to
hang out oh there's starbucks at Montana
you'd be surprised start okay yeah yes
should be um alright what's next so I'm
or has got a rumor that the apples going
to take pre-orders for the new iphone
right away on the twelfth that they'll
start internationally October fifth and
they should be shipping I think
relatively quickly pretty much right
away since ever 21st is when people will
be able to start buying a device I mean
if we if we buy that you know they're
gonna be announcing a product the 12th
then you know Apple has always had
pre-orders right away and ship right
away right after so it's pretty much par
for the course so I don't I don't really
have any reason to doubt this I'm just
I'm excited for an LTE iphone which is
weird for me to say because i'm totally
not inspired by iOS 6 but I'm excited to
see what an iphone feels like was crazy
fast LTE data yeah euro I've got bad
news for you dieter your LTE is not
going to be crazy fast because you and
somewhere between 10 and 50 million
other Americans are all going to be
experiencing LTE on iOS for the first
time or on an iphone for the first time
I should say and these networks are
gonna slow to a crawl I think that I
talked about this a week or two ago
maybe i did but i think i did that that
uh that LTE in 18 TLT in chicago has
already noticeably started slow down and
I think that's the gs3 effect because
I've seen GS threes everywhere since
they launched and and I think that
that's really started to have a negative
pressure on an LTE speeds so the gs3 is
doing that I can only imagine what the
iPhones going to do you okay so is it
time for me to give up on eighteen t is
that it that like it's it's time for you
it's time for you to give up on wireless
uh everybody is moving back to corded
phones and just stay on your cable modem
don't leave your house that's all I can
recommend you know it's long if I was in
your shoes detail I would just switch
t-mobile just cuz everybody else off
switch t-mobile and support the little
guy because that company is struggling
and yes I am in the process of doing a
really kick-ass great right now because
T mama reported its quarterly results
yadda yadda yadda and they tried to
patch over things but they've lost half
a million of their contract subscribers
in in the last quarter or relative to
the previous year I think which is you
know I'm hugely worrying number like
everybody else sprint cat was kind of
able to hold on to subscribers AT&amp;amp;T and
Verizon keep growing subscribers but the
guys who are losing subscribers a team
over and then losing hair the
interesting thing about that I mean I'm
not too surprised to see them lose
postpaid subscribers but both t-mobile
and Sprint are seeing huge grill in
prepaid subscribers and
you know there's this has sort of been
floating around on the internet this
idea that you know why are we all on
these super expensive postpaid plans
when prepaid pant plans are so much
cheaper month to month for basically the
exact same service and I'm getting to
the point where like I don't have a good
answer for that like at all like I you
know right I by phone so often that the
subsidies don't matter to me i'm
basically subsidizing nothing except for
att's profit margin at this point i mean
the only reason for me to not move to a
prepaid model is basically phone choice
and phone selection and that's a prepaid
with prepaid you just get at least on
tmobile you just get a sim anyway or you
can just get a sim if you want and then
you do it right well what I want is for
there to be an LTE option yeah yeah
what's up by the way this isn't this
isn't on the topic list but we should
briefly mention it we are hearing rumors
this actually came in through TmoNews
but we've kind of been able to semi
corroborated there's there's discussion
of am a temp song s ght 899 for tmobile
that appears to be able to phone 8
device with a 720p display and LTE oh
yeah I see right yes this is the the
phone that we rumored as the odyssey
well not rumored it was in Samsung's
court documents from the apple core case
last month that which appears to be
basically a gs3 chassis for for apollo
which you know when you think about it
is exactly what Apollo needs and uh and
so so if t-mobile gets this device and
it's one of their launch LTE devices
that'll be a pretty compelling windows
phone 8 argument but my guess since
t-mobile's previously said that they
won't have commercial LTE until 2013 my
guess is that they'll launch it with LTE
dormant and if it launches in 2012 at
all we don't even know that much but if
it launches this year you probably won't
realistically be able to get into any
real LTE service until next year that's
too long the wait man I can't handle it
you know
I know I hear you um no but I mean so I
mean volte I mean you know I have this
this article about about sprint trying
to be like the nice guy but it's in
what's interesting with both of these
guys is they're struggling but they make
are managing to you know pick up some
customers in the prepaid market but the
prepay market just isn't as profitable
as opposed paid market and so like I
would be really interested to know like
if you go into the boardroom of t-mobile
and Sprint how they really feel about
all these customers on these other plans
that are cheaper for the customer but
not making them as much money like a
they're there right there at least
offsetting their losses and postpaid
customers but they're doing it with
people that bring in less are boo we owe
the tmail God has been rules all I don't
know about sprint but the t-mobile has
actively been trying to reduce subsidies
for a long time I think that there's a
perception at t-mobile that that really
weighs on their bottom line having to
subsidy havily subsidized hardware so
they I mean of their I can think of
several examples of hardware that
they've launched in the past couple
years that they've launched at a higher
price point even on postpaid than AT&amp;amp;T
and Verizon have and that's because they
you know they they're not as willing to
to put these giant subsidies on those
devices so from that perspective you
would think that moving to this subsidy
free model even at the cost of monthly
arpu would be exactly what they've been
trying to do on some level at least
extrema we end up in this this this
they're doing this like this equipment
installment plan which again like in
principle I think it's a good idea where
you still get a subsidy you still sign a
contract but once you're done paying off
the subsidy the 20 bucks a month extra
then you just go back down to your
regular cheaper plan like it's a great
idea in principle but in practice it
just sort of is like a another confusing
mess I just wish that somebody verizon
hi verizon would you know start listing
the full unsubsidized price of phones
even if you're paying the subsidized
price
like they should list next to every
phone this is the full on subsidized
price first and then this is the
subsidized price if you're willing to
sign it to your contract very sometime
they do and and the thing is when they
do that and they were convinced that us
legitimate because Dale is things like
six five nine nine spot man and a woman
okay 659 dot 99 yeah and they kind of
seem like inflated prices and and they
seem like way too perfect prices when
you consider that they bind off those
phones in box from you know phone makers
so I never really trust those prices
when they say this is how much it used
to be and this is how much you could be
otherwise it cetera like that doesn't
feel like the right price well hey
they're not selling the phone at cost
right there said even when they're
selling it off contractor selling it
with a with a profit margin yeah I mean
that's right that's their their right as
a retailer but i think what deters
suggesting is that it would be nice to
see the American carriers and we've said
this countless times would be nice to
see the American carries move to a
slightly more European model where yeah
it really is about it is about the the
cost of the phone and then if you want a
tariff that knocks some some of that you
know that that reduces sting of that
hardware costs then go ahead and sign up
for it yeah now I totally agree totally
agree I mean to me this this proceeding
conversation is kind of absurd because I
see exactly what you're talking about
the European model Chris we're in the UK
you have Amazon you have a bunch of
importance guys like expenses hand tech
home etc etc like this actually really
well developed mini industry people
importing bringing in phones and then
competing on price each other is kind of
absurd to the US bond market but it do
compete on price just on the phone
itself and Amazon because it doesn't pay
any tax in the UK because tax dodging
such and such really go in some
dependency low prices and that creates
great competition and then I mean then
you could you have a choice then you
could go prepaid you could have a
contract but just get the sim card is
supposed to bind the phone to the host
subsidy dance which is diva says
it gives people better output because
the subsidy automatically includes it
selects your cash for them like however
much you subsidize because the phone is
not perfect it was you know tack on a
couple of extra dollars and that's how
you increase the output so I mean my
advice to anybody who's always buy the
phone by itself by the dates and the
contract by itself the perfectly
separable things they don't need to go
together now let's see that's a lie
because you cannot go into eighteen t
Verizon today on a postpaid plan and say
give me the data and don't charge the
extra that you would have charged me if
I had bought a foam with the subsidy you
can do that on t-mobile and you can do
it on some of the prepaid stuff that are
both NB knows on sprints and blah blah
blah but if you go and go into ATT and
pay for an android phone straight up you
do not you still are paying the same
amount per month that you would be
paying if you had ATT subsidizing the
phone by four hundred bucks over the
course of two years so if you if you
think I'd be switching phones a lot sure
hey don't pay the subsidy but in the US
on ATT and Verizon I think that you
should go for the subsidy even though
you're stuck in a contract and it sucks
and blah blah blah at least you know
that you're getting at four hundred
bucks ah you know off the price of the
phone and that gets spread out over the
cost you to your contract you're
actually paying more by buying a phone
straight out if you're not getting a
discount on your data and voice under
contract by the way uh creighton just
whispered into my ear he said I know
what arpu is but for the benefit of of
our listeners every week I know it well
you know and he knows what I pro is we
all know what arpu is but but we should
say arpu is average revenue per user arp
it's how much money the carrier's
squeeze out of you every month and they
all basically verizon i think at record
ARPU the highest of any carrier 18t was
very high springs very proud of theirs I
don't know what t-mobile's was it
probably wasn't great but they're all
making a ton of money and
I hate them I hate everybody well
actually it is princess looping a ton of
money is losing billions but that's
because of because of extra financial
engineering that goes on behind you see
use with all of these corporations and
the complexity in terms of as you say
these are just selling stuff to people
yeah they're making way too much money
we should okay so I want to talk real
quick about the the this federal port
they're going to maybe reassess
quote-unquote the how cellphone
radiation gets measured and approved in
in the US for compliance with the FCC
and you know we've got this report from
Adrian you know describing how the
process looks now and that's fine and we
can have an argument that is completely
uninformed about which study is more
likely to be correct or not correct
about whether or not it causes cancer
but what's crazy to me is these things
are designed as though they assume
you're carrying your phone and a holster
and I guess like it's not recommended
that you carry your phone in the pocket
like so like the radiation stuff is set
assuming the phone is on a holster on
your belt not in your pocket and it
seems like a really small difference in
terms of its proximity to your body but
it's enough to make me go uh I'm not
going to start carrying on my ulcer
because that's crazy this is but I mean
let's be real this is only a problem if
if if you have any desire to have
children whatsoever which you know
that's fair enough yeah which I don't
right I mean maybe they do who wants to
reproduce yeah yeah no I haven't seen a
normal human being put their phone in a
holster in a very very long time I mean
there's Dwight on the office use as a
whole but other than that I it's not
really a common sight it's more I think
it's more a common sight these days for
someone who's using a blackberry or an
ID n device that's essentially if you
want to see a phone in a holster go to a
Microsoft Store and you'll see those
Lumia 900 in like I phone holsters I
foam other cases are you serious
yeah so what do you think is doing
Matthew perizaad Oh on a Twitter he was
he was tweeting about it the other day
too like we both seen it that's pretty
amazing yeah she's away i'm going to i
wait I'm sorry but I have to interrupt
before I forget there is a very
important tumblr that everyone should
check out that I just found out about
myself today I called celebrity Windows
Phone sightings that tumblr com uh where
you'll see some crazing real-life
celebrities why you see I'm the
construction still awaiting building
materials you didn't know about
celebrity Windows Phone sightings tumblr
com no I had no idea but you're dancing
I know I had no idea is the most amazing
thing me about this site is that they're
like tons of b and c and d listers uh
and ii Lister's like myself uh and and
all of the B&amp;amp;C Lister's are using glossy
white nokia lumia 900 sometimes with the
matching monster headphones and my
suspicion is that nokia like blanketed
the entire B&amp;amp;C list community with these
devices at some point earlier this year
and then you know they all felt
compelled to take instagrams of
themselves you know using these phones
it's great that's really wonderful I
hope know if he does it again for their
Apollo launches memories Photoshop this
um this cyan Lumia 900 in your hand
there chris but it's not not a very good
photoshop it wasn't me that's all i can
tell you that it definitely was not me
yeah i mean before we get stuff from
first anyway he is quite proud of his
windows phone usage so i gotta think
christmas who hide from that fact but
quick correction there is absolutely
never a justification to say there's a
really important tumblr that everybody
needs over like that census you can just
you know slide it away file it away is
now going to use that again honey my
only question was do
think that there is somebody who used to
work for HTC when they design the nexus
one who has moved to the US government's
testing facility because this is the
same kind of thing remember when okay
wait is it's a it's a dubious connection
but it's that stick it a phone and a
host that not put in at newpark remember
what a nexus one has some screen issues
with people popping it in a pocket and
HTC's first reaction was tantamount or
what's the goose I don't know but the
first reaction was sent about saying
well you're not supposed to put the
phone in your pocket and everyone was
like what I don't remember this at all
are you guys serious the next one crazy
it was very good past few years people
okay was the next one it had some screen
issues with scratching on the screen and
oh okay outside okay well I'm sure that
some of our listeners / viewers uh oh
that's me about scratching okay I do
vaguely remember this yes yeah according
to HTC's technical support they don't go
in pockets let's the screen gets cracked
I think they were referring two back
pockets like you're not supposed to sit
on the damn things right which I think
expenses will happen to people sitting
on them that things are kind of get axed
shattering effect sir also i read that
there are a lot of people that there are
probably a lot of people who just throw
their phone in a pocket with like keys
and coins and stuff which i mean it
doesn't matter what kind of material you
know space-age materials the phone is
made out of you still should be doing
that so that's one conceivable
explanation speaking of phones and
holsters rim says that it is totally
ready to license blackberry 10 so
somebody should lanes it yeah they have
the a now they need to be you know yeah
I mean we'll see no you won't know I
mean who man
oh no we we don't need to go into room
anymore that's dead I mean we also had
the rumor that like IBM was like poking
around at their Enterprise Services Unit
and maybe wanted to buy it came out of
Bloomberg like my sensen like it's been
this from the beginning since these
rumors started is like the board has
like drank the kool-aid they fully want
to see what happens they fully think
that like they're gonna launch
blackberry 10 and then something's gonna
happen i know of course you don't think
they're even going to get that far but i
think they're gonna get that far and
it's gonna be it's gonna be like it'll
be out of the market for a month and
then the board will be like yeah it
didn't work let's sell the company i
think that you you could very well be
right they could end up in a touchpad
kind of situation where these phones hit
the market for a very short period of
time and then there's a you know a
bait-and-switch kind of thing and the
company goes away or you know they they
break it up and sell it piecemeal or who
knows they're there are many many
different scenarios none of them that i
can see and well for rim and you know
i'm not a professional analyst and I
don't have an MBA and I don't have a PhD
in economics so I don't want to make any
diehard predictions on what's going to
happen with this company but I just you
know you look at every possible scenario
I don't know how or where they can
succeed and I'm sure you know to a to
sort of backup this IBM thing that went
around I'm sure that there is a lot of
value in what rim has done and continues
to do in that space they have a lot of
expertise in enterprise security and
infrastructure and they they can tie
into all these different services and
they're good supporting devices from an
IT perspective and that business
undoubtedly has a lot of value but as
far as blackberry 10 specifically goes
there starting from scratch there's also
the the UNIX business which has a lot of
value to their in a lot of cars there
are a lot of other kinds of embedded
systems so they
there is value in the company that's
waiting to be unlocked but I don't see
how you know I think that the end game
for rim is probably going to be that
they they break up pieces of the company
that are worth a lot of money and sell
them off and whatever's left just
withers on the vine that's that's dire I
know but I it's I mean we've we've been
through too much a that you know the the
downfall of the symbian foundation broke
my heart I'll never be able to get over
that and since then I've just been a
jaded son of a gun I don't know well you
know blackberry 10 like the playbook
probably well no I'm fact I'm sure well
we'll run cute apps based on the the QT
application framework cute that nokia
has just sold off to what is it digia de
guia yeah digia and so like the core
application it it's this framework
because actually like was pretty good
for cross-platform stuff and I suppose
still is it was you know for developing
on symbian and then on Miko I know that
cute apps were running on webos they've
got it running on the play book so it
seems like it's a relatively flexible
application framework but you know if
they'll they'll get it running for
android iOS Windows 8 they say but I
mean I think it's like I'm not a cute
fanboy because I don't know that much
about it but it's always been like an
interesting thing it's always seemed
like it was the closest to actually
being cross platform app development
before html5 and still probably better
performance than some html5 stuff and
I'm a little bit sad to see Nokia drop
it but I'm not at all surprised but
maybe doesn't really going to do
anything with it yeah right he was part
of its former strategy the one that
revolved around the various symbian me
go combinations that nokia was going to
hopefully try and develop and create so
it makes sense to set it up and then
nokia initially sort of her beliefs and
licensing rights to this year which is
another finished company
so at least at least cute is sticking
around in Finland even if Nokia's
manufacturing facilities aren't zing and
anyway the other thing really to be said
about this is that he's paying four
million euros to complete this deal
which tells you everything you need to
know Nokia's cutting ties with his
former strategy for operations I mean
Stephen Elop has already cut quite a few
jobs so which presumably you know touch
on this cute development team so you
know the price of four million euros in
corporate terms I mean to you to you and
I it's a lot of money but in corporate
terms it is like well here is a little
loose change it's like he's village
enemy as well just open sourced it and
giving it away you know that I sort of
got my you know a little bit of a
goodwill but I mean yeah I think it's a
little bit like I think it's a little
bit like dig I think that there's a lot
more to the story than the five hundred
thousand dollars that was paid for dig I
think there's more to the story than the
four million euro that did you play a
paid for cute because I mean if nothing
else there's the ongoing expense of
paying the the the engineers that are
moving to digia I mean that you know
there's there's a whole thing it's not
just up front four million euro oh yeah
no no that's a good point i mean nokia
could be saving a lot of money I in
redundancy payments if you decided ok
world person was in this we shutting
down development he might have had to
pay off a whole bunch of these engineers
whereas did you might be picking that up
a great example of a similar thing is
over here in the UK with soccer clubs a
few of them have had debt problems and
you know a club will be taken over for
the price of a pound like a single pound
coin but then the guy who takes over the
club takes on the cost of like a hundred
million two hundred million pounds worth
debts so didja might will be taking on
some of that extra toxic baggage on
nokia's behalf and you know improving
Nokia's bottom line at the end because
seriously this formula euros if we took
an apple profits it's like a rounding
error
yeah it's not kind of it blood you want
to talk just really I mean it's not
strictly like smartphone related but
this this piece that you wrote about the
the surface and how it sort of might
affect nokia it's just a piece and I
just wanted to at least tell people to
go read it but maybe you want to say
something well yes briefly uh to try and
get people not to chop my head off for
it like I'm not trying to attack anybody
with this it was it was more a
rumination on the situation rather than
anything else in all so I readily admit
this kind of late analysis to Microsoft
Surface enhancement like Microsoft on
ourselves back in June I'm writing this
this week but it just kind of doin to me
he was surprising and but part of the
reason why I came back to nokia is
because somebody emailed me asking do
you have any news about like a tablet
and then I was like wait hang on a
second we haven't heard anything about
this um and the thing for me with
surface is first of all Microsoft in
terms of publicity it was massive
success just getting people hyped up
interested in the product etc it was
Britt was a brilliant success and now it
is it when you say windows 8 and you say
what is the characteristic device for
this platform its surface and Microsoft
is not shying away from that because it
recently had held a party to celebrate
windows 8 going gold be released to
manufacturing and at that party it made
a massive massive cake and it has
surface tablets with the keyboards
attached at the top of the cake I mean
actually the table was a cake that would
have really big discussion about this
crazy Microsoft cake table was a cake
and then the surface on top there was
like three or four parts which were all
cake it's matt is nuts salata cam is
what it is right but the thing is how
does that impact nokia and some of the
comments oh my piece were like well
you're overrating the importance of this
nokia tablet to luckys future because
nokia has never been in tablet snuck
it's about folks I don't think I am like
we would all my love respect to our
readers I think the
ablett part of Nokia strategy is gonna
be as huge as smartphone part of a
stretch go forward what do you guys
think am I crazy I think no no God speak
tell you you didn't you go I was just
going to say yes I think that Nokia in
another world where Microsoft didn't
create the surface definitely should
have jumped into Windows RT tablet and
could have had a pretty decent level of
success with it since we don't live in
that world then I if I were nokia i
would scuttle plans for tablets as
quickly as possible i would yeah i put
them in the same building as all those
cute developers were you know just like
oh yeah sure you know you guys work on
some other future stuff we'll get to it
later because I just I don't see how
even if they make something amazing like
you said like it's what's the point the
people don't act be able to compete with
Microsoft on on that space I kind of
agree with you but but I also feel like
their expense in developing a Windows RT
tablet has the potential to be pretty
minimal because it's it it really is
essentially a scaled-up phone the the
software is written for them they have
their their design language which is
still very attractive largely because
you know it the their phone their phones
that use this design language pretty low
volume at this point so it's still a
kind of a novel thing that won't be true
forever once they have a lot of success
that's no longer going to be a very
interesting ID but at this point it is
so if they made a scaled-up Lumia 900
that was a Windows RT tablet I I think
that that they would be able to do
something with that they could sit for
one thing this is a very important point
Microsoft correct me if I'm wrong maybe
I'm completely crazy on this but I don't
think Microsoft has said anything about
availability of lte windows I receive me
surfaces is that right that's true
that's totally right they want to be in
Wi-Fi huh right so so what so maybe
Nokia's angle can be okay we
are going to work directly with the
carrier is we're going to do bundles by
this Lumia nine ten or whatever they
call their Apollo device and and get
this uh this great LTE Windows RT tablet
that looks exactly like your your Lumia
if or some discount I don't know no
seriously I mean I find these suggestion
crazy that knock it would just cuddle
plans for tablet I do feel like the
company is already really heavily
invested in developing this tablet like
I don't think Nokia would do a tablet
without like blowing it out and just
doing something really impressive and in
that respect to do you feel like doc is
very much kind of like Apple and so
where those guys don't enter a new
product category without having
something to blow people away you know
and just recapture the hype and this is
the thing Nokia's first tablet is a
momentous product completely separate of
its specs and it looks as operating
system and whatever it's like iconic
brand iconic company entering a new
market segment let's see what happens
let's see what they do you know they
have such a great history of design but
then like Microsoft completely just took
the wind out of that sale because
Microsoft did the really nicely designed
Windows RT tablet it did the really nice
little innovation which the touch cover
and the type cover and all these other
tweaks and the integrated the you know
kickstand which is like put the design
so it's like wait my hands like what is
left for nokia to do to blow people away
how do you do windows RT tablet that is
so secure to surface that it makes
people not think about it I don't know I
think you can do that right now well I
think their only option they're only
smart option if they're going to
continue with the tablet strategy is to
search for a demographic search for
kinds of customers that aren't
completely or appropriately served with
the surface running RT or or pro and I
don't know I'm not you know I'm not
enough of an expert to know if those
demographics exist but if they do that
what you know
I I find hard to believe that that those
two products are the be-all end-all
solution to the quote unquote Windows
tablet there have to be other ways that
that market can be addressed well I will
say this the the surface we don't know
what the distribution is going to be on
it so nokia is going to can get in every
carrier store and no k can get in every
best buy and everywhere else we don't
know if microsoft is going to be doing
more than just a microsoft store and
online you know these are might not be
everywhere they're certainly not gonna
be inside carrier stores and so I could
see an argument for an Okie tablet from
that perspective but from the
perspective of like the ecosystem needs
nokia to swoop in and save Windows RT
talents we're making something that is
incredibly compelling hardware I just
don't see a huge need for it oh those of
you will have the ATT LT that you crave
data that cannot live without so there's
your in the feature yeah Chris do you
speaking of how do i put the speaking of
controversial arguments you want to talk
about the reserve tank because i think
you pretty much lost your mind I think
that Ivy this is this is a solution like
this is this is just insane I've gotten
that exact reaction countless times over
the past few days I was actually really
surprised that I don't think a single
person said oh that's a pretty cool idea
everyone's just like it's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard you've lost so
much give us give us the the a 10 second
issue of what you're suggesting so
here's the basic idea uh in in the
motorcycle world it is very common for
there to be this this thing on the
somewhere on the engine that is
essentially a velvet switches between
two gas tank intakes there's a normal
and a reserve and they're they're both
again they're both going into the same
tank but the reserve can access a little
bit of extra fuel at the bottom of the
tank and the idea is that you have that
emergency stash of gas that can't be
accessed normally so when that when the
when the tank goes quote unquote
dry and the engine putters to a stop you
have just enough gas to get to a gas
station or get your destination by
switching over to the reserve and then
you you go on and this has been a thing
in motorcycles for all of time it's just
it's been there for four decades and so
I thought why couldn't you would adapt
that to phones because i keep there are
countless occasions where i don't
properly manage the battery life that I
have available to me on my device it's
not that I couldn't it's that I don't
either I over browse I'm checking my
email too often I'm sending too many
picture messages something stupid is
happening and by four or five p.m. the
phone is dead how many ex your messages
you're you're like you're just yeah
messing it up you're all like I have
sweet man I totally love sprint
picturemail I am gonna just live stream
with my life like with little 320 x 320
images that I'm gonna send a my friends
look look man mms is the future ok mark
my words ah ok go ahead sorry the basic
idea is this i want a force shut off of
the device before the battery is
actually dead so that when that shut off
occurs i can do something to the phone
that gives me access to that last
remaining you know 25 30 35 40 minutes
of battery life just enough to make one
last call or navigate to my destination
or you know get to a charger and my
initial thinking and this is what I
posited in the piece was that the way to
do that would be a physical switch
underneath the battery cover that you
actually probably battery cover off to
get to so there was really like you know
it was a a you know a come-to-jesus
moment when your battery ran out like
you had to do something to the phone to
actually switch the battery over to
reserve but but with the comments that I
got on the piece it got me to thinking
about how you could actually do this in
software and I think the solution would
be this and that there might even be a
way to do this with like locale or one
of those other situationally aware apps
right now I don't haven't looked into it
but one option would be for you know
when you get down to say 10 or five
percent
real life the phone just shuts off and
then you know you pull the phone out of
your pocket so that way it's kind of a
self-preservation thing right that the
phone shuts itself off early so that you
have enough battery life when you when
you switch the phone back on so you turn
the phone back on at this point you get
a dire warning message on the phone that
says hey doofus here your battery is
just about dead you need to do something
about it but you still have a few
minutes do those last few things they
need to do so maybe you could handle it
that way I still like the physical
switch but I think I'm literally the
only human on the planet that thinks
that's a good idea well I'm Smart
Actions does this on a recent Motorola
devices there's a like a low battery
mode i'm pretty sure that the galaxy s3
has a low battery thing where like it
alerts you hey you're down to ten
percent we are turning off unnecessary
services like oh yeah there's a battery
saver mode yeah yeah like how is that
not a better solution because you're
barely favors I'll tell you exactly why
because the battery saver mode I've used
the battery saver mode on the gs3 first
of all I'm not convinced that it does
anything I think it might just be
psychosomatic it seems to drain at the
exact same rate but but that more
importantly regardless even if it is
saving uh saving power drain it's still
draining power I want to I want it to
stop draining power period when I get
down to a certain threshold so that by
the time I recognized by the time I pull
the phone on my pocket and see what's
happening I had that guaranteed last
remaining five or seven or ten percent
of the battery look this is very very
simple the problem here is that Chris's
apply and his petrol head mind to mobile
problems and the solutions that are
coming out just way too mechanical that
that's just the basic simplicity of
adding Chris let's face it you're also
watch enthusiasts and your favorite
watches a really intricate ones a fellow
watch enthusiasts get really giddy and
excited about things that are actually
called complications like a good thing
in a watch is a complication so yeah
it's coming from that sort of world
Christmas yeah a reserve that makes but
of course look look guys hey once you
try a phone with the reserve switch and
I can be able to go back well Chris I'm
not even joking your reserve tank in a
phone is exactly like these really
luxurious really highly designed watches
that have I mean a spectacular
sophisticated and and you know
brilliantly designs movements that
represent time in the most obscure way
like you need to look at it like it's
Japanese and interpret that thing and
like one thing is twisting around and
another thing is rolling around and the
other one is sneaking through and you
got the minutes in the seconds and so
kind of weird and freaky and whatever
and it always takes you like seven
seconds to figure out the time uh that
is your reserve tank which you know what
I think there's room for that like so
what you're doing he is there is going
to end of that over to here to tell me
that this gonna go to because that's
designed to be like a watch I mean ideal
no I insert and it will be amazing if
you're selling virtual phones wouldn't
that be kind of a nutty thing to be
selling to people like okay we've got a
battery you can replace it you can swap
it but if everything is desperation
stage and you really just need to use
the phone for emergencies we've got a
special battery this is an extra one so
you're gonna have to battery out and the
phone will still work because the vertu
and it's you know etc etc that's got
marketing potential right there it does
it does yeah and if they actually do it
um we're going to see because we just
came up with my the entire pinch for
we're suing everybody all the time and I
see where you're going with this this is
definitely a Segway isn't it Otis the
same way is to discussing the you ate
the same way Alice steps we do not have
time oh we're not going to get into it
but the the apple vs samsung trial we do
have insanely complete coverage brian
bishop is there on the ground every day
Matt and Neil I are
doing analysis with him there's a huge
stream of everything that's happening at
the trial and if you're not subscribed
to the official verge cast feed they are
doing a weekly breakout podcast
specifically for this trial Neela and
Matt and Brian to talk about all the
insanity that is happening there and so
if you're at all interested in any of
this hit the stream and listen to that
podcast and I mean there's just so much
stuff that's happened I don't even know
if there's like one thing I could pull
out for us to talk about that you just
say read the bush there it is go there's
beef it um will be there you do that and
it things would happen yeah and that I
think is going to wrap up our mobile
show for the week if if you want to
follow us we're at merge on twitter i'm
at backlog curses NZ power vladas at
blatts a bob we've got an email address
it's the whole show at the verge calm
and next week we'll be here so you
should be too thanks for listening okay
thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
