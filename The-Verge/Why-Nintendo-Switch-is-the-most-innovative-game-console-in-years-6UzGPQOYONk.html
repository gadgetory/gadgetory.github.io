long time videogame fan with the most
coveted gadget of the holiday season is
and the Nintendo Swift will be high on
that list probably at the top it's been
almost a year since the hybrid handheld
launched and it's still pretty hard to
get your hands on one and for good
reason the switch is the most innovative
console in nearly a decade
basically since the original week
besides being immensely popular the
switch also saves Nintendo it's easy to
forget how dire the company's console
business was in the wake of the Wii U's
failure
Nintendo found success with the 3d S&amp;amp;M
sequel but the hand held is not enough
to keep the company's biggest franchises
afloat and sales of the Wii U painted a
bleak picture of the company's future in
the living room
critics were telling Nintendo to exit
the console hardware market move
everything to mobile and call it a day
so when the switch was first unveiled
fans were skeptical some fun Nintendo
had made another gimmicky device with
funky detachable controller as an
unorthodox docking system and a mobile
processor that can never match
Playstation or Xbox despite these
initial concerns the switch proved to be
a massive hit this month after only nine
months on the market Nintendo said have
sold 10 million units and many times
that in software sales it stole the show
this year as the fastest selling home
console in Nintendo's history setting
the course for the company's resurgence
back to the forefront of the gaming
market so how did Nintendo pull this off
it's important to think of the switch is
the evolution of the company's previous
hardware it's always made wacky devices
using nascent technologies like 3d and
motion control while an eye for
innovation hasn't always paid off anyone
remember the Virtual Boy the company has
a history of success in handheld
starting with the Game Boy and more
recently with the Nintendo DS and the
3ds for the switch Nintendo put
portability above all else and the
company struck gold
you can play it on an airplane or in bed
or even on the subway the device truly
is a hybrid solution that transforms to
enjoy games in a number of different
ways whether Doc's handheld or kickstand
out using the detachable joi con
there's versatility to choose how you
want to play and where it takes the
concept of console gaming and turns it
into an on-the-go social experience that
gets you off your couch yes you can play
at home alone but there are plenty of
options for multiplayer using both
split-screen play or local co-op this
has always been a part of Nintendo's DNA
who doesn't love to play a friend in
Super Smash Brothers or Mario Kart and
that's where the switches success story
becomes so heavily tied to its games
Nintendo made sure the first year of the
switch included The Legend of Zelda
breath of the wild and Super Mario
Odyssey two incredible entries in two of
its most prolific franchises it's
unheard of for a console to launch with
a game of the Year contender and it's
even less likely for a console to get
two of them in a first year but Nintendo
was smart and I had a new Mario and a
new Zelda game in the works for the Wii
U it move development to its new console
and it shuffled its release schedule to
make them must own switch titles out of
the gate those two games have gone on to
sell millions and win multiple awards
they also reestablished Nintendo as the
influential and innovative developer
we've always known them to be you can
easily argue that the switch would have
never taken off without Nintendo's
pre-built cachet the companies behind
some of the longest-running most beloved
series since the beginning of gaming
characters like Kirby Yoshi Donkey Kong
they've become cultural icons like a way
beyond the core gaming demographic but
when Nintendo's Hardware fails
fans have nowhere to play its games and
the company's reputation suffers if
people aren't buying its software its
entire business model depends on its
cultural significance so fans were
desperately looking for a reason to
share Nintendo on hoping it wouldn't
just fade away and peddle nostalgia they
found that in the switch the switch is a
Frankenstein of all the best ideas
Nintendo's ever had the 3ds showed
Nintendo how a well made handheld gaming
machine with great games could thrive in
a mobile dominated landscape much like
the switch the Wii shied away from
top-tier graphics and realism in favor
of motion control
local multiplayer in antennas
well-tested game design the Wii U was
definitely flawed but it was an
important stepping stone because it
first introduced the idea of merging
mobile with the home console where the
Wii U was a tablet powered by a console
that sat plugged into your TV the switch
was the inverse a console powered by a
tablet so while the Wii U's tablet
screen was clunky and poorly designed
and the device was a huge flop it did
pave the way for Nintendo to incorporate
these ideas well inside the benefits of
the Wii and the 3ds all into the switch
the switch is a proper portable console
in all the ways the Wii U failed to be
it's still too early to judge the
overall impact of the switch consumers
have been more than happy to excuse it's
bigger flaws because the first few games
have been so amazing but there's the
online service that won't launch until
next year there's the perpetual supply
problems that make just getting the
thing and I'm noxious struggle Nintendo
fans will be less forgiving next year
when Zelda and Mario are old news and it
has to rely on other developers to help
its platform succeed but that's where
the secret to the switches long-term
success might be since launch we've seen
a bunch of interest from indie game
makers and even big-name developers some
really great games like stardew valley
axiom verge the Elder Scrolls Skyrim
even the new doom reboot have all made
their way to the switch there's only
gonna be more to come as it stands right
now antenna was the only player in the
portable gaming market and consumers
have shown that they're really willing
to buy into its vision Sony already
tried with its PSP and Vita handheld and
the company says it has no plans to make
another one anytime soon Microsoft has
also toyed with the idea of portable
gaming with handheld Xbox prototypes in
the past but it's never taken the plunge
Apple and other makers of set-top box is
running Android they've all tried to
bridge the smart phone game market with
a TV ecosystem but mobile games on big
screens have never really taken off but
without a constant stream of hot new
games to play amazing hardware becomes
pretty much useless so it's up to the
developers to cement the switches future
sure Nintendo is planning a bunch of new
games in its own franchises like a new
kirby and new Pokemon a much anticipated
reboot of Metroid Prime
but those taking years to make in the
meantime the company needs to quench
first of players by working with dad's
to bring premium titles that are fun
innovative but also complex enough to
keep the switch in the hands of
consumers at least until the next Elda
game comes out luckily with all the
consumer success of the switch Nintendo
should have plenty of cash to do just
that
