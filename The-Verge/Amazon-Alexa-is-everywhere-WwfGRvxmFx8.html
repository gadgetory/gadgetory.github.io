my company is not even an official
exhibitor they're here through Alexa
their popular voice controlled personal
assistant that first had its home in the
Amazon echo speaker seriously though
Alexa is everywhere this year but just
because it's everywhere doesn't mean it
works well everywhere so Alexa is
showing up in everything from copycat
speakers to smart lights to connected
fridges some of these are direct
integrations which means that Alexa's
voice capabilities are built directly
into that piece of hardware and some of
them still require some type of echo
speaker in order for them to work put it
this way you can now look at your smart
lights and order a pizza so that's all
fine and well inside of the home but
what's more interesting is Alexa outside
of the home where you don't have a
stable Wi-Fi connection where there's a
lot of ambient noise these $400 on vocal
headphones are supposedly the first
headphones with Alexa built directly
into them Phil directly in probably
sounds like it's just like walking
around the neck Oh strap your head but
it's not exactly like that you still
need a cell connection and it's not like
you can just walk around shouting Alexa
into your headphones you actually need
to press a physical button to get Alexa
started
Alexa is showing up in other wearables
as well like this Martian SmartWatch but
again you have to press a physical
button not once but twice in order to
get your question through to Alexa and
even then you're probably not going to
hear it very well for this tiny speaker
that's built into the side of the watch
you're going to have to open the M voice
app which is Marcia's app in order to
see the response there are other things
to consider too like the fact that
alexis still isn't officially available
outside of the US and she's still not
great at accents
Alexa what is the nutritional value of
avocados sorry
I didn't understand the question but
there's no doubt that the person who
stole the show this year is not even a
person it's an artificially intelligent
virtual assistant who we gave a
household name faster than you could say
hey Siri or okay Google even Amazon
seemed surprised by this the company
told me they were expecting around 35 to
40 Amazon integrations with products
here at the show and it turns out there
are a lot more than that hey Alexa can I
go home now you can now look at your
smart lights and order a pizza or
something yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
