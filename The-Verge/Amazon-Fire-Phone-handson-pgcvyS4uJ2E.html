Amazon's hometown where CEO Jeff Bezos
just unveiled the fire fund so the
biggest whiz-bang feature on the fire
phone is dynamic perspective which isn't
as gimmicky as 3d but it does enable
some neat features you can sort of peek
around the corners of things it allows
you to tilt scrolling in the browser and
an e books so that's what you see on the
720p screen and it's run by having four
cameras in each corner that actually
tracks your head in space beyond that
it's a relatively standard Android
smartphone it's got a home button it's
got gorilla glass on the front and on
the back where we've also got a 13
megapixel camera rubberized side stereo
speakers and a dedicated button on the
side which can launch the camera or if
you hold it down it launches this
feature called Firefly now Firefly is
pretty cool you can stick anything in
front of it and it'll automatically
detect it and tell you what it is and
then you can slide up and do stuff with
it pan since it's Amazon the thing you
don't want to do with a lot of it is buy
it so you can go right in there you can
buy it you can start radio stations with
it with third-party apps and whatever
else some of the other features here if
we look at this display perspective
stuff you can see when I tilt the phone
it starts popping up information from
the Yelp on the different restaurants
and I can actually just move my head to
have that stuff here too instead of just
tilting the phone that's pretty neat so
the dynamic perspective stuff also comes
into play in games so while you're
looking at a game you can actually peek
around the level to sort of get a sense
of what you're going to need to do when
you start running around the screen a
few the other features on the device if
you give it a quick shake over it'll
jump you into notification settings
where you can also start Mayday which is
Instant Video Chat help from amazon's
customer service and it also is instant
help from a teen tease customer service
which is great because att's customer
service really isn't
there's also neat little panels there's
a universal notification or navigation
thing on this side
these panels here you've got weather and
other other bits of information on this
side and overall the phone it feels a
little bit thick but if the screen looks
great despite the fact that's only 720p
it feels really sturdy despite the fact
that it's glass on the front in the back
the rubberized sides really help you
grip it and overall it's it's a pretty
straightforward kind of Android phone
there are some neat features it's got
really big blocky graphics here but it's
it's you know if you love Amazon you
might like this phone otherwise you
might be looking for something a little
bit more powerful it's available
exclusively on AT&amp;amp;T it's $1.99 on
contract or you can also get it next for
I think 27 bucks a month and for right
now Amazon is also giving you a free
year of prime which is worth a hundred
bucks that's not a terrible deal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
