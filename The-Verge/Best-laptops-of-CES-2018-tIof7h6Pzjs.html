Show we see more and more laptops we've
seen crazy light and thin ones giant
gaming ones and ones that flip and spin
around so this year the laptops haven't
been as insane but there's a few that
give us a little glimpse about what to
expect for the rest of the year so let's
start with HP spectre x360 and Dells XPS
15 now these are both 15-inch laptops so
what really matters is exactly what's
inside which is Intel's for actual
processor and in AMD's graphics this is
the first time we've seen such a thing
and what it basically means is we're
probably gonna see gaming laptops or
laptops that capable of playing games
anyway at the sort of size and form
factor of these two devices Dells XPS 15
21 is new this year and we've promised
you seen the XPS 15 before but this one
has the obviously the hinge so you can
go put it into tablet mode and as you
can see this is a quite a regular
looking laptop but the graphics support
on it so playing games or stuff like
that should be a little bit better it's
not gonna be amazing just yet but I
think that's gonna set the stage for us
having gaming laptops inside the black
suits that look kind of normal now this
is the first time that AMD and Intel
have paired up since like the 1980s so
it's also kind of interesting to see
what would could happen for the rest of
the year there
Dells XPS 15 also includes a maglev
keyboard now that sounds pretty fancy
and it kind of is so what's inside is
essentially magnets it underneath the
keys and they hold the keys in place now
that means that it's actually got a
little bit less travel and but it feels
and sounds a lot quicker so it's quite
interesting to see that on this
particular laptop and on Windows laptops
in general and the keyboard is slightly
thinner so something more like the Apple
MacBook Pro and but it's kind of
interesting you're seeing Dell doing
this and that might mean we see some of
the other PC makers do a similar sort of
thing with their keyboards speaking of
experimentation we're starting to see
quite a lot less of that this year
there's not so many crazy flippin
laptops people are sort of settling on
their own designs but what we are
starting to see and we saw it in
December is these new arm powered
laptops
now basically what that means is you're
starting to see laptops they're gonna
have all-day battery life that's 20 plus
hours like innovators be put on standby
can throw them in your bag pick them up
and they're not gonna be out of battery
and inside you're gonna get the similar
sort of components you would any other
laptop and the form factors that we've
seen so far are mainly tablets and
two-in-ones
and but I think we're probably gonna see
a lot more experimentation later in the
year we might even get some just regular
clamshell laptops so this is lenovo's
mixed 630 as you can see it looks like a
laptop stroke tablet it's kind of like a
surface a two-in-one sort of thing we've
seen quite a few times before what's
really unique about this particular
device is inside there's a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 805 processor now what that
means is it's basically phone components
and sighs you're gonna get LTE
connectivity inside there so you'll be
able to use it on the train anywhere
outside the house and and it's basically
it snaps off so you can use it as a
tablet as well you're gonna get all the
obviously the LTE connectivity it's
gonna be a run about 20 hours battery
life is what they're saying so that's
kind of like the key thing about this
it's quite a nice little device it's fin
and light and so you've got the single
USB type-c port on the back and so kind
of like the future of tablets and
laptops is what we're seeing and if it
sets the stage for this and other
devices like the HP one as well same
sort of family devices sort of sets the
stage for what we might see in 2018
which is a lot
or arm powered Windows laptops so
another training I've started to sees HD
our laptops now HD IO is high dynamic
range basically what that means is
you're gonna get a little bit better
detail when you're watching like a TV in
a movie colors will pop the blacks will
be blacker so it's really good for like
viewing content and stuff like Netflix
and stuff like that what we're kind of
waiting to see now is for Windows to be
updated Netflix and all those sort of
different applications so it's still
really early days but I think once that
comes we're probably gonna see a lot
more HD our laptops for out 2018 and
beyond we didn't see many Chromebooks
this year but razer is experimenting
with its own Android powered phone and
docking it and turning from a phone into
a laptop now we've seen us a bunch of
times
Motorola's Atrix Samsung's Dex doc even
Microsoft's phone continuum stuff on
Windows Phone and a lot of those
projects have failed in the past but
Razer stuff is very much a prototype at
the moment - I don't think we're gonna
see a phone that turns into a laptop be
a success this year but it's good to see
another company giving it a go and try
in another concept to see if we can get
to that point so aside from all those
laptops we also saw some regular plain
old laptops this year - so Dell refresh
the XPS 13 - a new white color we've
kind of rose gold finish on it as well
and it's one of the better Windows
laptops and they've changed the design
slightly but they still have the webcam
placement down the bottom so it's still
staring up your nose I saw also you
introduced a new switch 7 and it's taken
the title as the world's finished laptop
now we've seen Acer experiment with
being thin and light before and this
particular device the keyboard doesn't
feel quite as good but it's good to see
a so push everyone else to do fine and
like laptops there's still something
that obviously a Tsar cares about and I
think that's something that we like to
see now aside from the hardware on the
software side I think we're gonna see a
lot of Amazon Alexa appearing on Windows
PCs throughout the year Amazon announced
at CES the Alexa we built into a bunch
of different laptops from HP Lenovo a
seuss and Acer
now those devices are coming later this
year but I'm curious to see whether
we'll ever see Google assistant appear
on Windows laptops it's obviously on
Google's own pixel book
but it'd be interesting if it made the
jump over to the windows side as well so
all those trends combined with
Microsoft's work on Windows 10 and the
updates and also their ability to push
the arm that tops out makes for a really
interesting 2018 for laptops now
something we haven't probably seen for
quite a while Jovie teasers Tavor as
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
