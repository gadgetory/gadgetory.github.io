the week of april fifteenth 2013 I'm
Josh Topolsky I'm nilay patel i'm ross
miller span we are back when I quickly
just address the Paul situation cuz I
got a lot of tweets please do Paul Paul
is not on the I'm like your background
here mine I don't like this I all I can
see is a good wall and a door or you
look silly no big deal no I am
cel-shaded actually there's still doing
a lot of expert yeah you've been
superimposed yeah it's weird because I
look like I've been superimposed as well
yeah what's a new vibe there's a
conspiracies here that displays green
screen the lighting is um I'm not sure
I'm not crazy about this either what's
that white thing over this thing over
here what is that I don't know anyhow um
Oh Paul Paul let's talk about Paul
Paul's my bag on the internet all he's
on a easily enter the spirit journey no
he'll be back in 12 days then it will be
triumphant but don't rest assured that
he's fine you know he's just very busy
Paul's fine doing the last year's
prepping he's prepping his return to the
Internet yeah I got some hair stuff
coming on here there we go um he's
prepping his return to the internet and
and he'll be back at full force believe
me yeah he'll be back he literally I
spoke to him on the phone just before
and he was like here when I'm back you

been setting up a cot over there the
back I mean he's he is not leaving the

casting tormak arouse really return you
know a lot of people would love a
24-hour Paul cast no they freak an
absolute maybe maybe when he comes back
baby bash we'll put it we'll put a drone
on him um anyhow we have a lot of news
to discuss this week obviously not all
of it really very upbeat in fact this
has been like a crushing terrible we've
been a crushing news week yeah uh you
know we started on Monday with the the
Boston Marathon bombing and
uh in last night there's been in there's
been all sorts of you know things that
have happened at the UH related to that
had been terrible uh last night there
was a this explosion in in Texas which
is unrelated which is unrelated and is
not a terrorist as far as we know not a
terrorist attack is actually sadly uh uh
one in a line of many types of accidents
like this is like a fertilizer
fertilizer explosion factory explosions
are apparently not as uncommon as they
should be but that's what happens when
you're working with substances like
ammonium nitrate and all these crazy
chemicals they put into fertilizers
which by the way goes into your food so
that make you feel really really good
about yeah store bought your store
bought apples but um so it's been a big
it's been a big and kind of tough tough
week and I think we should start we want
to start by talking about Boston yeah
and what's been happening since Boston
obviously monday was insane yeah we you
know saw this story breaking on Twitter
and felt very strongly that it was
something that we needed to to cover and
it turns out i mean i think this is one
of those you know we've been covered a
lot of national security lately we've
covered north korea the sort of disputes
between North Korea and the US or the
rest of the world we've covered some
serious stuff and anyway and just in
general we've been talking about it
cities doing surveillance yeah security
yeah a lot of drones stores low
surveillance stories we did this great
report if you didn't see this great
feature about taser and their new their
new cams literally this show last week
was just me Matt Stroud and ben popper
and carl franzen talking about
surveillance yeah i mean like we've been
very focused on it so and so in so
anyhow so we so we obviously covered the
news on on monday which was chaotic and
crazy and then there's been a ton of
follow-up but but you know i think the
most interesting well one of the most
interesting developments that has come
out of this is this at least in the last
couple of days and elise if you work on
the internet and you are a news junkie
this thing with the
the well the New York Post and just kind
of like like Reddit and 4chan have taken
it upon themselves at the request of no
one yeah to to begin sifting through
photographic photographic and video
evidence that from the or not even
evidence just pictures and video from
from the marathon to try to identify
suspects in this case and and you know
that the authorities said said putt to
the public if you have videos if you
have photos please give them to us in
anything any useful information that you
think might be might might help us find
literally the first thing the
authorities actually said yeah at their
press conference on Monday was I said
this is terrible we don't know what's
going on here's a phone number for 24
tip well for you here's a front number
for your family you know if you're
missing somebody right and here's a
phone number for text ya know they were
there it was obvious that look I mean
the the way this thing developed on you
know the way we saw this thing breaking
on Twitter and all of these photos and
video and just like immediately
following it and by the way this kind of
happened with the explosion last night
but just this incredible immediate
outpouring of of info just random info
so so so somehow and I don't know how
the internet got this idea and its head
but but people on reddit decided and
people on 4chan decided of all places
decided they're going to not just hand
over what they might have or or or you
know they're going to start doing and
they're going to do amateur forensics on
these in these photos and it already has
it within I'd say you know 24-48 hours
of that really commencing and it being a
public thing it's already resulted in at
just terrible terrible stuff happening
and we covered something today the New
York Post ran a story front-page story
on your post not really known for I mean
laughing is not it's been above and
beyond for this I got in the onion cast
cure them pretty hard for this I mean it
with the near post already was reporting
bad information they said you know day
of night of they said Saudi national and
all this dozens dead as yet does instead
is not panned out I mean this is like
last night during the the fertilizer
explosion there were these reports 70
people dead and yeah and you know people
tienen was sort of kind of reporting it
you have to say so I've been watching a
lot of CNN
yeah can daddy has been watching a lot
of CNN with sir I'm sorry can you guys
turn down my volume in my earpiece is
extremely loud right now anyway so
adding I've been watching a lot of CNN
right as we like manages coverage and
watching see like I don't want to turn
this into a journalism conversation but
watching how like that operates now
we're like literally the story goes from
one thing and then like it's like
Anderson Cooper and John Kane like look
at their cell phones right and they're
just reading texts from their cell
phones being like a source is now saying
like really likely in the other
disorient between lead changes known
actually in part where they're like
we're gonna go check on this yeah or
we're to go off and do a little bit i
mean i think that that one of the things
you've seen in the last few days is is
you know since news is accelerated and i
do and i don't wanna get into adrenaline
conversation either but since news
accelerated now like I think that CNN
and and and all of these traditional
outlets feel like this incredible heat
from yeah just people beating like
actual people at the scene beating them
to information I beaten and which is
very much with the fertilizer plant
right and right and at video and uh I
think we might have this there is a vine
from Boston yeah there is a remix in the
it's a dvr'd it was literally somebody
played it on the DVR and to combine it
all but it wasn't it wasn't it was a
station running that footage but it was
footage from the scene that vine was
actually recorded off of television
right this time station running but from
what I can achieve it was just such a
weird circular this is it is terrible
yessir me it was the vine itself that
was like what got popular it's because
it freezes here I think on any on this
explosion and I don't know why I mean
but it's so I mean so just that the
incredible people I think they're now
looking they're going to the Internet
yeah right they're going to these other
channels where information is pouring at
you it's not necessary curated or
filtered yeah and i think the actual
news organizations now feel they have to
operate at that yeah i think i think
there's that I think there's this
increased this increase scent of we've
just got to get there first right um and
and it's you know it's something that we
have strived to
having you know kind of come from a
world of blogging where first is you
know this big thing and it's like we
have you know done everything we can
increasingly do everything we can to if
we do have something up if we do have a
breaking piece of news we don't have all
the details we don't flesh out the
details and be loved actually you know
they bitch sometimes that we put up a
headline and it says developing or we
have one line in there it says
developing the reason says develop is
because the news is coming we're getting
the news but we're trying to make sense
of it and you know we want to you know
obviously we want people to know that
that's coming in that it right we are
gonna be on the story but i think i
think the promising it wasn't that they
had the complete story and they were the
wrong they're wrong they're so confident
and yet so so bring it back to this post
thing so today the post runs cover story
um bag men this ridiculous headline i
don't know if we can put it up on the
screen or not but uh and and it has a
picture of these two guys that the
reddit people were just sure that these
were the guys that the somehow they all
they were standing their bags and get
one has a white cap and there's all this
misinformation all this weird stuff
going around and and and it's like in
the echo chamber of of the internet in
this in this with this mob mentality
where you literally have a bunch of
amateur right i mean i don't know who
these people are i don't know what their
agenda is i don't know what their you
know right red redditors are you know
anonymous it's like this is not your job
your job is not to solve crimes okay
well so and and i just want to say hana
and i'm sure you have something to say
here but i don't say like this to me is
that the Authority said give us your
pictures give us your video we want to
try to figure this out we have
professionals who are forensics experts
that are gonna look at the stuff and
figure it out this is like if a doctor
said you feud a friend who is sick then
the doctor is like if they get any
sicker bring him to me we might have to
do surgery right and you're like they
get in you sent them they since they
seem to get be getting sick and you're
like well i was gonna do the surgery
myself yeah but that's basically the cid
that's basically what's going on like
it's like you this is not your job you
don't do professionally you don't have
all the data you don't have all the
details the authorities are going to
share all their information with you and
like I'm all for i love the spirit of
let's get together collectively
do something to help but what that
should be is let's get together and go
donate blood or let's get together and
raise money for families of the victims
of this or let's make sure let's put the
word out that if you have photos or
video it needs to go to the authorities
but the way you help is not you put on
your little detector your little
Sherlock hat and decide that you're
going to be like a like a cool crime
solved I guess because I think it's I
think it's really dangerous it means but
what's happening with these guys being
on the cover of the New York Post which
from what we can tell seems to be
completely thanks to what's been going
on on the internet it's extremely
dangerous and extremely harmful and it
really hurts the process so the thing
I'm you're not gonna get crowds to stop
being curious looking at maybe they will
find something it's when they took that
information that they weren't sure about
and then grab the pitch for one yeah
hold up right hold on I went that well
so there's I think there is a little bit
of a media story here right which is
it's fine for the people on reddit and
the people on 4chan to go and look at
this stuff right it's that's great and I
think there's a lot of help I don't
think it's great I mean it's but you
don't think are allowed to do it you
you're a lot your life is Ryan you're
you're allowed to write a racist
magazine and publish it or right go on
it started racist erasing a racist
reddit side but let me I don't worry you
two to do bad things I'm saying you can
participate and you can like you can get
done with whatever takamine process you
want to have right and then be like
authorities here's our information sure
and then the authorities can do whatever
they want yeah I think all that's fine
what's not fine and I think here's where
the problem set in was there was this a
great hope and I think this hope is
manifested that somehow the internet
would solve this part like they would
fix it like these this collective band
of anonymous strangers would like
somehow beat the authorities and like be
vigilant but that hope comes from comes
from know it comes from that know it
comes from the immature mind of the
redditor who thinks that they can read
it didn't publish the New York Post yeah
no they didn't publish the nearest or
what they but what they did do was
because they're not professionals and
because they're working in a public
forum they doxxed people they took
pictures of actual human beings who live
and work and are real and were like
these guys look like the look like the
bomber that was the point and and that
was when they cross love you but you can
do but you can't be a reddit collective
looking at photos of human beings trying
to decide who's the bomber without
totally violating and stepping all over
those those peoples like rights to
privacy in two and two not being I mean
it'sit's libel you know I mean it's
basically defamatory that that you would
look at a person's picture and put it
online and say this person is looks like
most likely like they're the bomber you
know and it is shame on the New York
Post for them to take any of that and to
publish it right shame on them for
forever doing something for publishing a
photo where it's alleged to be somebody
without any evidence on the front page
note on the front page well on any page
no evidence from the authorities no
confirmation from somebody right um but
but I think the danger the dangerous
place is and I agree with you that but
there are amateur there are people who
are who are amateur investigators who
spend time and effort trying to figure
things out and they do sometimes see
something the police missed right yet
something that that that nobody else was
paying attention to but this is a case
where it is a it is 24 hours 48 hours
after this thing happened there is a
massive amount of imagery and video from
the marathon no one no one asked for
these guys to to disseminate this stuff
online and start picking it apart and
and and the result has been a
disorganized destructive mess and and
like I and I and here's the thing if you
want to take all the photos you can find
and and fig try to figure out who the
bomber is and take that to the
authorities no that's right that's great
but if you want to do it in public
you're going to take those pictures and
put them on a public forum where we'll
be where where we'll have the gasoline
report on it by the media because it's a
public place yeah um that's stupid right
stupid and it's full in it and it is
dangerous but I'm there's a reason we
don't run the story yesterday right as
we talked about it a lot right well the
story one is this
we ran today which is where you see
where you see that the result of
something like this and you know you see
redditors going in by the way I think
there are a lot of I think the red it
produces a lot of amazing stuff I'm not
this is not all people on reddit this is
small group you but you see the writers
in these forums going guys stop posting
that picture you know don't share this
with media this is wrong we got the
wrong people and it's like you know
that's what that's what a witch-hunt
looks like right it's like you you get
somebody strung up only to discover that
they're not the guy actually away
they're not a witch or they're not
they're not the killer I mean this is
like mob rule you know and mob mentality
and mob rule has no place in an
investigation of an extremely serious
extremely real right crime then so was
injured and killed people what's really
interesting about this and alexis
madrigal wrote this today and it's a
counterpoint some of the other stuff
that's happening right now which is I
think there's a very strong sort of
libertarian streak that perp was
pervasive and read it in these
communities yeah and it's like we'll
just do it we don't need the government
to help us we'd right anybody to
regulate this space but Alexis's point
was this fiction only works as long as
you pretend that what you do online
isn't the same as your behavior offline
right so if you actually did this if you
had a warehouse full of people like
circling print photographs and being
like is this the bomber like we wouldn't
cover that as some active like heroic
vigilantism right we'd be like these
people are crazy it's a lynch mob it's a
lynch mob in like this is what happened
it's like if you walked into somebody's
apartment and they have like 4,000
frames of the Zapruder film with JFK
assassination hung up no you like you're
crazy I'm just ask me ok it's ok that
theirs is ok that there's this personal
investigation going on if you have
access to it that's great the problem is
this is not a data collation issue there
is more is partially that it is
partially that the data is on a wrong
like programmatic yeah this is not
resolve it is not a programmatic issue
in order to in order to understand and I
don't by the way pretend that I have the
knowledge to even fully explain this but
what I will say is in order to do the
kind of work that the authorities are
doing right now you not only need to
have these amateur pieces of photography
and these amateur videos but you need
access to 60 ctv univ access the
security cameras give access to aerial
cameras you have access to witnesses you
need have access to victims and and and
data like you know uh phone logs and i
mean the the depth of the data that you
need right to properly detox you need to
be the cops you need to be the FBI and
the police who are actually doing this
work and who are really good our train
right solve a lot of these things pretty
quickly and i have no doubt that in the
coming days they are going to figure it
out and we know that these guys by the
way like your first pass amateur
investigators is resulted in a totally
destructive moment for this case which
is we took our attention off of you know
the real story which is the people who
were victimized and and you know the the
the horror of this bombing and made it a
story about like read it forms a lynch
mob right and and it also injured these
guys who are on the cover of a paper now
who have come forward and they're like
freaking out there like this is word
right there there i think one of those a
high school student yeah 10 wants to him
once her at their coach like this
harkens back like the Richard Jewell
thing about like the Centennial Olympic
Park bombing right he was a hero and
then he was villainized he goes to some
and he is funny about that is that I was
like 15 when that happened I remember
him and I don't remember who actually
did it right right she's like terrible
right like and and you know I think that
in the age of the internet and this is
the real thing I mean that was that was
trial by by the media right right now
the Richard Jewell think we've seen it
because that T like when seeing in like
the FBI had to do a press release
yesterday saying we have not arrested
that there was another amazing CNN
reported around like a rat in our cities
i watch saudi national watching CNN
again right i mean i just would I don't
generally watch a lot of like TV news
during the day but like so we just had
it was on mute every time we looked at
it had the huge breaking news banner you
know and we like oh and like turn
on the sound and it would just be like
Anderson Cooper reading this right again
but finally they're like okay arrests
have been made you know we're hearing
somebody's in custody everyone's massed
outside of the courthouse in Boston like
thousands of media people are there so
many so that eventually there was a bomb
threat and the courthouse was evacuated
and the FBI put out a press release
like you guys don't know what you're
talking about like right don't report
things until we like the FBI's presley's
was basically shut up CNN yeah right and
that was it and I think they didn't even
have their schedule press conference for
the day they were like which would have
been tremendously useful I think if like
the police and the FBI had a press
conference at yeah they were supposed to
have it at five the courthouse got
evacuated got moved to eight and I think
then it just got just put to bed it's
it's just dumb it's just like everybody
needs to chill out I mean basically
everybody needs to chill out for a
minute and let let the police and the
FBI do their job here but I think also
like them as having covered this you
know and being in the midst of covering
it you have to figure out you know for
us it's also like you know where it's
we're exploring certain areas of
coverage we're talking about things that
we may do or may not do that are you
know you have to kind of test your
comfort zone with it but you really have
to ask yourself is there any value here
are we you know is there context are you
telling a story or are you you know and
is it value is that story valuable or
are you just adding to like this wave of
noise you know right and I think that
everybody's is so desperate to have
something to say that you see this by
the way with all sorts of news stories
not just a terrible tragedy like a
bombing you know can be anything you see
this wave of people who and then you've
got like the second wave you get the way
the people who are covering then you get
the wave of the critics and then there's
like a third wave of the not
professional media critics but like
professional troll bloggers who are you
know the mg Siegler zuv the world uh you
know who have their
out there who have their like you know
attention-grabbing moment and so it's
like it's like it's like this pile on
you know and it's it's I actually spoke
to I spoke to a critic of some of the
coverage that we did and you know I was
like it's funny it's weird in a moment
of this intense a tragedy and confusion
that there are people whose who take the
time not to try to contribute but to
complain about things which seems like
such an odd place for your energy to go
during during something like this so
anyhow um the the the reddit stuff you
know we've covered I you know I don't
think they're going to stop I think
they're gonna keep going with these with
these um of course are you going I mean
I think I'm gonna keep going and I think
that you know what's been I hope yours I
Oh said you know here's the inevitably
damaging and destructive thing that will
happen here the cops will figure it out
right we hope and then read it will just
keep going and somehow that will turn
into a massive conspiracy theory right
about how this was a false flag attack
right for there was a cop in the area
right before or you could see something
any like me watching what's invisible is
buried on the roof what's incredible is
what's incredible is day one of this i
mean our one or whatever it was a
conspiracy there was some guy from
infowars asking the governor right uh of
massachusetts false face a false this is
a false flag attack which is like listen
I'm psyched that you have a conspiracy
theory but um you know you are in the
extreme intense minority if you think
like the American government is dropping
pipe bombs during the Boston Marathon
and there are real questions to be asked
yeah and one of them is not like did the
American government plan the Boston
Marathon bombing to the governor because
if even if they did by the way I didn't
catch him in for info wars i want to
tell you even if even if they was a
false flag attack
that was part of a vast global
conspiracy of which the US government is
is a part yeah the governor would not
tell you yes to that question because
he's he's in on it obviously love is I
mean obviously he's ain't even glimmer
of recognition as I he would also see
the glimmer of the reptilian of the
reptile that lives beneath the
shape-shifted flash of ravanar which is
I think something to the infowars people
my age so then here's and let's just not
segue to another ya denia we're gonna
keep trying out that the story is
actually is is developing in all sorts
of directions yeah there's a bunch of
national security questions a bunch of
policy questions and so the policy
questions are the ones that are coming
up right away because there is a vote on
sis pon the house yesterday yea which
was defeated last year in the Senate
then it was back for debate yesterday
and so siswa is the the cybersecurity
intelligent and by the way Mike am I
crazy I don't jump a gun to jump jump
ahead here jump the gun but jump a gun
there there there is there was an
enormous amount of strangely worded like
terrorism wording ya mera like scary
terrorism wording in the in this comedy
Jay compare that uh yeah yeah so Candice
Miller Hogan from Michigan Horace's but
passed 288 to 127 yesterday in the house
in the house going back to the Senate I
think Obama still threatened to veto it
there's a lot of time I the way no love
there could be no love loss at this
point after the gun control stuff gay
I'm sure Obama's like so Sonny's we know
anything that's like Republicans ruin
credibly scathing yeah he was not happy
no I mean and why should he be happy
well we should talk about that a little
bit so Candice Miller who is a
Republican represented from Michigan
said North Korean hackers will take down
the u.s. power grid Joe hack who's our
problem for Nevada said our nation is
under attack Mike McCaul Republican
taxes hey this is an outrage but let me
just read this quote then you just let
me just raise the temperature on you one
more one more degree okay Mike McCaul
Republican from Texas in the case of
Boston they were real bombs in this case
their digital bombs and these digital
bombs are on their way this this guy
lately just one more guy should be sent
to jail one more representative would
all from Georgia yeah
you're on your own stuff yes quote the
Fourth Amendment Trump's all he said
like basically whatever protection of
privacy you think you have it doesn't
matter the fourth with them and is going
to be specification for this measure is
great and ACL u--'s you're feeling
constitutions cause a lot of problems
yeah according if she was Michelle
Richardson this bill is Rolla saying
he's pretty much the exact same with the
introduced before you haven't made a lot
of changes clarification sure but it's
pretty much the same thing that we all
fought against with so much figure that
will probably never see again well this
is exactly how you end up in a war with
Iraq after a terrorist attack no I mean
it is i mean this is this is what
happens is is you take an issue that uh
it's been a thorn in your side that's me
relatively unrelated cyber terrorism is
a form of terrorism don't get me wrong
it's just really different than dropping
an actual physical bomb you know right
in a crowded in a crowded race I mean I
don't want to dive into sista you know
that because we've talked about it a lot
for over a year but I imagine we'll get
you just to remind people what goes on
here is right now companies like
Facebook and Google and Apple whoever
they collect a bunch of your information
right and they can't share it among
themselves they can't share with the
government Cisco creates a framework
that basically says those companies can
now share that information with the
government without liability right and
the government can like run around doing
whatever they want yeah and the
justification essentially is don't worry
who we won't do anything bad but we need
to start coordinating among all these
companies that are all being attacked
every day and they need like the
companies themselves need to be able to
like do best practices or security and
the government needs to know like what
the threat vectors are for all these
companies and systems so that we can
develop a coordinated national so that
then when I point out when I say it that
way it sounds great sounds very reason
when you dive in the bill language and I
like there will be no liability for
sharing personal information with the
government you're like huh that sounds
terrible yeah and there's no and it's
funny because this bill was defeated
last year Obama has consistently
threatened to veto in this form and the
Republicans are basically like hey there
is a bombing let's try
and right it just seems it's just so
detached mentality alien by the way if
he vetoes it right now if he vetoes it
I'm have no doubt the Republicans will
say Obama doesn't care about national
security he doesn't care about
protecting us against terrorism right
because he veto in the wake of the of
the Boston Marathon bombings right you
know we put a bill in front of him that
would protect us and protect our
citizens from terrorism and he said no
to it right which is which is the which
is like this this messed up game of
politics but you know but it's funny
because the state of the union--obama
passed a cybersecurity an executive
order like beefing up some of these
protections and he's sitting or urging
Congress to like do something about it
but he's like but balance balance it
with what the people are telling you
they want right which is some amount of
protection for the privacy and all this
all of this data that's in the cloud and
it's in I would say is what's really
interesting to me is these two things
happening at the same time like this
weird reddit daxing and this like
incredible fight for personal privacy
it's like you know if I had to pick if I
had to choose between one of these
outcomes I would I would take away the
reddit daxing and I'd be like all right
Facebook and Google I sort of trust you
to handle my personal information in the
case of like cyber threats from for
enough so the question is that like I
somewhat trust you in the government to
all coordinate and do a basket well I I
do not trust the crazy like anarchists
and reddit know to find that if I do
yeah I did it's weird because if you I
just done I don't have like a complete
thought because it's all happening in
the past 48 hours but it's just weird
this idea that we don't need the
government we can do a better job in the
government and we're going to fight
against the government literally trying
to give itself whatever tools that wants
to do that job yeah instead of finding a
balance it's like we've adopted or at
least this particular crowd has adopted
the most extreme position which is like
an hour kiss like anarchism at its
finest yeah but so my concern now I'm
speaking you because you are way more of
a legal expert I don't want to be an
amateur critic of this just for the same
reason the doc sinh and all that but
their wording on the cisco build now
still seems overly broad to the point
across like with this sort of
I've like legal scrutiny this is my
stuff the other current current form
screening from whom I mean so that's
classic lure so that's the quote the
Fourth Amendment Trump's all right like
yeah if this passes they seal you in a
number of groups eff whoever would sue
the government and this this is in
violation of Fourth Amendment but who
knows I mean who knows me the
protections contained in here are there
they exist and they're not using this
information to let go and prosecute you
so I don't know like is it an
unreasonable search for facebook to be
like here are the attacks here's where
they came from here in the accounts late
it's not it's maybe not a search and our
court certainly aren't like wonderful it
understanding that like what happens on
computer servers is just as real as what
happens in the real world tell you but
there's there's the broad idea what is
trying to accomplish and then there's
the nuanced rhetoric that's in the bill
that will be used and scrutinized and
potentially use in other ways that
wasn't expected like that's I think the
big concern here but so that's I mean if
you want to adopt a very conservative
position that's the problem with any
piece of legislation right that you you
put in this wording yeah these
idealistic vision of what you're going
to achieve and then people like
literally turn that into whatever they
want and so any piece of legislation or
like a Bible yes wow way to go there man
I mean I'm just saying role bloggers in
the bottle to Paul ski stop just Sade
you know the Bible is like it's like I'm
wringing it but that's can be wielded
like stop talking these do not bring me
in some China stop talking about the
Bible anyhow I so it's actually you know
I I don't want to we have to move on
because we will talk when you have a lot
of and I want to actually say way from
what you were just talking about into
facebook i know that there's other stuff
it because you were saying is facebook
with your data and we did um you know
Facebook obviously recently released yet
home and messenger messenger chat heads
it's actually using a messenger or
messaging facebook what do they call it
messier is that the official name anyhow
so they released this near this new app
he shat heads and and the home screen
but we did a blender okay it is
messenger so we did we did this great
like in-depth look at their design
process for for creating chat heads and
creating their messaging product and one
of the things I was surprised
was to hear from the developers there
that they all used Facebook groups to
communicate turns out that's how they
work uh and they pointed out that there
are something like 80 million private
Facebook groups and and I just thought
like here's a perfect target for for
sista right here's a very target would
be like we need to know all those
whatever the saying facebook groups are
right now you know and I and I you know
I don't know who like your your years
kind of a false equivalency like do I
want the doc seen guys on reddit or do I
want this crazy regulation from a broken
sort of a broken yeah I'm system like
art I mean you know I do basically I
crossed our government is doing the
right thing tiny little bit more it's
like how far do I want the pendulum to
swing in favor of life right the crowd
right and i would say that i'd rather
have it swing towards uh like
institutions that I trust but you know I
i I'm gonna get a lot of like for
being like a classical liberal in that
way yeah but like I would rather not
have anarchists on reddit well i think i
think i think i know i'm all for i'm in
support of new things and new ideas but
what I will say is our government has
many many many problems most of them
having to do with lobbyists and the way
money flows through into our government
from corporations like Facebook and
Google and much worse far worse
corporations but i think that like
generally are you know I trust the
intent the intent of most members of our
government and I'm not maybe not
Congress and yeah the Senate um maybe
not most of that I mean generally I
think there are the the Spirit is there
that that like you're going watch house
of cards yet no I have 10 minutes I have
watched do it maybe cuz i've been
watching The West Wing I've got this
wrong you're alive you gotta watch out
the car but our government built America
I mean like you know the ask the people
did but but this government has been
doing American stuff for a long time in
like the Republican presidents and
Democrat presidents who have done all
sorts of great things to build our
country into what it is in our best
moments the government does amazing
stuff in their best moments rather you
know and I believe that the I believe
that the possibility of
government regulating and governing can
result in incredible moments for America
and for the world in its worst moment it
can be a totally destructive horrible
force where we know we end up in a war
for 10 years for no apparent reason like
nobody knows why and we spent all this
money and destroyed on me and you
remember you remember what the last 10
years ago but by hot but by and large
like it's a government design to change
slowly because you don't want a
reactionary government case the react
the wrong way yes there are things that
fall the cracking up minimizing or
Domitian any were talking about like
there's a big right it built this nation
because it was slow to screwing things
up alright i would say that we we built
this we-we-we city on rock and roll but
i think that i think that's I mean
there's definitely like a kind of rot
yeah in the government right now that I
think Democrats and Republicans no
matter what party are you can be
libertarian or whatever you're gonna
look at it and go yeah there's a real
problem I don't know what American
unless you're I don't know who you are
that agrees with this this idea that
corporations are people and yeah you
know that free speech is that money is
free speech like those things are that
one's much harder yeah that one's much
harder kind of its way harder in the
case of in the case of anything but who
we elected officials I would say yes but
when we went when you've got like when
it's like a question of who can shout
louder I actually think and I'm gonna
I'm gonna get a lot of for this and
I think when it comes to like our
election process for the people we put
into office it should be you have a
finite amount of money as dictated by
the government now you have a finite
amount of Titus and like every angle but
this actually works in other countries
you have a finite amount of time to
campaign right and personally this is
the more controversial thing i'm sure
people be very mad I think it's be
mandatory for Americans to vote and I
think that you should be fined if you
don't vote you should be fined a hundred
dollars if you don't vote and there
should be two days ago been voting over
the weekend not agree with you there and
should be done over there any why isn't
it not in a like a pony but why is it
why is it it's like me wearing this
webcast from every week like an asking
questions are Native American of your
American citizen you should have to say
what your point what your opinion is on
who's going to make the laws that will
govern your life
and if you don't want to do that love it
or leave it Wow like that I wait I wait
I was going hard like liberal socialist
and then I just threw it back a little
nicer of it and I are we gonna talk
about the facebook finally I mean yeah
everybody loves the facebook phone who
saw this one coming right here right
here yeah this guy loved it I'm just I
mean I it's a hard hard hard transition
here it's not doing it you love it for a
different reason I'm gonna help you this
transit I love it cuz I'm a socialist
and you love whoa fascist I you know
person I just don't like the Facebook
part of it but I love everything else
about the phone you know I like it and
that's somebody asked me this it's
because I actually use I'll i like using
how this is by the way the heart the
weirdest transition in the history of
the verge i like it i think i but i
actually have it set as my lockscreen
spin the dour verge can try to share
some i like something the first show in
the history of the verge Cass did you
know have my min dir not really
functionality on that by the way I said
I like something and it's a like you uh
no look you know what I like I like this
locks like that I haven't sets that when
you push the home button it takes your
stocking and I see can i see with how
that works yeah you just push down
button and takes you to suck but like I
mean so there's like three steps to get
your phone on I just have to unlock it
but here's using you actually like you
use your Facebook that much like
Facebook is not just authentication tool
for you it's actually no actually I've
been using is Twitter a lot yeah but
i've been using I mean it's funny I
didn't using Facebook more now yes see
it yes here's the thing they got me a
facebook that the the cover feed yes
ever they call it god these names yeah
the cover feed idea is actually really
good good and and in all I wish is that
I could just plug in my Instagram and my
Twitter yeah I would like Flickr and
other way they need from HTC a baby hear
the difference no but bland feet but
blink flashes blinkfeed is like when
Peters got a good well it's it's not the
lock screen you can make blank read your
lock screen no I don't think so i don't
have my phone here's why but here also
it's called blink and I and I've come to
understand why i like this experience
far better than its whatever Samsung
does whatever HTC dozen blinkfeed it's
because Facebook and Google are two of
the best software companies on earth and
they write really really tremendously
good software yeah so I might not like
love using facebook but I'd find the
soft
they've written to sit on top of Android
to be like delightful and fun to use and
it makes you want to use Facebook more
but then I push the button and I get to
use google software and at no point to
Samsung's like s team of like hacks
getting my way steam steam uh and no
point is like HTC's weird idea of what
my clock should look like young feed it
in my way now I mean the brilliant thing
about this phone about the first and
about the home concept is is facebook
said kind of smartly uh look we don't
need to take over your whole phone to be
prominent and important but we just need
to take over the parts that you use a
lot right like SMS yeah and messaging
and your home screen your lock screen in
your home screen but they also weirdly
and on this device I don't understand
but I wish I pray I would love for HTC
to do this when you turn off facebook
home and you turn off the messaging if
you don't want it yeah you so it goes we
stock give a stock Android device which
is what I'm doing it's a good it's like
a 4.3 inch screen it looks nice it has
LTE it has LTE I'm it has a really great
screen it has i will say so by the way
benchmarks higher than that than the
nexus for my testing well i'm saying i
haven't tried any of that yet because i
just like using it like not that was
right necessarily the only thing it has
an absolutely garbage camera camera
sarah phone designers get you to use
facebook yeah such no i agree they
should have made more of an investment
in the camera and i will say having used
the one now yeah which to me is the
absolute i think probably the best
smartphone I've ever used yeah I wish it
had slightly better battery life but but
my droid has been all but abandoned but
you like you like going on the 11 camera
is great yeah it is I don't know what
like it's not gonna say it doesn't take
I would say that that I would say that
that the iphone 5s images look more
filmic they look more like a camera
right by a few degrees not crazy but
that but the one is I think produces
really great results it works really
well in low light and and its consumer
me has been very consistent yeah it's
not the best I don't think it's like the
most beautiful camera i've ever used on
a phone but it is so much better than
most
Amber's I've used on especially most
Android cameras I don't know what it is
but like now we've yet to take ova Lumia
it's actually surprising a good camera
button does phone in fact is I'm not
printing these out i'm not making prints
out of my image not taking my phone I'm
what I'm doing is I'm putting them on on
social network you're heavily filtering
them and putting I'm having children I
put in my Instagram but you know that
you know actually one thing I'll say
it's annoying is I i use my i use the
one in the widescreen mode because the
resolution doesn't change it doesn't go
you know most phones when you switch to
widescreen mode it goes from like an
eight megapixel shot or whatever
actually because it's it's it's
distributing the pixels differently this
is just like it's just prop it's still
just a 4-megapixel no its cropping right
so it's just cropping it out for the
other shots but what's annoying is when
you if you take a picture and you put it
on Twitter that's the wide screen writer
does some weird scaling where it makes
the image super tiny no weird yeah like
you and I tweeted a picture of the same
thing or something one day and I was
extremely annoyed because yours blew up
to like a 4-3 sighs and mine because it
was 69 it like scales are down it never
gets bigger interesting yeah it's
annoying anyhow but um but the but the
first is actually good if it had a
better camera i would i would seriously
i submit iris place a phone be up
besides a new iphone just quickly take
over our staff like the first right on
in like admittedly like there's a bunch
of unions phone yeah we have a week or
so these are a lot of these are gonna go
back what i want to see is who is going
to switch switch yeah I'm on the
precipice of doing so I want one in red
I've got the contract upgrade I'm not
leaving AT&amp;amp;T yeah like when this goes
back and I think it's no week's time I'm
probably pick up the right but i will
just acquisition red i have a baby blue
one and i think the baby blue is
actually i will say this i mean we get a
lot of review units all the time like
and they never people don't ever to them
yeah they're like they're not have
phones on my desk for days and I'm like
wow I see ya I like I'm on screen or
Sony that's been sitting on your desk
for like a week and yeah you don't you
interested in it at all I mean it's just
not good like I don't want to deal with
it but this is great I mean I will say
that it is it is pretty funny that
Facebook is like here's our first phone
we're going to tell you see what to do
and they've basically delivered the film
that like most of us have wanted for a
long time yeah minus is terrible camera
and obviously I wish it out of 5
industry oh I will say
I will say this you know I was you know
I was using an iphone 5 on 80 and my
droid on verizon I and I said to say I
still the battery life on that thing is
still like ridiculous but when you put
that next to the one not the first even
the first in some ways like kind of yes
screen is better yeah that's a screen on
screen is better that's about I was in
in a hundred percent this was done on
purpose but it is built to feel exactly
like an iphone oh gx god yes yeah like
the buttons are in the same place the
volumes in the same place this is blue
now it's white it's just so blue in here
and it's got like the same ran outside
it feels better it's like built a little
bit better than wasn't mad back on this
no it's great it's like it's like and
crack this is like the the cheaper
iPhone yeah there's my case leaks of a
cheaper iPhone footing around and that's
yeah yeah um but it is is a nice little
phone and just the fact that you can go
to stock is now incredible right okay
are we switching gears we're running out
of time are we yeah yep people are real
mad at the verge cast have been an hour
lately they've been really two hours
we've been really busy lately and it's
really hard to do a two hour yeah or an
hour and a half one of these days maybe
when Paul comes back when Paul comes
back we'll do like a marathon yeah any
urge cap that night he comes like we
will be on the air with ball yeah just
talking to him you're just watching
Paul's I'm sorry here's my real concern
with Hall come back in you know are you
ready yeah we're all excited all I only
finally we get to hear you I want to be
there with him it's what we want it I
want it to be a party I'm excited to
have uh huh but i'm sure that while paul
wants to do is like jack into the
internet and like drown out the world
and not pay attention to when he sees
how much would be together yeah over
this year I mean he's like well this
it's dreams nature you know would be
amazing free corner you know would be
amazing can I can I suggest something
yeah can we do this I just had this idea
okay what if we could get like you know
we're gonna say hey we're gonna make a
big deal out of Paul coming back and
we're gonna put him on a computer you
know we're gonna get him we're gonna
film it or something yeah right and we
give him a totally fake internet look at
where like everything has changed
dramatically yeah you know and there's
all
kinds of weird stuff on it and we're
like oh yeah you don't know about
flarping I know that is but they saying
yeah LARPing it's like LARPing but with
FL in front of it or was it happen for
ya know to an extra FL yeah a larf local
RP it's like yeah any I think with 2 l's
um you enjoyed yeah second else I we do
that how much effort do you think you
would take I'm sure to create a new
internet that's where everything is
different one of our one of our writers
evan rodgers could probably just make
that in a weekend yeah we should have
happy to have him whip it up okay so now
we're going to change gears as you guys
know we launched our we launched our
science of our science section your
science portal this week yeah uh and
area what science area science area and
and what and in katy dirt spot katie
drummond are our science editor is here
right yes i was in the rocks refuses to
leave i want the key music i want to see
there's this video i want see this
teaser video oh and then i will
magically oh that's what's gonna have a
bio so Katie's Katie's going to join us
but first take a look at we did at like
a little kind of get excited about
science on the verge video and and when
we come back I did like the idea that
you just refuse to leave yeah yeah like
I was holes his hand up there's a
handcuff like a part of the desk I've
been trying he's gonna join us in a
minute but watch this and we'll be right
back what if i told you that within two
years you'd be able to control another
person's movements using nothing but
your thoughts or that within 10 you'd be
able to replace your own kidney with one
grown in a lab or that in 30 years you'd
be packing the cooler and rallying the
kids for a long weekend in deep space
these aren't just the dreams of kids and
creatives this is our future and it's
coming faster than you might think
all thanks to the breakthroughs emerging
from brilliant curious creative minds
across the globe sure it can be tough to
wrap your head around when you're not
working in a physics lab or an ivory
tower of academia but think about it
this way discoveries in medicine will
let you stay healthier and live longer
new electronics will give you instant
access to whatever information you want
wherever you are and whenever you need
it progress in transportation will mean
the freedom to travel anywhere on earth
in a fraction of the time and those
examples are only the tip of the iceberg
just bring your biggest ideas and your
wildest dreams to the table there's no
guarantee that can be achieved or
realized today but when you think about
it that's the best part science never
gives up and never stops looking for new
answers all you need to do is ask the
question welcome to the verge science
and we are back with none other ok I
think 80 should say welcome a cage again
yeah welcome to verge science is there
any echo on this it sounds very bad back
let me just turn this that way ok ah
Katie thank you for joining us and thank
you Joshua wow wow that's thank you
verily proper there's definitely not
going on there is an echo where is that
coming from guys oh yeah you're the
worst that's not you John in the in the
control room he's a wonderful man
actually Katie science what is it
science is all about possibility mmm
discovery yeah answering questions okay
always a new question everyone's trying
to find the answer yeah yeah do we know
do we know can science prove whether or
not God is real no God really starting
here welcome to work Katie this is what
your drop will be like I'm gonna pass on
that could science tell me if aliens
exist not yet can science create a an
object out of nothing yes good science
cuz sorry I don't know
I don't know I I don't have a lot of
science questions actually no we're very
excited so we we've had been doing
science coverage on the verge but had
wanted to put a much clearer focus on it
as you know sure why you're sitting here
and I should be telling them this but
and and and so it was kind of a
painstaking process trying to find
somebody who had the right sort of a set
of skills to to do to do the science
section properly and you actually you're
not just a kind of a science person
you're also very interested in we've
talked a lot about like national
security stuff over the last few days
obviously she's used to work at danger
room sure for wired yet and so you'll
probably be doing some of that stuff as
well I hope so yeah I hope so too yeah
but um what is exciting to you right now
from us in terms of science like what's
like what's what's the thing that's
happening to that you are most excited
about like I know there's this discovery
today about new new planets sure where
aliens live yeah or maybe live yeah and
we can go visit yeah and I mean that's
well okay um so I'll ask you to go read
the story after okay no don't maybe
clarify a few things sure we can go
visit that you get a little closer to
the mic yes yeah and right yeah yeah
yeah you got yeah glee Phegley thread
this is playing really well um so I
think I'm I've always been someone very
interested in health and medicine and
that's sort of if I had to pick on a
niche in science that would be my thing
and so I think what I find really
interesting right now is regenerative
medicine and the idea that we can sort
of rebuild our bodies yeah and that that
is something that will emerge as a valid
option in the next decade um but I saw
no I saw the new vein but I saw the most
recent spider-man movie and a lot of the
plot centers around regenerating limbs
and it didn't go well in the film right
what happened was turned somebody into a
monster no I does that an octopus is
that something that we need to worry
about that wasn't now that latest one it
was Terry turned it turned a attorney
guy into a lizard into the lizard the
lizard I think it's his name okay it's
like a giant man lizard
do we need to worry about that when it
comes to regeneration body regeneration
doubtful okay yeah okay do you think I
always feel like you know we ran a story
today about um about how rabies is sort
of the inspiration for vampirism and
zombies sure yeah doesn't it seem and
correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't seem
like our ideas about what science will
do to us are always way more exciting
and way less realistic than what science
is actually doing to us I mean I think
yes and no I think what they tend to be
are unrealistic in the sense that I
think we want to see results before
results are actually ready right um so
we sort of hear about a new kidney being
regenerated created in a lab
transplanted into a rat and we sort of
get really excited about that and that
is exciting yeah and but we but humans
immediately go to the 10 steps later ran
our tents eps later are crazy were like
oh they they found a way to put an
artificial kidney into a rat and then
like somebody makes a movie about wow I
have an artificial about rap about a
giant rats that eat peoples kidneys yeah
right uh yeah I the way I mean I would
watch that you know we'll get there well
then I recalled sorry a rat eating
kidneys yeah like ratty like from living
people it would look as if that's good
feeds on Appa dasha the return know
anything about that that's pretty rude
an aside like which is what they call
the stuff that kills rats oh well that's
good I'm so sorry Katie early they just
want to hear it well I we look we've the
science the science section has been
revving for 24 hours and I think you
people are very aware of what we're
doing there yes you know I don't want to
like just rehash the stories we've been
telling I want to get to know Katie sure
never spoken before we've never met this
is our effort this is our first official
conversation yeah and and so far you
seem great uh but but I you know I think
people should know what Katie's but her
thoughts are on this rabbit via de road
on de Ferran yeah exactly um but yeah we
do but we do tend to kind of over
fictionalize sure we we get excited I
mean science is very exciting well
actually we get excited about it but
it's important
and I think that's something that I'm
hoping to make a priority for us at the
verge is to sort of obviously report
this exciting research that's going on
but be very clear in sort of what the
limitations are yeah um and be very
clear in sort of what just happened this
is a rat this is not a person what does
that mean right yeah I think one of the
things that happens in reporting
reporting science is that because
extrapolation is easy and when you don't
have all the data it becomes even easier
and there's almost a laziness to not
fully understanding not fully grasping
the story like this this planet story
today it's we talked about a little bit
right now there are a lot of unanswered
questions that I think a lot of people
and this is not an indictment of anybody
else but you you even as a reader I I
tend to make all of these leaps and
write about what it could mean right
without kind of knowing that we did not
find aliens you cannot go there okay
still very rural really crushing by you
know I would say this is really
interesting because I when in your intro
post and a few of those threads that we
have in the forum next ribbon new
science forum um there was a lot of
conversation about like I'm really
excited you guys are doing this but
don't please don't be like everyone else
yeah like please please tell us what's
actually happening how this could
actually work because that's what we're
interested I think one thing you can
count and I by the way this is one of
the things that when we talked i
immediately got uh when we started
talking about you coming here to do the
science stuff it was immediately that
feeling of your kind of weird the way a
lot of people the verge are weird and
yeah kind of it kind of a deal a kind of
it like a kind of a detail a
detail-oriented um overachiever yeah and
the tub yes as family know it like it
like also also like kind of you kind of
had you know you seem you seem
unsatisfied a lot of the time with like
you like you want to go further which is
I think a real thing here that that we
are unsatisfied with we can do better
yeah i was super annoyed like most of
the day Yeah Yeah right now we yeah what
were you know maybe we should take this
oh just we can always you know yeah i
can always do better no I say I never
annoyed with yourself not with the world
no just high achiever right right and I
think
yeah like cuz I've never you you're
lovely like that I think you're like
that I'm uh I will say this new
remembers we the night before the night
before the section launched you sent out
that checklist but I will say this
actually I know that's high-achieving
but is happy you have a different you
take a different approach like I am uh I
beat myself up a lot and I think I beat
up people around me sometimes because of
this feeling of of not you know not
adequately inadequacy you're just like
we didn't get it or what why did we do
this or why didn't I do that I mean I
used to say this is analogy time when I
used to make music that I would just you
know work on music for weeks and weeks
with like a band or by myself whatever
and then by the end of it I just like
this is terrible like I why did I do
this like any the thing would always be
you could do it better next time but and
I think that I feel like I kind of get
that vibe from you where it's like okay
that was good but we could do better and
you seems like you're striving really
hard to make things amazing and to tell
the full story and to and to paint a
clear picture and you do that as well
but you have you are heart makers mono
yeah that could be that could be it but
you you also are you get like a soft
side where you you have like this um
better appreciation for the need to
nurture know and and even like we're a
mother hen yeah when it comes to you
vote for us in the webbings everyone
that's good for a chat I gotta get up
it's true that I mean you might the
mother and some other stuff gets thrown
around a lot with ya statue this weird
and also your friends and market we're
kind of an irascible somewhat buzz
mother I mean here you can be you can be
you can be very combative but you know
you're kind of like you've got this like
this offside that like you're like let's
take a moment to to hug hmm I've always
hugging me buddy all right can we
the verge cast no but at the fine but
that is your fun therapy session I like
you like this is
yeah we're doing right so um psychology
real yeah they psychology I shoulda
therapy all tonight psychology science
Oh Oh God boom there's an area right
there that's nice yeah you got to shoot
things I shouldn't angry she was
thinking yeah you think it I mean it's
not like a man i'm gonna get for
this I'm just do it I guess I just don't
think of psychology and sort of the hard
science sense where I think of like
biology chemistry physics right
psychology is something separate but
there's a science to it I mean it's
research oriented I mean there are
doctors in the field there are sure
there are professors I call it right
there are but I guess I sort of i make a
discussion as well between sort of
psychologists and psychiatrists yeah um
we're actually running I mean we have a
story on deck about the DSM changing we
do yeah um we're actually I think gonna
have a couple um let's not give it away
let's not yeah my big mnemonic Ohio a
lot they're gonna be covering but one of
the things and I think this is in by the
way we have to go I just got in my ear
which is Ross now apparently in that
he's out in some walk past he's in the
background they're like try to fix their
you back Jennifer Lawrence too bad
because I think you need to come back on
and I could stay here all day no I know
so could I unfortunately we're being
rushed off for some reason I think
because of David disappears I think
David Pierce is responsible but but UH
one of the things about the science
coverage is that is that we are and I
think if you don't know this you didn't
catch this this week and if you haven't
been paying attention you know we are
obviously our appetite for fields of new
fields of coverage and for expanding
field of a field of coverages is huge
for us and and science is one of those
places where I see all of these like
it's actually incredible when you start
to crack that open a little bit how much
everything else is a part of you can
classify in this world of science you
know how much of a connective tissue it
is between topics yeah and I think for
us it's been it's been really liberating
to
have that big bucket yeah and have that
connective tissue to to to tap into and
so I'm excited very excited about what
you're doing with signs and what you're
going to do and and I would say to the
to the viewer or the listener or the
reader get ready get just put your gonna
tap into the connective tissue yeah with
a scalpel that was with it again with a
friend yes siree we're gonna go and
we'll be using a syringe and a drill
yeah to do that alright so we have three
things to plug before okay we had a plot
/ get ready listen up we're plugging uh
you're moderating a whole bunch of
Tribeca panels next week oh yeah oh yes
we are in partnership with tribeca film
festival hosting the future of film
sessions at the Tribeca Film Festival
and i'm moderating a bunch of panels a
lot of have a bunch of panels with some
really interesting people including i'm
doing a a a three-man panel with David
Denby and AO scott who are you should
know the names are very respected film
critics in that it's called the on the
the death of film I think ? yeah i just
wanna say i didn't invent the name of
that panel but anyway covering and we've
already been covering people at tribeca
now who are covering films there and
will be obviously doing coverage from
from these panels where where
appropriate but you'll they're going to
be doing video and we'll be having the
video replayed on the site and stuff so
it'll be great if you're at the if
you're at the film festival you should
try to make it to these panels because
we get people from these are really
really interesting panels we got people
from sony and naughty dog and and and
all sorts of distributors and 29 29
entertainment and just like it's me good
it's gonna be fine we're doing a lot
there um I'm required to say that we're
nominated for five webbie's we're
nominated voting so we're nominated for
five webbie's and close the next week
ranging from matter yeah we'd love for
your vote uh you don't have to vote but
it's appreciated you can go to the webby
awards website and search for the verge
and you'll see all the stuff polygon is
also nominated I would say as gaming sit
for a game gaming site and and I don't
know what their exact category is but
its gaming yeah I think it's actually
just gaming they should be vote they
should win they should be there they
should be voted upon they should be
voted for
upon upon which we voted with ya go with
them go with them and lastly just very
simple top shelf is next at five-thirty
