everyone who's here at vox media
headquarters in Washington DC and for
all of you who are viewing our
livestream at the verge com or FCC gov
it's a real honor to be here my name is
Jim Bank off and I'm the chairman and
CEO of vox media we were publishers of
sites like SB Nation the verge and soon
polygon it's a great honor for us to
host chairman julius genachowski of the
FCC this morning who will be making a
major policy speech and we're honored to
have him here and honored that all of
you have attended as well without
further ado I'm going to run a quick
video that will explain a little bit
about vox media I recognize it might we
might be a new company in a new face for
a lot of you so we're going to show a
quick + clip and hopefully get
everyone's blood flowing and explain the
company a little bit
I'm Josh Topolsky welcome to on the
verge welcome back to SB Nation Russ
rustic here with polygon integrated
bluetooth and Wi-Fi looking at the best
style I for your iPad this is really
cool we're in the Microsoft model shop
every year you have a chance to own the
New York Yankees in horse racing a bunch
of protesters stand behind me I wanted
to be here today to document it all we
are a couple weeks out from the release
of max payne 3 we've been hiring a lot
of different people with a lot of
different experience from different
parts of the industry know you moved hop
what do you open it up just don't move
your hand we're going to learn how to
become driving ninjas the internet is
the dream platform for scammers it is
the first free-to-play shooter on the
console yes indeed that's pretty
incredible every game of the World
Series are ye trucks it's one of the
best feelings ever to walk out on a
Sunday thousands of people who scream I
wouldn't trade it for anything in the
world right so that gives a little thank
you that gives a little overview of who
we are as vox media and what you can see
from the video and if you check out our
web sites is that we are a digitally
native web native company and that's why
it's so appropriate and we're so honored
to host this session our company would
not exist without broadband it's not
just the media that we create but it's
the infrastructure that runs our company
it enables our 200 plus employees and a
thousand plus paid contributors all of
which by the way our jobs that were
created in the past four years and all
of which were created by broadband so we
take this issue very seriously and this
this address is therefore very
appropriate chairman Genachowski and i
met in 2007 i had recently left my job
at AOL and he was beginning the next
chapter of his career following a very
successful tenure as an internet
executive and investor we were both
ready to embark on the next phase of our
careers as digital entrepreneurs but we
shared a problem that was common to a
lot of
Lee stagers we didn't have an office the
Chairman took matters into his own hands
and uh got a place and quickly he became
my landlord we sub leased the space down
in Chinatown and well well Julius was
setting up launch box which is an
incubator focused on helping early-stage
companies to reach their full potential
I started working on what was then SB
Nation and has now become vox media as
officemates our friendship group we
spent many hours talking about the vast
potential of consumer and enterprise
businesses that were being enabled by
broadband and we also talked a lot about
baseball sue and Julius had been
appointed to lead the FCC those of us
who understood the opportunities for the
United States brought on by the massive
transformation in broadband and
communications were thrilled to have a
chairman who was not only an
accomplished legal scholar public
servant and corporate executive but
someone who had also innovated and
created jobs at the grassroots level as
we waited confirmation the den
chairman-elect continued to share an
office with us of course we were growing
as was his staff and it's a proud part
of box media's heritage and history that
we had to compete for a conference room
space with the future FCC leadership
fast forward to today SB Nation has
morphed into vox media we've grown from
one full-time employee or founder Tyler
Bleszinski to 200 full-time employees
and over 1,000 paid freelancers all
within the past four years our media
properties like the verge SB Nation and
soon to launch polygons reach over 30
million visitors each month and in fact
literally just a few minutes ago we
launched our most ambitious upgrade in
our history with a bold new SBNation
platform that is optimized for the
post-pc era of smartphones and tablets
check it out little plug sbnation.com
chairman Genachowski is leading the FCC
and america's broadband roadmap and my
new york yankees and Julius's washington
nationals are both in first
place in their respective divisions so
not too shabby in the past four years
since being sworn in as chairman of the
FCC in june 2009 chairman Genachowski
has focused the agency on unleashing the
opportunities of wired and wireless
broadband he has successfully pursued
policies to promote investment in job
creation drive innovation foster
competition and empower consumers during
his tenure the FCC developed and is
implementing the National Broadband Plan
an ambitious strategy to harness the
opportunities of high-speed internet
promote us global competitiveness and
bring the benefits of 21st century
communications to all Americans the
Commission has worked modernized
outdated programs and eliminate barriers
to innovation and investment the
Commission adopted the landmark connect
America fund a once-in-a-generation
overhaul of the multi-billion dollar
Universal Service Fund and its related
rules transforming it from supporting
telephone service to broadband the
connect American fund replaces legacy
programs with new market driven
incentive based policies to achieve
universal broadband both wired and
wireless through the Commission's
broadband acceleration initiative the
chairman has advanced policies that
reduce cost and time required to deploy
broadband infrastructure including
streamlining the process for attaching
communications equipment to utility
poles and wireless towers the agency has
taken strong steps to preserve Internet
freedom and openness adopting a
framework to protect free enterprise and
free speech online incentivizing
significant private investment in
Internet applications and services as
well as broadband networks and
infrastructure today chairman
Genachowski is going to outline in a
major policy address where we as a
country can go from here as a company
that has been oak that has been built on
open access to a fast and secure
internet vox media is proud to welcome
chairman julius genachowski
uh Jim thank you so much for for that
great introduction and for reminding me
of what was really just such a fun time
in our lives and it's great to be back
it's great to be back I don't know what
you all were doing last night I was
watching Monday Night Football and I
fell asleep did I miss anything wow I
thought the FCC got a lot of complaints
about dropped calls very seriously Jim
thank you thanks to vox media for for
hosting this I know it's a big day
you're relaunching SB Nation and that
you took the time to host this that so
many of you are here listening to some
points about policy I appreciate it very
much and all of you should know Jim
Bangkok has established himself as one
of the great innovators in online media
seizing the opportunities of the
internet SB Nation has grown a network
of more than a thousand contributors in
49 states in the public has responded to
this localized content making SB Nation
the fastest growing sports website in
America with more than 28 million
monthly visitors now many of those SB
Nation contributors started as
commenters and ninety-nine percent are
paid so SB Nation much like eBay and
Amazon Facebook and Google serves as a
platform for entrepreneurial people all
over America to create value online and
make a living so when you think about SB
Nation just like when you think about
these other companies it's not just the
hundreds of jobs that Jim Bank off and
his team have created at vox media it's
the platform for other work and job
creation it's part of the hidden story
of what the broadband revolution can do
for our economy and one of the reasons
I'm really happy to be
here is that this company is a perfect
example of it of course SB Nation is far
from all that that vox media is doing
the verge is the country's fastest
growing tech news site polygon is taking
on gaming and I have a feeling that Jim
and the vox media team aren't done yet
now about this time of year ago I
delivered a speech just down the road at
livingsocial a pioneer in the daily
deals category that's provided value to
consumers and small businesses while in
a similar way creating hundreds and
hundreds of us jobs I chose to speak
therefore basically the same reason that
I'm speaking here at vox media to
illustrate that broadband high-speed
internet wired and wireless is
transforming our economy and the way we
live for the better I'll speak today
about how over the past four years the
US has regained global leadership in key
areas of the broadband economy and is
building a strong foundation for the
future but as important I want to talk
about how we also face significant
challenges some familiar and some new
most notably we're in a global bandwidth
race this race will help determine who
creates jobs and grows GDP in this flat
competitive innovation-driven global
economy now and over the next decade US
leadership will require a strategic
bandwidth advantage fast high capacity
and ubiquitous broadband to secure this
advantage for our country the private
and public sectors both have important
roles seizing the opportunities of big
bandwidth will bring enormous benefits
and failure to do so will have real and
negative consequences now I'll try to
keep my remarks here brief at least
brief by policy speech standards a
longer version that elaborates on some
of the points that I'll make will be
available at FCC gov and I encourage you
to go to FCC gov anyway and learn about
what we're doing
so let's start with the good news our
increasingly knowledge-based economy is
powered by broadband and a broadband
economy and its foundation have come a
long way in the past four years both in
absolute terms and relative to our
global competitors it wasn't long ago
that Asia and Europe were ahead of the
US and broadband powered innovation and
infrastructure take Mobile in 2008
Businessweek described America as having
been a wireless backwater we were
talking then about Europe's lead on 3g
and about the vibrant mobile innovation
in countries like Japan and South Korea
but thanks to innovative American
companies software mobile broadband
providers and others and to smart
government policies the story today is
different it's one of comeback and
leadership after trailing and key 3g
metrics we're now leading the world in
deploying the next generation of
wireless broadband networks 4g LTE at
scale today we have sixty nine percent
of the world's LTE subscribers and every
expectation to maintain 4G leadership
for the foreseeable future the United
States has become the global test bed
for LTE apps and services America is
leading to in the software driven apps
and services running on these networks
more than eighty percent of smartphones
sold today throughout the world run on
operating systems developed by US
companies that's up from less than
twenty-five percent three years ago an
amazing shift and US companies of the
clear leaders in the tablet sector
worldwide accounting for roughly
three-quarters of tablets sold and for
the operating systems on almost all
tablets the explosion of tablet use is
just incredible the percentage of
american adults using tablets and
e-readers has lept from two percent to
thirty percent in just three years
today's smartphone and tablet powered
apps economy already massive but still
in the early innings is fundamentally a
made in the USA phenomenon
a very recent one in june two thousand
eight there was no app store in june
2012 the apple and android app stores
alone had collective 3 billion downloads
it's a hundred million apps a day on
wired broadband infrastructure we've
made major progress too at the beginning
of 2009 broadband networks capable of
100 megabits per second past less than
twenty percent of us homes that number
is over eighty percent today putting the
US for the moment near the top of the
world and deployment of high-speed
broadband infrastructure and according
to akamai latest state of the internet
report the average speeds actually used
in the US are up almost thirty percent
in just one year from twenty eleven to
twenty twelve now smartphones and
tablets require both wireless and wired
infrastructure without Wi-Fi smartphones
and tablets would have far less value
and Wi-Fi wouldn't have been possible
without a and Wi-Fi wouldn't be possible
without a wired broadband infrastructure
as well as FCC policies that enabled
Wi-Fi use on unlicensed bactrim Wi-Fi
now drives over forty percent of mobile
internet connections and over ninety two
percent of tablet internet connections
in the US but some people call
heterogenous net heterogeneous networks
wired and wireless broadband or powering
other key growth industries like cloud
computing with firms like Amazon Apple
Google Rackspace box and others the u.s.
pioneered and continues to lead the
fast-growing cloud computing industry
delivering real benefits to businesses
and consumers so broadband is an
essential platform for job creation and
investment and we can see that in what's
happened over the last several years
mobile innovation is estimated to have
created 1.6 million US jobs over the
past five years and the nascent apps
economy has already created nearly
500,000 us jobs companies delivering
cloud services added eighty thousand new
jobs in twenty ten not counting the many
jobs they helped create by boosting
productivity and lowering costs for
businesses large and small from 2009 to
2011 annual investment and why
and wireless networks increased about
thirty percent to more than sixty
billion dollars even in this challenging
economy this wave of broadband related
investment and innovation in the US over
the past few years it's just the
beginning the benefits for education for
health care energy and public safety are
all proving themselves out right now
through amazing inventors and
entrepreneurs now I'm pleased that a
reinvigorated FCC has been part of this
positive story the FCC has helped lay a
foundation for success by modernizing
rules for the broadband age and ensuring
climate for investment and innovation
throughout the broadband ecosystem we
developed America's First National
Broadband Plan transformed an outdated
universal service program that was
telephone oriented into the connect
America fund the largest US broadband
infrastructure program ever we've
Unleashed licensed and unlicensed
spectrum for mobile innovation removed
regulatory barriers to lower the cost of
broadband deployment enacted a strong
common sense framework to preserve
Internet freedom and openness and taken
strong steps to protect competition of
course the country's work is not done
progress in broadband over the past four
years is real and significant but we
shouldn't declare victory not in this
fast-moving and globally competitive
sector challenges to US leadership are
real some of these challenges are
consequence of our own success the
internet is an American invention and
whether it's Google or Facebook Netflix
or Hulu Amazon or Ebay Twitter or
Dropbox the examples are endless
American innovators have driven dramatic
increases in demand for broadband
whether mobile or at home work or school
this rush of demand is creating real
challenges real challenges to the
broadband infrastructure and to other
broadband policies well bring it on
these are the kinds of challenges
America wants to have too much demand is
much better than too little and these
are the kinds of challenges we can meet
and overcome now in general the
challenges to us leadership in the
broadband economy come from technology
powered developments this is a flat
world where capital can flow and
innovators can work anywhere and in this
24-7 information world it's no secret
anywhere that broadband is a ticket to a
country's economic success I've met with
senior government officials and business
leaders throughout the world and I can
tell you that they are all focused on
the broadband opportunity whether it's
griha China the EU Australia on and on
all have plans to deploy ultra
high-speed broadband on a wide scale to
become a magnet for innovators and
capital we are in a global bandwidth
race a nation's future economic security
is tied to frictionless and speedy
access to information the faster we can
connect our citizens the faster our
economy can grow the more people of all
walks of life that have access to
bandwidth the more opportunity we spread
for all and much like the space race in
the 20th century success in this race
will unleash waves of innovation that
will go a long way toward determining
who leads our global economy in the 21st
century now US leadership in internet
innovation wired and wireless starts
with our remarkable innovators and
entrepreneurs that's why it's so
important that we have world-class
education in the United States and smart
immigration policies like Senator
Schumer's new bill to make more green
cards available to foreign graduates of
us universities with advanced math
science and engineering degrees
world-leading talent in the u.s. is
necessary but it's not sufficient we
also need world leading digital
infrastructure our Channel and just to
ensure that the US has a strategic
bandwidth advantage this is a point
first made by the architect of our
National Broadband Plan Blair Levin and
Tom Friedman has written persuasively on
this as well what do I see is the
elements of developing a strategic
bandwidth advantage
I see three key pieces broadband speed
capacity and ubiquity we need people to
have the bandwidth they need when and
where they need it whether you're a high
tech innovator large or small business
or a consumer at home around the go now
let me describe what i mean by speed
capacity and ubiquity and why each is
important and let me suggest what a
broadband ecosystem with these three
elements will require so start with
faster speeds speed matters because
innovators need next-generation speed
for next generation innovations genetic
sequencing for cancer patients immersive
and creative software to help children
learn ways for small businesses to take
advantage of big data and speed and
capacity heavy innovations we can't even
imagine businesses and consumers need
high speeds to take advantage of
services like cloud computing every day
these can make every smartphone tablet
and laptop capable of harnessing the
power of the world's largest
supercomputers and capable of accessing
the petabytes of vast data centers as
President Obama has said to lead the
world to a new future of productivity
and prosperity we have to connect all of
America at a 21st century infrastructure
and raise the standards for broadband
speed more capacity we're experiencing a
revolution and how we consume and
generate data the internet used to be a
text heavy website on a computer screen
today is streaming video on your TV set
your smartphone your tablet video
conferencing telework cloud storage and
more look at SB Nation most of its
content when it got off the ground I
remember this very well was static text
a few pictures on a network of blogs
that was that today more and more SB
Nation is creating high bandwidth
valuable video content across all of vox
media sites the number of videos being
posted is up one thousand two hundred
percent over the past year this
explosion of online video and other high
band
applications and services leading
internet users to consume more and more
data every month to maximize the
opportunities of broadband for our
economy consumers need sufficient
monthly broadband capacity to make
ecommerce routine and unconstrained to
maximize the opportunities of broadband
for education healthcare and other
important national priorities consumers
need sufficient monthly broadband
capacity so that families with
school-age children won't have to fight
over who gets to use the internet for
homework a distance learner can take a
full course load online a senior with
diabetes can have regular online video
consultations with a doctor in another
town ubiquity by ubiquity I mean this
broadband should be available to
everyone anywhere anytime this means
that our fastest latest wireless
broadband networks should cover at least
ninety eight percent of the country as
the president set as a goal that no
American should be without a broadband
option and that we must change the fact
that nearly one in three Americans
remain unconnected at home the phrase
universal broadband is often used to
cover these concepts and it's a good
phrase i'm using ubiquity today to
emphasize the increasing importance of
mobile broadband what's the goal and
focusing on speed capacity and ubiquity
the goal is removing bandwidth and
location as constraints on innovation
let me be more concrete on the vision
first as we said in our national
broadband plan we need innovation hubs
in the US with ultra-fast broadband the
speed measured in gigabits not megabits
there have been some positive
developments on this front in Kansas
City google has now launched the first
large-scale commercial effort to bring
one gigabit per second service to a
residential market in Chattanooga
Tennessee the community owned utility
installed a hundred percent
fibre-to-the-premises network making
speeds up to 1 gigabit per second
available to all residences business
and institutions and the gig you
initiative led by Blair Levin has
already catalyzed over 200 million
dollars in private investment to build
ultra high speed hubs in the communities
of many leading research universities
these efforts provide essential test
beds for developing and testing the data
rich technologies of our future but we
need more innovation hubs than we can
count on one hand we need a critical
mass of communities that have the most
robust bandwidth in the world where
broadband abundance is a fact of life so
that private-sector innovators and the
research community can invent and test
tomorrow's essential services with a
meaningful number of potential users now
second we need to ensure that truly
high-speed high capacity broadband plans
are the norm widely not the exception in
the National Broadband Plan we set a
goal of affordable hundred megabit per
second service to 100 million Americans
200 million households by 2020 we set
this goal so that America in 2020 would
have the largest market in the world for
high-speed broadband now we've made
significant progress toward that goal
but we need to get faster sooner many of
today's services already depend or
thrive at those speeds videoconferencing
and cloud services for example
particularly when there are multiple
users in a home or business without a
mass market to consume those services in
the u.s. we risk innovators startups and
established companies looking elsewhere
now third we need to make sure that even
the hardest to reach areas of our
country in the least advantaged among us
share in the benefits of broadband as
each new wave of applications moves from
novelty to necessity all Americans
should have access to a network that
provides a baseline of service
sufficient to connect them to our modern
economy and to education healthcare and
public safety resources and forth we
need to build on our global lead and the
deployment of 4G wireless networks and
keep pushing to make sure we're the
first in 5g and beyond
not only is this vital to meet the
nation's exploding mobile broadband
demand but it's the only way we'll
remain a world leader in mobile
innovation we have our work cut out for
us and despite America's broadband
resurgence here are a few key reasons we
can't let up consider the evolution of
competition driven upgrades to our
wireline networks over the past two
decades we've gone from docsis to DSL
and more we need the upgrade cycle to
continue which raises important
questions who will push the next round
of upgrades and when how can we ensure
that we see the network upgrades our
innovation economy needs now despite the
significant improvements in US broadband
infrastructure the average speeds that
Americans actually use appear to lag
those in some other countries including
Korea and Japan so whether it's because
higher speed services here are more
expensive or for other reasons Americans
aren't adopting high-speed services as
fast as some of our global competitors
and roughly thirty percent of Americans
are still not connected to home
broadband at all in mobile we face
additional challenges us mobile data
traffic grew almost three hundred
percent last year and driven by 4G LTE
smartphones and tablets traffic is
projected to grow an additional 16 fold
by 2016 with this exponential growth
demand for our wireless capacity is on
pace to exceed supply even with
significant new spectrum coming online
congested networks are slower networks
so what can our country due to meet
these challenges to have a strategic
broad bandwidth advantage we must drive
massive private investment in both
networks and applications a virtuous
cycle where innovative applications
drive user demand for bandwidth which
generates returns and incentives for
network providers to invest in speed
capacity in ubiquity which in turn
enables further innovation more demand
more network investment non we go some
say government has no role to play here
government should just eliminate
existing rules and policies on its way
out the door now someone who spent more
than a decade in the private sector and
believes fundamental
in the power of the free market I
disagree with that view we don't have to
choose between having broadband policies
that drive global leadership and
believing in a free market it's a false
choice a smart broadband policy puts a
well-functioning free market with
healthy competition as a core objective
government has a role to play limited
but vital light touch not no touch when
it comes to promoting fast high-capacity
and ubiquitous broadband networks there
are three key areas where the FCC should
act first we need to keep driving
improvements in broadband infrastructure
and accessibility we need to continue
removing barriers to broadband build-out
lowering the cost of infrastructure
deployment spectrum which the FCC
manages is our invisible infrastructure
and we need to address the spectrum
crunch both by unleashing more airwaves
for broadband and significantly
increasing the efficiency of spectrum
use by moving forward on sharing and
small cell technologies we're also
moving forward with a major policy
innovation called incentive options to
move spectrum from over the air
broadcasting to mobile broadband these
are all parts of the solution and parts
of what government needs to do and we
need to continue to implement programs
like the connect America fund and
broadband adoption efforts for
low-income Americans that will help
ensure that no one is cut off from the
broadband economy wherever they live
second we need to protect and promote
competition competition is the lifeblood
of our free market economy driving
private investment innovation and
consumer value the more competition the
less need for regulation we know from
decades of experience that when it comes
to competition in the communications
sector the FCC needs to be a cop on the
beat this means continuing to fairly and
rigorously review all transactions that
come before us distinguishing between
efficiency enhancing deals that serve
the public interest and should be
approved without issue and those that
threaten harm to competition and
consumers it means an obligation to
consider all options divestitures
blocking deals and imposing conditions
and it means vigorously enforcing can
Shinzon transaction so companies can't
flout or work around their obligations
it means that when the data shows that
our rules no longer reflect the
competitive landscape or art serving
their intended purpose we need to be
willing to take a fresh look based on
the best data about the state of the
market and act to preserve competition
promoting competition also means we need
to keep a close eye on developments and
places like Kansas City to see what
additional steps federal state and local
governments can take to encourage
game-changing investments by disruptive
new broadband competitors we need to
increase transparency which helps make
markets work more efficiently and
although there isn't unanimous agreement
on this point another as I've mentioned
at the FCC protecting competitions
sometimes means putting rules in place
to prevent anti-competitive practices
rules we adopted last year by majority
vote to ensure broadband data roaming is
one example now of course government
bodies including state and local
agencies must do their part to
encouraging competition and innovation
and certainly not erecting roadblocks
there's a debate right now in the news
here in Washington DC on rules that
could discourage the innovative
on-demand carves car service company
uber not hard to guess which side I'm on
I'm on the side of innovation to be
clear competition is vital throughout
the broadband economy not just for
communications networks but the
Commission focuses primarily on these
networks that's where I focused my
remarks and third and related we need to
preserve open platforms it's the
Internet's openness and freedom the
ability to speak innovate and engage in
commerce and free enterprise without
having to ask for anyone's permission
that's enabled it's unparalleled success
it's why we adopted common-sense rules
of the road to preserve a free and open
Internet and to foster the virtuous
cycle of massive investment in both edge
and the core of broadband networks these
rules which we adopted two years ago had
increased certainty and predictability
for innovators and investors throughout
the space and in fact in the two years
since the FCC adopted
our open internet framework investment
has increased innovation has increased
throughout the broadband economy at the
edge and at the core we're also fighting
to protect the Internet as an engine of
innovation and free expression
internationally in the context of un
negotiations which will come to a head
at the end of this year some countries
are proposing to fundamentally change
the way the internet works and impose a
new layer of international control on
the free flow of information and data
online these kinds of growth killing
proposals must be rejected so yes we've
made a ton of progress in the United
States but the threats and challenges
are very real we can't be satisfied with
where we are we have to keep focusing on
speed capacity and ubiquity and take the
necessary steps to ensure a strategic
bandwidth advantage for the u.s. in the
21st century we have to keep looking
over our shoulders at what other parts
of the world are doing and keep asking
ourselves the big questions like is our
broadband infrastructure providing a
strategic bandwidth advantage are we
winning the global bandwidth race are we
delivering to the country broadband
performance that's the envy of the world
if we keep the pedal to the floor
including through smart government
policies we can ensure we have the
innovation infrastructure we need to
preserve and extend US leadership in the
global broadband economy in that world
we all win broadband applications and
service companies broadband network
companies our economy and all consumers
working together we can do this thang
this is the transition this is the
transition so for those of you who are
watching the livestream bear with us for
probably no more than 90 seconds or so
while we make a quick stage transition
here and we'll be right back
welcome
the live stream so we only have a short
period of time but we wanted to make
sure that we got to some questions I'll
ask something and then nila is going to
ask questions that came directly from
the audience at the verge the WV verge
calm if you want to follow along
chairman thank you your speech and
vision for broadband and our policy in
America is inspired and as I think you
know coming here you're you're preaching
not only to the converted but to the
rapidly converted and so we want to help
and I think most of the people who are
watching on the stream want to help as
well it's an election year it's one of
those few opportunities that we as
citizens have to make a big difference
with our vote and our other actions what
what we're trying to figure out is at
least from my perspective I hear what
you're saying and I think gosh it's
great for all Americans and you know
whether you're a Republican or a
Democrat your interest is growing our
economy and putting people to work and
taking a leadership position in a growth
area so my question is for you is who's
against it and and and what do we do
that helped persuade those who are
against it I'll call them the bad people
to Brandon to frame it in a negative but
what what can we do as citizens who
believe in this to to advance this
agenda well let me the first point I'd
make is that I think the largest enemy
is indifference it's not believing that
issues around our broadband
infrastructure really matter to our
economy to education to healthcare and
indifference is an insidious enemy how
do you combat indifference don't be
indifferent and what does that mean I
mean it what it means get engaged one of
the things that I'm proud that we did at
the FCC was we really opened it up to
input from people wherever they are
right in the old days if you wanted to
have input at the FCC yet to hire a
lawyer have them write down some stuff
on a filing file it and someone would
read it maybe
everything we do now is live online
every one on the outside can have input
into our proceedings people can have
input as individuals whether they're
innovators whether there are people at
universities etc they can do it as
individuals or they can band together as
people do and say hey we have a view
that stuff matters the other thing I'd
say is ideas matter and we've got some
great ideas over the last few years from
people on the outside who use the
channel to say hey listen you've been
talking about this problem you know you
want to see more innovation hubs in the
US well why don't you think about this
so be engaged and combat in difference
is I think my main message yeah as some
questions from our audience yeah and I
know they another didn't pull any
punches they did not like the the the
the number one question we've gotten and
you know the iphone 5 just came out it's
big deal along with that Apple released
iOS 6 which the first time enables you
to make facetime calls over cellular now
the only major restriction on mobile
carriers with your open Internet rules
is that they're not allowed to block
other voice and video calling services
but 18t has blocked FaceTime on iOS 6
based on over cellular in Iowa sex
unless you get a new plan and the
readers they all want to know I mean do
you think this is a violation of your
opening that rules is they found a
loophole what's your take well this is
you know we're going to continue to have
disputes and issues that arise under
open Internet framework this is one that
could very well come before us in a
formal way so I shouldn't comment on
specifically I think there are reports
that there may be a formal complaint
filed but let me let me make a couple of
general points one is the best way to
resolve disputes over how the internet
should continue to roll out is through
discussion and multi-stakeholder forums
and trying to do the thing that the
Internet has done many times many very
successfully we adopted the open
rules because that doesn't always lead
to success and sometimes good faith
efforts don't resolve things many times
they do sometimes they don't I encourage
that process if it doesn't lead to a
resolution and a complaint is filed we
will exercise their responsibilities and
we will act does that mean do you are
you okay with a teensy blocking as I
said it may come before us is something
we have to make a decision we have
obligations to make decisions on a
record based on input on all the facts
so so I just can't comment on a specific
on a specific thing but we're going to
do our job as we proven in the past and
other situations where complaints have
come before us and we've resolved them
and we've made the tough decisions sure
okay so the next few questions for our
readers it's actually two questions I
think it is really one question I think
it's really interesting so this one is
from see West fuh this is let me ask the
questions first does the FCC intend to
start making progress and requiring
network interoperability seamless
roaming and devices it can be in lot to
work in any carrier the second part of
the question is from greasy taco
aficionado who is one of our one of our
best commenters actually how our apples
competitor is supposed to compete when
competitors don't allow them to sell the
same phone design on multiple carriers
there by not getting the brand
recognition and economies of scale that
go along with selling more of a single
phone so a a couple points one is you
know what we've seen in the mobile
marketplace in the last four years is
probably unlike any business revolution
any consumer and business revolution
that we've ever seen you know in four
years to go from a world of the feature
phones we used to have two iphones and
android phones and two tablets like it's
just amazing making sure that you know
in this world we also keep our eye on a
couple of balls competition and
consumers is important and so issues
like interoperability are issues that we
look at there is an issue with some
competing mobile carriers not being able
to
to access devices now that issue is less
of an issue than it was when the iphone
was first introduced and you can get the
iphone on more and more carriers now
another issue that we certainly pay
attention to and that we acted on is
broadband data roaming so just a very
quick story here you know we've there
was a an issue that came up in the
preborn in the voice era about whether
consumers had a right to expect that
their phones would be able to roam on
other networks this is really important
for competition because consumers don't
want phones that only work some places
and not other places and there are many
challenges to having multiple providers
build out infrastructure everywhere so
voice roaming rules were in place but
when I got to the FCC data roaming rules
were not and we took that up and we
looked at it as any online it's really
the same issue consumers expect national
roaming not all competitors can have the
infrastructure and we need to adopt
these rules to make sure there's
broadband data roaming for competitors
and consumers I don't understand to this
day why that wasn't a unanimous vote but
it wasn't and we have to keep on working
hard to explain why it's needed why it's
an appropriate role for government how
it fosters competition protects
consumers and ultimately drives the
innovation and investment that comes
from a competitive market so just to
follow up on this from my perspective it
seems like having slightly more
regulation on the network side of things
enables an enormous amount of
competition on the devices and services
side and that's our company that's this
device do you share that for you I mean
do you think there's a room for kind of
more regulation the interoperability
standards setting side sort of on the
network layer well you know we've been
very focused on exactly the point that
you're raising which is how do we ensure
this vibrant internet-based innovation
that we've seen and there's just no
question it's really not disputable that
the open nature of the internet has just
played a critical role like you know I
watched this company as it was founded
and so so yes you know sometimes
government has to act to preserve
platforms for innovation that's what the
open Internet net neutrality debate was
all about doing it in a smart
market-oriented way that recognizes the
realities of the marketplace the fact
that we really want an open platform for
innovators and we also really want
robust fast networks that require
capital investment it drives you to
policy solutions that recognize the
importance of both one of the things I'm
proud of is that we were able to do the
open Internet rules in a way that and
you know the facts just proved this out
over the last two years have contributed
to this virtual cycle more innovation
more demand for consumers more incentive
for network companies to invest in wired
and wireless infrastructure faster
speeds more innovation part of what I'm
saying today is that's a great cycle we
need to speed it up even more we need
more speed more capacity and we need to
get to ubiquity well I think our time is
unfortunately coming to a close but
thank you thank you for your leadership
thank you for your service thank you for
coming here today to share this plan
with us and I think we all hear the
message loud and clear that we have to
become active if this vision is really
going to continue and we can't take for
granted foundation that companies like
vox media and so many other great
american companies have been built upon
so we will fight we'll work together to
get it done for those of you who are
watching the livestream obviously go to
FCC gov to get involved to learn more
about what chairman Genachowski is
working on and how you can become
informed and part of the broadband
initiatives here and of course please
come to the verge calm where Neil I and
his Merry group of commenters will lo so
engaged in a lively discussion thank you
everyone who attended thank you everyone
who is on the stream have a great debt
