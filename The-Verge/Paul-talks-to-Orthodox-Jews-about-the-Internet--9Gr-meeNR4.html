mostly you know by its rules everybody's
wearing a black hat and a black coat or
you know you can't do certain things on
the Sabbath but they also have a lot of
reasoning behind those rules and a lot
of thought about how we live our lives
and part of everybody's lives now is the
internet and so I'm out of rally here to
just to talk about the internet theres
forty-two thousand people gathered here
in citi field and obviously the internet
needs a lot to me because i'm spending a
year without it I'm just trying to try
to understand and that's as far as I can
tell what these guys are doing so just
see what I learned internetting it
really distracting and I was saying you
know we so that's why you now we human
beings God created us with different
things that we can't always trust
ourselves to control ourselves you know
I'm saying people unfortunately are not
can't trust themselves to control
themselves and on everything in life so
that's why we feel very comfortable
people we trust to watch us and help
protect us serve God the right way so we
can do what we got to do while we're
here I will do it together
extra-strength this is about how the
technology affects our children okay and
the future for generations to affect out
to the open world how the Orthodox
community
looks at that okay that's what this
event is about I don't do this I don't
work right now we understand we have a
parents and other people our friends and
other than this they do have it and do
it supposed to work and it's hard to
work without that whoever had it and it
needed it should be correctly for him
and that's why the laburnum will say and
guide us the real way that he sees what
it's doing to him and he's talking about
me right he's fully aware of the
advantages he's a he's a certified car
carrying teching but he also realizes
what he's losing out because of the
internet and he's kicking the habit for
a year and of course he's going to be
blogging but he's not blogging about it
but he's going to be posting on the
verge calm website his exploits and how
he's surviving but you know the last I
checked Paul Miller is not it an
Orthodox Jew might not be Jewish at all
Oh Miller's right here wow this is
unbeliev I would really love to talk to
you this is not a setup it was really
really played really well thank you i'm
dodgin Orthodox Jew though what we're
looking to do here really is you know
making a cost-benefit analysis saying
our social networking sites are they
undermining my sense of human dignity of
privacy are they pandering to my worst
instincts when I get on the comment
section of a blog of a website are they
turning me into something that I don't
realize after i finish furiously typing
off my latest furious creed that what
anything and everything these are basic
human values these are things that a
secular humanists should be able to
immediately relate to you know the
bottom line is that we're fully
cognizant and we welcome the blessings
of technology into our lives the way
that it saves lives lengthens lives and
makes our lives more convenient but
again I come back to that theme of
cost-benefit analysis
can you encourage me in any way you got
yourself a library card did you not by
the way I found it fascinating that on
the first first comment string after
after you announced it it devolved into
a whole long lengthy discussion of
theology guys going back and forth
Christians atheists etc etc I found it
fascinating how you accomplished
something you got eight you got a
serious conversation on theology started
by people who normally wouldn't come
within wouldn't touch that stuff with a
ten-foot pole i just spent you know just
the unintended effects of what you've
done and the courage what you've done
you know we're really fascinating to me
but again any yeah i mean just stop and
smell the flowers I mean really just use
the opportunity of this year to do the
basic human things to take hold of the
basic human joys of life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
