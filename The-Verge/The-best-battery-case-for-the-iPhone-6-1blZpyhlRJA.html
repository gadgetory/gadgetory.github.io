it's only 3 p.m. in the afternoon and
your iPhone's down to 10% battery left
wondering if that's going to make it
through the rest of the day can really
make you sweat the iPhone 6 doesn't let
you swap out batteries when it dies but
not all hope is lost you just need a
case that provides extra battery life
and protection when you need it
you may have heard people refer to these
cases as Moe fees and that's because
Mophie was the first brand to really
make them popular another a ton of
different options available for the
iPhone and if you want the best option
for your iPhone 6 we recommend the
incipio awkward Express it's got lots of
battery capacity so you can charge your
phone completely from dead and then some
it's slimmer and lighter than
competitors and it's easy to remove from
your phone when you don't need the extra
bulk or battery it's also less expensive
than some of the other cases we tested
here's how virtually all of these
battery cases work you slide or snap
your iPhone into the case which will
then have a button or switch to turn on
its battery feature once you turn it on
the cases battery will then recharge
your iPhone's battery The awkward
Express can recharge the iPhone 6's
battery from zero to full and then a
little more for most people that means
being able to go up to 2 days away from
a power outlet
once the awkward is depleted you plug it
in just like you would your phone to
charge it back up the advantages of a
battery case like the off-grid Express
are pretty obvious you don't have to
stop to plug in your phone to an outlet
you don't even have to stop what you're
doing just flick the case on your
battery is low and keep on going like
you normally would
and since it's a case it can protect
your phone from damage at the same time
some cases like the uno DX 6 have
cutouts for the volume rockers and power
buttons that can make it hard to reach
those buttons but our choice uses
pass-through buttons that are much
easier to activate especially if you
have large fingers or gloves on remember
that Mophie I mentioned earlier Mophie
does make a few cases for the iPhone 6
and they're actually quite nice they hit
all the marks we're looking for large
battery capacity nice buttons ease of
removal they're also really well built
kind of like the Cadillac of battery
cases but they're also priced like a
Cadillac and Mophie Juice Pack plus for
the iPhone 6 that we tested is
considerably more expensive than the
incipio without offering a significantly
different experience now there are some
annoyances when you're using a battery
case most obvious one is that it makes
your iPhone a lot thicker and
considerably heavier options like the
Boost case make your phone more than
twice as thick as it would be without
the case but a good case like our pick
lets you take your phone out easily so
you only need to bulk up when you're
actively charging your phone or know
that you won't be near an outlet for a
long time there are other options like
OtterBox Azure surgeons which provides a
lot of protection from drops and damage
but it's really hard to remove from your
phone the other annoying part is that
every battery case on the market covers
up the iPhones headphone
Jack and lightning port for your
headphones the cases provide a pastor
and most will accept Apple standard ear
pods with it but if you're using a
different set of headphones you'll
likely have to use an adapter which
comes supplied with every case we looked
at or you could just go wireless with
Bluetooth headphones and avoid the issue
entirely for charging and syncing with
your computer you'll have to use a micro
USB cable with most cases meaning your
stash of lightning cables won't do much
good anymore getting stranded with a
dead iPhone can not only be annoying it
can be a legitimate safety concern but
with a battery case like in scipios
awkward express you don't have to worry
about being away from a wall outlet all
day long
