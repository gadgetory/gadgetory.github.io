one
well Microsoft went ahead and redesigned
its flagship game console this is the
new Xbox 1's
as you can see there are few things new
with its design it's 40% smaller than
the previous Xbox one making it the
smallest Xbox yet and it really does
look way smaller than its predecessor
and as you probably already notice it's
white Xbox called it robot white and it
looks really nice and hopefully you
won't say all that dust gathering a top
of your console like you usually do on
glossy black surfaces a few of the
components of the moved around in this
new redesigned - there's a USB port now
on the front as well as a pairing button
for your controller and for Nilay Patel
is a new built-in IR blaster as well the
console also comes with a slightly
redesigned controller it mostly looks
the same but has a really nice textured
back that makes it pretty grippy and the
thumb sticks have been redesigned to be
a bit more precise it also now supports
Bluetooth which means you'll get better
range and you can also use it wirelessly
with your PC but enough about the design
the Xbox one also has some new features
under its white hood it now supports HDR
for both gaming and media playback and
4k Ultra HD for media playback and
blu-ray and finally maybe my favorite
feature Microsoft got rid of the
enormous power brick and now all you
need is this cable right here the Xbox
1s will be available in three different
SKUs when it launches this summer will
be a standard 500 gigabyte version for
$2.99 a one terabyte version for 349 and
starting in August will be a special
limited launch edition with two
terabytes of storage for 399 overall the
new design is pretty close to other
console refreshes we've seen in the past
things like the slinky s2 or the DS Lite
it takes what was previously pretty
functional but not especially attractive
piece of hardware and it makes it into
something you'd actually want to put in
your entertainment unit and because it's
so much smaller and now that you can
display it vertically you'll have a lot
more options for where you put it of
course the new Xbox one will still be
compatible with all your old Xbox one
games and controllers so don't throw
away that expensive elite controller
