he's the editor in chief of formerly Vox
games now now polygon and got a crew of
amazing there's the logo this awesome
logo which I'm really I kind of in love
with oh so how did you get this name
this is incredible so oh my god calm yes
you would think that there would be no
chance of anybody ever getting that um
we had to fire me so so we had the team
like you said and uh we got a bunch of
editors together and thought what would
make a great gaming such an amazing team
I mean this team is like I mean I know
it's a team you may not know all these
people by name but you should this is
like a such a super group of gaming
journalists and we're still hiring still
hiring John there's job postings on the
sound postings in psycho um so we're
talking about names we come up with
polygons pretty early i think was
actually just a mac Roy on I and we
starting about what other what other
names if we can't get polygons so we
start by suing I was actually in one of
these you guess we're having like skype
conversations with fantasy backgrounds
and like a robot will go by and but
you're having you guys were having in
the office one day you're having like a
skype conversation you were like
brainstorming yeah we brainstorm yeah
you have a you had a lot of different
ideas for names yeah so and you brought
some slides yeah so we thought we'd
share if you guys didn't say we should
sum these up packs what some of our
names some of our potential names yes
these are these are just so you
understand it was there was a period
where didn't look like you could get
polygons we were we were hand and you're
like let's we got to think of something
else here are some this this could be
the name yeah and and and we're gonna
take you on a walk through them here we
go
it's the first one rag doll that's right
doll yeah so right dolla is this this is
an album cover what is this no so we did
some concept art you know pick some of
the names we have sun dresses like
linkin park this is like it's angie limp
biscuit biscuit yeah that's good the
huddle of mud and we thought puddle mudd
fans like what dolls yeah until you
Shayne Clown Posse this is sort of
insane clown posse's got some juggalo
going on yeah um it's got a clown so uh
rag doll clothes rag dolling the rag
doll does net maybe I was super
disturbing for the next thing I what was
the thinking behind rag doll like what
uh we it was we had a I don't know 200
names on a white be like it's it it's a
thing it's a thing it'll blame people
did play with it at one point yeah now
just terrified right doll physics right
in games you got trials you know you go
floppy right right next slide creepy dia
we played a lot I don't understand we
played a lot of super crate box that's
the only about is it what is this is an
iOS game yeah thought you were talking
about before I this looks really good I
gotta play this yeah alright crate crate
a PD accrete pedia we weren't sure like
a shame for crate yeah and the whole
site design we pitch it to Bank off at
vox media he said wait a second you can
make Wikipedia for one game and we said
sorry for wasting your time sir all
right what's it what's the next one
gamer nista gamer nice one of my
favorites it's edgy uh you know you're
thinking like revolution what's
revolutionary it's like you know
throwing a Molotov cocktail at the game
industry right yeah blow it up so like
what like bird sand and Eastern gamers
he's alive yeah huh so we would I don't
know you have like a you have a theme
you know you wear masks like that aren't
you you watch out for this yeah and they
want great use of a phone box up some
good stuff pirates what we got was the
next time sprites so I think you can see
the branding opportunity great great
branding opportunity it's not it's not a
it's a short walk to Paradise really
yeah and uh come check out the right cos
dry internet website video games also
drinks from the disp right own sprites
calm ah it's parked these were all parts
find out this was all check it out guys
have used it on the air are you happy
now let's see who let's see sprite
calm yeah it was a it was a great
opportunity to pursue is it can have the
girl going to college maybe oh it's like
a part where you go she's checking the
internet you guys either that's how you
know it's a good sites like we did
Donald something better with this by the
way they want 1 million dollars for this
here's a crazy thing why doesn't sprite
by it and make a new line sprite called
sprites and write multiple sprites yes
all right what's the next one just buy
one object it was a personal favorite
because it's like what isn't an object
that they're all object it's an object
yeah I I object that's the problems
objects objects should Phoenix Wright
fansite think about it phoenix wright
you know the objection no you don't
everyone else gets it right yeah it's
tough and I yeah all right I got it I
got it next one screenplay screen
flashes my I get it you play on a screen
yeah yep although it's a thing that uh
then I met feel more calm and
use so it is a thing that's you hit used
to make a movie it's tricky yeah alright
what else do we have oh this is good
game routine this is it this one's
confusing I'm confused that is a poster
of the libertines starring Johnny Depp
yeah that's living it up and and that is
Ovaltine yeah we you you tweet but
you've done some editing some and it's
creative adjustment yeah we couldn't
determine is it without his most is the
site about you know it's crazy sex is it
about a kids drink or is it a
combination of the two good book so I
think it I think you're getting to the
right point yeah okay those guys that
wear diapers the only way they can get
it going you where you really really
went there I think it's good else what
else we have mesh mesh com we have a
picture of a guy in a mesh shirt it
could be girly woman you know this is
it's it's unisex it's like edgy is that
actually what mash is is it like a mesh
clothes inside uh no its parking these
are all park it's all available so you
guys living wonders idea what you have
to buy them yeah another free so guys or
girls mesh com that's out there alright
whatever else way I think about it this
is a classic ap Eragon
so we I don't understand you couldn't
get a polygon what other kinds of guns
are there Oh what is it ain't what it
I'm not a gun here Oh God you might know
like dodecahedron like that sighs I'm
done that's how God but so APR gun isn't
infinite uh polygon was like no ends but
it's countable I don't know it's a
matter did you consider infinite polygon
cuz that's not bad that's not bad huh
that's a lot of letters know Sierra go
nice and short easy to spot I don't know
not actually either who's all right well
as you have entered Gaiman uh I think
it's pretty good I like this what is
this brandon is that if first time is
that the warp from the beginning of Star
Trek when it when it zooms i feels a guy
for mega 64 at the mega 64 guy what is
it what's the what's the day I gotta
work you don't feel ya feelin enter Game
it easy to spell over the phone ENT all
the letters sound the same oh yeah it's
got some clever wordplay enter game game
game ins it sounds like entertainment
get it now that you made me the
necessary I'm all what else through and
this is this was actually not but Vox
Games this we use Fox games but our
unofficial mascot and potential URL
panda suplex panda suplex comments
available what's incredible about about
panda suplex we had our commanders off
it's available oh it wasn't taking
somehow uh what's incredible man the
suplexes it's uh you did the art of a
it's the pandas doing the move yeah if
you actually google pen suplex you find
a lot of animated gifts append as soup
Lessing each other which is amazing I
recommend you do it really yeah no I'm
kidding here's the best part though that
guy isn't suplexing the Panda cuz you
think pants you're too but you're doing
uh yeah the pandas suplexing no I think
of it as a move the Panda soon with that
hand asleep I think so a panda could do
it or a human might learn how to do it
from from a panda maybe being a raised
by pandas raised by pandas hmm how did
you win all those wrestling matches I
learned the pan to suplex Wow yeah
there's a there's this opportunity
there's a touching fanfic here he's just
done I think that's at it so there's
some other names i think i think polygon
was ultimately a better we have an idea
though he really you've slides roll
they're great that's wonderful i wish i
could've been there for the bed
process i'm glad that i have this sorry
was going to close that well to what's
right too much i had lyrics to rag doll
up by the way I wanted to not gonna go
through now okay busy opportunity
alright so let's just talk a little bit
about gaming news and then we're gonna
do something very fun you wanted to talk
about the steam box yeah we reported on
this is valve as you know we've heard
creating some kind of console and I
talked to you when we had some info I
ran it by your like this kind of make
sense with what I've heard explain to me
why or how valve might want to create
something the fountain is a lot lately
there was of course the the rumor that
Tim Cook's stop by valve HQ which is a
huge lie yeah apparently it's just a
giant like Gabe Newell said it didn't
never happen but um they say no to it
they say a lot of things aren't
happening it's true I don't know who
knows so this is actually this is a
picture from from valves website
promoting big picture mode which they
announced in February 2011 the idea is
heading to living room or anywhere
there's a big screen this team soon to
be released this was 13 months ago for
ya oh yeah offering simple easy to read
navigation design specificity it's
esteem in your living room like you know
if you're playing it on your TV on your
console but how does that work you have
a gigantic like gaming keyboard and like
a 20 button mouse so they announced this
one of those like TV dinner things yeah
on a track that you won't as an idol
move by the way I'm in a phantom lap
board yeah that's good time this convey
/ where so I'm they actually releasing
you're gonna care not the Phantom lap
board uh so this is a little say they've
been talking about big picture mode for
a while and it stands to reason that
they've talked to hardware manufacturers
about helping us because you're not
going to hook up a giant water cooled
gaming PC to your television you're not
well good point Touche um right over
here on the side is actually a giant
water cooled you can see it off it just
panels like as as tall the tell it's got
a lot of blue LEDs am fan is so loud uh
so they've been think about this a lot
how to get the living room and sends the
reason that they've been thinking about
concept hardware I'm somewhat Intel
builds an ultrabook they don't actually
sell you an ultrabook somebody else does
the right help designs aspects and you
and we were talking about this in years
like if valves going to do it it's going
to be you think maybe a spec kind of and
I we said this in our article like
Android it'll be like here's our stuff
like here's the system basically go put
it on your box and you even you know we
talked about alienware they made this
what is the name of yacht x 51 x 51
which is looks like you know the xbox
and the ps3 made love to one another and
gave birth to a large child it really
doesn't get this hybrid of those two
things isn't it yeah it looks like a
console it's very clearly designed to be
a console to hdmi hookups it's got slot
loading drive i mean you know here
alienware is making a gaming console and
one has to assume that alienware being
one of the biggest gaming pc
manufacturers that valve is talk to them
about big picture mode right you know
there's this idea that pc gaming will
come to the TV well come to the living
room I think you're seeing alien where's
maybe a little early here I'm assuming
other pc companies have some games boxes
and then when seemed a picture modes
official maybe it'll be an official
steam authorized so you think this might
happen I think valve is means already
happen you can go buy this right now but
something more more of like an idea like
because they've also worked on gaming
like controllers and weird these years
one of their patents yeah you could swap
out different types of sticks yep
whatever so if I'll has been thinking
about this a lot you know how do you get
pc gaming on to the console I mean
they're obviously thinking about
hardware why would they patent this yeah
I mean in the hardware is a big part I
don't think here's the difference I
don't think valve has any interest in
making hard world no but they might have
interest in design I they very much want
to divide by the speculum ache this
