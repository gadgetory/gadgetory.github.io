you were looking at the all new youtube
app for the iPhone this should work on
iOS 5 some versions of iOS four and
presumably iOS 6 which is fitting
because both Google and Apple said about
a month ago that YouTube would not be
included in iOS 6 out of the box so
Google needed to make this new version
of the app now this version of the app
it's very fast it's completely native
it's not just a webview and it uses the
same interface as Google+ basically
there's this column over here on the
left-hand side that you can tap into and
it shows you all the channels that you
subscribe to it shows your own settings
and you know your own account and some
other bits there it's quite a change
from the original YouTube app on iOS
which had the traditional iPhone layout
with the buttons down at the bottom
instead of that left hand rail Google's
also added new sharing options they've
added the ability to see some Google
Play content and they've also added some
advanced search so it will do a
predictive search as you type it'll also
do voice search and you can also tap on
those little arrows there to give
yourself a look at other search options
and here it is against the Android
version as it as you can see they took a
lot from that it's basically the same
looking app with just a couple of iowa
specific customizations</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
