a serious question thousands of people
die from the flu every year and
scientists are getting more creative
about preventing those deaths one new
solution go after a different part of
the virus the flu virus has proteins on
its surface which are shaped like
lollipops
they've got big complex heads atop
skinny little stems most vaccines target
variations in the head but those vary
widely now researchers are looking at
ways to target the stem or at least
parts of it which don't very nearly as
much if the new approach works it would
give us a single shot that trains your
immune systems take down every kind of
flu the flu vaccine might be like the
ones we use for measles and mumps a
single shot once every few years that
prevents against bird flu swine flu
everything there are similar vaccination
projects for diseases as diverse as
Ebola dengue chikungunya they're even
making vaccines for certain kinds of
cancer we're getting smarter about
pumping up our own immune systems to
fight off illnesses and it could have
major implications for the way these
diseases work in the future we're also
getting better at spotting diseases
early and doing something about it
groups like the CDC and the w-h-o have a
lot more information than they did in
the pre electronic age that can make a
huge difference when you're trying to
stop an outbreak it's not all good news
though
at the same time that vaccines and
surveillance are getting better
antibiotics are getting worse a basic
broad-spectrum antibiotic only lasts
until the bacteria evolve defenses
against it what we usually do at that
point is just roll out a new kind of
antibiotic which buys a little more time
but right now our development pipeline
is whirring the empty there are already
strains of gonorrhea staph Anantara
coccus that don't respond to most of our
antibiotics and honestly that's just the
beginning
what's worse we're giving huge doses of
antibiotics to animals that aren't even
sick that gives the bacteria more
opportunities to mutate this leaves us
with kind of a weird future stronger
vaccines may mean flu season packs less
of a punch but without antibiotics even
minor cuts can have fatal consequences
while we might be able to prevent some
illnesses with vaccines there aren't
enough to supply the kind of protection
we need to
armed complex surgeries and medical
devices as basic as catheters could be
death sentences for want of an
antibiotic better vaccines are really
good news but unless we do something
about our antibiotic situation our
future is going to be a lot sicker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
