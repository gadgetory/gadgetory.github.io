I am riding a childhood dream literally
the Rhino one wheeled motorcycle can be
traced back to the moment when Chris
Hoffman's daughter asked if he could
build something just like what she saw
in an anime cartoon a few years later
the Rhino is now reality and since its
street legal
yesterday we took one for a spin on the
mean streets of Brooklyn the Rhino uses
gyroscopes and accelerometers to balance
and drive I've tried to learn how to
ride a motorcycle before and I found the
Rhino is actually easier and more
intuitive you sit down lean into it and
you're off getting comfortable takes a
little while and turning was way too
advanced for my 20-minute lesson but I
was still able to have lots of fun
zipping back and forth on my motorized
unicycle
the Rhino is a beautiful machine with
the slick lines and mechanical vigour of
a sports car or high-performance crotch
rocket
while it is street-legal the Rhino only
has a top speed of 10 miles an hour and
a range of 10 miles on a full battery
still it could work for some urban
commuters unfortunately the Rhino itself
weighs about 160 pounds meaning the
subway stairs are out of the picture and
with a price tag of over 5 grand it's
significantly more expensive than
comparable electric vehicles we saw at
this year's CES the Rhino seems like the
kind of thing you would splurge on if
style was your thing
it's definitely alluring what we were
testing it a half-dozen people stopped
by to gawk take pictures and ask about
the bike riding it is a unique and
enjoyable experience one I'm sure would
get better with a little more time spent
learning how to operate it it's not the
most practical or economical Evo I've
been on recently but it's not trying to
be the Rhino is more about taking a
crazy dream making it come to life
