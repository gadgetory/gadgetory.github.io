here at toy fair 2014 with a nerf can
see s12 blaster since time immemorial
people have been putting cameras on the
guns real and plastic so now nerf has
actually just built this camera right
into the blaster
the nerf cams major feature is obviously
the record button right here the blaster
is equipped with a fairly low resolution
point three megapixel camera for video
and stills and the microphone next to
the screen can record your color
commentary the camera records to a 4
gigabyte video card and some minimalist
controls that you cycle through what
you've got and delete the outtakes of
course you can also just take out the
card and do all this on the computer the
blaster works with other magazines from
nurse and strike line but by default it
holds 12 darts and runs on two double-a
batteries which power both the camera
and a motorized shooting system people
are already attaching cameras to their
blasters and nerf actually makes an
official mount for your iphone but this
is built right in and won't weigh it
down it's actually an idea we're
surprised we haven't seen sooner
for those of us who haven't used
anything from nerf in a while it's kind
of like seeing a replay of your last
death and a first-person shooter except
that you're the one behind the sights
what we're looking at right now is a
prototype which means not only are there
some bugs to be worked out the controls
are frankly kind of confusing but
presumably by the time it comes out this
fall though the least put labels on them
which will help justify the roughly
eighty dollar price tag
