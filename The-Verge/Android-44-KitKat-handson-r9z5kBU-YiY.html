looking at android 4.4 kitkat on the new
Nexus 5 as you can see there's been a
handful of different design tweaks
including the translucent menu bar and a
little animation when you go in and view
the apps it's a little bit like iOS 7
but not as big of an extreme change as
iOS 7 was for Apple one of the changes
is going to be to the dialer and it
operates a lot like the Yellow Pages now
so instead of just having your contacts
in there you can also search for nearby
restaurants and different places of
interest it'll show you and allow you to
contact directly from the dialer also
Google now is going to be a lot smarter
and it's going to be able to give you
information based on your location as
well as shows you might like and
different sites you might like and it
also directly directly into the app that
you want so Google has combined Google
Hangouts and SMS so they're now one in
the same so by default when you get your
phone there is no messages app however
if you don't like that you can always
download a third-party application and
set that as your default messaging app
but as it stands you're going to be
using hangouts a lot more on android
kitkat
so overall there has been a lot of
changes under the hood essentially it's
going to make the operating system run a
lot better on lower end phones Google
promises updates to the nexus phone and
the Google Play edition soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
