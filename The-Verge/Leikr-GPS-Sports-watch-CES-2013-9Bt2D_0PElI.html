I'm here today with Ryan from Lakers
sports watches they are introducing a
new GPS sports watch that's going up on
Kickstarter and he's here today to take
us through all its features and hardware
so Ryan why don't you show us the
products absolutely so you know we're
really excited to be here to talk about
the product today we're blown away with
the response we've seen so far on
Kickstarter
here I've got one of the first devices
it's the one that you see in the videos
on Kickstarter so here we've got a GPS
fix here in Las Vegas here on you can
see on the two inch display it's a TFT
reflective display so the more like that
actually hits this display the better
you're going to see that we also has
full backlight for our nighttime use so
here we have the six different you know
areas to see different metrics for when
you're working out we have a lot of
response for users that actually want to
customize this they want to have just
one huge display to show their their
heart rate or whatever so we're working
on actually modifying the software to
allow that for future you so you can
customize it to meet your needs this is
the way it's gonna start the default and
we're working hard and diligently on
that software to to get that ready you
know some of the other key features we
have we have this view here so we have
onboard OpenStreetMaps
so here you can see that we're here at
the Las Vegas Convention Center we have
a couple zoom levels that we can go into
and what this allows you to do is pre
map your route that you want to that you
want to follow and then track it while
you're either running orienteering
riding your bike on that long ride from
whatever right on Kickstarter sounds
like you've got some special GPS
technology in here to make it lock on
faster can you absolutely so we have a
lot of experience from being X no key
ins and you know with the GPS so what
we've done is we've done a custom GPS
antenna okay so instead of using kind of
a standard onboard antenna we fine-tuned
and specifically tuned an antenna
outside of the PW
so that it's as finely tuned and gets
that GPS signal as fast as possible
along with that we're using a GPS so
assisted GPS so when you sync it with
your computer it'll pull down the
Almanac for them for the satellites okay
and that just makes getting the the fix
that much faster because it knows
exactly what to look for in the sky and
it has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth also
absolutely so the connectivity overall
is Wi-Fi bluetooth it's gonna be
Bluetooth 4.0 and it's going to be amp
plus so the Wi-Fi and blue and the Wi-Fi
is for connecting with your computer for
syncing with your workout so the
Bluetooth and AM plus is for syncing
with additional accessories okay so we
see this really as you know an enabler
so we're definitely going to be working
to support as many third-party
accessories as possible including heart
rate monitors cadence monitors there's a
there's a huge amount of accessories and
it's mark any partnerships you can talk
about yet or is this all in the early
state this is all in the early stages so
I mean we're definitely working through
that and we're getting a lot of inbound
so we're working through that also but
you know our main concern right now is
is really getting this device out for
the battery and what about the hardware
the physical device itself like you know
is this thing built to withstand you
know some some tumbles or you know falls
off the bike early so the way we
constructed this this front glass this
front area here is Gorilla Glass yep so
it's scratch and shock-resistant just
like your recent cell phone so the the
the resin here is built for durability I
would say it's not built for finish as
far as you know you know a good paint
job or a big coating it's really meant
for durability and long lasting life
great so why don't you tell us a little
bit about how the project started off
like how did you guys get together the
genesis how did this all come together
absolutely so the team started in
Copenhagen so the core team is located
in the copenhagen all of the founders
and members of the team are X Nokia's
so there was you know last year the
copenhagen R&amp;amp;D site was you know
transitioned out so the engineers were
we're looking at what to do
and the founders were you know
enthusiastic triathletes
were always in that space and really
looked and saw that in the sports watch
market the pace of innovation has not
really kept up with cell phone
innovation so we have this innate
experience with the fast pace of cell
phones and understand how to do that at
a very high level and wanted to bring
that to the sports watch market and
cause a disruption in that space and so
how long has this been under development
your Kickstarter started was it last
week yeah it started on Wednesday were
for four or five days okay and so you
tell us a bit about the process that led
up step absolutely so the process
they've been working we've been working
on this product for actually one year so
it's it's really been a long it's been a
long process but really thought through
really thought through the ergonomics
thought through the feature sets the
technology the board is just amazing
it's got hardware for future
expandability with software updates so
we have an accelerometer compass so
which isn't currently enabled but we're
definitely getting back down to one
absolutely so this is geared for future
expandability future software updates
are super easy to do well users will be
able to do that through the online
portal great and you know it's just
gonna have it's going to be you know
deleting the market can you the big
question with most tick stars I think is
the production schedule meeting
deadlines you know we hear a lot about
missed deadlines and yeah things being
late so can you tell us about what your
what your team is working on to make
sure you you know hit your production
schedule absolutely and meet the demand
and when do you think this watch will
make its way into consumer hands perfect
so I think that you know one of the key
parts is that experience with with the
note with Nokia so everyone in the team
has experienced launching products
they've launched products that have sold
over 80 million devices totally so have
a lot of experience we have the best for
each discipline I would say from the
Copenhagen site working on this as far
as the manufacturing the manufacturing
is done locally in Denmark so a short
train ride from the you know from the
home base
that allows for you know making sure
that the production schedule stays on
time making sure that the quality is
high and up to the liger standards which
is very high and you know that you know
those major things I think lead to an
on-time delivery and we're very I would
say we're very we're not trying to be
overly optimistic we think we're very in
realm with what what we can do so we
have you know we have the tooling ready
we it's um you know some slight
modifications that need to happen to get
FCC approval yeah so that's really the
main push here on Kickstarter is to get
that modification and get the FCC
certification and so what's the current
estimate for one it'll be available yeah
so Kurt estimates yeah yeah yeah first
orders for Kickstarter which are going
to be the first orders that ship
globally will be June 2013
great so Ryan cremes with liker thanks
so much for your time absolutely thanks
so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
