take a look at Lumia 610 right here
we've got Lee from rockets tell us about
it this is new phone that Nokia's
launching it aims to be a little bit
cheaper a little bit more affordable for
people and part of that is the updated
version of mango that Microsoft is
released right and it will make it
possible to run the OS on 256 megabytes
of ram and a slower processor in fact
it's an 800 megahertz processor that's
right what sacrifices have you made in
the phone relative to the Lumia 710 no
real sacrifices I mean obviously you
need to be you need to be aware
sensitive to certain issues so we've
turned off some of the background
activity in some of the apps so for
example and SkyDrive you configure to do
a manual updates you can still manually
upload information SkyDrive but turn off
that automatic upgrade because that
requires more power than Cecily in there
but otherwise when you're playing with
it you'll feel the same great experience
it feels just as fast and that was the
key that the key to Microsoft working to
develop this to be the same expense they
weren't willing to just allow lower
specs in there and then actually get a
reduced experience and I think that's
the experience that a lot of people get
you go for more affordable smartphones
all the kind of entry-level smartphones
is they very quickly find that what they
got was a lower experience the idea here
is you've got an introduction to the
lumiere with this fun experience but at
the same kind of performance levels well
I'm still seeing a lot of the UI
animations are still present so you
haven't really trimmed down the UI too
much second save my background horses
yeah peppermint posters that you're
losing out and really I see it has a 5
megapixel camera is this the exact same
one as in gloomy 1110 i'm not sure
that's okay um somebody will you know
open it up tear it down also of notice
the back cover doesn't seem to be
revealed so not removed back cover that
user accessible no
so well that's another watercolors so
we've got it in white black cyan and
magenta okay and you got these shiny
bits all over the side yeah all of them
going to have these glossy elements you
need to use and you can I think that's
going to appeal to you it's true we're
aiming for a younger audience than we
are with some of the other products say
people are coming in may be buying their
first smartphones early looking for an
introduction into the platform trying to
get that the combination of the kind of
quality and aspiration in the design and
look and feel of the product you know no
must feel that they're buying an
affordable flounder and again think
that's one of the compromises people
often feel when they're coming into an
entry-level smartphone the idea here is
you still feel the quality you still get
an aspirational device you still get
that same great experience but a lot
more affordable all right and this will
be available include two as well q 2 4
189 euros before text and subsidy
exactly your estimate retail price any
specific markers you want an ounce or
you know then again we have an
announcement and we leave that to the
countries themselves to actually
announce when they getting ready to roll
out all right thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
