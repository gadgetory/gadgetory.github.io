decades this is the beginning of VR
gaming today I'm excited to show you the
oculus rift so here it is this is it
it's light you can hold it with one hand
we've designed a custom display and
optic system that enables us to achieve
comfortable presence there's no motion
blur
there's no judder there's no pixels
you're really there it also features a
wide field of view so that you really
feel immersed in a new constellation
tracking system there's an external
sensor that you put on your desk you
plug it into the back of your computer
and you're all set that's it and the
rift features an integrated audio system
that we've again refined we're
incredibly proud of this we know that
some people want to bring their own
headphones so we've made them really
easy to take right off we've added a
nice convenient dial that allows you to
adjust the lens distance so you can get
those lenses right in the center of your
eye I'm incredibly excited to announce
that we're gonna include a wireless Xbox
one controller and adapter in the oculus
rift
the rip will natively work with Windows
10 to make it easy to set up jump in and
have incredible VR experiences from day
one
another key area focus for us that we
talked about back in January was the
ability to stream Xbox one games to
Windows 10 devices I'm really proud to
announce that that steam streaming
capability will be available for oculus
rift something we've spent a lot of time
perfecting and the ability to work with
the team in oculus to create a virtual
cinema where Xbox one games will show up
I think really pays off the value of
people's investment in their games and
obviously their investment in oculus but
a VR platform this VR headset the input
as it all comes together really isn't
worth that much unless there's
incredible content we can say with
confidence that Ivanka D is the closest
thing you're going to get to being a
real spaceship fighter pilot today I'm
here to introduce you to a new
experience we would like to take you on
it's called Chronos let's have a look
edge of nowhere is insomniac brand-new
third-person action-adventure
exclusively for the rift in addition to
the games you just saw will have more
fantastic titles at e3 any developers
have created some of the most innovative
and interesting games in the last decade
so to that end today I am pleased to
announce that we will be investing more
than 10 million dollars toward
accelerating the development of these
sorts of innovative one-of-a-kind
independent games on the rift we're
developing new system software for the
rift that we call oculus home-home is
your portal to everything oculus and it
brings all your rift games together in
one place when you put on the rift
you're gonna drop straight into oculus
home we have a virtual environment that
you'll land in here I can check out my
games library maybe I want to play
something right now or maybe I want to
check out some of the top games that
others are playing let's say I'm
interested in learning more about
Chronos you can't convey what a VR game
will be like through a video or a screen
shot but because we're already here in
virtual reality we can put you straight
into a VR preview of the game before you
even buy it home also lets you see what
your friends are doing in the rift and
what they're playing right now we've
also built a 2d interface for oculus
home you can browse the store stay in
touch with your friends and manage your
games and downloads without putting the
headset on virtuality is really unlike
anything else and rift is simply the
best way to experience it and you'll be
able to get your rift q1 2016 so next
week is e3 and this is gonna be the
biggest show for oculus yet everything
you saw today you're gonna be able to
try on the show floor but before we go
there's just one more thing that we
really want to show you something that
we've been working on for quite a while
you've heard us say input is hard well
it is
but we got it right I'd like to welcome
Palmer Luckey close friend and colleague
to the stage we wanted to create an
input device that actually lets people
reach out that lets those people
interact with objects in the virtual
world let me show you what we've been
working on this is oculus touch these
are going to take virtual reality gaming
to the next level
come on let's clap let's do it these are
feature prototypes for oculus touch a
set of prototypes that were code that
we've codenamed Half Moon we wanted to
deliver hand presence the sense of
feeling as though your virtual hands are
actually your real hands precise
manipulation of virtual entities in the
virtual space is also absolutely
critical for example you need to be able
to pick up a gun from a table and then
fire it throw it or drop it effortlessly
without even having to think about it
overall we wanted a design that was low
mental load that you something you
wouldn't have to think about something
that would let you use these controllers
effortlessly like you use your real
hands in the real world we also wanted
to enable communicative gestures for
social interactions imagine pointing
waving or giving a thumbs up these are
the types of experiences that half-moon
enables and another priority was
including proven traditional inputs like
buttons and analog sticks finally oculus
touch needs to be lightweight and
ergonomic and it to be easy to get in
and out of and it had to be comfortable
for extremely long periods of play
whether you're standing and reaching out
into the virtual world or whether you
are sitting on your couch with your
controllers resting in your lap see that
resting on my lap there's two
controllers one for each hand you have
two hands they're mirror images of each
other like the two hands that you have
they're wireless so you can move and
interact in the virtual world freely
unencumbered by cables they have
integrated high precision low latency
six degree of freedom track six for your
freedom tracking leveraging the same
constellation trash tracking technology
that we use in the rift along with
integrated inertial measurement units
touch also includes haptics the
developers can use to deliver feedback
when you're interacting with objects in
the virtual world so that you can
actually feel the things that you're
touching finally though touch can detect
a set of finger-posts using a matrix of
center sensors mounted throughout the
inside of the device together they work
to recognize natural hand poses like
pointing waving or giving a thumbs up
the last few years have been incredible
for virtual reality things have come so
far so fast if you were to show someone
a video of this event today or a heck
you and all the technology that's in the
virtual reality industry across all
these different companies not just
oculus you took a video of that and
showed it to someone three or four years
ago they would have thought that it
looked like a science fiction film it
would have been a perfect cue but this
isn't science fiction this is reality
and it's happening today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
