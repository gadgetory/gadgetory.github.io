maybe you're thinking about getting
outside and doing some exercise
maybe says the person who's glued to her
laptop screen and her iPhone all day
long
unlike me I wear Garmin I sweat for
breakfast I'm that friend that tells you
to run up the side of a mountain or bike
50 miles for fun well in either case if
you are looking to get outside and
exercise a little bit you might be
looking for a capable fitness tracker
like the Apple watch which is awesome
because Apple okay that is not a real
fitness watch it's a smart watch that
has some fitness capabilities I mean
it's like a fitness watch for tech
people this is what you should be
looking at you're better off not looking
at that at all because speaking of looks
thing looks awful on your wrist I mean
it's not about what it looks like it's
about what you can do with it yeah yeah
sure it is so this is the Apple watch
and this is the new Garmin Forerunner
735 XT good god that's a mouthful why
does Garmin even use those naming
conventions the Apple watch is simple
and it's sleek and in addition to
showing UI message notifications and
letting you pay with Apple pay it checks
a whole bunch of different activities
activities you call closing those
colorful rings over their activities
yeah the Apple watch is actually a
pretty capable fitness tracker in
addition to tracking your daily steps it
also record specific exercise sessions
like running walking cycling elliptical
stair stepping and other workouts yeah
yeah the Garmin does all that too and
more is even though it's called the
Garmin Forerunner it's actually a
multi-sport watch so it tracks things
like walking
running hiking cycling Pama boarding and
it's waterproof unlike the Apple watch
so we'd even track swimming well the
Apple watch reads your heart rate from
your wrist and if you still prefer a
heart rate chest strap you can pair it
with that yeah the Garmin does that too
oh also the Garmin has GPS Apple watch
Fitness watch without GPS lol ok well
the Apple watch has this really nice
touchscreen display unlike that thing
yeah which you can't really see that
well when you're running outdoors in
direct sunlight right also you can wear
this Garmin to bed and it will track
your sleep Apple watch doesn't track
sleep right I mean it's not a core
function of the watch but there are non
Apple apps that let you track sleep but
I mean everybody knows it's sleep
tracking with these things probably
isn't that accurate anyway mmm yeah yes
as the owner of a fitness watch that has
an 18 hour battery life you know how
long this thing lasts more than seven
days and that's when I'm getting in
three to five workouts a week okay
overachiever also and this is pretty
major Garmin syncs all of your data to a
mobile app that works in a bunch of
different mobile phones and we'll also
sync to desktop software unlike that
Apple watch over there which only works
with iPhones okay this is true but
remember I said earlier you can get
iMessage notifications on your wrist
with the Apple watch well with the Apple
watch you can also respond to them
either using touch or using your voice
making this a truly interactive watch I
mean it's a pretty great SmartWatch and
it's a really capable fitness tracker
you can't say that about the garment
also the Apple watch sport is now only
$249 at Best Buy
that thing is
offensive okay so it's a little bit more
expensive a little bit alright it's it's
about four hundred and fifty dollars but
that's what you're gonna pay for a
serious Fitness watch which is what this
is not that doesn't matter the Apple
watch is great for iPhone lovers who
really want notifications on the wrist
and also care about their health it's
not the kind of watch that you're going
to use to train for your triathlon this
is true but it's a pretty sleek capable
fitness tracker you can also wear out to
a nice dinner which is more than I can
say about that okay I can admit that
that's a pretty solid fitness tracker
but considering it's the Apple watch
sport it's still lacking some pretty
notable sport focused features I still
think this is way more practical even
though I know it's more expensive but if
you're serious about working out it has
GPS it's waterproof its battery life
lasts a really long time longer than
that and it syncs data to a bunch of
different operating systems so it might
not be the fanciest watch in the world
but it's pretty capable Tyler can you
see what's in my eye
according to my camera I said in my eye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
