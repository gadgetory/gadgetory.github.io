Southwest has been accused of going
corporate and really there's no better
example of that than pens oils Mario
Kart racetrack
Pennzoil wanted to sell you motor oil
and Nintendo wanted to sell you a
videogame so the two of them got
together and created a go-kart
experience you are bad at Mario I'm
literally going to end it right right
for racers get on the track and they
strap into electric Co karts very good
peter is going to literally be thousand
tiny little pieces by the time I'm done
with it
each go-kart is equipped with a GoPro
camera and a bunch of RFID sensors as
you drive on the track you can go over
certain markers that give you power-ups
or hurt your speed you race on the track
and you try and win it's just like Mario
Kart put your Kart speeds up or slows
down depending on whether or not you hit
certain markers playing Mario Kart in
the real world is just a lot like
driving a go-kart there's no augmented
reality or shells flying at you you're
just driving over some markers and
running around in pretty slow electric
okay
what
go karting is always fun and Mario Kart
is always fun but putting two together
doesn't really quite work out the fun of
shells flying at you and crashing your
friends into the wall for Mario Kart
doesn't really translate into go-kart
which is all about safety and honestly
not going quite that fast it's not the
dream of actually throwing blue sparks
as I drift around the curve and a
go-kart but a South by Southwest PR
stunts go I really can't complain I was
still driving a go-kart and even though
I lost I can't blame that on corporate
influence I be theater that's the only
thing that matters I'll get you next
