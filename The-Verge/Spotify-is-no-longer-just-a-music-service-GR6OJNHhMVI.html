drama in the world of streaming music
Taylor Swift pulled her catalog from
Spotify a bunch of big artists got
together in launch title and YouTube
decided that I would get in on the
streaming music game as well what
happened today was modified diversified
into video podcasts and fitness so a
spot if I had a bunch of big
announcements today in New York they're
adding video they're adding podcasts and
they're adding this beat-matching sort
of fitness stuff into the app we've seen
Spotify do streaming music and we've
also seen that it's incredibly difficult
to make a profit doing that
Spotify revenues have grown to over a
billion dollars but their losses have
grown even faster today's announcement
was really about Spotify becoming a
diversified media platform now they can
run ads in a video they can sell people
on health and fitness services and of
course they can do podcasts which is a
great complement to the audio stuff they
already have Spotify is now looking to
take on everyone from YouTube to
snapchat kind of a new media mobile
company not just a music streaming
service</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
