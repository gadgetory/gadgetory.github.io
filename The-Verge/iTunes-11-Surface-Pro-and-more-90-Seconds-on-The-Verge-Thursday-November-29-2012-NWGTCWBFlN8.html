russell brandom and this just a second
this is 90 seconds on the verge iTunes
11 is finally available to download it's
possibly the biggest UI overhaul itunes
has ever seen with new sliding menu
pains in a heavy influence on album
artwork there's also new integration
with I class which emphasizes streaming
any purchased content like songs you
bought years ago and have long since
delete belong in the short it's a big
improvement and if you have itunes
already there's no reason to avoid
update microsoft surface pro now has a
price and a release window The Click
Clack covered tablet is due out january
and will start at eight hundred ninety
nine dollars it's a little heavier and
thicker than the just-released surface
RT but otherwise looks the same unlike
that model however the surface pro has
full windows 8 and will run all your
desktop apps the other trade off is
battery life microsoft says to expect
the pro model last just half as long as
the arm-based RT mom finally remember
when nasa said this week's Mars rover
announcement would be one for the
history books well the agency today
announced that it will not have any
major new findings to reveal its
upcoming press conference it seems
curiosity's recent soil tests didn't
turn up anything particularly exciting
after all in other words no Martian
organics no otherworldly artifacts and
no digging site for elon musk's future
Martian colony Starbucks that's it for
today's top stories tune again tomorrow
when oh god
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
