can't carry a ton of stuff with us
there's only so much room on a rocket
right and food takes up a lot of space
and I can break down over time but one
thing we can send with us are super
lightweight seeds to grow plants that's
why we're here at Kennedy Space Center
to learn how to grow yummy food in space
and on other planets in order to grow
plants you need soil right well there
are some problems with that technically
on the Moon and Mars it's not really a
soil a soil by definition has organic
material in it the surface of the Moon
and Mars doesn't so they're really
regulus it's crushed volcanic rock for
the most part and there's components in
that chemicals in that that are not
conducive to plant growth so especially
when we go to Mars we're gonna have to
figure out if we want to use the Martian
regolith as a medium to grow plants and
we're gonna have to convert that
regolith into a soil a usable soil right
and aren't there some problems yeah
already associated with using it soil
isn't it a little bit toxic yeah
perchlorates they're in the Martian
soils are a real problem for plant
growth
perchlorates are a type of salt NASA's
Phoenix lander and Curiosity rover both
found signatures of the chemical on Mars
and that's not great news high levels of
perchloric are toxic to humans which
could make growing food on the Red
Planet problematic but NASA's thinking
of ways to clean the perchlorates by
washing them away with chemical
solutions
there's perchlorates in the environment
on earth and their scientists have
already developed methods for
remediating those perchlorates using
microbes theoretically we could go up
there and use either chemical or
microbial solutions to mitigate the
microbes so at the end of the day it
might just be better not to use soil at
all than to actually try and clean the
potentially toxic Mora soil of course
you can always bring the soil from Earth
but that's not really a great option
either because it weighs so much NASA is
looking into other options for growing
plants that don't use soil we have you
know a basic soil here but picking it up
that's pretty
Hevy and this is even a very big box
well even today in control environment
agriculture they're getting away from
using soil as a medium to grow plants
and they want to go to things that are
basically hydroponically grown
aeroponically grown you want to minimize
the resources even today on the ground
to grow things in so we're going to be
looking at using some of that type of
technology and spaceflight so we can
eliminate the medium of soil NASA is
testing hydroponics a method for growing
that has gained popularity among
terrestrial farmers in the past few
years and also aeroponics as gravity or
lack thereof presents its own challenges
so we're growing things in kind of a
modified hydroponics way right now so
hydroponics is growing plants without
soil and generally on earth this is
using a nutrient solution a liquid
solution of nutrients and sometimes you
use a substrate like a baked clay or a
gravel or a sand sometimes you can just
use water and nutrient solution and so
we're testing different ways of doing
this both for a surface system like Mars
where you have some gravity and for
microgravity in space so without gravity
you get some really interesting
challenges you get very different
behavior of fluids so water and air have
been our biggest challenges especially
in the root zone watering your plants
and when we figure that out that's going
to be huge hydroponics delivers water
and nutrients to plant roots using a
liquid solution and aeroponics takes it
one step further instead of using a
solution plants are grown in a misty air
environment aside from hydroponics
researchers are also testing what
environments plants will thrive in best
by testing different lights and
temperatures including environments
similar to that of the ISS our main goal
right now is to produce safe nutritious
and appealing food for the crew to
supplement a packaged diet so they have
a really good package diet they have
several hundred foods and and they're
actually really tasty they do a lot of
evaluation to make sure that they're
going to be very very delicious for the
crew when we go to
ours we need a diet that's going to be
good for five years and some of the
vitamins don't last that long in the
packaged food so we're looking at can we
use supplemental food production crops
plants to add more flavor more texture
and more nutrients to that diet I
couldn't leave without getting a taste
of these plants time to eat basically
we're just gonna cut the leaves off and
put them in these little pots here so
that's all we have to do actually these
are microgreens so we're gonna try here
a little bit of broccoli with a
cauliflower so microgreens actually
started life as garnishes and high-end
restaurants you'll go into a restaurant
would be like a little marigold micro
green on there right now it's the meal
it's a meal that's the accent for foods
the biggest benefit of microgreens is
that they can be harvested in a very
short amount of time so you don't have
to wait weeks or months before you can
eat them here is our famous steak plant
amara mustard is what it's called it's
also known as Ethiopian kale medium rare
that weirdly does taste like steak it's
got that it's got that you know it takes
a while to kick in yeah figuring out how
to grow fresh food in space is not only
important for the nutritional value it
will provide but the psychological value
it has as well when you're on Mars
you're not gonna be looking down on
Earth
so I think the plants are gonna be
really important for those reasons yeah
like having a little taste of home
almost exactly while humans have
explored and adapted to new environments
many times before with space we won't be
able to rely on the resources we are
accustomed to here on earth growing food
is going to be incredibly difficult and
we'll have to figure out how to be
self-sufficient in entirely new ways
because this is an entirely new frontier
