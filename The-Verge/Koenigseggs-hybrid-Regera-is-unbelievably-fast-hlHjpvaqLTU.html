the Geneva Motor Show 2016 and this
cherry red Beauty behind me is the
Koenigsegg Agera this car was actually
one of the stars of the show in the 2015
Geneva Motor Show it has 1,500
horsepower matching the bugatti chiron
which is just going to be announced in a
stand just over there a few moments from
now but for me the rig era is seriously
it's stunning it's one of the most
gorgeous cars it was really beautiful
last year it still is 3000 parts have
changed in the design over the past 12
months so Koenigsegg says that this can
go from zero to 60 in less than 2.8
seconds this is a more reasonable 1.8
million euros run about 2 million
dollars if you don't add any extras so
the big difference between the rig era
here and bugatti chiron coming up is
that the Ruggero actually uses an
electric drive to supplement the petrol
engine that means you get 1500
horsepower but out of a more efficient
machine and a lighter machine so but the
bugatti chiron is going to be one of the
most powerful and amazing machines ever
but the Koenigsegg Agera is lighter it's
more agile and I might contribute to a
better driving experience so forget it
likes to talk about its cause as
automobile sculptures and Koenigsegg is
really living up to the same ideas and
the same standards with this the rig era
there's only 80 of them that are being
produced Koenig's they've already sold
14 so if you have a couple of million
dollars hanging around and that was the
time so that's our first look at common
execs final production rig era at the
Geneva Motor Show of 2016 but it's only
the start of our coverage so stay tuned
