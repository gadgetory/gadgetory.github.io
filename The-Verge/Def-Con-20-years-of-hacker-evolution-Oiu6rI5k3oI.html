years is we're at the the verge of the
fulfillment of the promise of 20 years
ago so 20 years ago people were saying
computers are gonna be everywhere and
they're gonna do everything and we're at
a moment now where everything we do
involves the internet and computers and
we're just before the moment where
everything we do will require in the
Internet and computers that's kind of
the David Brin transparent and society
thing the idea that instead of worrying
about one big brother that's got kind of
centralized surveillance it's kind of
everyone surveilling everybody all the
time in the old days already had the
computing power and the resources right
it was a handful of entities now it's
everywhere I mean the opportunities are
more abundant
so that has probably shifted the way
some folks operate a little bit it's
happening kind of whether we like it or
not so I think our only real choice is
to try to find ways to work with it and
make it work out the nature of the
computer security space the industry
technology the impetus of computers have
all drastically changed over the last 20
years where InfoSec used to be a problem
that affected a tiny domain of human
experience
now InfoSec affects every corner of
human experience
when we started DEFCON there was no
world wide web most people didn't have a
home computer and the computers they did
have were far less powerful than the
phones in all of our pockets today I
think DEFCON is what its gonna become
it's a very large semi corporate event
that has hackers comments got captured
the flag there's a social engineering
contest going on right now or there's
someone sitting in isolation booth
trying to call companies and get to
secret information but on top of that
you've got a lot of people who are much
more corporate who want to see it who've
heard about it and want to be there and
the hackers put on the show for them and
that's how you get 10,000 people here
so I'm dead addict I'm a senior staff
member at DEFCON and I've been senior
staff member since DEFCON began and for
the past decade or so I've been working
the press team helping try to foster a
better understanding of the hacker and
security community to to the rest of the
world
it's a real community that is is built
around some shared values and it's a
community where people are really sort
of being themselves in a way that you
know may seem unusual to some folks but
there's so many really wonderful people
that I've met here people who they see
an issue they see something that is
wrong whether it's a bug or system and
they want to solve that problem
and a lot of tinkerers who want to see
what things can be done in different
ways of course I still say you know
don't get on the the open Wi-Fi there's
so people coming here who are hackers
who have a hacker persona and also have
a day job so they don't want those two
to mix they don't want their employees
to know they're here you've still got
people who don't want to be identified
there are people that use technology war
criminal ends and the hacking community
as a whole doesn't consider those people
hackers so hacking is a way of thinking
it's a way of perceiving the world
looking at the world as a series of
systems that work in a certain way but
don't have to work that way on the one
hand there has always been and will
always be a total legitimate series of
activities that are about exploration
the acquisition of knowledge the
discovery and eventual repair of
security flaws and the intellectual
exercise of understanding systems
breaking them and putting them back
together on the other hand I think that
the opportunity to be a highly automated
vandal has never existed in the way that
it does today I come to DEFCON because
there's a very interesting culture here
it started out originally if ecology of
let let's break things to now I think
more like we know we can break things
but how do we make things better the
spirit of fight the man is very much
alive and I think a big part of it is
that the world is just becoming more and
more corporate and I've seen a big
change in Vegas Vegas is now culprit so
I think that roots only adds to you know
that mentality of the big man kind of
getting richer
people who break security obey
definition rule breakers so you need
rule breakers on the side the people
building the systems or they're no good
about a decade months ago every major
corporation that was involved in
software and hardware stated publicly we
do not hire hackers we do not hire these
people and the truth of the matter was I
had friends in all of these places so
they were either ignorant or lying but
now all these same companies have active
outreach programs they're recruiting at
these events people here a lot of them
grown up so back then it's it's all
hackers here it's really more computer
security professionals coming to hang
out with hackers and you know hacking is
almost the sideshow here this is much
more legitimate the NSA is exhibiting at
DEFCON you know in the beginning we as
spot the Fed contest in this room this
one right here is the talent our nation
needs secure cyberspace and there's some
issues that we have in cyberspace when
you look at you folks understand cyber
security you know that we can protect
the networks and have civil liberties
and privacy and you can help us get
there far as intelligence community the
FBI they started coming to Def Con a
number of years ago and started parent
panels and we have a meet the Fed panel
and essentially what they do is recruit
they look for the best of the people
that come here to help government solve
eight security problems you know there
are some things that I'm working my way
through to understand cyber security I
want to walk through those with you and
see what we can do together to help
secure cyberspace I think he's here
asking for help
I think that that's an admission that
they're having trouble solving problems
so he's asking for your help but that's
an admission that they have internally
they had problems solving these issues I
don't think there's anything wrong with
that by the way he's looking for talent
the NSA needs people who think like
hackers
where they call themselves hackers or
not I don't care I mean then what's a
towel determine 25 years to 30 years old
it's gone through a lot of iterations
it's been vilified it's been
rehabilitated you know you got white hat
black hat grey hat I don't even know
what these terms mean anymore well
personally I'm thrilled that the
security community has grown as large as
it has and I think it's crucial for the
global infrastructure that the community
continue to grow and continue to be
embedded in large corporations helping
with securing architectures and
infrastructures it shows there's a
growing interest in security research
and in playing with technology like they
view if you have a piece of technology
what can you do it that's a really
important aspect of technology feeling
that you can own it that it doesn't run
you you run it it's human behavior that
nobody wants to be told that things are
bad or things are broken so you kind of
have to find the right level of how far
you go at any given time and that's
gonna be harder because technology is
going to change faster we're going to
see more and more complex
infrastructures I think he's going to
see more infrastructures that do not
follow any standards or industry best
practices so really applying the right
level of expertise and the right level
of pressure at the right time is
is gonna continue to be an art but
perhaps increasingly be one and I hope
that deaf one can help the folks to
exchange information or experience like
where that Louisville is and how that
works things that right now are really
in the hands of just a few people are
rapidly approaching the hands of people
who are black either the emotional
maturity or the sense of responsibility
or the good sense overall to use that
stuff wisely I also believe that end
users shouldn't have to care about
security they do have to care about
security but I would really consider
that a failing of the software and
hardware industry of the computing
industry that they they have to make
very difficult decisions and have to buy
third-party products to help protect
them that don't work that well and that
shouldn't be the case as a community in
the software industry and as a security
community we should be making
technologies that that are secure by
default because you know my mother is
never going to be able to make the right
decision</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
