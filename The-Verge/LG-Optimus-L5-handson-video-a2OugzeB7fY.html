optimus l5 now this like the l3 is a
member of LG's new elle style series and
if I can show you the l5 and l3 side by
side you can get a an idea for the size
difference there but there's actually a
lot more going on here than just the
difference in size it's not like you say
well I want a small phone I take the l3
on a big phone i'll take the l5 the l5
has NFC integrated you can see the NFC
logo there on the textured back and it
also comes out of the box with android
4.0 the l3 is android 2.3 so this has
that very cool transition effect lock
screen that we saw on the optimus 4x as
well and i can unlock there and you get
an idea for what android 4.2 like on an
hvga display this is a 4 inch hvga with
capacitive buttons down here at the
bottom you can't really see them against
the white there but you have back you
have the multitasking button and then
the home button which is a physical
clicker in the middle and right now we
noticed this on the optimus 4x as well
the the multitasking button is actually
routing to menu for some reason but I
suspect that's not going to happen by
the time these actually shed so you'll
notice one thing that's kind of unusual
is that on the l5 they've changed from a
satin chrome finish to an actual chrome
on the sides which I personally don't
love but some people might like it looks
relatively high quality you can tell
from the specs and from the materials
that they're using this is kind of
geared toward the lower end of the
market and I think they've kind of
nailed it in terms of style so that's a
quick look at the optimus l5
