and after months and months of talking
about it apples finally released the mac
pro and we've actually got one in our
studio now it's designed very much for
professionals and so we're just going to
give it to our video team but before we
did we decided to connect it to a 4k
sharp monitor which is the one that
Apple's selling in its stores and really
start to see how this thing works the
hardware for its part is really kind of
wild looking it's about 11 pounds about
10 inches tall and six inches around and
it's a lot smaller and a lot heavier
than we expected it to be it's really
cool it's sort of an ornamental object
there's only one Apple logo on it on the
back above all the ports everything else
is really stark and minimalist and just
crazy reflective we've only been using
it for a few minutes now but it's really
quiet it sucks air up through the bottom
and expels it at the top as part of a
cooling process and it does it all the
time it seems like there's always air
coming out of the top but it never does
it particularly loudly there's really
almost no design or flare to speak of
here except a small power light on the
back but when you spin it around there's
a light around all of the ports that
lights up and just sort of breathe so
you can see the ports so really the sort
of the Mac Pro is its performance
obviously there's a new version of Final
Cut that's designed to be really fast to
render multiple cameras in 4k without
any waiting and we'll be playing games
will be doing all sorts of stuff but for
right now we're just watching 4k videos
and it's already really beautiful coming
out of the Mac Pro the Mac Pro is on
sale now starting at three thousand
dollars and we'll have lots more about
it in the next few days
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
