Transportation and a lot of experts say
that we're not going to see them on the
road for at least another 10 years but
some companies just can't wait like uber
uber started playing around with the
idea of self-driving cars a few years
ago then last September it launched a
pilot program in Pittsburgh as a way to
give a select group of riders their
first taste of an autonomous future
today
uber is ready to launch its second
self-driving service here in San
Francisco we spoke to Lee or Ron
one of the heads of uber self-driving
program who explained how their
partnership with Volvo is a key step
towards pushing autonomous driving on
two public roads aesthetically we were
able to actually integrate the
technology much more seamlessly into the
cover we have as many of the sensors
embedded into the car also for example
the front aerators will not sort of show
up randomly on the front but they'll be
integrated into the grid of the car and
everything we need in terms of sensors
all the antennas the GPS everything
you've seen on diffusion is now nicely
compactly integrated into the pod uber
doesn't want to unnecessarily accelerate
the adoption but rather take its time
focusing on particular cities and
neighborhoods while building a database
of driving patterns and for a number of
reasons
San Francisco seems like a great city to
start the program we can now have those
cows close to the urban engineers to the
other team to the uber self driving
engineers feel we can experience a much
bigger city with a lot of different
permutations a lot of different
neighbors a lot of different street
formation a lot of unique or more
comments and Francisco sites such as
Michaels and heavy traffic and heavy
pedestrian detail a steep hills that
they have a lot of fun dealing with
cable cars it's just a a much wider I am
basically operational area that we can
iterate on the technology naturally we
took a test ride to see how it all works
sands of Aruba has arrived
excellent I didn't have to hail it huh
all right where would you like to go
we're going to get a pizza
he took yeah it sounds good to me how
does it work when you're already in the
car
zero minutes away yeah makes sense we in
the car
the life will be self driven as much as
possible but not all of it this is about
operating in iterating on the technology
so the drivers are they'll - it'll take
control when needed all sort of man
you'd live in the portions aim of the
route that is needed the xc90 was way
more streamlined than the self-driving
Ford fusions uber is using in Pittsburgh
there are only seven cameras down from
22 on the Ford Fusion and 3d video for a
wider field of vision radar sensors are
mounted behind the plastic bumper rather
than protruding off the side of the
vehicle and the spinning lidar detector
and camera suite on the roof is way more
compact so what about the ride in
general it was pretty uneventful uber
self-driving cars in San Francisco will
always feature two safety engineers in
the front seats to take over just in
case things get complicated and during
our ride the driver did just that
occasionally taking control when
conditions got tricky but for the most
part the car drove itself seamlessly
navigating through bad weather and
distracted pedestrians with relative
ease but as convenient as self-driving
could be there will be a lot of
controversy that follows how safe will
it all be once it becomes widely adopted
can the cars be programmed to make
ethical choices and most importantly
what will happen to all those jobs it's
going to be a hybrid network regardless
it's not going to be all either all
black or white there's always going to
be room for a drivers to carville maybe
some difficult areas maybe some snow
you're some a challenging condition
maybe peak demand or time will sort of
the self-driving cars cannot actually
fulfill that request
so regardless the future is going to be
hybrid and it's going to take us a while
nothing to get them for now only a
limited number of people will get a
taste of uber self-driving future but
eventually everyone may experience the
shock of hailing a ride on their
smartphone only to have a car with no
one inside show up I feel if you guys
can build a self-driving car that can
also flick off people when they drive
like assholes that you will have
achieved the type of thing we will want
to have and right in the most</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
