we're at Panasonic's booth at CES 2013
and we're taking a look at their new
electronic touch pen this is a new
product for this year it works with
their 1080p plasma TVs that are new
coming up this year it's not backwards
compatible with earlier plasmas and it
doesn't work with their LED LCD TVs so
let's just take a quick look at what's
going on here we have an iPad connected
to the TV by Wi-Fi and this is running
Panasonic's swipe and share app it's
available for iOS and Android no windows
8 but what it allows you to do is for
example take some photos and throw them
up on the TV once the content is on the
television you can do all kinds of cool
stuff with it so let's just bring up the
palette first I have to let the tv know
that I'm talking to it right now we can
just bring up a palette I'm going to
pick a pen let's go with this one will
do I'll pick my color
actually I kind of like black that's
great and then we can just you know read
stuff on TV
we can maybe like but like a pain a bane
mask on this guy
something like this
that kind of thing yeah and then when
we're finished with the image we can
drag it back down onto the tablet and
that'll store it back on our device
there's some other things that you can
do as well there are some games tablet
like games running on the television
that you can interact with using the
touch pen and some cool whiteboard
functionality as well so Panasonic won't
say exactly what technology it's using
to communicate with the TV they'll just
say it's proprietary and it uses
bluetooth and yeah other than that we
don't have too much information it's
coming out later this year but there's
no price or release window yet and yeah
it's the electronic touch pen from
Panasonic</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
