that carry a game that is called green
fluorescent protein this gene
integrating his genome in his chromatin
in his chromosome in his cells and
expressed a fluorescence that is great.i
a senior scientist at the el Doble
Research Center for endangered species
and I wore basically in interspecies
cloning one of the century's greatest
scientific achievements was unveiled
before the eyes of a stunt world
her name was Dolly the sheep each human
life is unique born of a miracle that
reaches beyond laboratory science I
believe we must respect this profound
gift and resist the temptation to
replicate ourselves cloning is probably
still a controversial technology if you
survey Americans you'll still get a huge
percentage of people that say cloning is
morally wrong that it opens up Pandora's
box that we're going to clone humans
next sort of all these hypothetical
sci-fi scenarios and that hasn't changed
but I think as cloning has sort of
fallen off of front pages scientists
have sort of had some space to quietly
go about their work without stirring up
controversy at every turn
the Audubon Center for research of
endangered species or acres as many
people call it for short is a facility
in New Orleans that is devoted to using
advanced reproductive technology to help
endangered species breed and survive and
thrive
we work in assisted reproductive
technologies a specialist in cats and in
Wolcott
cloning provides a way to help
endangered species reproduce so if their
numbers are dwindling and they're not
reproducing well in captivity you could
maybe take a skin sample from an
endangered animal and use it to create
an identical twin a lab that focuses
exclusively on the cloning of endangered
or threatened species is pretty rare
there are not a lot of scientists that
are focusing full-time on that
application of cloning
so cloning from Dolly through the kind
of cloning that Akers is doing is
generally done for a procedure known as
somatic cell nuclear transfer and a
somatic cell is basically any cell in an
animal's body that's not a sperm cell or
an egg cell so it could be a skin cell a
muscle cell something from the body and
so if scientists want to clone say a
wild cat they'll take a skin sample from
that cat and they confuse that skin cell
with an egg
can you see Vivian is here outside when
that happens the DNA from the Wildcat
from that skin cell enters the egg and
as the egg turns into an embryo as it
grows and divides it has the DNA that
came from that skin cell this sort of
cloned embryo can then be implanted in a
surrogate mother say an average house
cat that will carry the embryo to term
if all goes well and eventually give
birth to this cloned wild cat kitten a
lot of what they're learning about cat
reproduction and cat cloning could be
applied to you know one hosts anything
from cheetahs to lions tigers any of
those endangered cat species the other
development that I think is really
positive and really exciting is the
creation of these frozen zoos frozen
zoos allow scientists to store cells and
DNA from animals for hundreds of years
and so if a certain genetic lineage dies
out we have that cell we have that DNA
and scientists a hundred years from now
could potentially clone it back into
existence
one of the criticisms you hear a lot is
that cloning is this high-tech sexy
spectacle and some scientists think that
it actually distracts from these other
sort of more basic efforts and the big
problem right now is a lot of these
animals have their habitats being
destroyed their habitats are
disappearing so until we can make sure
that there's a safe place to release
these animals where they won't just be
hunted into extinction again it doesn't
make much sense to bring a lot of
animals back animals vegetation human
beings we live together and human beings
are covering this pace of the animals
and we are destroying them in some way
because we are destroying the
environment we are destroying the
animals indirectly I believe that we
need to preserve the animals are part of
this this planet and a part of our life
and we want the children and the future
generations been able to enjoy what what
we enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
