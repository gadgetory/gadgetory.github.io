i'm ross miller and this is 90 seconds
on the verge amazon and HBO have signed
an extensive exclusive multi-year
agreement that brings many of the
network's shows and special to prime
instant video that means for the first
time ever you'll be able to legally
stream HBO content across a number of
set-top boxes without a cable

biggest shows in their entirety as well
as select seasons from boardwalk empire
true blood HBO also promises that seizes
a girl's veep and newsroom will be added
in the future but on until three years
after the first air notably absent
however arles also Game of Thrones it's
a good deal for HBO which is no doubt
walking away with unfathomable amounts
of money here but it's an even better
deal for Amazon the company has already
locked down several high-profile
exclusives stream shows like Downton
Abbey in 24 but HBO has long been the
white whale of streaming content and an
Amazon exclusive is ostensibly a missed
opportunity for Netflix its biggest
competitor and just like big red amazon
is aggressively pushing to create a
portfolio of original series on top of
these indication deals but don't mistake
this as a sign that HBO is softening its
ties to the cable industry the network's
top brass have always been very vocal
about where the big money is and these
shows are frankly years old so if you
really want to watch the new game of
thrones legally speaking you're going to
have to pay for cable for more on Amazon
and HBO check out the verge coming up
