just one day away from its biggest event
ever UFC 200 the fight card puts more
champions into the ring on a single
night than any event in UFC history but
there's another reason all eyes are on
the u.s. C's 200th major event wise bed
report that the promotion's parent
company Zuffa is on the verge of being
sold for as much as four billion dollars
capping one of the greatest turnarounds
in business history
now when Zuffa acquired the UFC back in
2001
it cost just two million dollars the
company was banned from television in 36
states and nearly bankrupt so how did it
end up being worth billions some of the
success is driven by simple sports
promotion but there's another aspect
here technology the UFC is evolved from
an ordinary sports promoter into one of
the most forward-thinking digital media
companies in the television market take
this weekend spike card in Vegas
subscribers do you have sea-fight pass
the company's streaming platform get to
watch the first three fights online then
the action kicks over to basic cable you
can watch on Fox Sports 1
finally for the main card you have to
pony up 50 bucks for the pay-per-view no
other major sports leagues for its a
single night of action across so many
different platforms the UFC streaming
platform fight pass also represents one
of the company's most interesting
opportunities for growth the $10 month
service launched back in December of
2013 and now it's available worldwide as
an added lure for fight fans the UFC
acquired and uploaded a massive library
of archival content basically the entire
history of modern MMA from 1990 to the
present in much the same way Netflix
pack its library with older movies in
the TV series the UFC site also serves
as an aggregator for streaming MMA leaks
that aren't big enough to build their
own platforms like Netflix or Amazon
Prime the UFC can afford to push
programming with a small but dedicated
audience along with small MMA shows it's
even branched out into doing kickboxing
and grappling matches it's the
definition of narrowcasting what's
fascinating about this story is that the
u.s. sees success is as much a matter of
necessity as strategy when it was banned
from television the UFC had to find new
avenues for distribution beyond
traditional television 15 years later
it's reaping the rewards of that
blackout flexing its muscle is one of
the most agile digital media companies
in the world today
Calla from carson is well let's it looks
nice I'm sure I have like a clean take
of you reading through sure and then
I'll have like a good like sure sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
