where's Russell Brandon we're talking
about the hack of the century what is
the hack of the century yeah it's okay
so it's 1.2 billion login password
combinations which is more than we've
ever gotten in one bundle um the
security firm called hold security has
been tracking this group that they named
cyber for guy think it's a great name um
and yet so through various methods the
cyber war group had amassed 1.2 billion
username and password combination and I
saw before was like seaweed million yeah
it was a lot it was a lot lower so I
mean that's why you know the number kind
of gets your attention we're up in the
bees million with Abby which is which is
new right at the time said like a big
exclusive yes yeah yeah there are you
decide it but then there's immediately
questions about whether or not this was
true yeah and you're saying it's not
true well yeah I have my doubts I mean
the biggest thing that immediately
people like questions about was everyone
wants to know if they're on the list
like is it my logon password combination
hold security which it in fairness done
all this work to uncover this stuff said
well if you're a subscriber which means
you give us 120 bucks a year then you
can know if you're on the list that
seems super scamming that's the thing
and so people were very uncomfortable
with that especially since it was this
big exclusive in New York Times New York
Times certainly I'm sure didn't mean to
just be driving all these people to hold
security so that felt a little weird and
then as you look more about the num at
the numbers you know is this really a
direct comparison to other hash so we've
seen before or is this just a kind of
come they just sort of get 1.2 billion
names for various things some of them
were theirs we know that they had as
part of their earlier things bought
username password combinations which is
a thing that scammers do on the Internet
um so where did this really come from is
it fair to call all of it a hack is it
all 1.2 billion together so what's the
weird part is that it seems like there's
this hacking group cyber war and yeah
there's whole security and cyber wars
should be the villains but it seems like
cold security is doing some weird stuff
to sort of turn themselves in the
villains and
story yeah well I think part of his the
cyber war aren't very scary other than
the name but I got the name sort of an
example of it like there so what are
they using this for they're not using it
to like break into my bank account
they're not sent like selling it to
other criminals which is often a thing
that happens they're using it to hack
Twitter accounts right which is not a
particularly lucrative or frightening
thing with this information I mean
that's cuz you're verified but I mean no
it's just not like this isn't a very
sophisticated thing to do with this
information so that's kind of whatever
and then also the way that the method
that they used um you know SQL uh
attacks have been known but it's not
really that sophisticated of a method so
if you have this unprecedented hack
which 1.2 billion certainly
unprecedented you expect them to be
using unprecedented methods that like
these people did something really cool
like with target they were hacking the
air conditioning company right it's like
the electronic version of like crawling
in through the air vents it was this
cool thing and they got in this way that
no one had really thought about before
this there's no real equivalent that
they just did this thing that they just
collected a bunch of stuff and maybe
hacks my well and yeah I mean they look
over a lot of sites to see who is
vulnerable for this but this is a known
vulnerability so it's just sort of the
scale of it is different kind of
quantity over quality but isn't that
like actually known vulnerability is
being propagated in lots of places yes
kind of a big story that has gone a
little bit under important right yeah
absolutely any does seem like these
people really did hack a lot of like
they hacked a lot of people right
certainly I think it does seem the more
you look at it that those were maybe
small firms who weren't very good at
security and sort of maybe these were
not high value username passwords in the
way that like I use a really complicated
one for my bank account and like my
snapchat password is a little less yeah
hi pry arm the thieves obviously like
there should be the other way I have
insurance on the bank national
reputation it came so bottom line I mean
it's just scary being it's the hack
of the century but is back the century I
think most people just want to know is
my stuff going to be
safe what steps can I take what sort of
next what's the next frontier terrifying
things happening I mean you should be
incredibly scared all of the time you
know it's terrible um no we always say
like chase your hazards use a password
manager don't duplicate the passwords
across multiple things which is multiple
services which that's like the number
one advise you don't use the same
username which is exactly what they're
trying to do here I mean that's the
attacker doing but if your name is one
of the 1.2 billion names which just
statistically if you're living on earth
the odds are high um it doesn't really
matter like they're gonna hack your
Twitter may be right if you use if you
do go get it but like who cares I think
people care if they have your Twitter so
yeah but I mean so this is a lot of
moments where you should change your
password like bottom line this is what
it is but like I mean it's sort of not
even like if your if your twitter
password was the same but i just think
even in the scale of hacks like if you
had shopped at Target they would have
your credit card information this it's
like nothing like it's just it's just
very even if you're one of the people
who's affected it's sort of a low-impact
thing I think it's just that the numbers
really high so it's sort of more likely
so just continue living your life free
of all danger and carefree yeah then
change your passwords</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
