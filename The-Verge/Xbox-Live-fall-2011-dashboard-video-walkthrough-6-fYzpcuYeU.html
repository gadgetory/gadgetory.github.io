are checking out the new fall 2011 Xbox
Live dashboard update it should be
launching to all Xbox 360 consoles in
the week of December 4th so the first
thing you will notice with the new
update this is actually the second big
visual revision after the blades that
are launched within the new Xbox
experience that came out a couple years
ago in fact mirrors very similar to the
Metro UI design you've seen in Windows
Phone devices in the upcoming Windows 8
panel and even the Kinect hub that we
saw a preview of back about a year ago
and to connect launched now speaking of
the Kinect there's actually a lot of
improved Kinect functionality first and
foremost being the being search that you
can actually access with your voice if
you go all the way to the left panel
you'll see being searched for apps
search whatever you can do it as a text
thing but it's actually the biggest pain
better yet from anywhere in the menu you
can just go ahead and scream Xbox being
the gun stringer so here goes just
thinking the Sphynx search only works
when you're connected on live and what
it will do it lets you search for games
movies TV is anything that microsoft
offers and can let you download and/or
purchase so as you see here we have a
couple toys for the gun stringer the
game itself a launch trailer as a few
ads is always there let's go ahead and
take a look at this we can also do it by
search by voice Xbox the gun stringer
item - it loads up and we don't have the
game yet but it is a free download so we
can go ahead and just say download only
once begin to the internal menu we can
use connect to way but voice controls
pretty much gone at this point go ahead
and tap wave finds it and confirming
download so in addition to games you can
also use being to search for the movies
TV and music that Xbox offers for
example let's give this a shot Xbox Bing
Modern Family
okay as you see we'll have modern family
which is available in multiple episodes
and for some reason the Sonic
Generations demo American Idol encore
dental music oppositeday and the like
let's go ahead and look at what we
wanted in Modern Family xbox Xbox there
you go
Modern Family Season 2 good cop bad dog
alright and then let's you purchase
through Zune music it is still finicky
service but it is nice that unlike last
version of this you can actually use
more natural language you can actually
say the episodes you want you don't just
have to go panel one panel - and it does
have that latent search function so with
this new update Microsoft is making a
much bigger push toward video and
including that they're going to be
updating the Netflix app and adding in a
YouTube app which is not here yet but
should be there launch week they've
overhauled the ESPN app they've added
sci-fi epics dailymotion Bebo should be
coming up there's a lot more apps
verizon fios will be adding live TV as
well comcast to various aspects
basically Microsoft's ultimate goal is
to keep your Xbox on at all times and
kind of watch video through the console
itself with some added functionality
let's go ahead and take a look at the
SyFy which is offering some on-demand
options okay so after something of a
elongated load time you get this sci-fi
menu is has the exact same metro UI is
everything else on the new dashboard
update and you can search through and
look through the new show content you
can look at some of the game trailers
that sci-fi offers but as with
everything else we're most interested in
the more natural language connect voice
options let's go ahead and give that a
shot
Xbox being human and you can use this to
go through the entire system video cast
and crew
episode guides there goes the
neighborhood part 1 and from here you
can take a look at some the information
about the episode you can get more video
options or if you want you can share the
other big thing Microsoft is touting
with this update is the ability to share
items through Facebook and even the most
inane things like an episode of being
human so we can go ahead and do the
share function and what this will do is
will bring up my Facebook account I've
already got that tied in from earlier
and you can just add a wall post that
says exactly it just says you're
interested in being human episode
there's not a lot of functionality for
this one but they do have some cool
Facebook features elsewhere in the new
dashboard let's go out of here so now
again there will be integration with
Verizon FiOS live TV and on-demand
comcast video on-demand and it will have
some new apps like HBO GO and a new
Netflix and of course most excited of
all the YouTube app unfortunately we
don't have that in the preview but it
should be rolling out sometime this week
now some of the other big features that
Microsoft is rolling out with a new
update includes beacons and cloud
storage let's go ahead and show beacons
the idea behind this is that there are
times when I want to play a game like
Call of Duty but I do not want to wait I
want to go ahead and say I want to play
the game wait for my friends to get on
and at the same time I'm gonna go ahead
and watch Netflix Hulu whatever so to
get there you go from the friends the
social tab go to your friends and then
go down to beacons and activity now what
we can do here is we can create a beacon
and this will basically say it will tell
me when my friends are playing this game
and if I want I can add messages so
other people can see my beacons so I'm
gonna go ahead and I'm going to select
modern warfare 3 the comment that's
default is I want to play this game with
friends I'm gonna go ahead and leave
that but you can modify it if you want
you can also choose to share social
networks and you can tell everyone on
Facebook yes I want to play this right
now anyone who's seeing this please come
on and play with me so let me go ahead
and set the beacon and that's it and I
have a chit if I don't have a change of
heart about sharing this on Facebook I
can do that and I can also
further modify the message so I'm gonna
cancel I don't want Facebook to see that
but all the same i beacon is still there
and I every time one of my friends
starts playing modern warfare 3 I'll get
an alert on the bottom anyone who wants
to see you know go through their friends
beacon should be able to see this as
well so that's it the other big new
feature if you go over settings is cloud
storage now this one's a you have to
enable at least in this one you have to
enable yourself or if you go over to
system you'll see storage options from
storage options you'll see your all
devices you'll see hard drive and you'll
see cloud save games it actually shows
up just like the memory card and hard
drive does now Microsoft is offering you
511 Meg's of storage in the cloud and
from there if you aren't on someone
else's Xbox you can go ahead and bring
in your safe files provided you've
already saved them to the cloud now
we've already had call duty saved here
I'm gonna go ahead and move it off just
to show you how easy it is and that's
that but if I want to move it back I can
do that and then if I want to sign on
someone else's Xbox all my save files
where I left last left off in the
campaign that will all show up and this
works for any game just like a memory
card so that's kind of a it's kind of a
general overview of what we're gonna see
for the new dashboard update there's
plenty more in store a lot of video
content to come including the YouTube
app a much improved Netflix app we've
seen a preview but we don't have it here
unfortunately now again all that should
be arriving the week of this number for
through a role to anyone that has an
Xbox 360 and that's it now if you don't
mind me I'm gonna start placed on Call
of Duty
come here you what go on be off the set
