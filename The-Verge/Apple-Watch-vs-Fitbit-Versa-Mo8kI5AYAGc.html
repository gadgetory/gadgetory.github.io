smartwatches it's really kind of cute
what do you mean still trying things
the Fitbit Versa is only the second
SmartWatch that Fitbit has released and
it's going up in the mass market with
this one
this isn't for fitness freaks or
SmartWatch nerds this is just for
regular people who want a smart Fitness
watch that product already exists and
it's called Apple watch which is great
if you have an iPhone but if not this is
the watch you need to look at this is
the new Fitbit Versa it joins the Fitbit
ionic which came out last year and this
is supposed to be a little more
accessible what does that even mean with
one it's less expensive than the ionic
the ionic costs $270 where's this cost
$200 incidentally that's also less than
that Apple watch Series one you've got
over there that's true an entry-level
Apple watch does started around two
hundred and fifty dollars or more
$250 or more but that's because it's a
well made SmartWatch it's made with
durable aluminum and has this nice
Retina display and in my opinion it just
has this universal design that appeals
to lots of different people so does this
that's because that looks like an Apple
watch that's not true
I mean it's got these carved edges here
and it has an LCD display yeah and you
can see the bezels if you look really
closely it doesn't have a digital crown
and it's just light and it lies flat I
mean compared to the Versa the Apple
watches bulges on our wrists this is
just better sure is the biggest
difference is between these two smart
watches are software and compatibility
unlike Apple watch if it works with
iPhones Android phones even Windows
Phone yep those three users are still
out there but fitbit's operating system
isn't really optimized for certain
things you're not in the way that
Apple's watch os's
like what like responding to messages I
mean on Apple watch I can respond using
an emoji
or a shortcut response or I can scribble
on it and since this has a microphone
built-in I can even use my voice to
respond yeah but that's not all entirely
fitbit's fault it has a lot to do with
the way iOS works or really the way
Apple works and Fitbit says that
shortcut responses for Android users are
coming to the Versa watch into the
future so that's something yeah winter
without quick responses on Android with
that thing I still just don't like the
way that handles notifications the text
is really tiny so it's hard to see
multimedia messages don't come through
on the watch oh did I mention that
Fitbit redesigned its SmartWatch
interface so that it's even easier to
see your health and fitness stats right
on the watch also there are more than
550 apps and watch faces I remember when
the App Store had fewer than a thousand
apps but anyone who's considering any
Fitbit is likely looking at it for
health and fitness I mean yes it's a
SmartWatch but Fitbit is first and
foremost a digital health company and
this tracks a lot of stuff
it doesn't G PS neither does your watch
only Apple watch Series 2 or later have
built-in GPS and those get pretty
expensive what Fitbit does track are
your steps your calories burned your
stairs climbed your heartrate your
distance traveled based on accelerometer
data Apple watch tracks all of that -
like all of it sleep this Apple watch
track sleep no yeah I mean that depends
on if you trust the accuracy of consumer
sleep trackers and the Fitbit first it
also tracks very specific exercises like
running or weightlifting or spinning or
yoga and it gives you your cardio score
which is basically your vo2 max it has
built in coaching oh and it has an app
called relax that reminds you to breathe
you know this is it's funny because
Apple watch tracks all of those same
exercises and has an app called wait for
it breathe this is uncanny
well I'm going on day four with this and
I've only charged it once
what's your battery life like
look I don't know how to break this to
you but recent data showed that Apple is
now the market leader in wearables not
Fitbit and regardless of how you feel
about wearables in general there's good
reason for that
Apple has figured out a way to add value
for iOS users with this watch which is
not an easy thing to do when you're
talking about a tiny wrist computer that
doesn't run apps very well a lot of
people find closing the rings really
motivating for health and fitness and in
general it's just a great little device
for notifications right if you have an
iPhone which is a big if I mean a lot of
people don't want to be locked into an
ecosystem we've talked about this before
and yet they still want a decent
SmartWatch one-nut tracks fitness okay
Fitbit needs a win I'm aware of that the
company has had its fair share of
struggles but based on using this I
think there's a chance that the fifth at
versa could be the mass-market
SmartWatch that ends up appealing to a
lot of people both because of its price
point and its compatibility are you
doing oh it's time to stand doesn't your
watch do that to where we're leaving yep
both of us we're kind of a package deal
but we need to we need to say thank you
to everybody everybody thank you for
watching Lauren's out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
