this is episode 53 for the week of July
eighth 2013 uhhh we're back from july
4th holiday weekend and nobody died
nobody lost any limbs so we're all here
to go and and then ready for another
show i guess i'm dan seifert I'm glad
tsavo and i'm chris sigler i just want
to point something out here that I think
our listeners need to know uh right
before the show started Vlad said hang
on a second I need to drop some
knowledge on Twitter and I'm going to
read for you a dramatic reading of this
tweet the flag posted sauce is to food
as makeup is to your face shouldn't be
necessary but this is the knowledge that
he urgently needed to drop then he
delayed the burj mobile show for
dystrophy one knows yes i donated van
Eyck was sick second that's important
stuff it is it's you had to know it and
then he also had to talk smack about
carrots yes which he apparently doesn't
love as much as we all assumed you did
yeah i mean carrots are just like your
gateway vegetable to get you into the
whole raw food obsession but I'm gonna
have to challenge you on your your your
statement about sauce because barbecue
sauce might be one of the best things
that's ever been invented brandy sauce a
good but you would expect that won't you
won't end to be fair to be fair Europe
in general in the UK in particular don't
have a storied tradition of barbecue the
way the United States does that's true
I'm also shown on the story ended have
the continent a bit but it's absolutely
true I uh you guys you guys might call
it barbecue we might call it some form
of grilling or whatever but we have
established traditions but no like but
like there's of cooking too dude i means
I don't owe in a journal barbecue
flavors in the US right there's like
four regions that have like a distinct
very iconic barbecue flavor and right
and it varies and it's like people take
it super seriously and they have
contests and yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna
a very calendar contextual response and
say barbecue sauce is as iconic to you
guys as the fourth of July and as iconic
to us as the fourth of July to us it's
really just like I just it's just
another way of mixing up ingredients
yeah it's a good way to put it yeah but
you guys celebrate before the dry is the
day you lost who celebrates that the the
the British and people living in Great
Britain they sent right yeah well that's
all bruh celebrate is wrong wordy you
acknowledge even now maybe maybe some
people who are you know Gouda schmoozing
their bosses might get a day off or
whatever but nobody really celebrates
getting beaten and just getting rejected
for a whole continent that's fair anyway
my only point is that there's no such
thing as like Edinburgh style barbecue
Edinburgh yeah you see just totally
butchered up Chris you and I do that one
and it look how it's spelled it's
spelled Edinburgh yeah no I totally
agree that's really great listen the
first couple of years that I was here in
the UK I used to say things like
Tottenham and lace Esther they were a
vesture and Tottenham we you said
Tottenham the same way twice no it's
Tottenham that's how it was to Tottenham
okay anyway okay I'll never understand
British English let's let's let's Chris
on its Chicago and said Chicago yeah
this is true this is true so uh the past
week has been kind of leaky huh like it
seems like everyone that is responsible
for keeping announcements under wraps
has went on vacation and let's just jump
into to nokia's got a big event
scheduled for thursday ah it's been
teased ten times over and they've
promised to do something something
related with cameras right like their
invite said to zoom in to see what's new
or something something corny like that
and so it's been longer if that thing
and I need to just pick pick up on that
uh it is basically impossible to leak
this phone that has been announced on
the 11th dont preach be thursday this
week because nokia said firstly tease
the event they said zoom in so you can a
new is going to be camera focused
camera-centric then there were a couple
of little leaks and then nokia just went
to straight up tweeted for 2 1,000,000
reasons to pay attention or whatever it
was and at that point is just like yes
it's a PureView 808 sensor its place to
get a windows phone it's like nike just
pre announced itself like the event is
going to come and the only thing that
can be due to stimulate any excitement
is probably have a lot of executive
wearing a sports outfit and I don't know
diving into a swimming pool something
after the head jo harlow dunking at the
London event which I totally approved of
you know when a most living 925 jo
harlow dunk tuna like a 6-foot rim that
was awesome are you serious what was she
was she was she hanging off of it we
don't work I into the 925 like I don't
understand how did you guys miss this
will i bugged it I didn't baby because
there was a 4 a.m. eastern but yeah I
didn't see any pictures of jo harlow
dunking but I would like it like 90
pictures of this i was taking like you
know continuous shots of the whole dunk
attempt which is successful is beautiful
it was gonna visuals were hey Duke
uniform friend whose captain of the Duke
basketball team actually I did not know
that they say that Elop to Harlowe is
the new Stockton to Malone oh 25 year
old back man wow I like the image that
just building up for me yeah the whole
purpose was the Lumia 925 and the
introduce a bunch of new camera features
with that it's things like isolating an
object then the motion blur around them
and
taking multiple photos and then
selecting subject brother who might be
motion and you know get rid of things
that you don't want having a photo one
of these kinds of features there are
actually a nice suite of features kind
of an intuitive and weird to explain but
once you get hold of the phone and start
taking photos with it works so what what
it did it was a live demo and it's quite
a brave demo was actually take you know
continuous shots of Jo Harlow running up
and taken that dunk and then editing
that with a software it worked out
really well but as I say the whole
build-up to this event has been let in
quotation marks leak every little detail
about it so everybody is absolutely
clear of what was all to announce today
ah Windows Phone central posted what
looked to be the most official looking
renders of what a final product that we
seen yet uh and then a whole rundown of
the specs of the device and they're
saying that it's going to have the as
expected that 41-megapixel sensor it
will crop down to somewhere on five
megapixels using the pixel bidding
technology it's going to have optical
image stabilization which is actually a
step up above the 808 which did not have
optical image stabilization so that's
pretty cool f 2.8 lens you know in flash
I mean this is like packed to the gills
with camera technology and then as far
as the actual phone it's going to
allegedly come with two gigabytes of RAM
which is the most that we've ever seen
on a Windows Phone device before I
didn't know that Windows Phone really
had a problem with RAM management um so
I'm not sure that's going to make a huge
difference perhaps doesn't needed for
the the camera processing I don't know i
mean there's two things I love about
Windows Phone one is the kind of the
wrap which i think is the best out of
any stock software and the other is just
the efficiency of the OS so yeah I
absolutely don't think that the OS
itself is going to benefit too much from
the extra ram but I'm sure some maps and
things are the camera are going to yeah
and it you could say it's kind of future
proofed I guess but the and then also
we've heard about this before but
there's going to be a pro camera app to
come
along with the 1020 which will give you
all kinds of camera controls that you
might want such as ISO and white balance
of all kinds of things so you know it
looks like an impressive device to me
you know it looks like a 920 almost
exactly the same until you flip it over
and you see this giant camera lens on
the back of it but now let me ask you
guys all the things being equal say it
but just let's just assume that the
carrier has nothing to do with it would
you take a 925 or this out of 10 20 yeah
really 1020 just because I'm such a
camera nerd and I like take a lot of
photos and I can with my phone saying
the night the 925 looks and it feels so
good I know I totally agree with you and
it's probably going to be a lot thinner
and lighter than the 10 20 and then
because the 920 is kind of like a chunky
brick right and it's heavy thick and not
not very nice to hold that the 925 is
the essence of like that design language
right right yeah no wait a more man I
completely agree with you guys the 925
is physically desirable but in my
opinion Windows Phone you don't really
have a shortage of physically desirable
phones like there's the windows phone 8x
das is also pretty nice there's the
Lumia 720 I don't feel there's any
shortage of world design phones well
maybe hear a Samson fan oh it's now when
it comes to well design windows phones I
think we've got plenty of those them
they can she see a txt who yeah that's
sex machine which is good but you know
in terms of really really awesome
cameras with and up-to-date OS I've been
saying this for so long since the ADA
way p of you came out we're lacking in
that department and I really want
something like that because actually one
of the things is going to make me commit
to a phone and stick with it for a year
or longer is having a really good camera
that I know will need to worry about
upgrading and just something I can rely
on its software which I think witness
one can do I just want a camera that can
stop my daughter
when she's running like stop the action
of my daughter when she's running around
and and indoors when it's like you know
not great lighting because we're at you
know my in-laws or my house or whatever
and and she's running around or whatever
every single smartphone camera either
has to use the flash which totally ruins
a shot or just doesn't freeze the action
so uh my hope is that the the 1020 curve
you can actually do that I don't know if
it will but once you once you rather
have I mean what when it when when
you're talking about like photos of your
daughter that you're going to want to
preserve and have for a very long time
and maybe blow up and frame or whatever
once you still rather be using a
dedicated camera for that that's the
thing like people you keep these photos
forever but you know blowing up and
framing them is like the rarest off
chance that you might do the thing that
I'm going to do with it is I'm going to
take the photo and I'm going to email it
to relatives immediately and that's what
I want to be able to do quickly is I
want to be able to take the photo have
it look great and send it off as quickly
as possible so i don't have to worry
about dragging this SD card to my
computer and you know opening up a photo
editing program and tweaking it and then
getting into that whole mess because
that means that those photos are going
to sit on my SD card for a month and a
half which yeah so it seems like from a
hardware perspective the the 1020 is an
s4 zoom done right like it's the concept
of the s4 zoom but done in a reasonable
way not a completely ridiculous ness
that way yeah that's an interesting way
to put it yeah very interesting way
because you kind of insults the 1025 so
you no good reason by associating with
garbage but actually it does bring up a
really good point no Chris which is that
there is a zoom function there's no
mechanical zoom like with the samsung
phone but there is an optical zoom or
crop zoom essentially that you can get
with the getaway peer review and
presumably because it's likely the same
sense it just mildly tweaked on the 1020
which is to say that you can because
essentially so large is because it's 420
megapixels you can crop it right down to
like five megapixels
and get the zoom function that way and
every other phone camera because it's
fixed when you get zoom in quotation
marks essentially digital in it enlarges
the center of the frame whereas this
thing gives you 5 megapixel images that
actually uses a 5 megapixel sensor to
take them so there is that kind of
optical zoom I don't know if its optical
necessarily but it's like to consume you
can get with it and my general feeling
with the ADA where P of you have been
used it extensively is that it's just an
extra step an extra tier above the
normal smartphone camera oh yeah
definitely and I mean it's taking better
photos and porn shoot cameras so many
times for me that I absolutely see no
reason like if I had to buy a pony shoot
camera I would probably just go out and
buy a negative way beauty it's just that
it is just that good so again
associating it with a good not an
awesome but a good OS like Windows Phone
it's just something to really look
forward to I think I think I segreta me
the biggest disappointment here is a
Windows Phone Central's leaked today
showed it in yellow black and white and
not saying so that's that's obviously
going to be the biggest disappointment
is that if I can't buy inside it I don't
think I mean so this happened last time
write like that they showed the 920 in
every color except cyan I'm sorry people
that just sounded so traumatized this
happen lost up didn't it happened I
remember well if it did it didn't happen
and I blew up I lost my my my poop use a
non-threatening term I lost my poop and
and wrote a piece about it and and sure
enough it turned out that the science
did exist and it was an AT&amp;amp;T exclusive
at least in the US was that was the I
don't know if the cyan 920 was ever
released outside the US actually because
I had to I dug someone to tom warren so
cool so presumably who by the way has
one in every color I think yeah horn is
single-handedly account
for half of 9 20 sales crustiness oh
yeah I don't know if the sign was ever
sold in Europe point is it feels like
Nokia uh I mean they must have the
market research to suggest that Sian is
not a popular color which just breaks my
heart because I think it's really cool
and it's it's a shame because other
companies are trying to do cyan as well
and they're not like hitting the mark
like not a tease s4 active comes in this
cyan esque color and it looks terrible
like it it's just off and he hasn't look
right it just looks cheap whereas
Nokia's able to has been able to at
least you know make it look good for for
BMW fans in the audience you'll
recognize Nokia's shade of cyan as
laguna seca blue way is like if you look
up a little goodness sake a blue BMW it
is it is spot-on perfect with the color
that Nokia is using like if you had a
Laguna Seca blue m3 and you you have to
get a cyan Lumia 920 to match well
anyway they're not doing the 925 in sign
as far as we know right and in fact only
doing in two colors right they're doing
it in like a light and a dark back I
think no this is least three there's
this white back the dark one and a
silvery grey one mmm well still is like
super boring choices but with it I guess
with a 925 there they're encouraging you
to customize by using that stupid
snap-on back which they often use while
charging that right there just to do
things i want to bring it first of all
so what you're saying chris is that if
you buy the cyan leave you 920 and you
put it on top of your cyan BMW there's
gonna be a perfect match yes it'll be
like there's a screen in your car
because you won't be able to see like
it'll just blend so perfectly yep it'll
be absolutely perfect a perfect match
the red one I mean don't get me wrong
that the glossy red 920 is a very
attractive phone but we haven't seen we
haven't seen the 1020 leakin read either
yet hmmm yeah just like yellow white and
black is it I think yeah and I gotta be
honest yellows not worried like I've
seen the the 920 in yellow and i'm not a
huge family maybe I'll just
later the black is the worst I mean
matte black is always the worst because
it literally looks like the phone is
like 3d printed it looks like a it looks
like the first prototype of the phone
that you just ran through a rapid
prototyping machine it's the like glossy
black is passable but matt black is the
world on that point unless it's unless
it's the matte black of the iphone in
which case it's okay but that's also
metal yes exactly cuz it's metal and
it's true it's not actually really black
but let's acknowledge Dita's right who
haters with us no I'm coming right back
we really were we were ever so briefly
in the bone zone whoo but under quite
about matte black I saw one of those f1
mclaren mercedes cars you know the 1
million pound ones Chris yeah is SLO
when it came that's a lie I don't know
are you talking about the one that was
in suede because there was one on the
internet either yesterday the day before
there was like a swated Mercedes no no
it was just it just had a matte black
paint job and the thing is you can see
all the dust I had gathered on it and I
just thought man what a waste well you
know interesting thing about Matt uh
paint colors on cars is that they are so
difficult difficult to maintain that
typically if a manufacturer sells you
one as in as an oem paint they'll force
you to sign a waiver basically waiving
the warranty on the paint because it's
not washable you get like you basically
can't drive it and can't wash it so the
owners experience yeah it's beautiful
like if you have a new one that's clean
like met grey cars are absolutely
gorgeous um but yeah they're they're
impossible maintained yeah literally the
second Vlad said hey deters here the
Google+ plugin crashed completely and
all I could hear was you guys saying hey
dieter and I had quick so nice guys hey
so we just were deep and yeah we're deep
in the 1022
uh so it looks like the show has been
going for maybe 20 25 minutes so I'm
assuming the only thing you guys have
managed to cover is the fact that Chris
is probably angry about the lack of a
cyan I imagine we actually just we just
did an encoder in that yeah it's
actually more positive than I thought
he'd be and he's hopeful I think he's
hopeful that they just haven't revealed
it it's not not gonna happen yeah yeah
there's one other thing to mention
though just on the topic of colors and
designs and things like that while we
recently introduced the w eight or
whatever it was again kind of a
mid-range II windows phone and the
rip-off vibe from monkeys designs was
really strong with that one like they
had a yellow a red the color schemes
were the same the designs were more or
less the same as the Nokia phones which
me was kind of chapin lame these guys
it's also kind of an upgrade because
while we and ASA when you used to bother
windows phones add some really atrocious
designs following in Samsung's proud
footsteps with that OS I can't say
Huawei is known as a company with a
cutting-edge iconic design language are
you kidding they had an edge and
elegance man agent elegance so read it
somewhere if you want to see what the
1020's output will be like um you could
actually see sample footage our sample
photos that were leaked by all people
Joe Belfiore of Microsoft had posted
some images this week to his flickr
account that were the exif data was
tagged the Lumia 920 ah it was
intentional yeah I can't I can't shake
the feeling that it was because like if
you look at the pictures they look good
they show off you know there's the lead
shot on our article if you if you read
the verge has Joe holding up his his
metal from a marathon he is running in
and like it's super perfectly sharp it's
got great depth of field looks awesome
for a smartphone camera uh and
unfortunately they were taken down after
it got wind that they were they were
posted but
you know if they turn out to be accurate
then you know it's probably going to
have pretty impressive camera results
which is not a huge surprise I guess hey
I mean this is this is just emulating
Vic Gundotra who posted some pictures
from the nexus 10 I think it was either
the nicer than one of the Nexus turn now
we were terrible tablet is definitely
happening he posted a couple pictures of
himself on a page the Jewish those those
pictures were terrible why it was sunny
I mean at least the widow was nice there
but it makes these existence really
relatable when you see them like I'm on
a beach I'm riding a boat in a river and
I have a meadow and things like that
it's like yes that's an accident a photo
to post to do I said I just had a
horrible vision of Nokia in some
dystopian future nokia releases a
Windows RT tablet with a giant PureView
hump on the back oh my god you think
about it so many missing big enough that
it could we could work as a stand and
like you know down as a diesel or it
could sit upright that's true that's I'm
getting I'm getting pinged my Tom he's
telling me that Bell Furies pictures are
back on flickr so if you want to go
check them out there they're back there
to look at I think autumn back up what
the heck I don't know cats out of the
bag i guess the internet is the internet
man and it's not like nokia was ever
trying to hide what's going on with this
phone for a minute yeah they put no
effort into it whatsoever so does this
mean that the 808 was basically just
like a consumer education campaign to
get people ready for for this on Windows
Phone I thought it was much an exercise
for them as it was for consumers I think
we needed you know Windows Phone we know
for a fact they've said the past that
Windows Phone was not technically ready
for that camera and but the technology
was and they had some p.m. sitting
around and also it made like a great
send-off for symbian like finish on a
high note so and it was obviously a
technology demo or a look what we can do
type of thing well they need a time to
develop
nokia procam and it's big giant purple
icon hey guys murmur and this camera
grip that's allegedly coming awesome
don't I love the camera grip i think the
camera grip is a great idea its most act
as a battery too but it's got like this
puny 10 20 milliamp hour battery which
will get you like twenty-five percent
more charge yeah well on it's not a
faint if they included it in box I would
be way into it but you know it's gonna
be like a sixty-dollar accessory but I
was gonna say you guys remember that
time that Aaron's a forest wrote this is
my next on the 808 okay he lived up to
III wasn't even at the verge at the time
and i'm pretty sure that i made fun of
them yeah did he live up to it fled how
long do you yes he owns an 808 I mean I
don't know how much you can get yeah I'm
owning it and using it or super yeah I
own a lot of things in either 50 my god
so can I tell you sorry I'm gonna take
this completely off topic we don't talk
about the 1020 is there more to say uh
there's a complete there's no more to
say another 10-20 but Tom Warren uh who
is like the most insider on anything
microsoft says that we may see a second
device and maybe some major app
announcements on thursday as well so
nokia might have a little bit more open
sea where we suppose to disclose that
information or was that yes he told me
to so you know that like so webos is the
the app store the certificates going to
expire on july twenty third and like
none of the online services or bunch the
online services are going to start
failing unless you install this really
hacky update to the app catalog that
they've come up with okay anyway so i
used to run precentral back in the day
and in a part of my job i needed to you
know register a bunch of palm profiles
to you know test different devices and
whatever and so but they're all tied to
my gmail because with gmail you can add
a plus and then another string and have
a you know that look like different
email addresses in the past 12 hours i
have gotten six emails from HP about the
mandatory webos system update 6 and i'm
expecting more because they're coming in
like every couple hours
I'm pretty sure that I'm gonna have like
20 emails about this thing and I I'm
just ignoring every single one of them
i'm just going to let them die i'm gonna
let them i'm gonna let them fade away
webos is that's kind of sad can i still
use my touchpad with android if i don't
bother to upgrade yes but you can't you
you need if you don't do the the
upgrades you have to go through this
really incredibly hacky thing to to get
the new certificate onto your device
it's um set the network time to off set
the delete date to July first 2013 and
then the app catalog will work if you
set the time back normally you can set
the time wrong it doesn't work but they
hacked their servers to work with your
matrix or something and what I feel bad
for the one poor bastard hey dude no no
wait I was I should have told him I went
to this drop box Dropbox developers
conference this morning and they
announced the new tools to take on
iCloud and it's actually really
interesting but there's no like actual
products using it yet but it's cool for
apps like anyway one of the guys working
the registration desk was using an OG
sprint pre without the touch tones
classic was shiny back yeah shiny back
things cracked the home button was
completely white because the chrome
rubbed off on those you know was he
using it ironic clear oh I think he's
like genuinely using it to get stuff
done and I saw it was like oh I gotta
help that man he needs my help so bad
totally forgot because there's no way
that he knows i still owe on to die i
saw an OG one on the train a few weeks
back and this woman was was typing away
furiously messaging and clicking the
ball and everything and I just blew my
mind yeah you know this this entire
experience is actually a good kind of
quotient retail for the rest of us and
investing ourselves too heavily in more
about operating systems or cloud
services because you I mean I don't
worry all right right right
things like that it is it's not the case
that I trust cloud services I'm
inherently distrustful kind of like
Joshua cops teen on our team who's like
everybody's trying to get me completely
paranoid about things so he doesn't use
many of these services but for everybody
else if you ever decide okay I trust
these guys at ross Apple not to
disappear overnight which might be a
fair assumption this there is still a
risk you know you you start to load up
all your photos and documents and things
and the more reliable services the more
in danger you become when you know
things might fail whether it be like a
one of thing or you market share just
kind of falls off it's kind of
heartbreaking but yeah we see it all the
time where things getting shut down I
think just not such a new yala i never i
an i never found a perfect replacement
for sketch i'm still pissed that that
was killed off yes skitch wasn't killed
off it was just ruined yeah yeah is
ruined and shoehorned into Evernote yeah
so i'm currently using a thing called
slingshot which throws it into dropbox
and see i hate that man because it
relies on dropbox no I love it cuz it
lies on dropbox oh yeah but you like
draw a little squigglies on your
pictures yes that's a problem that is a
problem you need to be able to draw a
mustache on it before you upload it
right the problem I have with relying on
dropbox is Dropbox upload can be kind of
slow and then if I'm in like a bandwidth
constrained environment like oh you're
something I'll turn off this doesn't
upload via Dropbox it uploads to dropbox
independently on its own like i will
pause dropbox when i'm in a low
bandwidth situation but rice will still
work and you'll be able to share a link
to it yeah that's weird i know man is
crazy I'm sorry totally derail this
conversation we can come back and start
talking about phones again let's talk
about motorola yeah this leak theme
going since nokia was being leaky
Motorola's being just as leaky because
this past week we've seen pretty much
all the details that you could want
about the Moto X and that we've even
seen other more
rolla phones leaked images of this
alleged droid Maxx and or maybe droid
ultra maybe I don't know what the name
is going to be for the verizon that
looks like a successor to the razor line
let me tell you what the names going to
be the name is going to be screw you
motorola for making a droid that has
higher specs than the Moto X which is
what I'm going to want to get thanks a
lot for making me get the less powerful
less awesome phone if I want to have an
open phone and not something that is a
drawing that's similar to get to the to
make this podcast really useful in
productive for me what are you guys
enlighten me about what these exponents
because I've been away the past week and
I've only glanced at them and it is it
almost feels like it's been
semi-official it's so much a coefficient
booking information and pictures have
popped up but then it isn't yet official
right it's well it's official that the
Moto X exists and it's official that
it's going to be made in the US and it's
official that Motorola is saying that
this is the smartphone that you'll
design yourself but Motorola proper has
not released any images of it or said
what the specs will be with they've
they've they've also said woodside said
it and I got this again from ball at
technique a couple weeks ago that it's
good and I mentioned this on the podcast
last week that it's going to have an
array of very tightly integrated sensors
that are unique oh and what what that
means I have no idea but everybody's
getting all like worked up into a froth
about this customization thing that
Motorola has alluded to but all of the
signs are pointing to this just being
something lame like colors right yeah so
it looks like you're going to be able to
pick a color for the back plate and then
you can have a custom engraved hope
probably with just some little words
like on ipods back in the day it'd be
cool if you could do like a full thing
but whatever and then they're going to
have some website where when you go to
pick your color then you can pick a
wallpaper
I guess those are the two things and
then they drop shipping to you directly
from Texas and so you can get it really
fast so minus the engraving it's the
same exact kind of customization you get
when you choose a particular color of a
nokia phone right i would just like to
point out that if somebody i actually
drop to the livery onto my porch i will
pay more for that delivery like if they
literally just bombarded it in if I mean
because that's kind of delivery people
in the US workers drop things on you
know but I drop shipping it to you from
Texas and I just got this image of like
a 1930s intrepid pilot you know putting
on the goggles and I've got a motor wax
delivery go come with us or perish in
power shooting it down yeah well so it's
funny you say that Vlad because there
used to be I don't know if anybody else
remembers this but there used to be this
this home improvement store in the u.s.
called home quarters uh and they had an
ad campaign you can probably find it on
YouTube where it was like these guys
flying around and dropping bombs on
people's houses um of it like home
quarters bombs that I think contained
products or something and and people
found it so offensive that it basically
like put the company out of business
they no longer exist so it did the the
bottom line is that i think your idea is
probably not wise from a business
perspective I guess I guess the issue in
the offensive part about that would be
the implication you know when you when
you're dropping people home improvement
items is that your home is already fix
it up like to turn back to the beginning
of the program talking about source and
makeup you know it's like hey here's a
free makeup I mean what what what is the
implication would you say that's people
it's true you need it um usually any
delivery service and and this is a free
business idea which I'm just throwing
out there and whoever wants to
capitalize on it they're free any
delivery service that offers is an
alternative when you're not home to
harris you the package into like a
backyard which reportedly secure right
there a drone delivery service in New
Yorker joke about that happening well
there should be yeah that's just like a
genius way to re-employ those machines
that was a burrito delivery service or
something right oh yeah something like
that or pizza I don't know but I know
your back but so the specs on this moto
x the reason I was complaining earlier
is we're expecting it to be basically a
mid-range phone right think it'll be
high-end in the mid-range like it'll be
a really solid mid-range on but it's not
going to be like this thing blows
everything else away I think it's gonna
be very similar to like when the nexus 4
was released last year yeah we're
talking about a 720p screen and I don't
even I don't know if I care about the
rest as long as it's fast uh I guess I'm
okay I'm okay with a 720p screen even if
everything is pointing to this being
slightly smaller than the most of the
smartphones that we've seen today but
you know a 720p screen on a 4.7 inch
display is like 341 PPI I don't have a
problem with that it looks great I can't
tell unless I put a side-by-side with a
one or a galaxy s4 I I mean I can't tell
any you know who else making a mid-range
phone really worked out well for is HTC
when they made the first for two days
Wow um so yeah camera sensor on the
first was a pretty bad let me tell you
something the camera sensor is not the
reason that phone lasted for a week yeah
well yeah well what he also dropped it
like a hot rock too ya know there was
actually yeah this is actually very
interesting to me because sitting here
in Europe I've never even come close to
touching the first but from all I've
seen a lot of heard about it it is close
to at least in physical dimensions my
idea phone and it's always bugged me
that ATT did drop it is always bugged me
that HTC didn't fire you generally try
and get whole hours flat I'd be really
interested to know what you think of it
and you know it and and to say add to
your point lad as far as dimensions go
it's like perfect perfect size screen
it's high resolution but you know it is
a letdown on the camera as d dimension
and
the processors when you're used to using
a higher-end phone you do notice that
the processor is slower and there's
actually I mean that there is actually
like a bigger story about why the first
was it wasn't because I mean it may have
been partly because no one bought it i
don't know that no one has actually
released sales stats on it but we heard
you know we ran that report a while ago
basically saying that the first was a
complete disaster for a variety of
reasons one of which was that facebook
had initially promised to not release
facebook home at the same time as the
first and then they did and that I'm
sent AT&amp;amp;T into a knocked a blind rage
and and that the first got there got
their fury was the director subpoena of
their fury so who knows who really knows
I mean all I would say again with my
limited knowledge and me arity with
advice is that whatever the reason for
the first failure I really don't think
it was hcs design or execution I guess
he has limitations it has weaknesses but
I don't think it was a bad phone and you
could you can look at other phones and
you could say well that's obviously
going to be you know nuts and going
nowhere like the optimus v from OG you
know that for by free aspect ratio and
it's like a big ms lab I mean those are
scenes are ya oh actually kill a segue
coming up LG is hosting a New York City
event sometime soon yeah you don't want
to talk about the droid ultra Maxx I'll
draw ultra maxy maxy maxy ultra I think
we just did this with 7 x's on the max
this time she wasn't enough they've
upgraded it looks like good looks kind
of ugly kind of like all the other
racers like I'm surprised that the razor
name is apparently dropped ah but it's
got that same kind of the rivers viber
village yeah maybe they'll bring the
razorback like properly someday was it a
camera rather than come father then yeah
right yeah it's it's Kevlar material but
it's got the same kind of cross cross
stitch look or whatever you call
that yeah sec carbon fiber are the only
thing I can say about this render of
this max or ultra or whatever it's going
to be called is one of the biggest
annoyances with last year's razr HD was
the bezel around the display was like
four inches wide and this appears to
have shrunken that down significantly so
we'll probably have either a bigger
screen or smaller footprint or both so
so LG's event well I'm gonna say that
let's quickly summarize what Motorola
then there's the Moto X there's the
droid maxx in a third one well you don't
up in the air or whether it's called the
droid maxx or the droid ultra or if
there are actually two devices that are
the droid maxx edit droid ultra i think
it's all kind okay here there's also the
the droid combat destruction I if you
follow droids well what is the name of
their they have some like teaser Twitter
account right now Oh they've got some
game that they're doing on it's called
droid combat right yeah and like they've
got like mex that are like different
people like on Twitter get assigned to
mex and they're supposed to shoot at
each other it's redic it like that
everything about the droid brand is so
violent and destructive and the Twitter
account like if you follow they're just
they're they're always talking about
like combat and like oh it's the wall
it's the weirdest thing I got it I got
it they should call it the droid bro the
droid bro I like that huh / file like
that that's not bad you're you're you're
very very explicitly excluding 51% in
the market that way instead of
implicitly excluding 51% the market I
like it up solid plan wow that's a he's
a clean water phase one percent of the
market because I don't improve the hole
bro well you're blue glad your bro I'm
sorry man your bro deal you know it
anyway the bro might be acceptable used
it would be in from a pronunciation of
heading bro sorry I have to make every
temperature Oh LG LG let's actually talk
about it because it's interesting to me
because LG has helped launch events
previously
done that but they've never at least to
my knowledge in memory they've never
held a single phone event in New York
City in the same fashion that Samsung
HTC in no that's not right oh yeah they
definitely have yeah folk singer phone
it's just they're never memorable so
like you forget about it but ya know
they definitely have I one way the
optimus G Optimus G was announced at
ctia yeah but that this is a party yeah
right I can't remember what theme was we
wish we were Samsung with the mermaid in
a pool Wow I'm just disappointed I miss
that now yeah but really it isn't thing
did they've done launch events fair
enough but they've generally done them
important ship with carriers or after
the Korean knowledge or after like the
London event where is to make New York
the main event in which a new device
gets unveiled and actually not to pre
leak everything themselves would be a
change of practice for og epic but but
you're giving them way too much credit
flat because we all know that LG is a
fast follower so they saw that Samsung
was moving to their own event in New
York and they're like oh that means we
should do our own events in my god what
if what if LG tries to out-weird samsung
that's what I'm saying what was that
good wouldn't put it past them ok well
yo defendant is instead of a Broadway
production it would be like an
off-broadway it's gonna be like Waiting
for Godot but turned into samsung said
the standard with the galaxy premier or
the premiere 2013 event they held in
London which had the most massive stage
of ever seen it was basically like an
Egyptian pyramid top cut off pure white
and then this is a tiny little person
standing at the top of it say hello
welcome to my newest palace of Sam
signals and then introduced like nine
products what was the one was that the
one where they did the word they had the
magician or no that was the galaxy note
2 event right all right
magician Merlin the magician and the
orchestra the live orchestra it's like
they literally don't know it's not that
they don't want to stop being weird is
that they don't know how so we know it's
going to be for the g two because the
invite is great to have you and the g
and the two are giant and in I guess are
in the same font but there and in the
twos case it's actually the number two I
I really hope that I can be proven wrong
but i can't remember last time i was
excited about a new LG phone well here's
the thing this is the g2 about the nexus
4 y.o if i asked you guys to tell me all
about the optimus g without looking it
up can you yeah yes because it's a nexus
4 and because it's a nexus 4 yeah okay
because next focus do i know i don't
really feel like its place may have were
they were different cameras on different
carriers i think like sprint yeah right
13 and 18 t had the eight I forget what
verizon ended up with it I don't think
verizon into the father I didn't get
anything at all if I don't remember
anyway they had the what was it called
the Nitro to or nitrogen here oh yeah
yeah the Nitro hd480 uh but here's a
question this this event is in like
august isn't it was yes i believe it's
august eleventh seven so yeah that's a
whole 14 way guys yeah we can speculate
about that epic event let's speculate
about tomorrow's event because tomorrow
t-mobile is hosting an event in New York
City it's uh promised to make this
boldest moves ever and if you have the
memory to go back to march when last
time t mobile had an event t-mobile CEO
or new CEO john legere literally went
off the rails in what was quite possibly
the most entertaining industry event
I've ever attended it's been pronounced
ledger I think it's it's john ledger
share I like lasagna I'd like to make it
French well anyway so let me tell you
exactly what's going to happen and the
order it's going to happen in tomorrow
okay Ledger's gonna come out onstage
he's going to drop a couple ice bombs an
f-bomb
yeah and then he's going to talk some
crap about the competition then he's
going to he's going to tout the LTE
rollout the sansa del T rollout and
where they're going to be offended 20 n
2 2013 then he's going to announce that
they're moving to postpaid no contract
no credit check plans yeah that Dave
reason there was a leak that they had
recently they were making fun of 84 it's
moving to 24 months or something yeah oh
yeah and up I'm not great cycle yeah so
they're going to do that and then
they're going to close out by announcing
a launch date for the 925 and possibly
announcing some other random god knows
what phone that that is my prediction
for the entirety of the t-mobile
béchamel and it doesn't happen Tracy
shaving his beard ok I'll agree to that
sure so Chris I just listened to that
and like I'm waiting I like it all kind
of blurs together so what's the boldest
move the boldest move is was probably
the plans that the fact that they're
like it'll be like the end game for them
moving to the opposite of what everybody
else in the market is doing where like
they just do this last time like we made
it even more normally postpaid ii who
knows a it leger needed another event
where you could swear I mean to me it's
like this is all really entertaining
with t-mobile and it's it's cool that
they're trying to do something different
but like when they poke fun at AT&amp;amp;T for
moving to 24-month upgrade cycles I
could just picture 18 DB and like
totally not caring and and like me like
why I'm not wasting my time bothering
with you because obviously AT&amp;amp;T is
chasing verizon right and I just feel
like you know so there's this rumor of
the t-mobile upgrade club of you guys
seen this yeah briefly it's yeah went up
on tmonews earlier that basically if you
could upgrade as often as you want and
pay the same price that new customers
pay how much per month would you be
willing to pay for it it's this survey
that team will put out so that might be
I don't know like I would pay like
two three four bucks upset like 3 i'd
pay three bucks a month to be able to
walk into a teen ol sorry anytime I
wanted and get something that was a
subsidized price but over the course of
like a few weeks you could bankrupt
t-mobile I mean every day walk in by a
couple GS fours but you know by a 1 and
it was very much more throat on oh yeah
right yeah and then they're eating this
enormous subsidies each time create the
flip side being 18 d or tivo will be
like okay and then they just raised the
price for every new customer equalize it
yeah yeah it's true yeah so new
customers have to pay four hundred fifty
dollars for ya so that's happening
tomorrow afternoon will be their life I
think I'll be there and so I'll because
I tune I'm dieter will be on vacation yo
a dieter case just time I took a
vacation I don't even know you'll you'll
be on a beach sipping margaritas I'm
going to Palm Spring rubinson the
temperature is currently I think 110
degrees i'm not excited you're probably
not going to be outdoors my guess yeah
anyway um hgo well that is the most
enthusiasm I've ever seen better enough
vacation really hot man I'm not used to
that been a while since I've experienced
100 and 500 10 degree time Minnesota boy
worried about 100 510 Minnesota that
happened really once once in a night
they couldn't play hockey for a week
like Jesus granddaddy's telling stories
about saturday I'm sorry dieter let's
talk each ecs HTC finally released that
well you know not finally but eventually
released the android 4.2 update for the
HTC One but I in Europe right now yeah
it's it's well I think its global you
know excluding the US right I notaries
able to like definition or not I haven't
looked yeah I haven't heard any us
reports of it but if you're in Europe or
the UK or Asia check it out apparently
it's a great
date it seems to address a lot of the
complaints that we had with Sense 5 on
Android 4.1 they fixed the notification
bar so you've got quick setting toggles
now like you'd expect in 4.2 and they
move that stupid power saver feature out
of your notification bar and they added
lock screen widgets and daydream
features and things like that but most
importantly there's now an option to get
rid of the menu bar so you can remap the
HOME key to act as a long press will
open a menu or if you swipe up on it it
will open Google mat which i think is
really good the amazing thing to me
about that first of all it obviously
address is a major complain for a long
long time but secondly it's it's an oem
basically responding to the reality that
developers are ignoring a holo like what
this also the second time HTC has done
this right like with the 1x it had that
stupid black menu bar and then they
released an update which I don't think
ever made it to the AT&amp;amp;T version but
they released an update for the
international version that you could set
a long press to one of the soft keys to
activate the menu which is really
surprising to me that they didn't just
launched the HTC One with that feature
and now they've updated it to have that
feature yeah oh it's a good update I
know what's gonna happen you realize
that it's gonna play out 18teen will get
this queue for it the earliest may be q1
2014 uh so just don't get your home I
don't think Ryan's gonna get anything
for eyes don't launch with it when it
finally is it an 8 because it isn't 11
hasn't washed on Friday no we still
don't even have a date they just said I
think this summer's I'd leave the last
guidance I gotta get on that they gotta
get on that announcement post haste yeah
they really do but how do you guys feel
about Android in general because like my
vibe at the moment is that no matter how
awesome the Moto X is in terms of design
in hardware in order to achieve these
premise of a device you would have to
step up the Android experience you know
you have to step up with the software
and I just feel like Android hasn't
really taken any major steps forward for
a long while
I mean yeah we're point2 yeah 4.2 is
getting in Android terms for pointers
getting pretty old it and it was very it
was very iterative on top of four point
right brave it's just an evolution of
that design with a couple of more
features added like what are we
expecting in 43 like ble that's about it
if you support me I mean right like even
the Google editions of the one and the
s4 have the new camera interface that
just listen spected supposed to come
with with theirs I mean if we look back
a few months we can anticipate a key
lime pie or something like it to be
introduced at Google i/o they don't mean
the would be some people expecting it
now just give me hope I think they're
trying to move to an October cycle for
like for that because that was the nexus
4 right yeah yeah I was more than Isis
the Galaxy Nexus and the nexus 4 were
both kind of like that october november
range I this is what I want from Android
I don't want really more features I know
the motorola is supposed to be touting
all of these sensor features but maybe
those are cool maybe not I want more
efficient process I want I want more
better battery life and you know I want
to be able to use a dual-core device and
still have the same speed that i can get
with a a quad-core device so i just want
a more efficient or less I want project
butter to not be BS because like every
time you know i've been using iphone 5
as my primary phone for a while now and
what sucks is that it becomes harder and
harder for me to use an android device
every time i try now because all the
apps that I'm accustomed using just
perform like garbage on Android and like
you don't realize that when you're using
Android is your primary device for a
long time but when you're coming from an
iOS device it's really noticeable it
there are a few android apps that have
really awesome performance it great
scrolling and they do everything right
uh but they're so few and far between
especially compared to Iowa's I have
solution for you guys butter it's it
it's like the general app framework
there's something fundamentally broken
about Android and the way that
developers make apps on it that I don't
think it's necessarily their fault but
it's just not as easy to make something
awesome with Android as it seems to be
an iOS and like what I want from Android
more than anything right now is like
incredible quality apps
that don't make me feel like I kind of
wish I was on an iphone right now like
that's that's it like I prefer
interesting i think i had free more
total solution for you both question
detail what's that um and that is
upgrade your iphone to iOS 7 all right
because then your phone is going to chug
is going to crash apps on go to perform
as well and you're gonna be like hey
this is just as good sandra it's fine
they're equal the initial I mean I've
read a few posts about it beta 3 seems
to be not terrible um but I have you
know I mean I haven't in terms of betas
not yet so you can still expect terrible
battery life and you know probably a few
apps not not working right but aside
from that I think we have a really good
grasp of what we want so dance demands
are more and better and deters demands
are incredible apps so as you wish list
guys what better battery life that's
really gonna happen that's really like I
don't want to be surprised when a phone
lasts all day I want to be like that's I
want that to be like just expected we're
like it just is so you want to droid
maxx yeah well they're not being a droid
razr maxx HD but now he wants of things
well i wanted to be like in a nice
normal phone right like like I hate to
use this ancient tired argument but the
iphone has a 1440 million of our battery
and these android devices have batteries
that are almost twice the size and and
the iphone could still outrun them on
battery life my ex I can't I don't know
what you're smoking my iphone like I I
you know I take it off charge it at
around seven in the morning and by let's
see where am i right now I'm at
forty-one percent so yeah that's a
pretty long as website is for you Chris
that's pretty great you have gone from
seven to 7 p-7 am central's and it's
like what 430 central now yeah so you
are got at nine and a half hours and you
still have forty-one percent left oh
yeah but it's gonna be dead like it will
be completely dead by probably seven
30 or eight yeah i mean that's crap okay
that's not happy about it I a battery
should like if a battery can just last
until the following morning that's all I
ask for doesn't have to last two days
just has less pull the next morning is
opposing your anxiety at the moment
Chris yeah that one to the moon yes yes
wed I want to throw my phone at the wall
ah man I mean look I'm I'm being
facetious but actually that's kind of
true we know these devices and the
battery's running out I mean one of the
biggest upgrades maybe even the biggest
upgrade I've ever made in technology my
life is buying the macbook air because
from that day until today I just stopped
worrying about better life on my laptop
remember that that has 11 who are you
know the 2010 late 2010 matt cain but at
Legion what I mean cuz I can kill fifty
to sixty percent of my battery's life in
an hour on a Mac MacGarry today ok you
guys must have the 2011-2012 models I
have the twenty twelve year all right
exactly 11 battery life went downhill
from since its way 10 2010 and well that
has well one is absolutely yeah and and
has we jumped it back up but my point is
that when i went from my old windows
laptops which would last an absolute max
is like five hours if I really monitor
the battery use to this thing which can
you know go seven hours without any
problem whatever I'm doing it's just a
major difference and you know these
things short battery life I mean that's
the other thing I didn't pick up
smartphones for a long long time
everyone and the team was using
smartphones I'm saying you know you can
use can access your email do all these
other useful things as opposed to just
receive text messages with your phone um
but I kept away from smart phones
because feature phones would last for
like a week which was kind of handy you
know because each other anything with
them you charge up on a Sunday
you get all your text messages you send
off with extra cheese and then sunday
i'm i'm charging my phone again yeah
play snakes too wow I stopped playing
snake after the Nokia 5110 snake to just
the biggest oh yeah oh yeah I truth yeah
personally I think snake to was the
reason Nucky's that's an operation right
now that was a black do they the start
of the age group of brick breaker you
know yeah and they didn't even offer it
on blackberry 10 why do you think no
buying blackberry 10 exact can't play
brickbreaker right but brickbreaker
isn't far less compelling experience
without a rollerball right of course
it's true I'll dude what would it
wouldn't be here is it a jog wheel if
library actually had something really
compelling in blackberry 10 that would
just burn so bad for the people read the
flag with playbook and will promise
blackberry 10 and then didn't get it
wouldn't it yeah remember remember like
a year and a half or two years ago when
some Buster's stole a semi truck full of
playbooks more valued at like millions
of dollars yeah I wonder what JFK Vern I
wonder what happened to those hot play
books like you think someone's using
them or do you think they ended up in a
dumpster what was that real look I kind
of feel like you might have been some
weird attempted viral marketing or
something I the course i think was
reported torsten high on a ski mask and
led the highest it was like on tourism
has the most polite robbery ever it was
it was like point break he had a Reagan
mask in the end he should all right so
sprint softbank looks like it's gonna be
done this week spring angle God
acquisition of clearwire thank dad
tomorrow softbank and sprint are
supposed to close and thus i can leave
us behind no no because moody's just
downgraded softbank's
bonds to junk status what no bring ya
just happened forget imbalance print
that's the most guys have money
apparently not if they spend all their
money on their insane I just learned
about these insane softbank commercials
have you guys seen him no they are
completely met so that the whole concept
of these commercials they've been
running for years is that there's this
like husky kind of like abusive white
dog who plays the father of this family
of humans then there's there's like the
wife and then and then they have a
sudden like an adult son and then so
wait there's this white dog this asian
wife and then a black son and then and
then like some other random person and
that the other person changes from
commercial to commercial so like in one
there was Tommy Lee Jones for no
apparent reason and like the commercials
are completely insane you guys just have
to google them now they're all on
YouTube um like they in the Tommy Lee
Jones one's a one his eyes like glow and
then he turns into a mayor know and then
is his eyebrow grows into a unibrow and
then like he turns ago made or so it's
insane look look them up so my point is
that I think they've they've blown all
their money on these commercials Tommy
Lee Jones is probably like yeah I'll be
in that insane commercial for 10 million
just don't ever aired in the US yeah but
also in YouTube happened and also it's
unclear why the father is a dog but
anyway do we do we make anything in the
fact that vodafone has a portion of
verizon deutsche telekom as a portion of
team level and now softbank has got a
portion of sprint well clearly what that
means i get je viens if you're if you're
the only real Americans will be on ATT
right well what that means dieter is
that we are now safer than ever from
prism I think the only people we have to
fear are people in the American
government no I I don't really make
anything of it it's a global economy we
live in these days it's like you know
companies are going to be shake
and making connections all over the
world and I'm not surprised by it i'm
not i got a writer i thought there were
laws in place uh apparently i'm wrong
but i thought there were actually laws
in place to prevent majority ownership
by a foreign company of a domestic
telecom company well they were but
definitely like concerns within Congress
about it but they're mostly concerned
about softbank buying chinese parts for
the network hmm i don't know and the sec
and then the Justice Department put up
much of a fight for now springs up a
dish was definitely trying to play the
jingoism angle with some of its late
stage PR right before the deal went
through they were like I can't remember
the exact terminology they were using
what they were definitely trying to play
it up but you know the other thing is
this is actually good in terms of
diversifying service providers in the
u.s. because the alternative sub bank as
question said was dish and this already
provides services in the US and the more
of these companies you have that
concentrate a wide variety and breadth
of services for this competition you
have you know if you only have five
companies that provide Oh for services
like cable fixed landline telephone
connections broadband and mobile
connection it's much easier for them to
act as a cartel because there are fewer
competitors and it's constructive and
helpful for them you know if you don't
have four or five to just keep prices on
some sort of parity level between
themselves rather than competing and
trying to drive down prices and the
other thing is exactly the answer is
this a global phenomenon telefonica owns
02 in the UK hutchinson which is hong
kong company i believe is the one
operates three here in the UK 02
recently i think sort of its island
business 23 again i think so all of
these cross-border ownership agreements
and things like that i just kind of par
for the course nowadays yeah vodafone
owns everyone
yeah they're they're kind of everywhere
yeah oh it's not over re this much fun
on in Denmark I was surprised about that
I stand corrected though it is gone
wrong I was actually looking around the
year about second look at like how much
other people pay for the mobile contract
and to get data and you know a few
minutes on a monthly basis Germany is
actually one of the more expensive
places which surprised me because it has
the infrastructure in place and t-mobile
recently famously put throttling limits
on data consumption on a monthly basis
things a lot so you kind of thought it
would be competitive but everybody else
kinda has a parity of around 20 pounds
or something from our free to get data
we can contract this up by that but
Germany seems to be apparently expensive
it's it approaches you know the sort of
crazy price of the you Americans pay you
choose know what glad the trains are
always on time in germany in germany
right screw how we surprised if your
droid network even works over there in
the US yeah really doesn't yeah it's it
doesn't it said ah so we got one thing
left on our list samsung announced
shipments of 20 million galaxy s force
so people like them not another save
samsung stock apparently i think that
just goes to speak how fickle the wall
street is I mean it's out in mid know a
few years that wall street is fickle but
like how disconnected Wall Street and
like consumers are right and we see this
all the time with Apple people are still
buying our products hand over fist and
Wall Street will you know a tank on the
stock and the same thing happened with
galaxy s4 samsung sold more galaxy s4's
than any other device its ever sold in
its history and because Wall Street said
it should have sold more Wall Street the
stock is plummeting but it has a thing
that it's not under
temp to give an accurate price for the
stock itself it's not an attempt to
accurately value the company it's an
attempt to guess what other people
estimate the value to be is a Milton
Keynes said this he said when you are
you know trying to price and you saw any
stock in the market what you're trying
to do is guess what other people would
guess the price is so when stocks like
Samsung's tank that basically means
people's guesses about samsung samsung
future value in subsidy to profits
previously were wrong so now they're
essentially correcting themselves and
Samsung's stock price falling is
actually just correction and adjustment
to more realistic body which is all to
say yes it's a big fat fantasy which
contributes little to society and
extracts more it I mean there's a point
is people are still going to buy galaxy
s4's you're still gonna love their
galaxy s4's uh you know people love to
call du monde on stock market things but
life is over you know what's actually
interesting to me is Samsung so these oh
 these 20 million phones how does
that compared to the rest of the Android
ecosystem like how many phones is
everybody else shipping at this point
well HTC was five million right away in
a short time compared to Samsung's 10 I
can't remember does this not see one not
even close really oh yeah uh I I hate to
change the subject back but I just need
to point out that if you look in our
comments right now Alex Thompson our
lead moderator has posted two extremely
frightening Jeff's from one of the
softbank commercials where you can get a
really good sense of what I'm talking
about like a really frightening
terrifying sense of what I'm talking
about here I am toward the end of the
the comment list so just a mission work
ah Tommy Lee yeah wow yeah welcome to my
nightmare ever since this was brought
to my attention last week by I was I was
at an event with Kevin fitchard of
gingham and he brought this up to me and
actually Alex links Kevin's piece in
here ever since he brought that up and
I've learned about him and and watched
them I haven't been able to sleep and so
I want to thank Alex for posting these
extremely frightening Jeff's ruining the
next month of slumber for me that just a
tip of the iceberg Chris you should look
at kdd eyes Darth Vader ads I'm sure
they honest naughty but they still kind
of out there I'll have to watch this I I
haven't I haven't seen those I've been
too busy taking in softbank abusive dog
ads and then when you're done with all
this off I just look up Arnold
Schwarzenegger's Japanese energy drink
ads because they're the best things ever
oh no oh my god knows i think i think
that's a good point for us to wrap it
and call it a show this week so thanks

you happen to be listening to a recorded
