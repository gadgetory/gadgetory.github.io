International Auto Show 2015 a lot of
cars inside a lot of new cars inside you
go check them out
that is a Porsche 918 Spyder I did not
expect it to be here will star struck
right now it's kind of like seeing like
Tom Cruise walked by and you're like was
that Tom Cruise and you're like holy
crap yes it was Tom Cruise if you want a
big Cadillac New York Auto Show is your
Auto Show this year they're showing the
ct-6 which stands for Cadillac touring
six and it's gonna have a new engine
exclusive to Cadillac a twin turbo v6
that puts out 400 horsepower so if you
want to sit in the back of a large
Cadillac great now we are at Acura where
they are showing that FX again Venice XS
debuted at Detroit in January but can't
clean up that car there's a new custom
version of the rolls-royce Wraith of
course they're all custom but this is
the rape inspired by film which has
about $40,000 in options on it a little
out of my price range it's hard not to
get excited when you walk by McLaren
but it's especially exciting here
because they have a new model very rare
for McLaren it's the 570s which they're
showing here in - very very nice color
Lincoln introduced the Continental
concept which is a very very very large
sedan that they're targeting the Chinese
market with because Chinese rich folks
there's no other way to put it like to
be driven around so the back seats are
very very cool very comfortable but I
can't emphasize enough is a huge car we
are coming up on the Toyota at v1 which
is not a new car we've seen it in at
least two different versions going all
the way back to Detroit last year but
it's still just as beautiful as ever I'm
trying really hard to care about the new
Malibu but I just can't do it
however I'm a little more interested in
front we are at the Land Rover Range
Rover SV autobiography which is a
$200,000 version of the Range Rover I
don't know if it looks $200,000 but it
does have a bunch of really crazy custom
features that a normal range rover
doesn't have I'm inside of a disco ball
at the New York International Auto Show
one of the loudest announcements of the
snow the loudest announcement of the
show is the new Civic concept in a very
very bright green this will be coming to
the u.s. soon and Honda announced that
they're going to be offering a Type R
version here which is very very rare for
the US market so that's exciting this is
the Vulcan which flag got to see at the
Naval s month and
jealous about horses showed off the
Boxster Spyder which is service stripped
down juiced up version of the Boxster
it's more expensive faster and just
generally better all the way around
Nissan unveiled the new Maxima which is
one of the more extreme looking cars at
the show it's it's very nice on let's
put it that way but 300 horsepower at 30
miles per gallon not bad
this is the Mazda mx-5 Cup which is a
dedicated racing version of the mx-5
that was recently introduced people are
super excited about the new mx-5 and I'm
further excited about the Cup as well it
will be for their dedicated mx-5 racing
series next year and Volkswagen showed
off a bunch of people concepts and here
we are at the Focus RS as the first time
that this beastly little hatch has been
shown in the u.s. after a European
introduction this cars gonna be awesome
let me sole in the u.s. all-wheel drive
over three well over 300 horsepower and
it has a dedicated drift mode what auto
show would be complete without a
gratuitous shot of poor GP I mean just
look at this thing so that's it from the
New York International Auto Show
now where did I park the car</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
