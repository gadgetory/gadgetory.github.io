Clyburn I dissent for sure Riley aye
commissioner Carter High Commissioner
risen whistle I dissent the chair votes
aye the item is adopted with editorial
privileges granted as requested thanks
to the staff for your terrific work on
this item
the FCC just killed net neutrality
Republicans voted to repeal the
regulations on a party-line vote but not
without scathing descent from the FCC's
two democratic commissioners here's what
commissioners Jessica rosenworcel and
minion Clyburn had to say net neutrality
is Internet freedom I support that
freedom I dissent from this fire lease
pun legally lightweight consumer harming
corporate enabling destroying Internet
freedom order I just sent because I am
among the millions outraged outraged
because the FCC pulls his own teeth
abdicating responsibility to protect the
nation's broadband consumers I dissent
from this rash decision to roll back net
neutrality rules I dissent from the
corrupt process that has brought us to
this point and I descent from the
contempt this agency has shown our
citizens in pursuing this path today
this decision puts the Federal
Communications Commission on the wrong
side of history the wrong side of the
law and the wrong side of the American
public because the public can plainly
see that assumed to be toothless FCC is
handing the keys to the Internet the
Internet one of the most remarkable
empowering and abling inventions of our
lifetime over to a handful of
multibillion-dollar corporations and if
past is prologue those very same
broadband internet service providers
that the majority says you should trust
to do right by you will put profits and
shareholders returns above what is best
for you as a result of today's misguided
action our broadband providers will get
extraordinary new powers they will have
the power to block websites the power to
throttle services and the power to
censor online content they will charge
and scoota below the line fees raise
prices unexpectedly and put consumers on
hold for hours at a time who will have
their best interest at heart in a world
without clear and enforceable rules they
will have the right to discriminate and
favor the Internet traffic of those
companies with whom they have a
pay-for-play
arrangement and the right to consign all
others to a slow and bumpy road
particularly damning is what today's
repeal would mean for marginalized
groups like communities of color that
rely on platforms like the Internet to
communicate you see traditional outlets
rarely if ever considered their issues
or concerns worthy of coverage it was
through social media remember that the
world first heard about Ferguson
Missouri because those legacy outlets
did not consider them worthy enough for
coverage until that hashtag started
trending they say just trust us but know
this they have the technical ability and
business incentive to discriminate and
manipulate your internet traffic and now
this agency gives them the legal green
light to go ahead and do so
one broadband provider who had in the
past promised to not engage in pay
prioritization is now quietly dropped
that promise from its list of
commitments on its website
we're told don't worry competition will
save us but the FCC's own data show that
our broadband markets are not
competitive half the households in this
country have no choice of broadband
provider so if your broadband provider
is blocking websites you have no
recourse you have nowhere to go
what's next blocking Oh throttling that
will never happen you say after today's
vote exactly who
is a cop on the beat Dickens can or will
stop them and just who will be impacted
the most consumers and small businesses
that's who everyone from the creator of
the world wide web to religious leaders
to governors and mayors of big cities
and small towns to musicians to actors
too actresses to entrepreneurs and
academics and activists have registered
their upset and anger
they are reeling at how this agency
could make this kind of mistake they are
wondering how it could be so tone-deaf
and they are justifiably concerned that
just a few unelected officials could
make such a vast and far-reaching
decision about the future of the
internet now there is a darker side to
all of this that we have witnessed over
the past few weeks threats and
intimidation personal attacks Nazi
cheering Russian influence fake comments
these are unacceptable some of these
actions are illegal 2 million comments
features stolen identities half a
million comments are from Russian email
addresses 50,000 consumer complaints are
inexplicably missing from the record I
think that's a problem I think our
record has been corrupted and our
process for public participation lacks
integrity 19 state attorneys general
agree they have written us demanding we
halt our vote until we investigate and
get to the bottom of this mess this is
the new norm at the FCC a norm where the
majority ignores the will of the people
a norm where the majority stands idly by
while the people that they are committed
to serve that they've taken a note to
serve are about to lose so much I worry
that this decision and the products that
process that brought us to this point is
ugly it's ugly in the Cavalier disregard
this agency has demonstrated to the
public the contempt it has shown for
citizens who speak up
and then sheer disdain it has for public
opinion when you really wake up and see
what has changed I fear it may be too
late to do anything about it
because there will be no agency in power
to address your concerns
this item insignia Slee ensures that the
FCC will never be able to fully grasp
the harm it may have unleashed on the
internet ecosystem
we're told don't worry the Federal Trade
Commission will save us the FTC is an
agency with no no none nada
technical expertise and
telecommunications the FTC is an agency
that may or may not even have authority
over broadband providers in the first
instance the FTC is an agency that if
you can't even reach a very high bar
approving unfair or deceptive practices
and that there is substantial consumer
injury it may take years upon years for
any remedy to be levied and most
companies don't have years and years to
wait for an answer to evade FTC review
all any broadband provider will need to
do is add new provisions to the fine
print in its terms of service there is a
basic fallacy underlying the majority's
actions and rhetoric today the
assumptions of what the assumption of
what is best for broadband providers is
obviously what is best for America
unlike its predecessors this FCC has not
held a single public hearing on net
neutrality but what saddens me the most
today is that the agency that is
supposed to protect you is actually
abandoning you
but what I am pleased to be able to say
today is that the fight to save net
neutrality does not end today the agency
does not have the final word thank
goodness
for that I will call for the yeas and
nays all in favor say aye
aye opposed no the eyes have it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
