- I did not.
Nor will I.
- This thing sounds amazing.
- And this lets you play multiroom music
from a variety of services,
just like all of Sonoses other speakers.
- But have you heard
how this thing sounds?
- Nope, and I bet I'm about to.
- This is the new HomePod.
It costs $349 and it's Apple's first foray
into the world of smart speakers,
although Apple says it's been
working on this for six years.
- And this is the Sonos One,
which launched late last year,
and for awhile you could get two of these
for the price of one of those.
- Yeah.
This works with Siri.
- And this works with Alexa,
which anecdotally speaking is everybody's
favorite virtual assistant.
- But the big sell with
HomePod is really its sound.
Apple has gone to incredible lengths
to make this thing sound good,
which in my opinion makes
it less of a smart speaker
and more of a high-end audio product.
- No, the big sell with HomePod is getting
you more locked into Apple's ecosystem.
Sonos, which has been making
smart speakers for a decade,
is really all about letting you listen to
the music services you want to listen to,
not shoehorning you into Apple Music.
It's like the Switzerland
of speaker makers.
Sonos wants to work with all
of the virtual assistants.
- Yeah, but it doesn't
work with all of them yet.
- But it will, maybe.
- But it doesn't yet.
All right, let's talk about set up.
In my experience, the
HomePod is a lot easier
to set up than the Sonos.
You just plug it in, take
your phone, hold it near it,
and voila, it's set up.
- So, what happens if you
have an Android phone?
- Well, then you can't set it up then.
- That's dumb.
So, you can't use HomePod if
you have an Android phone?
- Anyway, this is just
a lot easier to set up.
- Sure, I mean, Sonos isn't
exactly plug-and-play,
especially if you have more
than one Sonos at home.
And getting Alexa set up
on this requires going back
and forth between the
Sonos app and Amazon's app,
which is a little bit annoying,
but it's not like it's hard to do.
- I mean, with HomePod
you don't even really
need to open a whole other app.
You can just go to the control center
and go to Home from there
and control this that way.
- Yeah, but the Home
app is so limited that
when you want to do more advanced things,
like control whether Siri can
send messages through the HomePod,
you have to go digging
through your phone settings.
I mean, no thanks.
- Anyway, this is just better.
- We're gonna be hearing
this a lot, aren't we?
- Now, in terms of design,
the HomePod's been
built to really give you
the best sound imaginable in this small,
lightweight speaker.
- Seriously?
It looks like a bulky,
$349 roll of toilet paper,
and it's been leaving rings
on people's coffee tables.
- So, it's not just one speaker.
There are actually eight
speakers packed in here,
all running on Apple's own A8 processor,
and fine tuned with
lots of custom software.
It has seven tweeters,
a four-inch woofer...
- Do you even know what those things do?
- And seven microphones, six
of which are used to hear
your voice so you can control Siri,
and one that helps inform the base.
And Apple uses this
process called beamforming,
which means that the HomePod
creates a bunch of sound beams,
essentially virtual speakers
in the room around you,
and then the speaker
assigns different parts of
the music to these virtual speakers.
- Okay, well like I said, Sonos
isn't exactly new at this,
and knows a thing or two about speakers.
I mean, this has digital
amplifiers and a tweeter
and a woofer and a six-microphone array
and an adaptive noise
suppression algorithm,
and all of that good stuff.
It tunes to the room
just like HomePod does,
although this does take
45 seconds to do that,
and you have to wave your phone
around the room like a nerd.
But, in either case, this
doesn't look like toilet paper
and it sounds great.
- I think it's time for a sound test.
- Let's do it.
- Hey Siri, play Cardi B, Finesse.
- [Siri] Here's Finesse
Remix featuring Cardi B,
single by Bruno Mars.
♪ Drop top Porsche, Porsche ♪
♪ Rollie on my wrist, wrist ♪
♪ Diamonds up and down my chain, aha ♪
♪ Cardi B, straight stuntin',
can't tell me nothin' ♪
♪ Bossed up and I changed the game ♪
♪ You see me? ♪
- Hey Siri, stop.
- My turn.
Alexa, play Finesse by
Cardi B and Bruno Mars.
- [Alexa] Finesse Remix by
Bruno Mars from Spotify,
playing on living room two.
♪ Drop top Porsche, Porsche ♪
♪ Rollie on my wrist, wrist ♪
♪ Diamonds up and down my chain, aha ♪
♪ Cardi B, straight stuntin',
can't tell me nothin' ♪
♪ Bossed up and I changed the game ♪
- Alexa, stop music.
Okay, so the HomePod,
it sounds pretty great,
but I'm guessing what will
be more important to people
are the services that
you can play music from.
Like, with the Sonos, I can
play music from Amazon Music,
Spotify, Google Play Music, Apple Music,
Pandora, TuneIn, I mean.
- I can play music from a lot of
the same services on this too.
- Yeah, but the only service that
the HomePod really
supports is Apple Music,
and since it doesn't currently
play music over Bluetooth,
it's using AirPlay, which means
it's prone to interruption.
If something happens in your phone,
then that interrupts the music.
- Well, I can use Siri on this
to send messages to people.
- Right, of course, and
you can also ask Siri for
the weather or you can set a timer,
although bizarrely you can't set more
than one timer at a time.
Look, there's just a lot that
that $349 smart speaker still can't do.
Right now, the HomePod
still can't tell you
your next calendar appointment,
initiate a phone call,
prompt something to start
playing on Apple TV,
recognize different voices.
So, literally anyone can
walk into your living room
and send an iMessage through
your account from that thing,
unless you change it in settings.
Also, you can't do multiroom audio,
can't pair with another
HomePod for stereo sound,
although that's supposed to be coming.
Should I keep going?
- It's not like your speaker
can do all of that either.
I mean, there are specifically
still limitations with Alexa.
- Yeah, but there are a lot of things
that Alexa can do on the Sonos,
and if it can't, Google
Assistant can do it,
and look, it just seems to me that
HomePod is pretty limited out of the gate.
So, if you're someone who
already has other Sonos speakers,
or you're looking for a smart speaker,
either because you want multiroom audio
or because you're just
looking for the basics of
what a virtual assistant can do,
I don't think the HomePod's for you.
- But if you love Apple products
and you're an Apple Music subscriber
and you want amazing sound,
you should get a HomePod.
- Or don't.
Just don't.
(playful music)
- Hey Siri, play another U2 song.
- Sonos never preinstalled
U2 on any of my devices.
- [Siri] With or Without
You by U2, now playing.
(&quot;With or Without You&quot; by U2)</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
