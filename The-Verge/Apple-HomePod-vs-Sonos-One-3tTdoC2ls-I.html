this thing sounds amazing and this lets
you play multi room music from a variety
of services just like all of so nurses
other speakers but have you heard how
this thing sounds nope and I bet I'm
about to this is the new home pod it
costs three hundred and forty nine
dollars and it's Apple's first foray
into the world of smart speakers
although Apple says it's been working on
this for six years and this is the Sonos
one which launched late last year and
for a while you could get two of these
for the price of one of those yeah this
works with fear and this works with
Alexa which anecdotally speaking is
everybody's favorite virtual assistant
but the big sell with home pod is really
its sound Apple has gone to incredible
lengths to make this thing sound good
which in my opinion makes it less of a
smart speaker and more of a high-end
audio product no the big sell with home
pod is getting you more locked into
Apple's ecosystem Sonos which has been
making smart speakers for a decade is
really all about letting you listen to
the music services you want to listen to
not shoehorning you and Apple music it's
like the Switzerland of speaker makers
son√≠s wants to work with all the virtual
assistants yeah but it doesn't work with
all of them yet but it will maybe but it
doesn't yet all right let's talk about
setup in my experience the home pod is a
lot easier to set up than the Sonos you
just plug it in take your phone hold it
hear it and voila it's setup so what
happens if you have an Android phone
well you can't set it up then that's
dumb so you can't use home pod if you
have an Android phone anyway this is
just a lot easier to set up sure I mean
Sonos isn't exactly plug-and-play
especially if you have more than one
Sonos at home and getting a lexus set up
on this requires going back and forth
between the Sonos app and amazon's apps
which is a little bit annoying but it's
not like it's hard to do open with home
pod you don't even really need to open a
whole other app you can just go to the
control center and go to home from there
and control this that way
yeah but the home app is so limited that
when you want to do more advanced things
like control whether Siri can send
messages
through the home pod you have to go
digging through your phone settings I
mean no thanks anyway this is just
better we're gonna be hearing this a lot
are we now in terms of design the home
pods been built to really give you the
best sound imaginable in this small
lightweight speaker seriously it looks
like a bulky $349 roll of toilet paper
and it's been leaving rings on people's
coffee tables so it's not just one
speaker there are actually eight
speakers packed in here all running on
Apple's own a processor and fine-tuned
with lots of custom software it has
seven tweeters a four inch woofer you
even know what those things do and seven
microphones six of which are used to
hear your voice you can control Siri and
one that helps inform the bass and Apple
uses this process called beamforming
which means that the home pod creates a
bunch of sound beams essentially virtual
speakers in the room around you and then
the speaker assigns different parts of
the music to these virtual speakers okay
well like I said Sonos isn't exactly new
at this and knows a thing or two about
speakers I mean this has digital
amplifiers and a tweeter and a woofer
and a six microphone array and an
adaptive noise suppression algorithm and
all that good stuff it Tunes to the room
just like home pod does although this
does take 45 seconds to do that and you
have to wave your phone around the room
like a nerd but in either case this
doesn't look like toilet paper and it
sounds great
I think it's time for a sound test let's
do it hey Siri play cardi be finesse
here's an s remix featuring cardi B
single by Bruno Mars my turn Alexa play
finesse by cardi B in Bruno Mars next
remix by Bruno Mars from Spotify playing
on living room to stop music okay so the
home pod it sounds pretty great but I'm
guessing what will be more important to
people are the services that you can
play music from like with the Sonos I
can play music from Amazon music Spotify
google play music Apple music Pandora
tune in I can play music from a lot of
the same services on this - yeah but the
only service that the home pod really
supports is Apple music and since it
doesn't currently play music over
Bluetooth it's using airplay which means
well it's prone to interruption if
something happens in your phone and that
interrupts the music well I can use Siri
on this to send messages to people right
course and you can also ask Siri for the
weather or you can set a timer
although bizarrely you can't set more
than one timer at a time look there's
just a lot that that 349 dollars smart
speaker still can't do right now the
home pod still can't tell you your next
calendar appointment and if she had a
phone call prompt something to start
playing on Apple TV recognize different
voices so literally anyone can walk into
your living room and send an iMessage
through your account from that thing
unless you change it in settings also
can't do multi-room audio can't pair
with another home pod for stereo sound
although that's supposed to be coming
should I keep going it's not like your
speaker can do all of that either I mean
there are specifically still limitations
with Alexa yeah but there are a lot of
things that Alexa can do on the Sonos
and if it can't
kugel assistant can do it and look it
just seems to me that home pod is pretty
limited out of the gate so if you're
someone who already has other sono
speakers or you're looking for a smart
speaker either because you want
multi-room audio or because you're just
looking for the basics of what a virtual
assistant can do I don't think the home
pods for you but if you love Apple
products and you're an Apple music
subscriber and you want amazing sound
you should get a home pod or don't just
don't hey Siri play another u2 song so
knows never preinstalled u2 on any of my
devices with or without you by u2 now
playing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
