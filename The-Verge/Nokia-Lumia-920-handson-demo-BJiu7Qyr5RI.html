at Nokia September 5th to vent and I've
just got a hold of the brand new Lumia
920 device this is the new flagship both
for Windows Phone 8 and for Nokia itself
is a pretty stunning thing to look at
and behold it has a glossy surface on
the back this is a brand new yellow
color I'm personally a huge fan of it
what you can see over here is the new
PureView camera it's an eight point
seven million pixel lens sensor rather
with cow sized optics there's a whole
lot of optimizations which Nokia's tells
us justify the pv branding which
previously meant a 41 megapixel sensor
with oversampling on the 808 Symbian
device but anyhow there's a whole heap
of new additions here who got a new dual
core Snapdragon s4 processor as well as
the brand new Windows Phone 8 interface
which is Phone 8 has a whole heap of new
colors it's not just yellow got green
purple etc etc it is still just as
responsible Windows Phone 8 has always
been the display is something Nokia COEs
HD plus its high resolution of 1280 by
720 it looks very good it's an LCD
display it has very nice viewing angles
so have to leave in 920 here next to the
HTC One X the HD 1x is a 4.7 inch LCD
display and there's a 4.5 inch display
on the new Lumia 920 both of them are
really good looking displays in terms of
size you can see these two devices are
very similar I can compare them in
thickness right here again very similar
around the back both of them made out of
polycarbonate this is Lumia 920 use the
same polycarbonate as Nucky's Lewis used
in the new 800 900 and has a glossy
surface like the white Lumia 900 so this
is it our very first look at the brand
new Lumia 920</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
