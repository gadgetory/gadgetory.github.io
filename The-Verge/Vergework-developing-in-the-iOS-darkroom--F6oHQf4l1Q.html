memories being made every day and
they're being preserved on these nothing
there's anything wrong with that it's
just most people don't know how to use
these devices to their highest potential
okay let me help you with that in our
hands we hold a magnificent piece of
engineering but most people usually
don't think about how to frame a shot
know when to use a flash or how to apply
tasteful filters technology has
progressed to the point where we can no
longer blame slow processors small
sensors and bad lenses we can only blame
ourselves luckily I can show you how I
do it
it all starts with capture there are
certain things you can tweak with
software but ultimately you need to
begin with a well exposed sharp starting
point I'll take a minimum of three shots
for any picture I'm trying to capture
sometimes many more if you've got burst
mode definitely use it there are a lot
of camera replacement apps available but
for me the stock app is good enough for
just about any situation with speed out
weighing any additional functionality
provided by third-party apps a stock app
is accessible from almost any corner of
the OS and it's gotten progressively
better over the years the grid overlay
is handy I usually keep it on and helps
keep the rule of thirds always in the
forefront of my mind now I'm a big fan
of bold symmetrical lines that draw the
eye towards a particular part of the
image all encompassing wide-angle shots
are also among my favorite as you could
probably gather from watching a lot of
the videos on our site the grid feature
is key keeping these scenes lined up and
looking clean another useful feature in
stock app is the ability to lock focus
and exposure by long pressing on a point
in the scene disabling the auto exposure
and auto focus and metering to that
specific point this is important when
trying to expose or focus on something
that isn't the most prominent part of
the image which is the default behavior
of the app for more control apps like
vsco cam camera plus allow you to
specify different points for focus
exposure in the case of camera plus
twice this additional control does come
in handy but it requires a few extra
seconds to find and launch the app more
often than not I'm able to get the stock
app to expose the way I'd like using
exposure and focus lock the iPhone 5s
has one of the best image sensors of any
phone but the latitude or the range
between the darkest and brightest points
of the image is still limiting factor
this becomes obvious when shooting a
high contrast scene the most common
example is a bright sky blowing out when
exposed for details in the ground below
this is where HDR comes in by combining
multiple exposures into a single
composite image you can effectively
increase the available range of the
image sensor it's a technique used
everywhere from mobile photography to
digital cinema some use it as an art
form itself but I prefer to use it
subtly stock HDR is handing the pinch if
I need to quickly capture a scene where
I'm forced to make a trade-off between
exposing for the subject and exposing
for the background I'll hit the HDR
button and exposed to the subject this
can save blown out windows and skies
while maintaining proper exposure on the
subject and if I've got a few extra
seconds and there's little movement in
the scene a much better option is a
third-party app called Pro HDR this
allows you to select two individual
exposure points I choose two points that
are not quite the brightest and darkest
parts of the image so it doesn't look
over processed to fake the app then
captures both images back-to-back and
immediately combine them you can then
make tweaks saturation contrast and
brightness of the final composite I try
to get as flattened image as possible so
it's more flexible in the processing
stage Pro HDR will also combine images
from the camera roll so if you
deliberately capture the same frame with
two different exposure points you can
put together an HDR image after the fact
if you combine this with an app like
Auto stage you can put together some
pretty amazing HDR panorama --zz my next
step is processing over the past few
years I've gone through countless photo
apps on multiple platforms on a quest
for the perfect photo workflow I went
through a photo forge - and picture show
power combo phase then I was really into
swang collab for its unique filters and
noir photo for black and white shots by
bouncing between multiple apps I was
able to overcome their individual
weaknesses but I was left endlessly
importing and exporting images to my
camera roll luckily though an app is a
merge that combines great photo editing
tools with fantastic filter options for
now my go-to app is vsco cam i'm a big
fan of visco cams library tool this
allows me to bulk import photos from the
camera roll quickly swipe between them
to judge with the shots flag the ones
I'd like to process and then bulk delete
the ones I don't once I've settled on
the shot I dive directly into the photo
editing tools leaving the filter
selection for later I'd like to get my
image on a good baseline before
stylizing vsco cam has over a dozen
tools available each with the strength
adjustable slider
the key here is moderation the images
here are really compressed and you can
only push them so far before they fall
apart and become noisy I usually start
with the sharpen tool one or two points
in this tool can really make a photo pop
and if you've missed the focus a bit
somewhere in the 4 to 6 range can help
you fake it you can usually get away
with it on mobile just keep in mind that
is your sharpening the image you're also
sharpening the noise from there I'll
push my exposure a point or two in
either direction if needed
I find this tool to be particularly
susceptible to noise when adjusting it
in either direction too much you can
just make it look ugly if a shot is
overexposed sometimes the best treatment
is to just roll with it given the right
filter you can lend some drama to an
otherwise dull image from there I jump
into the color temperature adjustment
dragging the left or right moves the
images overall temperature to be warmer
or cooler my personal preference is to
keep things a bit cooler the deserts
mean this can also come in handy if
you're under some ugly fluorescent
lights between the temperature tool and
a tint tool I usually strive to get skin
tones as accurate as possible
I also lean on the highlight save tool
which reduces the brightest parts of the
image only you can never really get the
detail back from blowing out highlights
but it can help make the effect less
John like I said before though just
letting it go can be kind of cool the
vignette tool is basic but it does help
draw the eye to the center of the image
it's also one of the most overused
tricks in the book and I constantly have
to stop myself from Vinny adding every
single shot I take but it can come in
handy vsco cam has the best filters I've
ever used on a mobile app they range
from subtle to dramatic and each allows
you to adjust them like the editing
tools on a scale of 1 to 12 I have no
real rule of thumb for selecting a
filter but I generally try to find
presets that complement the environment
you wish the shop to take it personally
I'm a fan of the levi's presets as well
as b1 and d5 for black and white shots
once I settled on a filter I'll head
back to the editing tools and make any
final tweaks usually I'll reduce the
contrast a bit or dial down the
saturation after that it's a simple
process to export the shots back to the
camera roll or to apps like Facebook
Instagram or Twitter on occasion with
the right shot adding fake depth of
fields can really make an image stand
out
fortunately the way most people go about
doing this is using instagrams circle
focus filter which always looks bad
using an app called big lens I'm able to
selectively trace around the subject I'd
like to keep in focus the program will
then automatically generate a mask and
blur the background from there I can
fine-tune the background blur as well as
unblurred the subjects I always use the
lowest blur strength setting in fact I
wish there was a lower setting a small
amount of blurring there's a long way I
should also know that there's a high
potential of this image little Mike
garbage so be careful once I've captured
processed and shared my images with the
world it's time to back them up clear
them off my device some people chase
inbox zero I chase camera roll zero
there's no perfect solution for photo
storage right now but I found a good
balance between Google Plus for full
resolution backups of every single photo
I take regardless of whether I process
it in Flickr for just the photos I
consider finished it's refreshing to
have a spot for my finished photos that
isn't among a sea of receipts so this is
my process for making photos in iOS it's
not perfect it's always changing and
it's only one of a million possible ways
to do it
but it works for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
