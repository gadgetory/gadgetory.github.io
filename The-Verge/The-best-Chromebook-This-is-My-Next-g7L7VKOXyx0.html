doing the basics you should look
seriously at a Chromebook for a lot of
people it might be better than a Mac or
a PC but there are plenty of options
with that multicolored chrome logo in
the corner so how do you pick the
perfect one Chromebooks are always cheap
and they always run the exact same
software so when you're looking for one
you should really pay attention to a few
other things
battery life is key and it varies wildly
among different models so does
performance depending on the processor
you get and even for $300 you should
still expect a good keyboard and
trackpad and good and sturdy industrial
design after all you do have to use the
thing even if it's cheap there is no
perfect Chromebook yet no wonderful mix
of everything that I want
but Dells Chromebook 11 comes the
closest it's an 11.6 inch laptop for
$299 with all the bells and whistles a
good Chromebook needs an Intel processor
helps it run fast as just four gigs of
RAM having an Intel chip is really
important in a Chromebook it's really
nicely designed a matte gray box that
weighs just under three pounds and seems
to take a travel induced feeding pretty
well it has a good keyboard and trackpad
despite the smaller size and the best
thing about it is it'll last you an
entire workday or more good performance
good design good battery virtually no
other Chromebook can claim to have all
three fair warning though the Chromebook
11 does have the same problem most other
Chromebooks do if screen isn't
particularly impressive its eleven point
six inches 1366 by 768 with a giant
bezel and a lot of reflections but it
does get the job done and if you're
gonna sacrifice something to get this
price getting only an average display
actually is better than settling for
subpar performance or a frustrating
keyboard trackpad
I'm still waiting on the perfect
Chromebook the one that does everything
exceptionally well and still cost $300
but until that exists the Dell
Chromebook 11 is the best one you can
buy the Samsung Chromebook 2 is the next
best thing though and it's this close to
being the right thing the 13-inch model
has a higher res 1080p screen that is
frankly still a tiny bit washed out and
muted but you'd be hard-pressed to find
a better display on a $399 laptop
anywhere and the Chromebook 2 has a good
keyboard and trackpad plus a really
beautiful design that curved wedge
you'll also find on samsung's high-end
at eve laptops if body is a little
plasticky and it has this faux stitched
leather that I'm not
about but it's light and thin and sturdy
and looks more thoughtfully designed
than just about any other Chromebook its
battery also easily lasts all day but
the Chromebook 2 runs a Samsung Exynos
processor the same one you'll find in
some of Samsung's tablets that means it
works like well the tablet it's good
enough as long as you're only doing one
thing at a time but as soon as you even
try to load a couple of browser tabs
simultaneously the thing really starts
to chug as soon as you pick up any other
laptop the chromebook 2 just starts to
feel slow too slow there's a smaller
Chromebook too as well on 11 inch model
but it's not worth buying it's only
slightly cheaper than the 13-inch model
only slightly lighter only slightly
smaller and it has a much worse 1366 by
768 display and a more cramped keyboard
and trackpad the size and price savings
just aren't worth the sacrifice
especially when it still comes with
exactly the same performance problems
among the larger screen Chromebooks out
there the Toshiba Chromebook is one of
the best it's good-looking almost like a
MacBook Air though it's a bit deceiving
it's a little flimsy and not as well
made as I'd like it to be it has solid
performance thanks to Intel's Haswell
processors I really can't stress enough
how important those are a Chromebook and
it has decent battery life too but it
has a big low res display that is
average at best and pixel II and
frustrating at worse it's a decent
option especially at $299 but you can do
better
same goes for the HP Chromebook 14 which
has the odd distinction of being the
largest Chromebook on the market it
comes in cool colors has solid
performance it also has good battery
life and a nice keyboard and trackpad
but it has one of the worst displays
you'll find on a Chromebook
and it's both heavy and a little bit
cheaply made Chromebooks are made to be
portable to go everywhere with you and
this is not that machine that focus on
portability is like most Chromebooks
have 11.6 inch screens of those the acer
c720 p is one of the best it's not
exactly attractive at all but it has
everything else going for it good
battery good performance decent
touchscreen usable and portable if it
weren't for the Dell Chromebook 11 this
might be the choice but Dell gives all
that plus a design that doesn't look
like it was hacked together in five
minutes out of spare parts there's also
the Acer c720 which is the exact same
thing but without a touchscreen it's
cheaper and gets slightly longer battery
life but it's basically the same
proposition I still hate the design but
if you want a dirt cheap Chromebook that
works this is probably the one to get
the HP Chromebook 11 is sort of the
default Chromebook who likes to talk
about it but it's not very good it's
cheap and plasticky and slow I like its
super vibrant display
which proves 1366 by 768 doesn't have to
be a bad thing and I love the fact that
it charges with the USB cable but this
looks feels and operates like the
cheapest Chromebook on the market then
it isn't so don't buy it and then
there's the Chromebook pixel this is the
gold standard what all other Chromebooks
are supposed to aspire to with an
incredible twelve point five inch 2560
by 1700 touchscreen a fast processor an
outrageously beautiful design that's as
nice as any laptop on the planet and a
great keyboard and trackpad oh except
that it's $1,299 more expensive that
basically all of these other Chromebooks
combined it's a wonderful idea in a
totally ridiculous thing to spend your
money on it's really amazing how far
Chromebooks have come in the last few
years they used to be just a web browser
but now for a lot of people they're
fully capable of replacing your PC
they're getting better all the time
and companies are still looking for that
perfect balance of performance and
quality and price but these are finally
real viable options for everyone and if
you're in the market you can't do any
better right now than the Dell
Chromebook 11 it does everything right
and it only cost $299 that's pretty hard
