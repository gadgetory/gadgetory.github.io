you might cry you might be happy but
let's think for a moment about the
environmental legacy he leaves behind at
home Obama worked to lower emissions of
greenhouse gases from cars and power
plants his boosted renewable energy and
set new records for protected public
land on the international level he has
spearheaded climate deals like the Paris
Accord an agreement among nearly 200
nations to the work carbon emissions in
the fight against climate change the new
presidents of the United States Donald
Trump has vowed to dismantle all that
but environmental groups are preparing
to fight back for the next four years
when it comes to climate policy the
place to watch is in the White House
it's the courtroom the question really
the area of last resort to a lot of
environmental groups in a lot of states
that have supported the Obama
administration agenda a lot of
environmental groups are gearing up to
fight in any data climate action by the
transition already people are fully
staffed up and fully ready to hit the
green go button on litigation trans
record on the environment already isn't
great I mean is that climate change is a
hoax and his action so far dumb bode
well he nominated Exxon Mobil CEO Rex
Tillerson a secretary of state his pick
for the head of the Environmental
Protection Agency is caught Pruitt a man
who sued the EPA over environmental
regulations his transition team also
sent a questionnaire to the Department
of Energy asking for the names of
employees worked on climate policy
that's really intimidating even if
Trump's team leader said the
questionnaire was not authorized most
importantly Trump vowed to scrap the
clean power plan Obama's signature
policy to reduce co2 emissions by
rolling back the CPP won't be that easy
in fact a lot of people are already
trying two dozen states and industry
groups have sued the EPA arguing that it
overstepped its authority under the
Clean Air Act if trance EPA tries to
hold that lawsuit before a ruling is
reached several other states about to
sue the administration the EPA has to
follow the cleaner act and regulate air
pollutants in the US and in 2007 the
Supreme Court ruled that greenhouse
asses like co2 are air pollutants under
that law in 2009 the EPA determined that
greenhouse gases like co2 endanger
people's health and welfare if Trump CPA
declares that greenhouse gas emissions
are in dangerous to the public
environmental groups with Sue and
probably win because I I think it would
be really difficult at this stage to
argue in a legally defensible manner
that there is not endangerment given
what we're seeing with the Greenland ice
melt Antarctica the more frequent storm
or more frequent severe storms i should
say precipitation changes throughout
many many of which have been connected
to human responsibility for co2 and
other climate-related mission in short
global warming the courts are likely to
hear cases on a host of other
environmental issues if endangered
species aren't protected under the
Endangered Species Act environmental
groups could sue the government for
inaction if Trump decides to undo some
of the national monuments named by Obama
under the entities act that could also
wind up in the courts how the course
will rule is difficult to predict Trump
will be able to appoint a new Supreme
Court justice skewing the balance to the
conservative side environmentalists also
worry about some 100-plus judicial
vacancies that Trump will be able to
fill with these appointees the Supreme
Court will get a lot of attention but
the federal courts pose a much more
immediate opportunity a couple of
openings are at the Second Circuit which
has ruled on water pollution before
other openings are in the Ninth Circuit
which is important for endangered
species cases I think the trump
administration can do many damaging
things ultimately laws on our site so
will win cases if we have to bring them
against these robots and we'll also find
that they lose in a court of public
opinion because the public is in favor
of these things not a catch them and
it's a wind up in the corner
yeah okay spelled the same way as when I
was like I think it's wine the veligit
is spelled like wind okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
