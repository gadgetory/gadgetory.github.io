feature you may not know about that's
collecting data on where you go it's
called Google Timeline and it basically
is kind of a persistent location record
every time you call up your location in
Google Maps it makes an entry of you
know this person was in this place at
this time so that that is really useful
for Google for marketing purposes if
Chipotle wants to run a specific ad to
people who they know who've been in
three different burrito stores in the
last month that makes it really easy to
target they can look and see oh okay
this person we know was we can see them
in this burrito store here in this
burrito store here in this burrito store
here and then they can target that ad
and that kind of ad targeting you know
Google is incredibly good at it and it's
one of the things that made them one of
the most valuable companies in the world
but the data isn't just useful for
marketers it's also useful for police we
found two different warrants asking
Google to hand over data on suspects
that would place them at the scene of a
specific crime and all they need is a
warrant they demonstrate probable cause
that we believe this person robbed this
bank on this day give us all the
location records you have and that puts
Google in a very tricky place legally
they don't really have legal grounds to
resist it and if they have it and police
have probable cause to see it they
really have to hand it over but the
interesting thing is that record largely
doesn't exist for iOS users Google Maps
on iOS isn't producing that same
persistent location record there's no
timeline equivalent unless you install a
separate Google app the result is that
when police have a suspect with an
Android phone they know there's this
record that they can order Google to
hand over and that record on iPhones
just doesn't exist
they're very interesting which is why I
here is fine yeah let's look at
