for a week or two I've been playing with
it you've been playing with it and you
already know that there is a bunch of
gestures that you use to get around the
OS but here's a question is swiping
really that much better than just
pushing a button I'm not gonna at the
end of this video come down them they're
the best they're great you should love
them or no they suck they're terrible
there's plenty of articles about that
instead I want to look at why I think
Google decided to go with gestures and
swiping instead of just tapping buttons
on the bottom these gestures are
important honestly because they just
feel different and I know that's really
fluffy and soft and whatever but your
effective relationship with the phone
changes when you are swiping around
instead of just tapping a button and for
Android in particular that tactility
that tangible direct interaction is part
of the philosophy of the design of the
operating system for a few years now
we've had this thing called material
design and the stuff on your screen
should be sort of like magic paper that
you slide around and move and there's
something sitting on top of the other
thing and by switching to this gesture
system you start moving that paper
around instead of tapping a button and
having it move itself and that just
feels more direct it feels more like I
said before human what I say it's more
human I mean that kind of literally when
you move something around in the
physical world you're actually moving a
thing through space and your brain
thinks spatially in a lot of ways when
you tap an icon it's like an if this
then that sort of programmatic thing
that just happens but when you actually
move a card or move a piece of you know
UI on the screen it feels to you're you
know lizard monkey brain like you're
moving a thing on a table and it just
feels a little bit more natural and a
little bit easier to understand in this
intuitive sense even though I hate the
word intuitive and UI but we can come
back to that in a whole other video
before we get too deep into this there
are a couple of caveats that are
actually really important dimensions the
first is I'm testing this on a pixel to
excel and so what we see here might be
slightly different than what you see in
other Android phones when it's
eventually released number two this beta
is not that good it's kind of hard to
show on camera but you know it when you
feel it it's some combination of
animation speed and physics on this beta
it just feels off it's not even as good
as what I experienced when I used it on
Google's campus so
before I oh that might have been a
different build I'm not sure anyway
enough caveats let's get into it if
we're talking major new functionality
with these gestures on the pixel I think
there's two that are really important
when you have an app open you have one
gesture access to a really important
thing in the overview screen when you
swipe up real quick you have these
predictive apps at the bottom which are
really accurate I use them all the time
now and you also get the Google search
bar which is a big deal you just swipe
up tap and then you can keep typing and
you'll get something that you want and
an Android P it's actually way more
powerful with those actions and slices
and so you don't have to think about
where that search bar is you can just
start typing and you'll end up with what
you want way faster than before now if
you're an Android person I know what
you're thinking yo dieter the square
button does that just fine in the beta
you don't need to swipe to do that
you're not wrong you're totally right
but there are some other reasons that
this Chester interface is more efficient
the first is you can just fat finger it
you don't have to hit the home button
exactly you can swipe up from pretty
much anywhere at the bottom of the
screen to get to this you know new
overview screen or the new gestures the
second thing is no matter what app
you're in you can swipe all the way up
and you'll get to your full app drawer
so you have instant access to all of
your apps instead of hitting home and
swiping up for the app Shore it saves
you a step and then third most
importantly there's this lozenge Home
button thing and you can just swipe it
over the right to switch to your last
app same as double tapping the square
button or you can drag it over and kind
of jam through and a little scrolling
action your recent apps and let go to
jump to an earlier app it doesn't have
to be the last one it can be like the
one you use three or four apps ago and
it's a much faster way to get to those
so that's my basic overview of why I
think gestures and Android pee could be
better than what we had before but we
should talk about the elephant in the
room and that elephant is named iPhone
10 so the big question here with the
iPhone 10 is did Android pee just steal
all the gestures from the iPhone and I
have to admit there are some
similarities so you swipe up to get to
the overview screen and you can just
sort of swipe over to the right on the
bottom to switch between recent apps and
that's a very very similar but there are
some differences the first the thing I
haven't really mentioned yet is on
Android pee you tap the home button to
go
and so they're mixing metaphors whereas
the iPhone is a little bit more
consistent the other thing is that
Android has more spaces it has an app
drawer in addition to a home screen
whereas the iPhone just has a home
screen so I don't think it's fair to say
they exactly stole this from the iPhone
10 we're going to talk about stealing
gestures and swipes we should really
talk about this other phone Palm Pre so
I know you've been waiting for it for
the moment when dieter talks about webOS
and the Palm Pre well fans mobile
accomplishers here it is I'm gonna talk
about webOS again so look there's a lot
of stuff that webOS did that's very
similar to what Android does and what
the iPhone 10 does you swipe up to go to
a multitasking screen you swipe up again
to go to all of your apps you can from
this overview screen just start typing
and do a search just like you can on
Android P there's a lot of stuff that's
very very similar and that's just
borrowed but there's stuff that was
different on webOS that we don't see
here at all so web loss is really into
this idea of cards and they would be
grouped together and they'd be organized
spatially instead of just most recently
and there's some benefits to that but
also some drawbacks and we don't need to
get into all of that to me the point is
that they're just borrowing ideas from
each other hand I don't think it's
really stealing it's just that there are
certain tools in UI and like you pick
some and you try and make them your own
and in particular I just think that
swiping is kind of a trend and user
interface goes through trends it changes
over time and people borrow from each
other and that's not the end of the
world
all right so having looked at webOS miss
you buddy and the iPhone 10 what do we
think about gestures on Android P well
there's two things that everybody's
really talking about one I don't care
about what I'm super worried about the
thing I don't care that much about is
the mixing of metaphors I get that you
still have to tap the home button I get
the back button still shows up but you
know what we're not building a Zen
garden here we're making a functional
phone OS and we're smart people and we
can figure that out so that's not the
problem the real thing that's going to
be troubling is they have to nail the
animation
and the smoothness because if you're
swiping around and moving stuff and it
feels janky literally one of the
description of the beta on Google's own
web page is that there's a lot of jank
if it feels janky this thing is going to
fail massively they have to get it right
and there's no in-between
either it's going to be a disaster or
it's going to be actually a really
surprisingly cool success because there
is that extra functionality that I've
been talking about so that's it
I think the gestures could be great I
can't make a final judgement yet but the
bottom line is they have to nail the
feel of it but if they do pull it off
it's gonna feel great hey everybody
thank you so much for watching I want to
know how would you set up gestures on
Android if you could just do whatever
you wanted let me know in the comments
and then head over to this video bye
eater it's the kitchen gadget show and I
actually really loved it they just did
an episode on whether or not the instant
pot is worth it you should check it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
