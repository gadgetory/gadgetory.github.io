the LG watch style their new Android
wear watches but that's not really
what's important about them the bigger
deal is that they were on Android wear
2.0 it's the biggest update to Google
SmartWatch software since it launched
it's been three years since Google
launched Android wear and since then
smartwatches have gone from being the
next big thing to becoming just another
thing and not a thing most people really
want but now Android smartwatches can do
more on their own even if you use an
iPhone so for these two watches the big
question is is that enough to make an
Android smart watch worth it for more
people
if you've used Android wear in the past
you'll notice that we're 2.0 has a
cleaner simpler design it's easier to
navigate easier to switch watch races
easier to launch apps and easier to see
your notifications
it also has improved fitness tracking
features new ways to reply to incoming
messages and the voice controlled Google
assistant that's been slowly creeping
into Google's entire line of products
but the most significant change is how
Android wear works when your phone isn't
around you can now browse for and
install apps right on your watch without
having to use your phone looking for and
installing apps on a screen the size of
a quarter is exactly as tedious and
fiddly as it sounds but fortunately you
can install apps directly to the watch
from the Play stores web interface you
can also choose which apps on your phone
install to your watch
before this any app on your phone that
had a wear version would automatically
show up on your wrist whether you wanted
it to or not Android wears third-party
app selection isn't as strong as the
Apple watches but it's still better than
what's available for the Samsung gear s
line and if you're using Android wear
2.0 with an iPhone you can finally
install third-party apps and watch faces
third-party apps also have more
capabilities now with wear 2.0 you can
customize your watch face with
third-party complications for weather
stocks to-do lists and more so when I
tap on this Foursquare application the a
bloat is a list of interesting places
nearby Google is definitely playing
catch-up with Apple here but it's
certainly a welcome feature but apps
still take far too long to load on the
watch to be truly convenient even
Google's voice controlled assistant is
still slower than it should be prompting
me to just pull out my phone to send a
message when it took too long to respond
we're 2.0 also supports watches with LTE
connections and that's a big deal
because you can leave your phone at home
and still access your notifications
launch the Google assistant make calls
and send text messages track your runs
with GPS and even buy things with
Android pay
so Android wear 2.0 is great to have and
it has a lot of useful new features but
are these LG watches any good the $349
watch Sport is the flagship of the two
and it comes just absolutely packed with
features LTE GPS NFC for Android pay a
heart rate sensor large circular display
and three hardware buttons two of which
can be customized it's also a big watch
it's thick and it's cumbersome it has a
stiff rubber strap that's really not
very comfortable to wear and you can't
change it if you like the looks of large
sport watches the watch sport might be
something you're into but if you want
something more discreet or
professional-looking
it doesn't really fit the bill the $249
watch style is everything the watch
sport is not smaller lighter thinner
more comfortable to wear and has a
leather strap that can be easily swapped
out for something else it also lacks
many of the sports capabilities and it
doesn't have most of those Android wear
2.0 features we just talked about
it also looks kind of cheap like it's a
cheap watch it's trying to look more
expensive than it actually is both
watches have sharp clear displays that
can be read well indoors and out they
also both have a rotating crown that can
be used to scroll through lists or
messages or zoom in and out on a map
view yes this is a total rip of Apple's
digital crown in both function and form
but it works well for navigating the
interface both washes are also dust and
water resistant but neither can be worn
while swimming now I've been able to get
through an entire day with a watch style
but the watch sport tended to kick the
bucket a bit earlier sometimes before o
is even ready to go to bed myself it's
clear that the sports larger display and
extra connectivity options take more of
a toll on its battery life the designs
of the new watches are polarizing for
sure and frankly I'm not really a fan of
either of them I want something in the
middle one that's not as big and clunky
as this model but has more capabilities
than this one but if you want the watch
that best tells Google's vision for the
future of smartwatches and for Android
wear the watch sport is the one again in
the past three years since we're
launched if it's become clear that
smartwatches are good for two things
tracking Fitness and providing a quick
glance at your phone's notifications and
for the most part that's what Android
wear 2.0 is good at
I like the new interface it's easier to
navigate them before and I like the
rotating crown on the new watches for
scrolling through lists or texts when
I'm reading I like being able to use my
watch to pay for things at the store
even if it's slightly awkward for both
myself and the cashier ringing me out
typing out words by swiping on the tiny
keyboard to reply to messages sounds
ridiculous but it actually can be useful
from time to time if I ever actually go
out for a run and I'm wearing the watch
sport I can track my run stream music
from the cloud to my watch and then to
my headphones buy a bottle of water at
the convenience store and then text my
wife to let her know I'm on my way home
all my phone and my wallet are back at
home but if you aren't a fitness
enthusiast or SmartWatch enthusiast
chances are none of those things
interest you Android wear 2.0 is better
than before and the new watches have
lots of new features but they don't
really change a conversation about
wearables and in a lot of ways Google is
simply playing catch-up with what Apple
and Samsung we're already doing with
their smartwatches if you like the
Android wear chances are you like
Android wear 2.0 as well it's a more
polished version of the thing that's
been out for three years if you already
own an Android wear watch like the Moto
360 or Huawei watch or any of the fossil
models you probably don't need to invest
in one of the new ones unless you really
want LTE GPS and Android pay because
you'll be getting an update to Android
wear 2.0 later this year while it may
seem like Google's grand vision for the
SmartWatch is to make it a more
independent device the reality is you're
still going to rely on your phone for
the vast majority of things you want to
do and that means that if you haven't
jumped aboard the SmartWatch train yet
all of this new stuff probably won't get
you to climb aboard
