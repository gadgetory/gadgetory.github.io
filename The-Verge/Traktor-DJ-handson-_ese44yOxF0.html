here with Jim maser who is head of
product design for tractor tractors DJ
software if you've ever been to a club
or a bar with a DJ they're probably
running tractor on a laptop somewhere
and now they're bringing the software to
the iPad it's called Traktor DJ and this
seems like it's gonna be like 20 bucks
mm-hmm it does a lot of stuff like how
do you see that market expanding are you
gonna be a pros knees this or kids gonna
just play around with it or they gotta
graduate up yeah we want to make
actually the first right entrance point
for somebody that's interested in in
DJing but maybe hasn't gone out and
bought Hardware yet so we wanted to
spend the time and take that kind of
thinking that we have at native which is
very much for the pros and apply it to
this interface to the screen and think
about you know what well how would our
take be on DJ stuff we're running on an
iPad I I see this actually is a great
like after-party thing yeah like you
know gear somewhere else pull out the
iPad start having fun yeah the first
thing you'll notice on the interface is
the two waveforms and we wanted to
actually try to think about new ways
that you can interact with music through
the waveforms and achieve traditional DJ
techniques such as cue points and loops
on a touchscreen so I'll show you some
examples of this for example scratching
is done just by a swipe and it keeps
time using the same flux mode concept in
Traktor but I have this freeze button
which I can turn on at any point he
basically turns the waveform into
individual touch points for cue points
so that looks like this
at any point I can just decide that I
want to start from in on the waveform
and to set a loop you simply just tap
the waveform with two fingers where you
want the loop to be placed and to
release you tap again and you can set
the loop ahead of the playhead so we'll
roll in or you can even set behind and
by placing your two fingers on the
screen you can actually grab the loop in
your hand and move it about if that's
cool you can even change the size and
when it comes to mixing you can bring in
the browser to find your next song from
the bottom and this will take your
iTunes collection and it will run a
bunch of tracker algorithms on it for
the actual tempo of the song the key the
melodic key and we'll do some kind of
sound similarity and because this has
downbeat detection as soon as I hit play
this will start playing and sync it to
the downbeat so so now these tracks are
playing perfectly synced I can crossfade
back and forth
additionally I can bring in more like
mixing tools so we actually have a EQ
and filter panel which you can slide in
from the right so I can kill the bass on
the top track bring it back in I can
also switch this just to be an XY filter
control where it's adaptive if I do if I
go to the right of the center I'll get a
high pass if I go to the left I'll get a
low pass and I can lock this in place if
I want to hold the filter so for example
we'll hold it there and then bring in
some effects so I can have both these
panels open or just one and you have
three effects that you can access at
once so you can choose which effect you
want so for example I have a reverb
delay and beat master is my first effect
so I just press here or I can switch the
reverb or delay we also have an audio
panel so you can record your mix as you
do a mix and you can have a split output
so if you have a headphone splitter you
can send them a master to your speakers
and monitor to your headphones you're
kind of doing a lot of work for people
you know if you ask a old-school DJ they
say you're doing you're taking all the
art of it this out like you don't have
to learn the fundamentals so how do you
respond to that for me it's really like
getting two tracks up and running and
and really playing with the music is so
much more exciting than that get trying
to get to that point right because once
once you're there I mean it's literally
yeah just I turn the app on in 30
minutes blow by
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
