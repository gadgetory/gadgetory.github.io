years to rim but the company's coming up
in the defining moment with the launch
of blackberry 10 and all new modern
smartphones we sat down here in San
Francisco with CEO thorsten heins to
find out a little bit but what's coming
on the launch and see what he thinks
it'll take for RIM to get its mojo back
well sort of sines thanks so much for
speaking with us it's a real pleasure we
still got a few times now and the the
big news most recently is you guys
announced that you're launching
blackberry 10 on january thirtieth
correct that is the announcement you
made the decision to push back the
launch and after q4 into q1 of 2013 and
so you'll be missing the the holiday
season can you talk a little bit about
what made you decide to push back the
launch into 2013 the major argument
really was we not just building a next
update of a smartphone OS right when it
moved from blackberry 7 to blackberry
aid we've built a whole new platform
nothing that's in blackberry 10 on the
software side has anything to do with
Watson blackberry 7 so is a huge
undertaking to blow the new platform I'm
really really looking at this as a
platform taking us something the next
decade you need time to get it right you
need time to polish it when it when it's
out there I wanted to be a WoW
experience in the user sense that was
the first argument the second one was
that q4 is going to be pretty crowded
with launches its a typical holiday
season and the question we had then with
our carriers when we discussed that was
you know is it is it too much noise
right if you know all these products
launched at the same time because I said
you know what q1 why don't you go for it
they want the quality so they supported
us in that decision and we can give you
full attention in q1 what's the 10
second pitch for blackberry 10 as
opposed to iPhone Android or even
windows phone okay you're you're a user
hyper-connected always on multitasking
and you need to get things done how do
we do this the best typing experience on
a keypad we have the full integrated hub
so your brain is not occupied with any
in and out or which application do I
have to open and if you're connecting
your device to an enterprise we have
blackberry balance that makes your
personal part of the device full private
and allows the CIO to have a fully
secure corporate part on the same device
windows phone has a very concise patch
we have
start screen life tiles and you feel
like you can get in get out of it out
new today when they call it do you think
that you've got that's compelling enough
reason for someone to choose blackberry
over another platform I think it's it's
the user experience that will finally
make that decision right and with the
hub and all the integration of all your
communication channels all your
notifications into one central hub which
is not an application right it always
runs on that it was it's always at your
fingertips and it's all it's just one
one swipe away wherever you are on this
device you just do this one gesture and
you're in your activity center right and
you take activities on all your channels
beat facebook twitter email BBM whatever
you have right notifications out of the
hub so there's no need to say back
facebook all bank back linked and back
BBM right and i think that is so
compelling because right now people are
really getting overwhelmed by all the
different channels they have to deal
with right they're hyper connected and
we just make this so easy and
comfortable them I I think that's going
to just speak for itself the big
question of course is abs and recently
said that do you're aiming for a hundred
thousand apps at lunch how are you going
to get to that number that's a pretty
big number well we have pretty good line
outside to get there you had about 2 30
jam conferences that we did globally and
the way we look at this is and we
learned this from our presence in asia
pac and middle east and south africa
applications are also local so the first
attempt is in every of our major
countries get to the 200 to 600 most
important local apps so really work with
the local app developer community this
is why we did this in 30 countries and
then the generic applications like in
our games content video music books we
are deeply integrated with twitter
facebook and linkedin such as an
application is really deeply integrated
into the device that's one thing second
is we have built a blackberry 10
platform with various software developer
tool kiss on it flash air html5 c c++
native and then we have an Android
player with Android apps the way that
you execute that on the playbook OS is
relative interesting the developers
still need to submit them directly to
the blackberry store yeah because we
want this to be part of the blackberry
app world right
reward but they don't have to do a lot
of coding or anything they submitted it
gets converted into the blackberry
upload a file format they need to be on
the commercials and sign up for that we
test it for quality for sure as we take
a look at that and then it's there I'd
like to go back talk about the
competition a little bit microsoft it
seems is really gone after you guys with
Windows Phone 8 they've got the whole
new kernel and platform that's tightly
integrated with a whole bunch of their
their windows services and especially
their their enterprise services for
device management how are you guys going
to counter Microsoft to ensure that
Windows Phone kind of doesn't eat your
lunch I have a lot of respect for all
companies working in this space because
they all have good engineers they all
have creative people right so I think
it's about the smartphone market in the
u.s. is a very mature market sixty
percent penetration by now right whereas
in other regions we sit at 20 so if you
are in a mature market you need to
segment you need to find your
bull's-eyes segment we have identified
this for the blackberry user with those
three criteria and it's not us you know
putting this on paper academically we
did in intense user study about this for
four weeks in a month which is your
hyper connector you're multitasking you
need to get things done so you're
probably not using the device to game or
to watch TV shows now we got to be good
at that because that's the consumer
decision element right but the hub the
flow the peak the balance that is all
geared towards this segment that roughly
is kind of about fifty percent of the
smartphone users and that's what we're
aiming it and that's where we compete
second thing is I truly believe in
mobile computing I predict that over
time laptops really will disappear go
into a meeting today and see what people
carry into a meeting right so sometimes
when you have discussions with your
financial teams in a company you know
they they are the Excel spreadsheet
gurus and they come the pic laptop right
but in general I think we were up to
mobilize the the enterprise and in my
view is smartphone and or a tablet is
going to be good enough for fifty sixty
percent of all mobile workers of all
employees and
corporate enterprise and that's also
what we're shooting it what is your
metric of success for blackberry 10 if
you know if we talk again in six months
what will be the thing that says you
know yes we're doing we're on the right
path this is going well or no this isn't
going well i think it is clearly making
a mark in the market so you know being
being attractive to consumers into
enterprises selling the device in
certain quantities is a measure of
success no doubt right successful global
launch is a good sound marketing
campaign Iran it that attracts consumers
and then we will ramp it up right so
that to me is the next six month and
then bb10 will proliferate into the
portfolio so there will be new products
we probably can talk about it if you
meant for them now that black pretend
will be and it is again it is also from
me the exploration of the mobile
computing domain so i have several
projects innovation projects running
right now in the company where we want
to you know start building this this
mobile computing experience well thank
you very much good luck with the launch
oh thank you deanna and great talking
with you yeah thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
