of streaming services for $15 a month
one service can give you access to
basically endless movies and shows with
new offerings coming in every week but
enjoy it while it lasts because wheels
are already in motion to make those
services more profitable for companies
and worse for you
someday soon to get the same amount of
content you're getting now you're gonna
have to pay for more streaming services
so think about all the content on a
service like Netflix and where all of it
comes from a lot of what you see is made
by Netflix but most of its not whether
it's network TV shows old movies or
movies that were just in theaters a
study last year found that licensed
content makes up 80% of what people
actually watch Netflix pays to license
that content from the studios and it's a
big part of their business access to the
streaming market is important for
studios too because streaming media is
where the viewers are Netflix added 30
million US subscribers in the past five
years and that's coming at a time when
traditional cable and broadcast TVs have
less viewers every year but licensing to
Netflix Hulu and the other services
isn't the only way for studios to get
their movies online next year Disney
plans to launch its own streaming
service a direct competitor to Netflix
Disney's a little late to the party but
the service will have so much popular
content that it may not matter
remember Disney owns Pixar Marvel Star
Wars and 21st Century Fox along with
more than 90 years of beloved movies and
TV the bad news is if it's on Disney's
new service it doesn't really make sense
to put it on Netflix too once Disney's
current licensing deals expire cocoa
guardians of the galaxy and last Jedi
are all probably gonna disappear from
the other streaming service it's a
simple business move why would Disney
put last Jedi on Netflix when it can put
it on Disney flicks and make you pay
another $15 a month for it even if
Netflix offered to pay more money in
licensing Disney would rather have you
watched their movies on their servers
Disney is actually really good at making
money when distribution methods change
if you look at the history the company
they've done it over and over again when
VHS and DVDs became popular Disney
pioneered a system called the Disney
vault where movies would be locked away
for years and only made available for
lucrative limited run sales all these
magical Disney videos before they
disappear whether you love or hate the
vault it worked a study in the year 2000
found that 55% of Disney fans replaced
their VHS tapes with DVDs compared to
only 14% for other studios cable
expanded the playing field even more
initially Disney licensed its content to
HBO but soon they realized the real
money was in running their own channel
so the Disney Channel was born last year
Disney made 40% of its money from cable
channels including the ABC networks and
ESPN and as cord cutters move away from
cable towards services like Netflix
Disney is trying to pull up the same
trick with streaming video using its
massive content library to build a whole
new service from the ground up now
Disney is not the only studio trying to
do that comcast has its xfinity
streaming service Time Warner has HBO GO
the only way to see the latest Star Trek
series is by paying $6 a month for CBS
all access everybody is vertically
integrating which means there will be
less and less third-party content
available to license if you want to
follow all the movies and shows you'll
have to pay for all the services and
there will be more and more of them to
pay for if you've noticed a lot more
Netflix originals lately that's why even
if you can't find Star Wars or Ironman
on Netflix executives are betting you'll
stick around for stranger things in
Bojack horseman just like you stuck with
HBO for Game of Thrones so if you follow
a bunch of streaming services now you
might soften the blow by borrowing the
password from your parents or friends
but that could be in danger too
streaming services can shut down account
sharing anytime they want just look at
Spotify where sharing accounts isn't
really impossible Netflix is slowly
cracking down an account sharing to
adding distinct profiles and stopping
any profile that streams multiple shows
at once as the industry matures those
rules are gonna tighten and it's gonna
get harder and harder to dip into a
service without painful
now for corporations this is about the
money Disney paid four billion dollars
for Star Wars and they want to make that
money back as fast as they can but all
that leaves the general interest fan in
a tough place do you stick with a single
streaming service and miss out on the
next wave of Marvel movies is the new
Star Trek really worth $6 a month we
don't know what the future of streaming
will look like yet the transition away
from licensing could be jarring or it
could happen slowly over years
competition between the new services
could inspire a new golden age of TV
shows or everyone could fall back on old
tricks and familiar franchises but
whatever happens the pipeline between
the camera and your screen is going to
get a lot more controlled and if you
want the same amount of content you've
been used to you're gonna have to pay
more thanks for watching I hope you
liked it if you want more free video
