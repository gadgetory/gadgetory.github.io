lot of really disparate things we want
bigger and more immersive ways to watch
movies and play games but we have these
incredibly powerful computers in our
pockets meanwhile we're all becoming
more comfortable wearing new gadgets
like Google glass or the oculus rift
abakan thinks there's a place in the
middle of all this as long as the right
technology is in play and it's building
a device called the glyph to prove it
it's essentially a $499 screen you strap
to your face except it's not really a
screen at all it's called a virtual
retinal display and instead of just
showing you an image to look at it's
projecting that image directly on your
eye it's much more like the way we all
see everything is just light reflecting
off of other services with avec on
technology that light reflects off of
two million micro mirrors and goes
directly into your retinas your eyes in
your brain actually create the image the
technology's actually been around for
decades mostly used in medical and
military cases but even for regular
people it has some really obvious
benefits when we look around the room my
eyes don't get tired right I don't have
any problem seeing 3d and you don't get
nauseous through seeing headaches get
headaches when I'm looking around the
normal world
and so you know we try to recreate that
light as closely as possible so we can
separate where the light's generated
from where the light is modulated and
how we modulate light means we have
these mirrors that bend and twist and
all we do is pick and choose what colors
of light are bounced in and what colors
a lighter bounced away it's a micro
mechanical part that's machined using
kind of semiconductor type processes so
you have these millions of tiny mirrors
that are hinged and they're just
wobbling at an insane speed the glyph
looks like a set of headphones it
actually is a set of headphones until
you flip the band down over your face
that's when you'll start seeing movies
games and whatever else you can think of
I haven't used the glyph itself but I've
tried two different prototypes and all
it took was plugging in a phone or a
Playstation 3 to get it working it's
designed to be totally plug-and-play
Life of Pi played in perfect 3d without
being adapted at all and in Call of Duty
ghosts my head was mapped to the right
joystick when I turned my character did
too but avocado developers to do even
more the company imagines a 360 degree
camera at a football game so you can see
everything as if you're standing at the
50-yard line
games could be even more tuned to what
your eyes and your head are doing and
movies could be both surround sound and
surround picture right now the glyph is
really just a better screen for watching
Netflix
but with developer help it could be
something much more the prototypes we've
seen were pretty rough and there will
always be some Sena you have to tune the
focus to suit your eyes and the two
sides have to be perfectly aligned or
you get an awkward double image but when
it works it's great it takes no time at
all to adjust - and my eyes never got
tired the glyph has about 45 degrees of
visibility which is roughly like looking
at an 80 inch TV from 8 feet away it
doesn't completely fill your view like
the oculus rift and actually allows you
to see outside of it so one of the
really important things that that we
focus on is to actually give people
quite a large peripheral vision in this
direction so that you can still see your
hands you get a text message you pull
your phone and still see your phone if
you want to use your computer you can
still look at your keyboard or if the
guy next to you needs to get up with the
drink card goes by you know what's going
on and that's how you can feel
comfortable in public that's where I
wonder well people want to put on such a
strange Cyclops II device and actually
use it in public there's no doubt that
virtual retinal display as a viable
useful technology but the glyph might be
a hard sell oculus wants us to have
insane immersive experiences sitting at
our desks in our couch avocado wants us
to take them out into the world who
knows how that'll go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
