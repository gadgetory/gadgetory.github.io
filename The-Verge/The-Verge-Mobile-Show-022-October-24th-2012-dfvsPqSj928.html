write all these papers and you'd stay up
all night studying and go to take tests
and it was the worst and you'd spend all
this time working for what you're
supposed to do for your job but really
what you really just wanted to do is
party because you're almost done well
this week is basically finals week in
the mobile tech news world and instead
of actually working we're gonna party
and that party will be the Virgin Mobile
show so stay tuned for the verge bolts
show I'm dieter Baumann I'm Vlad settle
i'm dan seifert i'm chris sigler and it
is episode 22 for the week of october
twenty seconds 2012 and yeah we're
midway through this insanity I think the
infinity is just beginning I I think
we're very much in the thick of it okay
so we're not midway through we're like
it's were at the beginning of the
beginning the beginning of the year all
the end of the beginning we're all going
to be bloody corpses by the time this
thing is over and then I really don't
know is going to host this program uh
we'll find like a squirrel or something
I could host a bureau that we good yeah
we can find Pataki if we can find a
talking a squirrel I really don't think
that putting them on the Virgin Mobile
show is the best use of his time I think
that we should you know go around the
the world showing off this amazing
creature and make millions and millions
and millions of dollars just think
there's a better way to use that kind of
novelty and then we can keep Nokia float
yes yes that is the the cure for all of
nokia's troubles train a squirrel to
talk put them on a tour and profit becky
no wasn't there not a bad there's so
much there's so much insane new this
week to talk about this topic list is
huge I'm
gonna go ahead and take Vlad's a lead
here and let's just start talking about
nokia at the outset because what the
heck um the lumia 510 has launched um
yep I'm trying very much to care about
the lumia 510 can someone convince me
that I ought to I'm sure it'll be French
in certain markets I'm not sure it'll be
super relevant to us in the West but
where it's launching it's very important
because it's got a very important price
point and it kind of what nokia has been
very successful with its Asha line in
india and asia and markets in the east
so the fact that it's centered putting
in a really entry-level windows phone is
kind of a smart move yes me write the
questions just like go ahead right yeah
just thinking I was going to mention
first of all dan is completely right
because Jim before we started the
podcast today tisa was talking about
having a galaxy note 2 an optimus G on
18 th sprint and I a galaxy s2 length
mike is swinging hired for dieter and he
was complaining about the fact that he
does have a good enough android device
and he's just stuck and doesn't have a
good choice so yes I don't think the
lumia 510 is going to have a massive
effect on that kind of an audience but
to try and also do this point about why
we should care the whole reason lucky is
still kind of creeping creeping along
and not completely sinking it's actually
symbian it is a windows phone yet nokia
is still selling more symbian devices
the windows phones which is kind of
amazing reported yeah yeah your imported
his latest financial figures Lumia sales
of AXA shrunken and we should be
surprised because of the osborne effect
where Nokia microsoft announced you're
not gonna get upgrade to Windows Phone 8
or Windows Phone 8 is gonna be so hot
it's just wait so that was predictable
enough and the future is going to be
more interesting but again is down was
saying the azure line and the silver
line are the things that have been
setting for nokia so going with lumia
510 dragging down the entry
price point for Windows Phone app into
windows phone 7.8 it's probably a good
play for the company yeah what would you
say like the Nokia picture Oh would you
say that the picture of Nokia's
financials is going to be much clearer
once they launched the 920 it is a
pretty dark time for nokia right now
yeah I mean to me and maybe I'm being
overly dramatic here everything as far
as the company's long-term survival goes
it needs to win with the 920 and
potentially with the 820 which also
looks like a really solid phone like if
those don't work out I don't see
anything within like 6-9 months a year
when okay could again say okay here's
the big reboot here's the big new
flagship like those are the flagship
devices that need to work right now
Chris you're gonna jump in before I
interrupted with my terrible joke I was
just I was just wondering what what
Symbian devices nokia still sells i mean
they can't possibly be making money off
the 808 who's going to 80 well exactly
right i think it's the Asha phones yeah
Astra phones are definitely keeping it
the company afloat but there are no asha
Symbian phones no they're all s40 so I'm
wondering what these Symbian devices are
but that doesn't think Chris I think
this is the case where we're really
lacking in our coverage of the Indian
subcontinent because if we had somebody
based in india in singapore and those
markets I mean you eat you know rim
launch one of its BlackBerry's not too
long ago and it was like Singapore is
our fullest market is such a huge market
for us and those are the places where
these phones are selling the other thing
is they're a riot when that blackberry
was launched like I think they were here
at a few of the store and like thousands
of people rioted it's crazy um yeah and
exam BlackBerry's one of BlackBerry's
executives in the region was arrested
over that incident and I can't remember
what happened to him I don't know if he
got sent to prison or what
story was but he was blamed for inciting
the riot wow I love eel ops quote from
the the call having spent most of the
quarter explaining to the US population
about the great innovations that are
coming in q4 one could reasonably expect
that would impact sales in q3 that's
like an underhanded like swipe at
consumers not not even underhanded it's
just a straight-up swipe yeah that was
that was the whole beginning of the
sentence Chris we spent a whole quarter
explaining to you people why this fig
matters this is how long it took us free
moms okay so I'm looking right now at
nokia's list of symbian devices that
they currently sell they sell the c5 03
the c7 which was discontinued on tmobile
like two years ago the e7 which is the
basically the the na with a qwerty
keyboard it was the one that it was the
last phone that uh that s sorry not at
sorry uh that an SI van yogi uh like
pimped before he left nokia yep um and
and i remember very very well i was at
that nokia world and he was all so fired
up over this phone he's like I camera
damn you were you there was no you know
I was not okay get know you he was like
he was like insane at this over the
phone he's like you know oh and I'm
gonna have to go back and watch the the
keynote again cuz he was just he was
insane he was like on cocaine or
something um so so then they still sell
that Nate they sell the 700 and they
sell the 808 that's the extent of their
symbian range right now by the way you
can pick up an NH for just three 3999
unlocked which is not I mean if you can
get that Simeon it's actually not that
bad of a deal considering the camera
that you're getting and the construction
it's a very very well-built phone but
there is the symbian issue also you can
get a
a c5 dash 034 just 129 99 unlocked I
don't know what I am William straight
devolved into Chris scanning amazon for
what Nokia phones are available unlocked
no I nokia's site I'm actually looking
at nokia a calm right now then all these
prices match on amazon for what it's
worth 3 30 and 70 to meet viene okay the
Lumia 920 needs to be a flagship phone
for nokia it needs to do really well to
help turn the company around my question
is you know in the US will it be able to
do that or do they need to depend on
sales internationally I mean we know
that 18 tease got exclusivity for the
920 and there's a rumor that it's going
to be six months of exclusivity and then
best buy is pricing it I want to say it
149 is what we saw Tom it's correct it
and I mean you know it's not like the
900 was you know att's singular massive
focus I don't expect that it will be the
920 will be their singular focus for the
holiday season they're going to be
pushing a lot of stuff we know the
iphone does really well on AT&amp;amp;T so I
guess I'm just wondering it seems to me
like you know Nokia's gonna get a little
bit of a foothold in the US market but
it doesn't seem to me like they should
be assuming that the US market is gonna
lead the charge for whatever come back
they're going to get that what they
really need to do is kill it in Europe
and you know they need to be here in the
US but I don't think that it is there
depending on AT&amp;amp;T to turn them around
with a 920 I think that's not going to
happen well yeah but at the same time I
kind of I kind of feel like Nokia's
extra strategy is unlike the strategy
that we want not get to pursue and what
I mean by that is that we want nokia to
go for all the marbles try and seize
real market share asserts itself be bold
audacious etc whereas what Stephen Elop
seems to be doing is be very focused on
the bottom line so he's got an exclusive
or 18
which obviously earns donkey a bunch of
money the reason nokia work with
microsoft windows phone instead of
android does have something to do with
the fact that Nokia gets a billion
dollars from Microsoft every single year
right and also Nokia just recently
issued new bonds which is basically just
financial instruments it's dead yeah so
it's taken on new debt for 2017 to the
tune of another 1 billion dollars in
order to solidify its liquidity s
financial position so really and truly I
think what Nokia is actually trying to
do is lock in some gains in terms of
just pure money just in terms of pure
cash flow before its launch happens like
that doesn't really Express much
confidence in the final product it has
to be said but you know as a CEO as a
CEO of a company that's losing and
hemorrhaging money and which actually
has a lot more employees than it needs
right because like I still need to trim
its wage bill and its facilities which
is doing but it still needs to keep
shrinking because it basically was a
massive massive company built to sell
massive massive phones and it doesn't do
that anymore and the two things need to
be realigned so like the cold harsh
reality is that Nokia is just going for
the shura thing discover these
exclusives and at the same show in the
UK has exclusive with e 4g carrier for
the 928 yeah just the 920 I don't think
it has it for the a 20 I which again is
a limited term exclusive but it's not
going to end every single carrier which
is kind of unusual now it's been a
couple of years since we had a true
flagship phone exclusive to a single
carrier I think the question here though
is glad you mentioned going with the
carrier exclusives as a safe thing how
safe really is it though for nokia with
the 900 on ATT we could see that it
definitely didn't pay off what was what
was the total sales of the 980 on AT&amp;amp;T
was it 600,000 or something in that
ballpark so I would assume that the 920
would sell more I think it's a
more higher profile products it's
obviously much more competitive than the
900 plus but at the same time eighteen t
is a carrier that sells like more than
seventy five percent of its smartphones
or iPhones so I don't know if that's
really the safest that that Nokia could
have made yeah I'm just saying it's kind
of a more of a short-term strategy and
what I'm saying a safe bet I'm saying
take 18 tease money because ATT is going
to pony up the exclusive money up front
presumably right so you know even if the
product flops ATT is paid up the
exclusive money ee has paid up the
exclusive money and again a like I say
this doesn't really seem like no keys
all that confident its own product which
is kind of weird because the 920 is
still the most exciting thing at least
for me when it comes to the new windows
phone 8 Rangers yeah so okay we're gonna
get the official unveil windows 18 on
the twenty-ninth um and we'll finally
like get to play with the phone with the
lock screen turned off um I honestly I
want to believe that they've got
something crazy and amazing up their
sleeve but as much as I want to believe
that I pretty much don't think that's
the case does anybody think that
Microsoft has got something shocking and
like game-changing that they're gonna be
showing us with with Windows Phone 8 oh
yeah yeah forever ooh I hope so for
their benefit I hope so um I don't know
what their ace in the hole is at this
point because you can't sell you know
the developer focused capabilities of
Windows Phone 8 that Microsoft was
selling back at their their event
earlier this year really can't translate
into something that consumers can or
want to understand I mean you can say
things like multi-core and you know
there's been enough marketing push for
four terms like that you know consumers
generally know that bigger numbers are
usually better or at least that's what
they've been trained to believe
so you can say things like that but but
otherwise they need a they need a lot of
whiz-bang I think to really get this
thing to say I mean they've already
tried the trick of blowing out these
phones and surprisingly low prices and
that hasn't worked for it with the Lumia
900 debuted 9999 contract right so and
that didn't work very well it was the I
was 99 99 then it was very quickly free
when it didn't work right and Nokia had
to scramble right so I think it's going
to be a tough sell to say to consumers
this here's a phone that looks almost
exactly like the Lumia 900 we were
selling six months ago but it's fifty
dollars more and it looks generally the
st. like the software looks generally
the same here are these two new features
and by the way it has to course now like
that's a that's a really tough sell
night and I don't know if they're gonna
be able to pull it off not only well as
far as Apple pulls it off with the
iphone yeah but that that's Apple lives
in its in it own world and it has the
luxury of playing by its own rules and
that is luxury that Nokia nor any other
company in the world hacked and to
follow up the the difficulties that
Nokia will have to selling this it will
be the 920 on AT&amp;amp;T will be there sitting
right next to an HTC 8x four fifty
dollars less that arguably extremely
similar runs the same software is you
know I ID probably just as quick we
haven't really tested them to be honest
with you so we don't know that for a
hundred percent sure but it's you know a
thinner lighter version of the 920 in
most people's eyes so they've got a lot
of challenges ahead as far as getting
that message to the consumers as the why
they should buy this I mean look this is
the thing that I was complaining about
what is it now is going to be two months
ago while two months ago like stem
effect when Nokia had this big blur
event for the Lumia 920 at night 20 it
was where's the release date what is
this thing happening I want one now
because that was the time when
everything was novel and everything was
fresh and this is the thing you know
I've been kind of banging on about when
Apple does an event
it's either ships today pre-order today
or pre-order within a couple of days a
week style apple doesn't waste time I
mean look Apple whole secrecy thing is
just gone completely to crap this year
we do pretty much everything about the
iphone 5 we learn three much everything
about the ipad mini I mean everybody
pretty much called it an ipad mini event
even though I've recorded a special
event again but that tradition that I /
has of here's our announcement here's
when we reach out to mass-market here's
when you know the big news corporation's
like the BBC for example was covering
this on radio on television the apple
event that just happened this week this
is when we reach out to the mainstream
and then immediately after you can go
and get now Nokia's big opportunity big
chance to do that same thing was a
tempest and I think they had a really
good presentation I think but the whole
thing of being able to sell the 920 is a
form that you can use with gloves is
nice I mean honestly that's like a it's
a major feature in particularly we make
fun of it but people in Nordic countries
people in Finland people in diversity in
January yes I've been in New York City
in January you guys are nuts right but
the point is that happened nearly two
months ago and now Nokia essentially has
to reheat that exact same message and
and that's the issue that is facing took
it about total 29 it is you given people
the sales pitch and I have to redo it
well enter the Chris's point they've
given people the sales pitch they have
to redo it but the sales pitch isn't all
that different from what the sales pitch
was for the 900 right it's not it's not
it's not a rapidly different message
well yeah I think that also depends like
we can say or Windows Phone 8 like we
need to be windows phone 8 a chance we
need to find out exactly what it is
because microsoft itself has been
keeping a really tight lock on it and
then find out how it compares I mean
personally my anticipation of it is that
i'm just way too much of an
android like abusive way to any habits
around android around the negative G Jim
application you to your application
cetera and that's the thing I was
mentioned before the podcast it was
funny that previously Windows Phone were
saying it's lacking because doesn't have
a proper YouTube application its email
client isn't as good as the native gmail
client on Android it doesn't have google
maps and now those exact same things
were actually the same place we can have
about iOS there's a very important
difference though there's a very
important difference which is that
google offers its own YouTube
application for iOS and the webview of
gmail on iOS works extremely well in
fact its my primary email client when
i'm using an iphone and and there's
something yeah and and that's something
that that Windows Phone does not have to
this day if you if you navigate to I
think I mentioned this before on the
show if you navigate to gmail on a
Windows Phone you get the web view which
is designed for like a flip phone from
2003 it's it's embarrassing and I think
I think it's a combination of I mean I'm
sure it just has to do with like ie9
having like quirks or ie8 excuse me in
75 having quirks that that Google just
doesn't like there's not enough scale
you know for Google to bother dealing
with that maybe ie9 in Windows Phone 8
will be different I don't know we
haven't tried yet so my fingers are
crossed if if they if they have a
functional gmail web view in Windows
Phone 8 that could be a game changer for
me personally because that was honestly
when I was using Lumia when I was trying
to use a Lumia 900 full time that was
the only thing that was really stopping
me was the lack of any acceptable gmail
experience I can make it work on iOS it
kind of sucks but I can do it on windows
phone is just a non-starter right now
I'm trying really hard not to complain
about my iphone right now but now I
brought it up i'm going to save if you
follow me on twitter you may have seen
that my iphone 5 has randomly and
inexplicably started uh just uploading
or downloading or doing something with
massive amounts of data I've
chug through six gigs of data in the
past two weeks don't know why don't know
what happened don't know which app it is
I you know I started looking at the
console stuff but it's really hard to
like figure it out after the fact um I'm
really unhappy i'm deeply unhappy AT&amp;amp;T
has been great you know I called him up
I talked to him they're gonna give me a
call when my bill comes in to talk about
dealing with it um and they are still
swearing up and down it's not suffering
from this bug that the verizon version
suffered from but i've seen reports for
you TT seeing it and like Rogers and a
few other carriers get it too so it's
either the podcast app or like might be
like Dropbox going crazy or it's just a
huge iOS 6 bug but I'm good pretty
unhappy could it be i clawed back ups
could be icon backups well I'll say I
use iCloud backups and I haven't seen
this bug myself yeah the way those days
they showed us like I'm sorry blood drop
box they did a phone 5 compatibility
update and some photo size stuff so the
drugs application for us got updated
recently but I don't think it's been two
weeks ago so probably isn't it yeah no I
think it might actually been Dropbox
which is a voice recording application
um that was trying to upload some crazy
stuff up but I don't know like I
genuinely have no idea I thought that
was just a vocal typo that you did there
um ya series of the above
troubleshooting dietz's iphone I I do I
should want to switch us over to the
Android segment of October 29 because
Google get through an events happening
then as well and I'm actually kind of
scratching my head because I physically
scratched my head for no good reason it
wasn't eating buddy I'm scratching my
head about exactly what Google's gonna
do because we've anticipated multiple
Nexus devices for a while which put next
to smartphones but then there's kind of
cool down that rumor hasn't it again do
we expect gonna do yeah we haven't heard
that rumor I don't think we've heard
that rumor since the original was it
Wall Street Journal rumor
months and months ago but you know
there's been a lot of bubbling of you
know other Nexus devices whether they be
tablets we're various sized tablets so
maybe that's what that will morph into
instead of it being a multitude of Nexus
phones Google presents you know a big
tablet of the revised Nexus 7 or
something well we know a 32 gigabyte
Nexus 7 is coming that's pretty much all
been confirmed at this point yeah maybe
one with connectivity built in cellular
connectivity and then obviously this LG
nexus 4 that we've seen up and down for
the past few weeks I want a new Nexus Q
that's what I was yes can't forget about
nexus q you know to what what happened
to that thing it's just gone right well
no not gone it's sitting right there on
my desk if you bought one google paid
you for it and you got it for free and
Google was like we're gonna try again
but we're not gonna tell you when or
whatever yeah we just know this is not
working right agria manufacturing I
don't know well yeah I mean that might
be part of I mean it was it was a very
noble experiment on their part but there
were so many complaints about the price
to capability ratio of that device
that's that I mean that's gonna be if
manufacturers continue to try the
American or you know just Western
experiment for manufacturing this is
gonna be this is gonna keep coming up
for many many years to come I love that
you start the podcast by going through
and listing off symbian phones from
Nokia and now when we're trying to talk
about Google's event you're trolling us
by talking bringing up the Nexus Q like
you just it's like everybody knows Chris
just wants a dog on a podcast entirely
that's all of our listeners know that I
am only here to derail what you guys are
trying to talk about that is my function
like everybody has a function everybody
has a role on this show my role is to
interrupt you and make you talk about
something that nobody cares about so
anyways so you know the 29th in our
little mobile world is probably going to
be the most insane day of all the
insanity that we're dealing with for
this past week because as we were just
saying we've got the Google's event is
happening in the morning on the East
Coast in New York and then later on in
the afternoon on the west coast
Microsoft's doing its big windows phone
event so and then on the end in London
yes how can I forget of course and I
might go to that you say let me of
course the lid why would then you know
we might we might actually see this is
complete I'm confirmed that i'm just
guessing here but we might actually see
the samsung achieve s final oh my god
what Alex the ultimate paper yeah the
ultimate product Brenda yes uh you know
one thing I don't think they're gonna
dress but I want to address it here is a
jelly bean updates for existing phones
we've had just a raft of bad news Sony's
not updating anything from 2011 they're
not going to get their jelly bean
updates until next year motorola listed
the phones that aren't getting jelly
bean a confirm which ones but they also
offered 100 dollar update samsung did
confirm that 4.1 is coming to the galaxy
s3 in the US but not until the quote
coming months I just I we talk about
this all the time but I just don't I'm
tired of like being outraged at this
point I just whatever I'm just gonna use
a Galaxy Nexus yeah I'm kind of out of
outrage too although I feel like
Motorola has set an important precedent
with this like reimbursement thing and
Sonia should seriously consider doing
the same because if i'm not mistaken
correct me if i'm wrong i think sony was
part of that ridiculous meaningless
update pact that google announced at a
thai o in 2011 and they just completely
ignored that or it you know have reneged
on that so they owe it to themselves and
they owe it to their customers and their
future customers to show that they
are going to support these guys in some
way and it continues to baffle me I mean
this is like one of the very fundamental
differences right now between Android
and iOS is that when you buy an iphone
you have a very very safe assurance that
you are going to be supported with
software updates for a minimum of three
years which is well beyond the end of
your contract that is not something you
don't have an assurance that you gonna
be supported in three months with an
android device much less three years
unless you've got a droid biotic then
they're bringing four point out of the
droid bionic well I want to talk about
Sony for one more second yeah so this
really surprised me with Sony because
Sony was one of the most aggressive
manufacturers with getting ICS onto its
older phones that we're already on the
market it released beta after beta that
users could go download and install if
they unlock their phones and then you
know it put out ICS on you know
virtually its whole line of experience
that were available and now for it to be
like well we're not going to do anything
beyond that is a little bit surprising
for the 2011 phones of course yeah
nobody else yeah yeah no is it
surprising and disappointing I mean uh
what surprises me is you know I was had
the impression that jelly bean you know
shouldn't have been that hard of an
update but apparently maybe it's
something you know with with project
butter apparently it's more difficult
for manufacturers to implement them than
I anticipated but also I was just
thinking about this if somebody like
Samsung saying you're gonna get jelly
bean but you might be next year oh you
know well I'm sure LG's promising jelly
bean in like 20 60 that also kind of
deflates the expectation at least for me
I was seeing an android 4.2 another you
know upgrade to the OS and also yeah I
don't know if I agree with that Vlad
because when android 4.1 was announced
there was less than like five percent of
android phones on even android 4.2 at
the time
so I I don't know if Google is using
that as a way to slow down its
development of Android in the least yeah
okay I'm not sure but it just kind of
seems like like one of the excuses if
you like from my perspective for not
loading up jellybean is to say well
android 4.2 is going to hit in a few
days time let's just go ahead and jump
straight to that 4.1 what's the
difference will we integrate it with 4.2
but any people if companies are
promising you'll get it at such and such
time way up into the future then it just
kind of seems less likely um at the same
time you know this is kind of a
predictable thing with Android and a sad
thing really because the Suffolk of us
would be thinking about my favorite
android phone seems to be changing every
other week yeah and that there is a good
thing if you're actually spending your
money on these phones if you feel you
know messing around and reviewing them
and getting a new one every two weeks Oh
Andrew is the best andrew is just like
oh yes oh here's a new one that limits
it let me tell you about the curvature
of this phone and nobody who's actually
spending money I cares that much about
the curvature of the phone as I do but
that's just because I see a bunch of
phones and I like to play with it but as
a fireable phone you just can't have a
set of situation like either you have to
track everything like an eagle and be
like okay now finally this phone and
this OS they're a match and that you'll
probably get the update like Peter says
that most like to get Nexus device
anyway um and it's just kind of rubbish
way to treat phone buyers to be able to
speak because everything kind of just
keeps getting upgraded in a very
incremental way in a sort of way but
still a desirable way like for example
right now my favorite android phone is
the optimus G boom oh gee diese might
not necessarily agree with that but that
seems to keep happening you know it's
the latest phone has a nice aspects
actually as far as oh geez concern I
think that's the best android smart
phone companies done by far I think know
is the best smart
Jesus is incredible it's it's one of my
favorite smartphones i love the screen i
love i love almost everything about it
it's just that i'm an AT&amp;amp;T man and ATT
did a number on the software on it and
i'm not a big fan of the the skin on it
but I mean to your point the you know
just how consumer hostile the upgrade
situation is did we talked about last
week the the motorola quote that we got
from when they were when we got the the
razr HD stuff that they they are you
know going to try and do the right thing
and get as close to base Android as they
can I can't remember yeah I think to a
code the quote was like stock Android is
a nice house Yannick go to have but
we're not gonna do it basically yeah
that and it's basically like it's cuz
carriers have you know they push the
blame on verizon yeah you wrote this
piece yeah II didn't spit in
specifically named verizon but I mean
you know it is what it is and and so I
get some the reason i bring at motorola
is what i want to start talking about
the the razr HD but to like I'm sorry
you're owned by Google now and I know it
takes a while to get your products out
of the pipeline that you had already
been developing and blah blah blah but
remember when you know before this had
gone through i have this i claim that if
they you know just were to announce on
day one after the purchase that if they
just released stock android for all
their phones that i would buy like a
million razors i think i said it by a
hundred razors or something luckily for
me and my bank account that didn't
happen but if there's any company that
should solve this problem of you know
Android manufacturers offering steady
updates outside of the nexus program it
should be motorola and even they're not
doing it yeah it's a it's an incredibly
disappointing especially in the case of
motorola because of the close access
that it does have regardless of how much
Google likes to talk about how
Motorola's being run as a separate
company and so forth the truth is that
google and motorola motorola has a
closest access to Google's resources
and you know that's borne out in the
software that ends up on its phones the
version of Android 4.2 on all of its
phones is the closest thing to stock
Android that you can get from any of the
major manufacturers but it still hasn't
translated into Android 4.1 being on all
of its phones as we would expect to be
at this point yeah and Chris wrote the
the piece of from there their earnings
call that we've inherited an entire
product pipeline where harbors and
cycles are typically 12 to 18 months so
like we keep wondering ones Motorola
gonna be act like you know a new
motorola the google owns and apparently
it's like next year or a live right
after next year right III think that you
know when they bought Motorola they
inherited a stack of contracts that had
already been signed with verizon and
there's nothing they can do to get out
of those contracts other than grid ethan
and push forward and once they get past
that maybe we'll see google's start to
exert its influence a little bit more
because I mean bear in mind i mean the
the nexus program exists for a reason
right and that's because google wants an
outlet for its own vision of what
android is supposed to be and if they
you know if they don't take advantage of
their of their ownership they don't
ultimately take advantage of their
ownership of Motorola to push that
agenda that I don't know what they're
doing well we kill me about these
contracts as they don't they couldn't
change him like you know they did the
contracts for this 12 to 18 months not
only included you know phone design but
also you know all the software that went
on it and whether or not Google's
allowed to offer updates in a timely
fashion like its walkers sorry I was
gonna raise is that the original
reasoning for Google's acquisition of
Motorola was motorola spada portfolio i
think GU has been talking up the fact
that it takes a defensive position
defensive stance whereby requires payton
so that it doesn't get sued and doesn't
get
to poke down into these you know
protracted multinational clashes the way
the Apple and Samsung do at the moment
anyone's support the Android ecosystem
etc etc we've we've had that
conversation already we've heard that
narrative and a google was like well
it's not gonna cause a couple more
billion to acquire ha motorola we might
as well and since then to be trying to
keep operating them at arm's length
which find whatever but again i kind of
feel like you could explain those things
to investors and maybe you can explain
them at the corporate level but to the
consumer they just weird you know
because because the conversation that
teenagers are gonna have when they
discuss these things it are things like
okay I don't know if teenagers as you
can okay but you know I I say teenagers
today these crazy kids because their
cell phones because when you I mean look
think back to the decades ago when all
of us with teenagers as well right
things are a bit simpler and in a
simpler world the case of matter is
google's motorola that means google
build android phones and what we're
seeing is derivative relatives of
motorola's older hardware designs and
you guys could talk more about that with
a razor HD uh derivative designs and
still we're seeing skins and still
racine carrée interference and nothing
is changing nothing is improving I mean
that isn't really impacting on the
actual sales because Andrew just keeps
growing but I don't I well I mean these
me Mel rollers not selling a whole lot
of phones uh motor shuts on verizon yeah
well yeah but motor oil is still losing
money for Google each quarter to so well
let's let's talk about the razr HD and
the HD max uh you reviewed him right
there I did review them yes uh yeah so
you know i think i gave the HD at 7.6 i
gave the max to 7.8 the nod for the
extended crazy battery life that it gets
and you know it's it's like the they're
very similar to the razor's that we saw
last year the big difference being that
it's got a bigger screen with a higher
resolution of this now 720p screen at
4.7 inches as opposed to the 4.3 inch
qhd screen that it was before but it's
not a perfect display it's got the same
issues that we've seen on every Motorola
display it's pentile it's extremely
oversaturated so it's a it's actually
quite harsh to look at so it just
definitely does not look like a top of
the class their top top of the line
display in this kind of a price class at
this this phone is sitting in especially
when you put it next to like a 1x it's
just no competition and then you know I
said this in my review the if you're
looking at the razr HD which translates
to the successor of the razor from last
year the razor when it was released last
year was like wow that's then that's
incredibly thin that's like a razor
that's what a razor smartphone should be
and motorola and verizon really played
up on how thin it was but then this year
the razr HD is actually thicker than the
last year's model and it's not like
thinner than any phone on the market
it's it's thicker than most phones that
have come out recently so it's like
totally lost its allure for me as being
like a crazy thin device and you know
then it kind of just makes it like
another humdrum Motorola device that you
know it the styling of it is kind of you
know take it or leave it I guess it
depends on on your preference personally
I don't think it's very attractive but
you know others might feel different and
and it just makes me kind of
disappointed and the whole whole thing
as a whole and then the other thing here
is like if you're going to go for the
razr HD why not go for the razr HD max
in my review I know that the max gets a
very good battery life kind of as we
expected and you know you are buying
into that for the battery life because
you're not getting the best display
you're not getting the best camera
you're not getting the fastest processor
you're not getting the best build
quality really what the by there is it's
for the battery life so you might as
well go all the way up to the max so
yeah a quick question but DZ usually
going to be talking about the razor so
I'd rather we carry on with that
just let me ask my question later okay
I'm doing it up I like the the razr maxx
the razr HD mac does it RAZR MAXX HD
arrays are your HD max its razor razor
mash d which drives me nuts because i
think it's yeah the other way but i like
it despite myself III think that the
idea of like screw everything I'm going
to have a phone that lasts forever is
actually pretty compelling I like this
skin a lot because it's so lightweight
they added that little quick setting
things on the left they did get rid of
the cool little pop-up which is which i
guess is fine I'm gonna disagree really
close to stock I'm gonna disagree with
you there about the settings page
because the settings feeling like it is
actually the least usable quick settings
page that you can have because you can't
access it from within an app like the
way LG does it and the way Samsung does
it by putting it in the notification bar
allows you to access it from wherever
app you're in you can like swipe down
click your bluetooth on or click your
Wi-Fi on or off or whatever it might be
but with motor oil you have to go back
to the home screen and then swipe over
to access it so it's really you know you
might as well just access the settings
button from the notification menu it
does it does I mean you've got you could
the widgets oider notification toggle
whatever but yeah you're right there but
I mean and other than that I mean you
know if the skin isn't too bad and you
know it uses the on-screen buttons and
whatever else so like yeah the cameras
not the possibles too awesome and I know
that a lot of people think the screen is
where I think it's way over saturated um
but if I were on verizon and buying a
phone tomorrow um I would probably go
for the razor matchick maxx HD uh-huh is
that easy Emily else over the galaxy s3
if you were you know because i mean the
the galaxy of 3 is a better camera um I
think the screens whatever but i mean
the the battery thing is super
compelling to me i am you know i am i
would love to like think about
pleasuring my phone every day and a half
uh you know I think needle treat plug my
phone in the way I treat plugging in my
tablet like oh yeah I guess I should
charge it whatever like that would be
nice instead of oh my god oh my god am I
gonna make it to today how'd it out
that's when our GT I would just buy you
a duck for the galaxy s or stuck in a
second battery since you can swap it in
the galaxy s3 and you can't on the laser
okay that's fair they just all right
gonna take a pic thinking about buying
blackberrys so we know that my judgment
is not to be trusted when it comes to
purchasing phones dude I'm gonna be
interesting those BlackBerry 10 devices
like rim is completely missing out on
this holiday season weirdest new devices
and is betting the entire house on what
I was happening in in the beginning next
year so I'm gonna be very interested
like we've been bashing blackberry for a
long time but I would be very interested
to see what comes out of it because I
also think much like Nokia now with 920
there are no more walls for him to have
his back up against you know it's in
this company has back up against the
wall really needs to make a success out
of this we said that badly 800 said
about the Lumia 900 but I really feel
like Nokia is facing that with the Lumia
920 now I definitely feel the same way
about rim but it's new BlackBerry's next
year but I think she I did this question
that I have is for Chris providing he's
still alive and is briefing a quick one
do we actually have any examples of
companies going through just a massive
tumultuous period what are their being
taken over by another company whether
just completely switching brown strategy
the way to knock is done with symbian to
Windows Phone and I'm also thinking of
HP taken over palm and things like that
where that massive change as I should
turned out for the good because I don't
seem to recall any such examples Apple
okay do you wanna expand well I mean
Apple was on the verge of bankruptcy
multiple times over the course of its
history in the 80s and 90s then of
course they they brought in Steve Jobs
and what was it 98 I think 99 somewhere
in there
and you know they switched their focus
to consumer products and of course the
ipod very famously in the imac that you
remember the original Bondi blue iMac
which i was in college at the time and
every single dorm room in college had at
least one bonnie blue imac and i think
the rest is history I don't need to
explain where Apple is now so Apple
would be I think that the most obvious
example of that but you're right i mean
there there aren't terrible I mean I i
think that the you know what nokia and
rim are going through right now are
somewhat unprecedented and it becomes
more and more difficult by the day for
us or for financial analyst look at what
they're going through and say you know
there is a viable way for these
companies to come out of this unscathed
than in one piece um we'll have to see
you know you can't you can't make that
call until it actually happens but i
don't know you know it I can't that I
personally very much like the 920 in a
limited time that I've had with it and I
I'm always optimistic when new version
of Windows Phone is announced and I very
much like that the tweaks that they've
made I love the new home screen but I
selling that message to the average
consumer like I said before when you're
going from 99 99 for the Lumia 900 up to
149 99 is and as Dan pointed out that
the Lumia 900 very quickly fell to free
that is just not a message that they're
going to be able to convey very
effectively especially when you have
this it's what 12 points something
millimeters thick sitting right next to
a seven-point whatever millimeter thick
iphone 5 4 199 it's it's a very very
tough sell yeah i mean the reason i was
asking this is what was to related to
google's motorola take over just because
it kinda seems to be tracking on the
same way with HP and palm where it was
oh where we need to integrate we need to
integrate we're big companies etc etc
and then the monsters kept passing and
passing you didn't see anything truly
innovative I mean if we recalled palm
still kind of bringing
devices to still very much look I mean
the palm pre was palm pre 2 rather look
almost identical to the palm pre if I
recall it directly but a shining ray of
hope and light is actually the novel's
take over the thing about brand yeah we
which puts my mind so that that actually
worked out more or less well somehow i'm
not sure glad that the comparison of HP
and palm to google and motorola is is
quite apt just because HP and palmer and
such very separate in different
businesses when when each people at them
I know HP had its little smart phone
line but it was really HP had no
presence in the mobile space and it
really didn't know what to do with palm
and that became apparent very very
obviously apparent but where Google and
Motorola is like you know they're both
you know companies in the mobile space
they have you know what would one would
assume to have very similar interests as
far as you know getting their product
out there in the hands of people so for
for Google to not quickly take advantage
of the fact that it's got a massive
phone manufacturer and device
manufacturer at its disposal it's like
we mentioned before a little a little
bit mind-boggling especially to a
consumer speaking of companies on the
brink we got a look at the HTC j
butterfly Oh Jersey oh my god i want to
say this uh i am not a fan of five inch
phones i've said this before but this
thing looks absolutely amazing and I
really really really really really want
to play with one its own I mean the
macro shot of the screen compared to the
iphone 5 like bra you could die like
tesc so text text so sharp it will cut
you
yeah well what's the PPI on this like
440 is that it's that's you know that's
it that's a our friend Paul Miller pixel
density enthusiasts like absolute dream
I well I want to say a 5-inch phone
would be he's absolutely nothing but I
got mean that kind of what excellent
entity is uh but yes three yeses it's
great it's crazy just treated like a
tablet yeah it's it I don't is 8,000
milliamp battery gonna be enough though
that's using the s4 pro so that's
definitely gonna be easier on the
processor around the battery life it's a
pretty powerful processor uh but I do I
would worry a little bit about that yeah
I think there's a lot of things to worry
about there's a lot of unknowns here
it's like you mentioned the battery is a
big deal except that's actually kind of
small relatively at this point which is
insane to think but especially for
something that has such a large display
with such a high pixel density and
resolution to be pushing around all day
long yeah and then we've got rumors that
it's coming to verizon we've seen it as
the dl x and then also today i entered
central had a leak that had it showing
as i believe that the droid DNA which I
I'm motherhood DLX if that's not the
deluxe I much prefer this just might be
called a droid I mean that's what I much
prefer I much prefer that it not have
tried branding no I'm ready I'm with you
been but it would also kind of make
sense because if you record last year
HTC had one of the very first 720p
phones with the resound by the way the
first in fact yeah and now it's kind of
shaping up roughly around the same time
frame to release one of the very first
1080p phones sea monster okay i get i
will say that if it does if they do go
to the droid branding maybe that's a
good thing for HTC at least because then
verizon will put some real marketing
behind it which we know that
historically they have been press re i'm
just paging through Sam Jeff's photos of
the HTC j butterfly
right now anyway traditionally verizon
has not put a ton of marketing help
behind HTC stuff so that I guess is a
good sign um yeah I mean this thing is
going to be a giant phone but if the
battery life is you know good and the
screen in person is anywhere near to you
know what it looks like in these photos
and what we've described in our post
then I'm gonna be really excited for
this phone and and we can be pretty a
pretty confident that it will not have
this software that we saw on the j
butterfly which is very much of a japan
i think was a kddi yeah that's that's
very much their custom software which is
like the the rhyme from last year if you
know you remember that so so that will
very likely not be on it when it does
make its way into the US and we'll be
looking at sense 4.1 or four plus or
whatever HTC is calling it at the time
witness arise so this is just a couple
of quick points here first of all we
also got a reports out of Korea to say
that Samsung and LG and pantech are all
planning to do 1080p smart phones
themselves next year I mean energy is
already showing up a 5-inch 1080p pounds
so that's no surprise there so this HTC
is going to have competition is just
going to be next year but the second
point is I'm really curious to know what
happens if you just chop down this 1080p
panel make it a 720p one all sort of
screen size you get I mean it kinda
seems like probably gonna be like four
point six inches again so gonna be
decimal but it was so awesome to have a
720p panel at four point four inches I
really high quality one well and also if
so it would actually be if you chop this
down to 720p it would actually be
smaller than that because the the
resound as you mentioned before is a 4.3
inch 720p display and if I remember
correctly they had about a 30 346 ppi
all right yeah so you would actually
might actually be in the range of four
inches or even like 3.8 3.7 3.8 I'm sure
if our chat wants to do some really
rough quick calculations for us
but you know that would be utterly
amazing if you just kind of cut the
screen down and then put it in a 3.7
inch phone when 7 is actually gonna be
useful uh but i'll set up for really
weird resolution in the middle yeah you
know and at around 4.1 4.2 inches i will
settle for that that was it but
seriously though if it kind of bugs me
that I mean maybe it's just mass
manufacturing reasons but do these 1080p
panels that have been produced in their
overkill and five inches or we go again
other than you know people with really
small hands using there was just a
proper tablet so just something a little
bit smaller a little bit scaled down
with the same pixel density that is
gonna be a real 60 none of these 1080p
was hot I'm just gonna say I think our
chat someone in our chat is saying that
445 PPI would be on a three point three
inch display someone in our chat also
would like to point out that dan seifert
likes his calculations rough yes I like
them rough in forty shades of a quick
right there actually Wow uh it's defy
how do you pronounce this defies gravity
I don't know uh I've nothing else to say
about the j butterfly other than I can't
wait to see it in the US we should talk
about sprint though before we wrap the
show um so okay they have gone back and
acquired a majority stake and clearwire
again how many times are we gonna write
the story where Sprint is or is not
investing in clearwire are putting it at
arm's length or taking it back into the
fold or dumping clearwire stock or
acquiring clearwire stock it seems like
every six months they do something
different with clearwire and I know that
things are different now because of
softbank is so there how much cash and
they're trying to you know go back to
something now that they're in more of a
position of strength in terms of you
know casual and I guess uh but like just
decide guys
acquire them or don't I'm tired of this
like I do we like their wire don't we
like their why do we need them or don't
we it's it's exhausting I think I'm sure
Chris can speak much more intelligently
to this than I can but I think sprint
actually and Softbank to that matter
actually has zero interest in
Clearwire's a company and it's just
using as a pollen to access the spectrum
that clearwire owns the licensing too
yeah I think that that move was driven
entirely by the softbank deal and that's
something that's move that they wouldn't
have made had that deal not gone through
and that you know that was probably just
a situation worse off shopping was like
you know we want to acquire you on the
condition that you up your up your stake
in clear where to be a majority the the
fact that they they say I mean sprint
already had a majority right like the
fact they sold down just enough to not
have a majority it was kind of weird in
the first place because they lost all
those voting rights if for a little bit
of money it was weird so I yeah this
makes a lot of sense to me it's like
them and they were living paycheck to
paycheck basically right and then they
found their sugar daddy yep in this
issue in jeopardy we should we should
mention that we did um a profile bank
CEO whose name I'm gonna struggle to
pronounce now masayoshi son Wow very
good nicely done that was excellent I I
spent many many hours editing that piece
so I'm well acquainted with masayoshi
matsuyoshi son at this point yeah he
seems like a really interesting
character like if you haven't read this
report you totally should because like
it's all these things we're like oh wow
there's like he's like I don't know like
a cross between Bill Gates and osa
Branson no I don't know what I want to
say it's like I don't know it would be
really cool to like see him start
talking about sprint in the US and um
bring a you know be like the opposite of
dan hesse in terms of like being like a
you know person that isn't totally
laid-back and show all the time well
he's yep resume dan has in terms hi yeah
in physical size that reminded me of the
Butte Bill O'Reilly debates against Jon
Stewart uh pick up Horry I never
realized the difference in height
between those two dudes as well and
sprint also has now hit a 30 markets
with LTE which I have yet to see it in
anywhere I've been there in Chicago
Wichita Massachusetts I'm every bit
serious in Kansas it's clear that we
need to be clear that it's not in
Chicago proper or Chicago metro rights
it's some kind of suburbs so I I don't
even think Chris could access the elt
network here where he is if I had a
device that was even capable of it I
used one once upon a time I had a Sprint
Galaxy Nexus review unit which I might
need get back but but other than that I
I do not yeah didn't you use that Nexus
review unit to drive out to like
Kankakee uh and yes see if the LTE
network was alive at that point and you
had yes I was I was so stoked that I was
gonna be I was like okay I have this key
advantage over every other tech reporter
in the world and that I live in Chicago
not New York or San Francisco and I'm
like you know it's it's driveable for me
right so hop in my car in the middle of
the night drive out to the the middle of
nowhere and and try to get service I
drove that entire freaking town I spent
like four or five hours driving every
street there and was never able I I kept
rebooting the Galaxy Nexus never got a
thing so I don't know if that was just a
bunk rumor or what happened but wait it
would like it came from Wall Street
Journal so there was some basis in truth
to that but it's just you know might
have just been that
the engineers had the network turned off
at that point because it wasn't official
is a I wouldn't even call the soft
launch I think they were just turning
the signals on and off you know to test
it internally and they you know they
didn't intend for actual consumers to be
using it so yeah that was that was a
bust but i did i did still manage to
squeeze a report out of it even though
my test was a complete bust i'm very
proud of that now that your efforts were
not totally in vain right so well I
should do the rap ah for
Thanksgiving so if if I can I will go
and test more sprint LTE what I'm there
it'll be fun uh yeah that's right we
should wrap up we owe you i just wanted
to raise a couple quickies do it if i
can uh first of all this morning at
t-mobile put up the galaxy note 2 to be
able to buy in the US now 369 99 on
contract and my report from this morning
was that pretty much every one of my us
colleagues as soon as they came on and
so that were like what i believe is
exactly what i says is that when i
dropped i jumped in our chat at like
seven in the morning and I'm like what
are they thinking so first thing out of
my mouth it's it's not something the
thing is AT&amp;amp;T has the same phone for
three hundred dollars in contract and
sprinkle as well so it was Prince
verizon is gonna get it and probably
have the same price I'm not perfectly
sure about it antique my larger size you
know we're special so which are just say
seventy dollars extra and this is after
a mail-in rebate so that's adding insult
to injury so you have to you have to
pony up more is it more than four
hundred dollars in the story seems like
it's 420 you have to pony up over four
hundred and twenty dollars in the store
on contract for the note 2 now it should
be noted that this is not any different
than what t-mobile did with the galaxy
s3 the galaxy s3 on t-mobile is more
expensive as well first whatever reason
that might be oh really yes yeah it's
either t30 or seventy dollars more I
can't remember exactly t-mobile is very
hour
verse 2 there they're trying very very
hard to get away from the subsidy model
and this is something that this isn't
just like a rumor this is like they
regularly talk about this as a business
priority for them and but I would argue
that the way to get away from the
subsidy model is not to charge people
three hundred seventy dollars on
contract there there there are other
ways to approach that like you know just
just go ahead and charge them full MSRP
and not have them be on a contract
because that's that's kind of a pathetic
subsidy agree yeah if anybody's
awareness for you I was just saying if
you haven't read it you should go read
lads review of the the galaxy note 2 i
I've been playing with tmobile aversion
and like you know we put up a little
update to the review but the update is
essentially a t-mobile's version is just
like the international version but
there's also Wi-Fi calling if you want a
big tablet and you want to spend a
ridiculous amount of money at the outset
it's really good I mean wow that's a
super fine that's a great point about a
tablet you can get the new ipad mini 4
less you can get the galaxy note 2 on
tmobile video to your contract well to
be fair the the price of that ipad mini
does not include cellular connectivity
right right okay but then even if you do
check on the LTE option you're looking
at something like 400 something dollars
again without the contract right and
it's a bigger tablet and it again and it
runs on LTE whereas the galaxy note 2
and t-mobile will not right yeah so
there's no it's over it's the verge
bubble show we have to end on a down
note and so if you want to follow us on
Twitter you really should i'm at back
lon vladas i have lots of courses at z
power dams at DC seifert with an e I in
the middle of it we are all at verge and
we'll be back next week
which day who knows we'll have to check
the Mayan calendar and see if we can
figure it out thanks for watching
