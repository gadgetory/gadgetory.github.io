we're here at the Amazon echo event in
Seattle where as you might expect we've
seen new echoes today we've seen a whole
bunch of new stuff but I'm gonna take
you through these echoes speakers and
I'm gonna start with the echo plus
because I think this is the one that's a
little more interesting even though this
one looks different
so the echo plus looks just like the
original echo it's the same tubular
design it has the same far-field
microphone array there are some
differences to the speaker architecture
inside of this but the biggest thing
about it is that it doubles as a smart
home hub so for awhile you've been able
to use echo devices use alexa and echo
devices to control certain aspects of
your smart home but now this will
actually search for different wireless
protocols around your home look for
smart phone gadgets that you're trying
to connect with and go through the setup
and configuration process directly from
the echo speaker you just say Alexa
discover devices around the home and if
you happen to have let's say smart
lightbulbs in the home she'll take you
through the setup process amazon says
this is going to support different
wireless protocols the one that we saw
demonstrated today was ZigBee I don't
think this supports z-wave but it'll
also work across Wi-Fi and Bluetooth as
you might expect ok so this is the other
new echo speaker as is obvious new form
factor it's a shorter and a little bit
squatter than the other echo we just
took a look at also has a different
speaker architecture built inside of it
as you might expect because physically
it's different also has Dolby sound
processing does all the stuff that you
would expect an Alexa equipped echo
speaker to do but the most interesting
thing about this is that it's $99 so
that is a pretty inexpensive echo
speaker it also comes in
different designs so this one's wood you
can get one covered in fabric and here's
a little bonus echo for you these are
the new echo buttons that we saw today
these pair with an existing echo device
and then you're supposed to use Alexa to
trigger the buttons and you can start
playing some type of game you can play
trivia games or just games that involve
you tapping the buttons as you might
expect we don't know exactly when these
are gonna go on sale yet but we know
that they're selling for twenty dollars
for a two pack of buttons but let's be
honest probably gonna want to buy more
of these if you're the kind of person
who wants to interact with your echo in
this way so yeah
echo buttons these are gonna be the
things that force you to interact with
other human beings rather than just
interacting with your voice controlled
speaker we live in the future
the echo plus goes on sale today it
starts shipping next month it's one
hundred and forty nine dollars which is
less expensive than the original price
of the original echo from a few years
ago but still puts it at sort of the
upper level of pricing for echo products
so yeah it's been a pretty Ecco filled
day we also saw the echo spot which we
have another video on we saw the echo
connect it's supposed to let you make
phone calls but yeah Amazon is really
going all-in on its approach to sort of
infiltrating your smart home and making
Alexa be everywhere I said it weird
right okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
