verge and today we are checking out the
Moto Z 3-play Motorola's newest phone in
their Z lineup you can immediately tell
they've made some obvious hardware
changes to make the phone look a little
more expensive even though it's still
keeping that mid-range cost and so far
I'm having a lot of fun playing with it
you'll immediately notice some obvious
hardware changes dual rear facing
cameras the missing home button side
fingerprint sensor in a taller display
motorola clearly designed the device so
click a higher-end phone particularly
with those minimized bezels aluminum
body and black back well there's no
notch sorry - all you notch lovers out
there the new phone looks nice although
the glass back gathers lots of
fingerprints and doesn't serve a real
purpose like allowing for wireless
charging you'll need a moto mod if you
want to do that speaking of which z3
place still supports moto mods and is
backwards compatible with any you might
have purchased for prior models as for
these Hardware updates the display is a
six inch full HD Plus Super AMOLED with
a new 18 by 9 aspect ratio in my brief
handling of the phone the display
quality wasn't great it wasn't very
bright when I took it outside and I
didn't feel it could accurately
represent colors especially skin tones
it also wasn't extremely clear and
didn't allow me immediately the side
fingerprint sensor seems to work well
enough although sony was really the only
other company using side sensors and
even they recently gave up on it but
motorola didn't really have a choice
here because the rear fingerprint sensor
would be covered by mods which of the
company definitely wants you to buy so
if it wants a fingerprint sensor it has
to go with the side placement inside the
phone features a Snapdragon 636
processor with four gigs of RAM and 32
gigs of expandable storage the phone
charges over USB C and supports fast
charging the batteries 3000 milliamp
hours which is the same as last year's
model but smaller than the originals II
play this should still be enough to get
you through the day though of course you
can also always buy a battery Mon if you
want more juice and if you purchase the
unlocked z3 plate in the US it will be
bundled with a battery mod that'll give
you up to 40 hours of use
the cameras underwent the biggest
changes the dual cameras on the back
include a 12 megapixel sensor in a 5
megapixel depth sensing lens that's
mostly used for portrait mode the
front-facing camera has an 8 megapixel
sensor there are a couple new software
features like portrait mode for the
front-facing camera but my favorite is
the cinemagraph mode it lets you record
a video of a scene and choose which
parts of it keep moving in which stay
still like these balloons or this flag
it's super gimmicky but I enjoyed
playing with it what I continue to use
this feature after a few days probably
not the phone also features google lens
built right into the camera the z3 play
runs Android 8.1 mostly sticks with
Google stock Android but because there's
no home button you can gesture on the
screen through Motorola's one-button
navigation it allows you to swipe left
to go back right for recent apps or tap
to go back home if you press and hold
Google assistant will launch the phone
will be shipped with this feature turned
off in the standard navigation buttons
on honestly this didn't free up much
screen space and I kept getting confused
about which gestures did what it's
personal preference though and some
people will probably like this feature
while others won't ok so the phone will
be out this summer exclusively through
US Cellular and Sprint in the US or you
can get it unlocked through various
retailers but if you do that you're
going to get a bundle in the u.s. o come
bundled with a battery mod and abroad
you can either get a battery mod with
the phone or a speaker mod those bundles
will cost $499
we don't have pricing yet just on the
phone by itself through the carriers but
hopefully we'll have that information
soon thanks for watching then as always
stay tuned to the verge comm and the
Verge's youtube channel for a full
review of the z3 play and all our other
tech coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
