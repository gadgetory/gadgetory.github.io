we're taking a look at the new iPad
you're probably looking at these devices
wondering which one is the new iPad it's
actually the device on the left but
they're basically identical in design
save for some very minor differences in
weight and thickness so while the new
iPad does look the same as the old one
it there are some significant
differences the first one is of course
the Retina display which you probably
can't see on this video and looking at
on a computer screen does it no justice
but it's an incredibly high resolution
display it's 2048 by 1536 which is
double the resolution of the previous
iPad and higher resolution than any
monitor I have in my house higher
resolution than your HD television it
just is incredibly high res and it looks
pretty incredible even up close you
really can't see pixels on it looking at
a text dense page like the verge
there's just no it's just kind of like I
said this before but it's kind of like
looking at a glowing piece of paper
which sounds a little ridiculous until
you see it and it just is you get an
idea of how amazing the text and images
really look on it again seeing it on
camera doesn't do it justice you hate
you kind of have to see it in person it
should be noted that the Retina display
on the iPad on the new iPad is a lower
pixel density than that of the iPhone 4
iPhone 4s Apple's explanation is that
you're going to hold this a bit further
away from your eyes than you would the
iPhone 4 that may be true but I have to
say even holding it really close up to
your eyes you you can't see a difference
between this and the iPhones Retina
display and in fact to me this actually
looks better than the iPhone display
also inside the new iPad is the a 5 X
SOC it has a CPU clocked to one
gigahertz and a quad-core GPU which
Apple says will help with graphics
performance we're probably not seeing in
on titles at this point since this thing
has just been released but this is a
fairly graphically intense game and
there's no lag whatsoever everything
moves really fluidly no stutter but I
have to say the performance is also
quite good on the iPad 2 so it's hard to
if if it's just a question of the code
here or if the new SOC is going to make
a big difference also inside the new
iPad at least on certain models is LTE
you can get an eighty and four rise in
varieties I tested the Verizon version
and I'll just show you a quick speed
test here I'm on LTE right now I've got
full bars and the test numbers I'm
seeing are pretty off the charts
we're in midtown Manhattan and here you
can see it's getting about 20 down and
just absurd 13 up which is faster than I
get at home by a longshot
on DOCSIS 3 so really impressive
performance on Elte of course
depending on your coverage and the how
many people in your area are using LTE
you're going to see differences but
pretty impressive and in Brooklyn where
I don't get as good a signal I still get
really impressive numbers on LTE
performance it's great for browsing and
streaming it's completely usable and you
can also for the least the Verizon
version use the iPad as a hotspot and
they've got a variety of plans from one
gig a month up to 10 gigs also of note
is the new camera here they're now
calling the camera on the iPad and on
the iPhone 4s an iSight camera it's a 5
megapixel shooter on this does autofocus
face detection it's actually a decent
camera except for the fact that it is
extremely ridiculous to use an iPad to
take photos with so while it actually
does take good photos I can't recommend
that anybody walks around taking photos
with this thing because you're just
gonna look like a jerk it takes fairly
competent photos and you can see some of
the detail here they're clear very crisp
does a nice job focusing in even on
close subjects and you can get an idea
of the speed here not that not that the
iPad 2 is a slouch but clearly this
device has no trouble handling large
files and in fact even with higher
megapixel pictures twelve fourteen it
still handles them quite quite easily
and quickly in the new iPad the battery
life is pretty much unchanged on LTE you
lose an hour Apple says you can get 10
on Wi-Fi browsing and nine
an LTE and in our testing that's pretty
much exactly what we got surprisingly
Apple is able to achieve those numbers
because they've almost doubled the size
of the battery and yet haven't really
altered the shape and size of it in any
significant way so times like I said
tiny bit heavier a little bit thicker
but the battery life is still fairly
solid there's a couple of notable
additions on the app front here first
off Apple has created a version of
iPhoto for the iPad it's also for the
iPhone and you can do some pretty decent
editing on this it's it's actually
surprisingly powerful you can get an
idea again here of how fast it is at
handling large images so there are a
bunch of different things you can do in
terms of editing you get options for
fixing redeye changing the saturation
the coloring highlights and shadows
playing around with those guys you can
change various color elements of an
image it actually can detect specific
parts of an image for instance here it
knows this is sky and you're able to
adjust the blueness of the sky just by
swiping left to right and this is
non-destructive editing you've got an
undo up here and you can also choose to
reset the changes that you've made it's
also got a number of effects kind of
Instagram ish there's vintage stuff and
black and white and and just a variety
of these different effects you can add
on pictures and it also has a vignette
which you can which you can alter using
multi-touch if you really want to give
it that vintage pinhole feel but it's
it's a surprisingly powerful image
editing tool and in fact there are even
photoshop asked features like you're
able to repair photos something like the
clone tool it's best used when you get
in close on an image but you see here I
had our editorial assistant Michael draw
a star on his hand and we're going to
just see if we can repair that
a little bit up in there pretty decent
for if you've got to do some quick edits
of a photo it's actually really powerful
considering it's a $4.99 app and it's
running on a tablet
it also can import and export RAW files
and you can work with much higher
resolution images than what the iPad is
capable of so Apple has an included Siri
in the new iPad but they have added
dictation which does a really good job
of listening to what you're saying and
translating it to text on screen let's
just do a quick test here I'm dictating
a note to the new iPad , and it's pretty
great so you can see it works pretty
well and pretty fast alongside the
announcement of the new iPad and iPhoto
Apple also talked about an update to
GarageBand which adds a few things like
smart strings which is an orchestral
version of their smart guitar and
keyboard and drum options but one of the
coolest new features of GarageBand is
the fact that you can basically have a
jam session with other people running
GarageBand on the same network whether
it's on an iPhone or an iPad and
basically one person becomes a band
leader and everybody else follows their
sequence but when you play on the
secondary iPads it records to the first
one and records on the second one as
well so you can contribute to a song in
real time it's actually really cool and
in fact even if you're just playing
around with an iPhone an iPad solo
you're able to play multiple instruments
at the same time which is really cool
for a musician so here's something I was
working on
so in closing the new iPad is really
really good it's got that beautiful
Retina display superfast LTE a better
processor and more RAM in terms of
general functionality and look and feel
it's not that different than the
previous version but the new hardware
really takes it to another level if
you're in the market for a tablet right
now there is no product that I can
recommend more highly</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
