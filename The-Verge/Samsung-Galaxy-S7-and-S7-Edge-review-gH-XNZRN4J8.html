out design this is a big deal it's the
first Samsung phone with beautiful
curves and premium materials instead of
those cheap and plasticky designs that
the company used to crank out so here we
are a year later and Samsung hasn't
changed too much
the new Galaxy s7 and s7 edge are
radically different from last year's
models and they look almost identical
their refinements and progressions their
iterations on what was already a good
product that's really a good thing
because the s6 was a good foam and
Samsung has done enough here to make the
galaxy s7 a great phone the standard
galaxy s7 has undergone the fewest
changes it's got the same sized screen
same overall design largely looks
indistinguishable from the galaxy s6
it's still glass and metal and there
isn't a shred of plastic to be found
it's a little bit softer and a little
bit easier to hold and it's also
slightly thicker with a more rounded
back which makes it more comfortable in
your hand but other than that it's
pretty much the same phone but the s7
edge has undergone a number of changes
that really make it head and shoulders
better than its predecessor and smaller
sibling well for starters it's got a
larger 5.5 inch display still Super
AMOLED still quad HD resolution still
stunning to look at it also still has
those curved sides on the front but now
the back is a slight curve too which
makes it way more comfortable to hold
and easier to pick off of a flat surface
now I don't want to get too crazy here
but it really feels like the s7 edge
might be the nicest phone I've ever held
I have a lot of phones now let's talk
about those curves Samsung's been
putting curved screens on phones for a
couple of years and well it's always
felt like a bit of a gimmick but the s7
edge actually proves that there's a
reason for those curves it allows for a
larger display without making the phone
huge in fact it's notably narrower than
other phones with similar sized screens
look at it next to an iPhone 6s plus or
a Nexus 6p
or the LG g4 or even Samsung's own note
5 in each case the s7 edge is a similar
or same sized display but it's
noticeably narrower and smaller in size
that makes it easier to hold easier to
use in one hand and easier to slip in
your pocket without giving up that big
screen finally those curves have a
reason to exist both phones are also
water-resistant this year and they can
go under a meter and a half of water for
up to 30 minutes at a time but the
practical use here is that you don't
have to worry about dropping it in the
same course
and coffee on it or getting caught out
in the rain and the other big hardware
difference is support from SD cards so
if the 32 gigabytes of storage I comes
with the phone isn't enough well you can
easily expand it aside from that the
hardware on the s7 is really familiar
again these are refinements not
overhauls and again that's a good thing
because last year's phones were really
nice and these ones are just better
inside Samsung's made bigger
improvements the phones are thicker this
year because they have much bigger
batteries 3000 milliamp hour on the s7
and a whopping thirty six hundred
million power on the s7 edge which
addresses the biggest complaint with
last year's phone both phones have been
able to get us through a day but they
probably won't get you to to really if
you're concerned with battery life the
s7 edge is the one to go with you just
can't argue with the size of that
battery both also have fast charging and
fast wireless charging so it's easy to
top-up when you need to
now the s6 wasn't slow by any means but
it did get bogged down when you push it
to the limit the s7 on the other hand
doesn't have any performance issues that
we can see it's got a new processor and
four gigabytes of RAM that make
everything from browsing the web to
taking pictures to playing games a piece
of cake and it doesn't get nearly as
warm as last year's phone did either ok
let's talk about the camera because the
camera is a big deal and Samsung's
making a big deal about the camera it's
all new it's got lower resolution and a
brighter lens and an all new sensor it's
also really fast to launch and focus and
that unsightly bump that's on the back
the phone isn't nearly as bad this time
around it digs great picks in all kinds
of lighting situations but truth be told
it's not hugely different from the s6
this camera it still produces yellowish
images in low light and if you zoom in
all the way there's a good amount of
over sharpening happening so those are
pretty minor complaints I had no
problems trusting the s7 to take pics
when I needed it to it was often very
happy with the results so I mostly been
raving about the s7 and the s7 edge so
far and that's really because there's
not a whole lot to complain about but if
there is one thing you complain about
its unsurprisingly with Samsung's
software they both run Android 6.0
marshmallow and they have Samsung's
TouchWiz interface which is still ugly
but it's probably the best it's ever
looked
you can still theme it pretty easily if
you want something closer to stock
Android to the Verizon models that we've
been testing are loaded with crap where
and the vast majority of is bad and not
useful if you're really great Samsung
stood up to carriers and stop them from
loading up otherwise great phones with a
bunch of useless apps but that hasn't
happened here
Samsung has added a couple of new
software features like a bigger edge
screen on the s7 edge it's twice as wide
as before so it shows more information
and you can do a little bit more with it
than you could last year but it's still
pretty gimmicky and I ended up turning
it off most of the time both phones also
have a new always-on display mode which
lets you easily see the date and time or
a month calendar or even a picture if
you want without turning the screen on
but it doesn't show me app notifications
would be way more useful and it begs me
to double tap the screen to fully wake
it up which of course doesn't work it's
like an always-on version of what
Motorola and Google have done but with
less practical utility but the overall
upside here is that while these software
features kind of stink you can easily
turn them off and pretend they never
existed so that's where we're at with
the s7 and the s7 edge they're really
great phones not perfect but really
great and perhaps the best Android
phones you can buy right now they get
the basics right great screens great
cameras great performance reliable
battery life and they have eye-catching
designs of premium materials it turns
out that a new design one year and
refinement on the next is a great idea
and you know what great ideas make great
phones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
