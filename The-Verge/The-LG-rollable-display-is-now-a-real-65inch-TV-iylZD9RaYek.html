This is LG's rollable
4K signature OLED TVR.
I know it's a mouthful,
but it's beautiful.
Here in Las Vegas, we're
seeing a lot of TVs
with bigger and bigger screens, 75 inches,
88 inches, and above.
And there's a ton of hype about 8K,
even though there's not any
8K content to watch anywhere.
But here's the thing.
There are people who don't love having
a big black rectangle be the centerpiece
of their living room.
Lots of folks don't have a TV at all.
We've seen with our phones this desire
to spend less time in front of screens.
Now, that's translating to our TVs.
Companies have been making
TVs that blend better
into our homes.
You've seen this with
Samsung and its Frame TV,
which looks like a picture frame
and shows museum artwork
whenever you're not watching it.
Samsung also has the Serif TV,
which looks just like a piece of furniture
and even has built-in shelves.
In a way, this new rollable TV from LG
is the pinnacle of that philosophy.
When it ships this spring,
for a lot of money,
let's be clear, you
can have a beautiful TV
that just tucks away once
you don't need it anymore.
Now, since this is an OLED after all,
you get all of LG's best technology.
Perfect blacks, bright HDR highlights,
and a wide range of vivid colors.
It also runs webOS and has all the popular
built-in apps that you need.
If you're like me,
you're probably wondering
if there are trade-offs or sacrifices
when you move to a rollable screen
versus a rigid, standard OLED TV.
I asked LG just that
question, and they claim
there are no major differences.
You get their best picture quality
in a screen that rolls up.
Now is that true?
We'll have to wait and see.
Way back in 2016, LG first started teasing
just this kind of bendable display.
Two years later, LG Display
had a prototype at CES 2018
that looks just like the OLED-R.
But LG's consumer brand
has made some changes.
They've added a Dolby Atmos soundbar
with virtual 5.1 surround sound,
and polished up the enclosure
so it looks a bit nicer.
You don't actually see
the roll as the 65-inch TV
closes up into its base.
As it rises and goes back
down, you'll notice the bracing
on the back sort of close in
right up until the whole thing
disappears inside that base station.
So the whole point of this TV
is that you don't have to have
a big TV up all the time.
There's this cool mode where
it comes up just one-fourth
of the way, you can play
music or control your
smart home gadgets without
having the whole panel rise up.
Even when the TV screen is down,
you can still play music through
its hundred-watt speaker.
And for the first time,
LG's adding support
for Apple's AirPlay 2.
The OLED-R is designed to be flexible
wherever you put it, whether
that's on a credenza,
in your living room, or just
freestanding on its own.
Now I know not everyone's
gonna be as captivated
as I was by a roll-up TV.
You can buy a great 4K HDR TV for $600.
But once you do, it's
always just kind of there,
in a room.
All you can really do
is put it up on a wall
and try and forget about it.
Now we're seeing this trend where TVs
are trying to become more and less,
works of art, shelving units,
and some that just disappear entirely.
But let's be real.
It's gonna be a few
years before most folks
can walk into a Best Buy
and afford a roll-up 4K TV.
LG tells me it's gonna be
priced at a very premium level.
For comparison's sake, its wallpaper TV
started at $8,000.
This is more impressive so
it might be more expensive.
But this is CES where
we've heard about rolling,
folding screens for years.
This time, we see a real product,
and it's almost ready for showtime.
Hey everybody, thanks
so much for watching.
Now, stay tuned, because
we've got an entire week
of coverage here at CES 2019.
All the latest gadgets
that are here in Las Vegas.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
