we're looking at Google keep the new
sort of note-taking app that Google just
launched a little while ago basically
it's designed to be like sticky notes
it's not competing with Evernote or any
of the services like that it's supposed
to be a really easy way to capture stuff
that you want and basically it gives you
three different ways to do it you can
open up here and just type a note and
save it and just like that it's a note
and it's stored in Drive and it's
accessible via the Android app we'll get
to that in a second you can also upload
a picture which is really just as simple
as picking a picture and hitting Enter
and it uploads and it's all stored here
and just streamed in this one line you
can also quickly create a list if you
want you know a shopping list or
something like that
there's really not that much you can do
with it at that point you can search so
like if I have a grocery list it'll
search through my grocery list and find
all the things that are on here it's
there and you can archive a note you can
delete it so they're really two
different ways to see your notes right
now there's the stream like this where
everything's just kind of in a running
chronological order or you can see it in
a grid which is a little easier to get a
big sense of all of the notes see that
you have so the keep Android app just
launched as well and it's basically the
same thing you have a couple of
different ways to add notes here you can
add voice notes so you can say remember
to pick up milk after work and it'll
just put it right in there and you can
save it and like with the web app you
can color code things to make them a
little easier to find there's also a
keep widget which basically lets you
just jump to write to the same things to
take a picture and upload it and it's
dead simple it's really fast that's one
of the best things about this actually
is a lot faster than something like
Evernote or even simple note just for
uploading things but for right now it's
super basic there's really not much you
can do except have this one big running
stream of stuff and you can obviously
search but what's really cool is what
could come next they they're gonna
integrate this with Drive so all your
files will be available there but it
would also be great when you could take
a note and then immediately jump it to
Gmail or Google Calendar or any of a
number of different services so that's
Google keep it's available for Android
and the web right now and it is pretty
basic right now it's gonna be great for
some people but not nearly enough for
others and hopefully they keep growing
it and don't kill it in some
spring-cleaning three years from now
