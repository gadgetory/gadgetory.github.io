dependently or what's going on so Justin

a Vietnamese socially OC they're making
a robot a dancing robot that plays music
and they've been talking about how
justin bieber is gonna appear here at
CES because a lot of celebrity indoors
and warm robe oh ok so anyhow so we've
been waiting all week to see Justin
Bieber because joanna is has a sexual
crush on justin bieber and so much
sexual it's highly sexual okay and it
grosses everyone out and she one time
accidentally tweeted from PA and gadget
your name Gaza she tweeted from the edge
account I accident like I I got your
21st of it was like using is it wrong to
think justin bieber is sexy it's
actually does it make me a pedophile if
I oh yeah yeah it would have been fine i
think if the engine account was tweeting
is it wrong to think justin bieber say
it was one of our most embarrassing and
shameful moments i actually thought I
cannot believe I live that's why we all
had to leave anyhow that's why we all
had to go cuz of that message I actually
can't believe I was screamed at
understandably so you were screamed it
might be the first time I really
screamed to you you definitely yeah but
not the way out but but but today you
finally got to touch and see a talk what
can your hero but come out of this fugue
state and just kind of yeah what
happened what time was he to the front I
was there for hours with Jordan we went
to go fill me George one of her video
guys yeah he's amazing we wish my way to
the front the PR lady recognized me she
said oh the bird she loves the verge Oh
what she did this is true my beavers BRB
ville no Jesse yeah Bevers Bevers is
like you where the creepy gadget
reporter who's trying to Hawaii burger
the one who tweeted say like yeah and so
she was like you can comment like I
didn't had no idea this was gonna happen

happened I don't know what you told me
that you said to him that you loved him
no to the billion says what did he see
no no no no she says do you love me yeah
it's what she said you love me right oh
yeah he's like yes okay yes i love you i
think he said of course but you said if
I love come out of history is that when
you black down you know what's
interesting before I do I even asking
about a robot I asked him what phony had
even though the iphone was getting their
position I think you see what I be
removed and you say what's this your
favorite hobbies like I don't know said
he doesn't know yeah and then and then
he said do you love me and he was like
yeah and you were like of course it was
real it's worrying about is that you
were weird you were weirdly jerky to him

love him yeah
you're like a mugging hold on me back so
we got something for you to commemorate
this oh really event it's him yes John

photo of you yeah Justin Bieber you
gather it's a little pixelated because
we took it off of off at a booth of yet
but this was that you can hang this
there's like a quick print their
sessions booth you're like I print this
real with there's some stuff here you
can hang you could hang it from your
above your bed or whatever you want to

you and I can put it in my stroller yes
yeah that's a really weird thing to have
it that's it you could you fooled on

a weird confluence I mean it's an
awesome stroller but like I think your

gotta go I'm dying over we we have
reached a fever threshold but I cannot
don't don't that ruin that it costs six
dollars there we go you guys got this
happening yeah what's going on are we
not filming this all right okay yeah you
can just sit here for the rest of it
that's cool I I don't know hey I don't
sit down I have no I started talking
about gadgets no I'm just gonna rock him
to sleep I can't I can the robot was
really bad the robot will send you do
the room there's robot it was a robot
nobody cares there was a robot it and
Bieber did a very suggestive move with
the microphone on the road we yeah I'm
rocking him to sleep okay just making
sure I'm a natural-born father for
Bieber Bieber daddy Bieber day tell me
what happened in tech news assigns a
value on it please the LA like we're
saying the the news breaks are over now
it's everybody just talking about in the
news I think Josh and I'd we did a panel
watching people today have fun today we
did good time we had a we had Ryan body
from samsung mobile Erin woman from
Microsoft drew Bamford from HTC hey by
the way how much is this music getting
picked up
no no not a lot I got it all like
wishful baby but if they like break out
into like a really sweet guitar so we
can turn that up right Yankee we all
right all right anyhow but we had um
Ryan Biden drew Bamford from HTC and and
Aaron woman from Microsoft and we did a
super session called argue the future
where we talked about what was going on
in technology now what was coming we
talked a lot about mobile we talked a
lot of its three film guys three phone
guys but it was a really it was a really
good conversation I gave Ryan Biden from
Samsung a ton of crap about the
commercial they did where they're making
fun of Apple you know he told me I asked
him about the feel free its galaxy note
he was like that that might be an
international oh that crunch then crunch
Bieber a little bit are you beaver
Scottish yeah but imagine anybody Ariel
cuz Bieber crunchies okay all right what
do you see you were giving himself hi
luck screams coughs you know right away
all right let's free its Galaxy Note
right you're slow again might be
changing as it comes to the US Ryan bond
was like that's kind of an international
slogan does he they could go he knows
yeah these like he kind of knows that
it's like it doesn't really work in the
States I'm sorry I'm so distracted by
the fact there's a band trying to stay
behind
and there they see me playing dire
straits yes no yeah it's yes money yeah
I mean I think I think there's a pretty
good chance which ad can you hear this
there's a pretty good try now there's a
pretty good chance we're not going to
continue the podcast like this yeah and
we may have to change location some
great bubbles me back to see this has
been not great for us for the verge cast
it's been we're trying a lot of
different things trying new things try
new things you're not working out well
Oh something were working out well you
just go to our hotel rooms in the sky we
should yeah what do you think about that
I mean that's not they will just play
money for nothing I did I would be I
would except these little pink wings and
money for nothing are you a new stream
right now what's going on over there let
me look what's happening a stream let's
talk to our guys that Chad's off raising
no I know you entered a jaws getting
into a fistfight with Pickler's manager
look I don't even know who this Pickler
is kellie pickler she's apparently a
d-list american idol he lists why don't
know they can't cheer Paul they said hi
to me what's up yeah
what camera along m.o.e we should keep
talking ya know obviously um so promise
we can barely hear each other guys talk
about the super session okay yeah well
done so anyhow we have this great super
session oh you know you were giving ryan
Biden crap about looks feel free to go
freezing the tampon Galaxy Note yeah but
I think they'll change me come to say
see they know but you know I think was
interesting to be like feel free to rock
yeah we was HTC and Samsung HTC Samsung
line to stop Microsoft you know I I
think one of the most accent there he
got along but you know drew we pushed
him on skins a lot and drew first he
said since it's our skin it's an
experience that he relents it makes me
explain to him that it was a scared uh
he was very insistent that HTC believes
they're doing something better yeah I
mean he said I said I said I said I said
you'll skin it because you believe that
you can make the big Android a better
experience he's AG absolutely but what
about when Android becomes a great
experience or you go that's what I'm
seeing with ice cream soon yeah they
don't need they don't need you anymore
they do need your t9 dialer and then you
can hit the rim that's it like I don't
know why people aren't doing but then
you know they won't do 2nite dialers
anymore on standard phones like apple
doesn't do it yeah what do you mean
still you start yeah on phones now like
on stock phones like a smartphone yeah
yeah I don't mess my I need that I'm
yeah won't super could be when you go to
the phone start typing a number you know
or know when your magazine numbers ya
like like predictive dialing you know
nobody does it really yeah maybe they
have to be amazing at t9 texting yeah
that's the day their answers oscilla
dude that one how much is this being
picked up trying yeah I think it's just
really distracting I think it's more
distracting for us that is it okay
that's what they're saying on you so gay
are saying the audio is out of sync on
ustream I don't know if there's anything
but it's cuz we're rocking to hard guys
okay it's possible Pickler's bandage
uses a lot of bandwidth yeah what
they're probably streaming this vertical
six jams someone says the HTC
Thunderbolt has t9 dialer no no HTC he's
saying HTC has it agc puts it in cents
which is great but no one else then
maybe TouchWiz has it too but I'm saying
like on stock OS is from right i mean
webos didn't have it yeah android
doesn't have it stock and iOS doesn't
have it stock right and windows phone
doesn't have in stock and I don't know
why it's like the dumbest best thing in
the world I can't say I've ever wanted a
feature phone yeah don't you want to
dial people in a hurry I mean no I put
everybody my favorites list and what
about your car service if it's less than
one kind of one percenter do you think I
am a car service my government Evan no I
use metro line mmm like a crappy
Brooklyn cart like laughing like an
eight dollar ride somewhere i'm not
talking about like a limo everywhere you
know I know you mean yeah I know you got
your saying no no I know you think I'm
so sorry high-class one percenter yeah
well I am I am actually in the point
five percent I'm more of like an eight
percent richest of the rich i'd like to
think of myself as like an eight percent
ER you're just above the boy boy in the
ten just above the poverty line
but so what else we have you don't that
price of it though you gotta really
about that stroller 300 think it's
probably like that's not no no no no a
nice a nice one of these is like fast
like five hundred thousands of thousands
at least at least a thousand if not two
but my sister really don't have a baby
so we find out Michael do it do for moms
for mom well you're number four yeah
what's this type in robotic somebody
started my foremothers I bet it it
should be except all about dealing with
every guy your mom's by moms all the
people I've been dealing with on this or
guys for for moms 400 400 moms and then
the multiplication symbol mom I think
for moms or dads for baby Joey I don't
even know what don't do anything didn't
nothing else happen to superstition I
mean we won't we had a grill Ian
conversation I mean I i dropped the S
word okay during it it was a totally
twice actually not one time I was
totally packed yeah it was a packed
house there's even people there even
people in the overflow room and no it
was weak I mean it was a very deep
conversation we talked for an hour it
was like a podcast with a bunch of
different people right it was really
good so people should check it out ya
know it's gonna be up on the ca yeah
thank you he'll be up on the CL put it
up tomorrow and we'll put it up on on
the verge tomorrow okay oh and its
really an and I can I can learn well how
can learn what happen I tell her life I
didn't get invited the super social well
I could only have so many people so it's
not super listening Paul's not as cool
as drew but good how about we can have a
profession you have a great one great
great night I 5855 out a great session
we interviewed a lot of people today
yeah there we have an errand women at
her trailer yep yep we had trouble Fiore
Jill belfry much microsoft just hazel
head all everybody asamblea de los del
fiore and wouldn't men who else well I I
interviewed
I change from right here I chang from
light rail yeah which and I i we should
watch them about and we're gonna do a
post I'm actually been to put something
up of like some of our best video and we
have so much video content and that
Lytro interview is really this has been
like a really fun thing at CES to just
have people come over and interview that
we've never really been able to do
before and oh yeah I mean you guys want
to talk about electro because we should
we should go okay so that two things
have I don't know if you've heard of
light row but it's a it takes pictures
and then you can refocus them it's a
light field camera and so you have you
can view the photos in 3d you can like
do parallax stuff and you can choose
your focal point on the on the photo
after the fact and that all that stays
in there but he described it in a really
interesting way that it's kind of like a
3d engine in Reverse where instead of of
a 3d rendering engine tracing light
bouncing off of objects back to a
virtual camera it has all the light
coming into the sensor and then it
traces it the other direction and it
like extrapolates what the scene is
basic blue my mind blowing my mind
because I've been trying to figure this
camera out for a while so that's the
hardware right and then they have this
like secret software that's yeah yeah
over here basically like almost like a
rendering engine like does all that
compositing it takes all that crazy data
that they're getting and then it
converts that into what looks like a
regular because you can do it on the
camera right then you put it on your
laptop you can do in there together so
the laptop stuff is different really
that's like you you don't get the full
file when you do the embeds like I'm
face you can refocus on that yeah you
have the full file is like is like a 16
mix and that's on your computer and that
has infinite focus and then yeah
embed that you do on Facebook or
something three or something yeah like a
limited number and they said that you
could do a video camera yeah no
technical reason why you couldn't do
because he said it take it's like a
shutter system where it takes a still
photo at one time the thing is it's a
it's a processing thing as the big thing
right right now the camera which if it
was shooting a fast sequence it would
shoot it like vga right now but what's
really exciting something now I mean in
a couple years yeah exactly and one of
the things they said we had a red camera
in the trailer that's kind of been
floating around hey Anna you can
basically said that would be one of the
sensors that could actually work with
their technology their as they tried
sensors yeah they have a standard CMOS
sensor and red has one of the best a 4k
CMOS sensor and then they put like a
filter in front of it it's a prison to
do all it was a really fancy but really
feels protected to send all those angled
things but then it's received by a
regular see mom I mean this is truly
it's just truly innovative camera turned
on and what what they really need what
they really have to have to actually do
video is insane like GPUs right to
render this stuff in real job so what is
that what is the resolution you can do
this of still photos now on my trail
it's it's not that it's not that I don't
measure in resolution oh yeah it's like
mega raise your spirits like death rays
some weird Chad I don't like you when
you smiling that way oh great story and
to quickly put off the Micra what is
happening so this is chad milan here
about to start the broadcast they get
the mic up to his face so we went over
there i got one over there better when
they handed I'm just look like this so
we went over there Stockholm today we

we'll have a set up at the trailer
please say a command we have the best
technology powering our site things like
storystream and the video technology
that we're using and our product
database we're really good at taking a
lot of information making it presentable
making it readable and still showing you
what's important what really is going to
make the coverage great is that we have
a staff a big staff of really smart
really talented very sharp writers that
are putting these stories together that
are building narratives out of these
stories they can tell the stories better
than anyone else in the industry
alright we're back kellie Pickler's a
new record she's got a new album coming
out on genuine 24th and I'm pre ordering
it right now right let's get totally to
talk about more technology lytro latro
when is it coming out and yeah it's art
yeah yeah yeah you can pre-order yeah
coming out like februari march and
review what's the maximum resolution egg
erase they don't say mega pommy mega ray
it's like kind of looks like you know
yeah two or three megapixel so like
print out it's meant to be viewed on the
internet but I'm saying on the internet
that's like a that's like a fold it will
generate those quick today give you like
that's like a full screen on a 40 90 x
90 yeah yeah printing out a picture that
you can refocus i think i think they're
letting that one go I'd all been worried
if I want to find a picture but no no
but you can you find you find the egg
you find the focus you like and then
print at it exactly you're living in the
past the point of this also like you
take a lot o my god focus you can
refocus you know what they need to do
they need to create an accessory that's
the Lytro frame yeah Harry tap where you
destroy we could look at your stuff we
have him on we had them it's a freebie
light rope on the verge yeah and before
that they were telling me that they're
building an entire ecosystem yeah they
know that this is a patented technology
yeah yeah Susan Rajan I'm invented it
last time you saw such a wildly
different technology I can't think of
its brand it's a brand new kind of you
know what's really interesting like this
in China this is theoretical in like the
90s yeah yeah so like there was papers
published that guy kept on working on it
kept on being into it finally started a
company the cameras been built over like
a few years as an actual company and now
it's about to kill American company yeah
yeah made in the USA prayin amazing and
say he's fan ever yeah you American
American company American innovation
Chinese money and I think Chinese money
Chinese parts I think I think there's no
better way I such terrible the channel
I'm gonna channel my any inner inner
Gary Shapiro right now yeah there's no
better place to revitalize the US
economy right right here at CES in Las
Vegas it's starting right now if you
have
an idea party right now you have an idea
setting right now and publish a paper on
it in 50 years 25 years you can make the
product no but it's pretty cool I have
to admit it's really cool that that that
this is a brand new type of camera no
one else is doing it and it's a real
thing like you hear all the time about
you know we play my 4k display saw there
like concept cars right now and you see
a lot of 70s that's like a concept car
this is what we just saw concept car
become the car and now we're gonna be
able to drive it and that's exciting and
I have to say you know people and I know
this isn't a CES thing when did they
announce it actually what was the first
Oh while ago we said sean BTW this a
year yeah it's been a while but i think
you know people should talk about this
last night there's a lot of people like
going negative on CS but this is cool
i'm glad people come here to talk about
stuff like this yeah i don't know i
think i'm sure i'm the only guy
cheerleading CES well no I mean I think
since we're not like talking about
hardly is that I was thinking about this
hey like are you gonna go home from this
show and be like this was the best
product we don't have a this is the best
product that's a good question actually
what's the coolest thing like last year
I feel like was the HIV like this is the
best pradhan Oh last year didn't last
year before we do beatrix would it be
like that the rough it was a cool we
were like that's a cool idea that could
be no one's going to that booth to see
that Yannick this year there's no
everyone's going to that butta see ya
gotta be honest with you we talked to
Sanjay Jha and Chris and I is a group of
other reporters and he was talking about
you know they we actually wrote a post
on you guys should read it if you
haven't we talked about this yesterday
no no I know I don't know no but the but
the chrome sure the web he mentioned
that like that there was gonna be a web
top with chrome and you know I think the
idea would be that it's like this like a
Chromebook yeah I thought for a second
that he was gonna say you know we're
announcing later today or something no
because I think that would have been
like this is a big deal you know if
you've got a android phone with a
Chromebook when you dock it yeah that
would be a big deal I think but he
didn't do that right so I guys already
know there's there's a quote along those
lines
um Eric Schmidt today you oh man wrote
this up his ship it happened my dear it
is so good it just busted ago I mean
it's a it was a shitstorm so he
basically said I don't know the verbatim
banana story he said that she might not
survive this transmits good transmission
yeah barb did with radio way okay I tell
you story so Eric Schmidt's here he's on
a panel they're talking about how many
projects microsoft has going at once how
this is molly wood from CNN saying
microphones cross street project to me
at once they find it hard to align them
to make a cohesive story google has all
these projects going at once how are you
aligning and avoiding this problem and
you basically replied and said well
we're a lot different the microsoft
microsoft is going through this
architectural transition and it might
not survive yeah which is that's windows
to arm right and that's nuts that is it
for google for the chairman of Google to
say Microsoft may not survive as a
company survive the transition
transition it's making over oh yeah it's
not even really changes like it's adding
an architecture mean it's almost like he
didn't fully understand they are also
doing still doing Intel windows which is
status quo which everybody can go by and
everybody will buy on day one you get a
windows 8 laptop you find it but I I
think there is something there where if
if chrome OS was really compelling which
it's not and.and you had a visit yet it
isn't yet but I do hear a very
compelling aspect if you had a phone or
tablet right now that you could dock
into something and and just be in Chrome
OS and it was hot and it was good why
don't they just say that's not gonna
kill myself overnight but that would be
a really compelling about just chrome to
android Wi-Fi not happen I think the
problem is that with oh well I can tell
you that there's no chrome made for arm
at this point and by the way can I just
show shoot something you're working fine
is are the Intel chips are making their
x86 right now they're doing android on
well i would bet dollars to doughnuts
because motorola is partnering with
intel on android device
I would bet dollars to doughnuts that
the reason they're going to do chrome
later on it's because they're gonna take
whatever Medfield based phone and it
could be x86 so there's no harm just
blew this wicked there is no chrome are
known for linux yes but not for arm okay
so they have x86 chrome you've got x86
and phones that's all of a sudden doing
a chrome laptop is not to be that's so
hard by the way we should probably write
a story on this right now if I don't
think anybody else's put that because
fire that up yeah I mean yeah it's a
great theory no I aging fear because
unless you know of them working on an
ARM version of Chrome which by the way
you say just bring chrome to Android the
reason they haven't done is because
there is no arm crown don't do it are
you Betty's gonna be are more crumbs
open-source me motorola could just do it
right yeah boner l is not gonna put
developer resources in there doing
you're suggesting motorola won't put
developer resources into some insane
idea like what time i think i think the
developer reason he first saw wet top is
a boon to with some modifications and
there whatever little ate whatever
they're plugging allowing you to see
your phone on it you know a little like
essentially the iframe for your phone
whatever it's a good minute just do
something like that in the browser why
why do I build it when when intel goes
hey by the way we're making x86 chips
for android devices that makes it really
over bara and that plugs into their home
right it's not now it's in the future
right now because i said and also i mean
they know they talked about how they
really were looking down the road it
wouldn't tell it's literally what I just
said and I know that's what I'm saying
I'm agreeing with you it plays in no a
minute ago I was like it's on now it's
in the future that right but I already
said that they weren't doing it right
now that they were doing it sunday guys
disagreeing no but I think we're having
a heat ray future it's not agree minimum
but I you know science I that's not that
but the answer is where it'll be free
with everything that's not agree with
you know if this thing needs it needs a
smartphone app where i could just tap it
you know it leaves the smartphone doc
does it have one no i don't think so it
should charge i would get the motion by
the end of the wheel my gosh ours oh my
god it does it does it does what is the
charge
the mention of the wheels I don't know
if it's a dog it's a pouch that's just
like a fanny now and that's a USB wow oh
wow I think I were just wow wow do you
think what's happening there's a board
here I don't know this also you know my
mom am I going to this for my major I
did that Johnson good at sports like the
Segway I realize I have I have some sort
of Acts manpower Oh like oh I could
catch things really well yeah I'm a
catcher catch bad as me my new mighty
superhero names catch mad to the rescue
officer others rescue people who are
trying to commit suicide or trying to
get on the Bernie John yeah we're trying
to throw know what are you okay just to
fill you in you spin around what so this
insanity is joanna is now simulating a
baby by pushing on the seat so that a
picture of a baby shows up is it coming
up there it is there it is there it is
maybe cake baby stroller anyway I got
quick it back yet I know hello arm she
was very kind to give us and you're
blowing it with this stuff well you
could we put him down yes although I did
pre on her album so I I shouldn't feel
bad I don't know what I was thrown are
you made any money oh look laughing you
know one dollar and ten cents out of
that I dudes gonna get cut her so much
conditional oh there was actually one
big story a lot that not at CES today
what's that no it's the google doing
these google+ search results in search
this is a huge story yeah and i think
mostly texture said about it is
distracted from it because we're here
that's why they started doing it like
they'll never notice but i think it's
actually a key a big deal because
explain the problem so Google it's hot I
don't know if it's a problem can you
explain this situation listen yes a
scenario lessons wheres and the scenario
xem soon ah sad area that's just a bunny
call that's acid area
prolly met Snooki last night Jeff I Lee
did meet Snooki lastly I have to say can
I just say the one thing we have Joe I'm
getting kindness yeah we have joined the
one thing you know technology is hey the
level of Chris are you okay it's
everything all right here it's just
wanna keep talking that you know you
know that in time you know that you know
that technology is moving further into
the mainstream because I think you're
seeing an exponential rise in weird
celebrity celebrities appearing as yes
it's normally you get one or two lady
gaga last year this year I mean I guess
stuck he's not really a celebrity is she
want to throw money in celebrity yeah
yeah no but I think you're seeing more
and more of that definitely you know not
really David Caruso is here is this a
member with yeah you know that David
hung out with him yeah wired cuz he was
going on g4 like the seconds review a
new website he was investing in summer
yeah not make money I guess they've
always had so uh no I want to say this
Joe flatly on our team bunny flatly has
been experiencing an entirely different
CS he's been going no don't go don't
don't tell me we should have much just
you'll know why soon it's all just just
on the direct email of the Snooki last
night yeah he didn't he did say what I
made love to you he did say he didn't
say Howard how would you take me if I'm
s really used to be a family friendly
yes which I respond yes to which I
responded I think it's just be family
friendly to you google google made love
to stinky last just like they do go
ahead in search results Google is now
directly integrating Google+ so you see
google+ results on the sidebar and
anywhere in results where you go to
youtube or any other Google product
those results now show Google+ links
directly use other than like when I see
the little plus like Oh so-and-so plus
this yeah this is in search their core
product the monopoly like and Twitter
was pretty pissed twitter is super mad
about it you know it's getting really
socked for them is when Microsoft gets
to fifty percent with being being just
passed yahoo it's the thirty percent
being is Yahoo is powered by days like
we're totally recur still you know who
is powered by somebody else
Alvin was powered by Google yeah maybe
one yahoo at own search engine yeah
everyone else got its own searching my
google what any well how to search
search engine haha words all right go
ahead no so there's been a lot of talk
about this yeah twitter is really mad I
mean this is google taking the big
monopoly right search and using it to
directly promote their competitor to
facebook and twitter which is nowhere
near Menaul and Twitter and Facebook are
very upset facebook is so far said very
little twitter is I think we react yeah
twitter is raging I think this is like
and everything how do we know their
Twitter issued a statement I got pretty
vitriolic statement Google responded
saying well Twitter and just open up and
let us search everything on Twitter
would be great but that doesn't work for
Twitter right i mean for twitter to just
become another source of data for google
kind of ruins their model i think you
you're right because twitter wants its
revenue to be a search waiting yes you i
think the issue with google is looks
like Yelp for what it's more the more
you move in seem a little hypocritical
yet the more you move into well that's a
good point too but that's another story
it's all bad it's waiting on wait wait
if you search for something in twitter
right are you gonna find google results
no no no no but yeah open up the Twitter
service wow these are searching twitter
right i know i know and we go when
you're searching google what google
results would you find well know exactly
you wouldn't but when you're searching
google and and twitter isn't as open as
and google would like for searching
those results but twitter if your
twitter you don't want the primary
method of control the people come to you
from to be your competitor right that's
weird for twitter all right also
globalist and use all these companies
but if your google+ you would want that
but it but here's the deal the prom for
google is they've done from being this
kind of plumbing the search service
nutritious power which is powered by ads
so it's kind of like there's a sense of
neutrality there I to
trying to provide the same they're
trying to provide the same services
whether it's a social network y lr humor
microblogging service yeah I'm going to
be detrimental to Twitter to open up
their search well that data because if
you could if you could search all that
data you could mine in the same way the
Twitter wants to mine it and sell it
back to people to take the money because
because if they're going to be
profitable is likely going to be through
some scheme where they sell their it
wouldn't get on traffic to this I'm not
seeing I'm not saying they don't need
try and trap traffic's not the problem
yet people they need money right and in
order to do that they need to have
something that is valuable and what's
valuable is their data and if you give
the data to Google it looses what I'm
saying it's not just twitter if I guess
oh yelp right it's every service that
collects data from users right
segregated oh wait yeah but Yelp is also
has also didn't they file suit yeah
that's right so okay so here's the thing
yes I understand no it's different but
they're there I'm sorry no I'm so she
said they are Yelp it's different but in
the sense that that the same problem
exists which is google has a service
that emulates or replicates we don't
know what yelps uber it's a consumer
service it's not the Plumbing's not
search and they're basically mining
yelps data to power their data which
does the same thing that Yelp does so
it's kind of like stealing it's exactly
so what they're showing that Google I'm
not saying Google is a saint here but
Google is obviously its whole thing you
know we think of it as the plumbing of
the Internet has been you know mining
other things and making a centralized
place where you can find all the other
things right ah if there's been an
emerging model and people have talked
about the lot where some people's whole
internet is facebook they do all their
stuff all inside the face down when they
have the majority that is already a
Twitter and operator isn't like that
with what Twitter does have a certain
thing where it's trying to keep people
inside but especially if you look at
facebook at Google wanting to compete
with Facebook any service like Twitter
or Facebook that's really hard to index
and Google candidate leverage fully
that's that's scary for google and so it
makes sense that Google would promote
its own thing or doesn't in sizes which
results and I don't think I this is
Google's Microsoft moment this is the
moment where they take their big
monopoly and they say oh my God we're
siffredi big monopoly we're afraid of
the next wave of services will use the
gig monopoly honestly I agreed if your
premise that's why that what I'm saying
is everything they've done around it
this looks like Microsoft no but but but
what's the parallel there I mean your
Microsoft had the big monopoly in
Windows they saw the web I saw an
emerging platform right browsers that
would take the share away from oh you're
saying is he put out IE and I did
bundled IE and they said we're gonna
kill Netscape right and you know what
they did they killed nuts yeah they've
dudes that company is gone right if
aided away because Microsoft killed it
well and they because they were worried
and you know what they were right I mean
Microsoft was a hundred percent wrong
and Google's I'm picking up where
Netscape left off right and now they're
began bikers off yeah well this is you
know you become what you despise that's
there's always you live you die as a
hero or to be Microsoft doctor died here
well you become microsoft behind these
things but I think that this is a
dilemma when a company gets what like
when do you stop growing right right and
when do you decide I've we've
accomplished the things that we mean to
accomplish I don't think you're never
sure that as a couple but if you're if
you're if you're also if your google I
mean does it seem like they made there
was a definitive sense that we needed to
be in X Y or Z I feel like they've been
doing things trying things out this is
another one of those things where they
go I think they're very seriously well I
think the race I think they're very
serious about it they've been so slow
facebook facebook is taking so they're
eating their lunch facebook is taking
their bread and butter which is which is
it's becoming the place you land on and
go where's blah blah blah and you find
it on face I think of what Facebook is
doing like like and also the way
integrates with being well is is that
they want you
to instead of searching google for the
good thing they want you to say you know
what are my friends recommend for music
for movies for four restaurants or
barbershop like they want your friends
recommendations you know obviously yep
does that in a different way but but
they want to mind that social data and
make google little less relevant and I
think they're also worried about their
other services like Facebook keeps
trying to get into messaging they keep
trying to get in till these other
services which Google's like have that
ecosystem of right yeah photos all that
stuff Chad's giving us I a right now
where I think the big point here is not
the google shouldn't try to do these
things not you know if you're gonna run
the dominant search engine on the
internet you should make search better I
think algorithmic search like what's
have a computer figure it out is slowly
being augmented and even replaced by
social like recommendation and Google
should get into that but the way they're
doing it with this is so tone-deaf and
like varies it's so Microsoft in the
night it's just it's a bully it's a
bullying so total believe they're being
a bully and and Microsoft is a lot of
bully tactics and you know I think it's
come back to haunt them i do think that
that there is a kind of karma wheel in
technology that aren't works you know
yeah man i don't believe in karma my new
i I've heard of I've never heard the
term karma wheel well it's you know
cyclical you know yeah and I think that
it is good today thanks accelerated I
know what you did today I got a guy got
a gun og og because you killed who was
waiting in line to get a Justin Bieber
agra autograph hello boy I didn't Bieber
got a 16 year old girl up Justin Bieber
otter girl yeah didn't she cry through
girl crying cried and she cried with her
why was it crying I'm pretty good I
can't think of so many ice you can
juiciest just to get the out of there I
thought it's so weird so so I thank you
i was saying is that i think that um
that's me good i think that in the tech
world the being a bully can come back to
haunt you quickly you know i think it
took I think it's taking a little bit
longer with Microsoft cuz they were so
he's such a huge bully but i think they
reap the rebate a little bit what
they've sown with what something is that
google's are under scrutiny and europe
about search and how to promote search
and whether or not the algorithm is
really the thing they've been you know
that they need to open source are out
there some way that random congressmen
are like you know the calling for
antitrust investigation of google here
this is just fuel to the fire you know
this is like there's sparks I've isn't
it and Google's like you're some guess I
think I think it's an unsustainable
situation that Google has pure dominance
in search and I don't know how you deal
with that my thought is though a
government search engine provided by the
US government and it's just a gray just
it's just a great in with a cursor yeah
and the results are I don't know what
their where the results will come from
anybody will be you have to have it
it'll be the default search on every
browser I'll never lie computer public
service employees who will file newly
yeah no no this is how we can ignite
jobs in America we could hire people to
add things we can hire able to add no
listen it's not socially now hire people
by the way it's so the opposite I have
government employing everyone thought
social thanks it's not everyone I've to
say to the state controlling the means
of production and the meson Fornaio I
only produce links i upgrade any of them
so i hope that every does that I being
facetious now I hope that everybody
knows that I mean facetious about this
but let me disappoint me search can I
just can I just roll with my idea big
gray blank page and then we'll hire move
Stoke jobs in America by hiring people
to find things on the web and add them
to the database as long as human-powered
how do they find government regulated
they just type random URLs and it would
have to have an awesome
nice Jesse jazzy uh it would have to
have a really awesome name like search
gov huh I got I like it I certain as
long as you're still guitar riffs in
America I don't know any completely free
breathe easy yeah by the way my god I
wish I excited about this this red and
black out if you heard about this reddit
ready guys are going everything so the
