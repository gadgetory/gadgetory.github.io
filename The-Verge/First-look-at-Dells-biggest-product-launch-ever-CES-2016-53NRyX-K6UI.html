and we're here taking a look at all the
announcements coming from Dell at this
year's CES let's start here this is the
latitude II seventy three seventy this
is the business version of Dells XPS 13
laptop that they launched at CES last
year and we see a lot of the same design
elements brought right over to this but
in a more secure device made for
professionals we've got a glass trackpad
we've got the carbon fiber weave on the
back and overall it's basically just a
more sleek looking less consumer facing
version of the XPS 13 that was announced
last year this like a lot of the other
devices that we've seen here today
follows a trend that Dell is pushing
across its entire lineup which is
everything is going to be customizable
you're going to be able to get it in
touch and non touch versions you're
gonna be able to get it in full HD and
4k and it also is going to be coming
with USB type-c which is another thing
that Dell is going to be pushing across
this entire product line up this coming
year another first for Dell this year is
its first wireless monitor which you can
see not only works here with the
latitude version of the XPS but also
works with mobile phones so you can cast
both of those to the screen at the same
time this particular monitor will have
different options for full HD and 4k
it'll also have options for wireless
charging in the base now this is
probably the most impressive display
that Dells going to launch this year is
a 30 inch OLED 4k monitor and it's their
first OLED monitor ever you can see if
you look really closely it's running by
a USB type-c here so another
continuation of that trend in all of
Dells new products this year really
pushing us to be type-c but if you're
still working off of Thunderbolt or you
need other ports Dell is going to be
releasing a big series of converters so
that you can basically mix and match to
make your laptops work with any
different monitor now this is just some
of the many products that Dells
launching this year at CES in what
they're calling their biggest product
launch ever and that includes everything
from these monitors and laptops to
things like battery that can charge your
laptop and your phone at the same time
two USB type-c converters so that you
get lost when you switch to USB type-c
so there's a whole bunch more coming
from Dell almost all of it is available
now and if not now this spring for more
on all of this from Dell and everything
else here at CES head to the Virg calm
