the celebrating the milestone with a
free anniversary update available in
August 2nd it's not a huge update that
will change the way you use Windows but
it has some pretty additions that more
than 300 million Windows 10 users will
enjoy here are the top 10 new features
coming to Windows first up is Windows
Inc while Windows has always had Inc in
support for years most sorts of create a
dedicated section for it in Windows 10
complete with a sketch bed sticky notes
and the ability to quickly sketch on a
screenshot the best part is the new
virtual ruler that lets you draw
straight lines and shapes apps like
office and maps also going to have
Windows ink support and further party
ones will get updated in time of all the
new features there's still more to do to
improving support in Windows 10 but
Windows ink is a good start Microsoft
edge browser is finally getting
extensions to be very similar to the
extensions II using Chrome and if you
like adblock last passed one password
and Evernote already available expect to
see a bunch more hit the Windows Store
in the coming months you'll also get web
notifications in edge allowing sites to
integrate alerts with the Windows 10
Notification Center Microsoft's digital
assistant Cortana debuted on Windows 10
last year and the software maker is
bringing it to the lock screen with the
anniversary update you'll be able to ask
it to make a note play music set a
reminder and lots more without ever
logging there's a new dark theme with
the Windows 10 anniversary update and it
makes the OS feel a little more complete
in terms of the overall UI my tips has
also tweaked the Start menu Notification
Center taskbar and the system clocks
slightly through improvements that make
Windows 10 just that little bit easier
to use live tiles now have deep linking
which means you'll click on an app in
the Start menu
head straight to the live tile content
you saw within the app rather than just
opening the app to its home page setting
your time zone automatically is really
minor but it's also a big deal if you
travel a lot my shutters finally added
the ability to set time zones
automatically so no more playing around
with your clock manually if you're
heading off on vacation window solo lets
you log in with just your face and
compatible pcs we'll get new support for
apps and websites with the windows
anniversary update you won't need your
password for websites if you have a new
PC that supports Windows hello you just
sit there let's scan your facial
fingerprint and then you're in and ready
to go
Windows 10 apps are finally here on the
Xbox one we've been waiting for what
feels like years for these apps to
arrive on the Xbox one and it's finally
happening with the anniversary update
we're expecting to see a variety of apps
and hopefully some new additions that
really make sense for an entertainment
and gaming machine if you're a developer
then bash on Windows 10 is a big deal
but for everyone else is something you
really won't use my talk is essentially
adding the Linux command line to Windows
10 and it's a great addition for Linux
developers that need access to all of
their tools on Windows my sisters
created an entirely new skype app for
Windows 10 anniversary update it's not
totally feature complete just yet
but your basic skype video and audio
calls work really well it launches
instantly and you'll get notifications
for calls and messages straight within
Windows 10 and finally one of the best
new additions in Windows 10 anniversary
update is the ability to mirror
notifications from your phone Windows 10
mobile and Android phones are supported
and you'll be able to reply to messages
dismissed notifications and send photos
for a phone to a PC or really quickly as
you've seen most of the additions in the
Windows 10 anniversary update aren't
exactly groundbreaking but altogether
they make for a solid number of feature
additions that will cater for nearly
everyone who uses Windows 10 this is how
Microsoft plans to update windows going
forward so expect to see more similar
feature additions like this later in the
year and Beyond Windows is now a service
and Microsoft is really update
