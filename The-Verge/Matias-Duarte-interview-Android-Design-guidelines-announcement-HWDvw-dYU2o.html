live with matias duarte from google and
android and you guys have an
announcement that you're making today
first off are we live or is everything
good Chad I just want to make we're good
okay cool you just kind of hurried over
here you guys are making an announcement
today and we're kind of getting first
crack at here so so what is what are you
guys talking about what's happening
that's right today we are releasing this
first style guide for Android Ice Cream
Sandwich so today on the Android
developer site you'll find a blog post
that describes that we've done and
you'll also find a link to Android
design which is a document but it's also
a living site that's going to be your
one-stop reference to find out how you
can make beautiful simple applications
for ice cream sales it so you haven't
done this for earlier versions of
Android there's no we don't have an
up-to-date style guide and so our
mission for ice cream sandwich was to
make it beautiful to make it simple to
make it powerful and there's really
three parts to that one we needed the OS
right the OS and all the apps that's a
big part of it right um the other part
was the framework you know it doesn't
get noticed by people who buy the phones
like Galaxy Nexus or who get the upgrade
but the framework itself has changed the
framework itself makes it much easier to
make beautiful simple apps the part that
was missing until today is a guideline
the tells developers how to use that
framework how to follow the patterns and
new conventions that we introduced in
Ice Cream Sandwich how they can make
stuff that is beautiful and simple and
powerful using the new capabilities of
ice cream sandwich so so you thought it
was fairly necessary to start to say to
developers hey you're doing great work
with like your apps but you could just
make it a little bit more handsome a
little bit more beautiful that would
really be great I mean you're a designer
you clearly put a focus on design we've
talked about this a bunch we did an
interview months ago and more recently
on our show we really focused on design
ice cream sandwich is a big departure
from the last version of Android for
smart because it's such a big departure
that it's so important
provide guidance and in fact all
designers crave guidance right you need
to have constraints and you need to know
the environment that you're working in
anytime you're doing a creative
component that's part of a larger whole
like I'm sure the verge has a style
guide every every publication we do have
a style a style good yeah that is true
every platform in the world also has a
style guide I'm so for ice cream
sandwich we needed to have that style
guide as well but you didn't but you
haven't up until this point I've not had
that style guide for for the other
versions I mean no we didn't that's
pretty crazy don't you think well that's
why we have a lot it's just something
that you did is like a mandate from this
is a Matthias mandate is that a thing
can I TM that i'm mateus mandate yeah I
don't know if I get a stamp for it maybe
yeah we are gonna get a little stamp and
then they put on your goddamn dates that
that's a mean we get a virtually a
watermark yeah it's gonna be tough folks
I don't do anything about paper yeah so
a bit was this something you said oh
yeah no to my mind like ice cream
sandwiches a release is not complete
until we get this so get out right so
and it's out today yes so I can go get
it developers and go get it what are you
going to do to ensure that people are
following that are they're actually
taking this stuff to heart I mean
because it's one thing to put it out
there it's another thing to actually get
people to say oh yeah my stuff have been
really ugly let me fix it oh oh I get it
Matthias I've been making ugly apps and
now I have to fix them up I think that's
putting the wrong spin on it it's not
about people doing stuff that's ugly
it's about people not understanding what
they should do right there's plenty of
times what it's important to break the
rules but you want to know that you're
breaking the rules right it's it's one
thing to be the audacious rebel who
really knows what they're doing it's
another thing to turn down a one-way
street because you just didn't notice
that it was okay right right so steering
wheels broken basically or just there
was no sign yeah right or there was no
sign so so this is really about telling
people what the rules of the road are
you know people of course are free to do
whatever they want with it we're going
to follow this up with a lot of
evangelism right that the first round of
this is is press obviously an NCS is a
great opportunity to do that to get the
word out that rat we have the design
guidelines out that we are engaging
heavily that we
want to talk to designers and developers
and that this is just the beginning of
these guidelines actually we want to
hear feedback from them we want to know
what more can we tell them how more can
we help them right is this a reaction to
your competition I mean Microsoft has
made a big focus has put a big focus on
the design of Windows Phone they've
really talked about it quite a bit and
it's a beautiful product I know you have
your opinions of the what did you call
airport signage design you don't want to
repeat that dude here k very
uncomfortable I'm making you very
uncomfortable right now and I don't have
to answer that the spotlight spotlight
but also i mean but apple clearly a
design focused company iOS is a very
design focused operating system google
has historically not been known for
design we talked about this a while ago
ICS like I said it's very different is
this in some way reaction to what the
competition is doing and how much
emphasis they're putting on design I
mean if you want to be serious about
design you have to do this stuff right
ice cream sandwich is Android getting
serious about design and this is part of
that right so we're actually taking
questions from we're supposed to be
taking questions from people and I don't
know if this is not working or not
because I don't see any but we're
grabbing questions and we'll have some
in a second but one thing we have about
while we wait for those to come in or I
figure out actually hey guys can I get
sorry this is live weekend through this
together last minute because you sprung
it on us that you had an announcement
you want to talk about can somebody come
in here grab this iPad and hold on one
second sorry okay good and just let them
get some questions uh yeah whatever
would be fine that's great are we
getting questions in I think okay cool
but but but I actual antacid before we
get into the questions we've seen a lot
of ICS tablets here at CES there have
been no ICS phones what is do you know
what the holdup is I mean it seems like
your partners are being very slow on the
on the on the on the uptake of you know
honestly I don't know I haven't even
really seen what's on the show floor
I've been so busy
so you don't you don't know that there
are no Ice Cream Sandwich Islands here
no so you're saying hey I have I have
like zero visibility right now into with
what's been announced and what hasn't
been announced tablets phones anything
right you're just here making the
announcement then back to back up north
I have a few a few other meetings that's
really I wasn't just your coming here to
the trailer to have this interview and
then you're leaving hmm that's what I
was told um so I have a couple questions
got this worked out yes how does the
style guide fit into the whole
fragmentation story is it a first step
to enforce a certain consistency took a
pretty good question so is this is this
something that you guys are doing kind
of to start to try to crack down on the
fragmentation of not only platform I
mean I'm for a bit apps it's no secret
that we hate it when people use the word
fragmentation because it means so many
different things to so many different
people and it's like a word that
intrinsically is negative it's like you
know well it's like the what are you
going to do about the beating your wife
problem right like there's like well
that also i'm concerned what is Google
doing about that wife-beating actually
that one we're we're neglecting yeah
black beating I mean yeah very bad so so
people mean so many different things
when they talk about fragmentation one
of the kinds of things that they might
mean this style guide is intended to
address and that's the the way that
applications work together right and the
way that that your experience in the
operating system is kind of a cohesive
harmonious whole right the reason why
you have style guides and the reason why
I have conventions within an operating
system is because you know everything
works better together if they all follow
certain standards if they all follow
certain practices if things are where
you expect them to be right it's like
when you buy a set of tools from one
manufacturer they all have a similar
kind of grip right whether they're tools
for your kitchen or tools for your
garage or whatever so they tend to work
better together we want applications in
Ice Cream Sandwich to take on the same
benefits in the same attributes of the
new applications that we launched an ice
cream sandwich we want to show
developers how they can do that exactly
what they have to do what metrics they
have to follow with what patterns they
can utilize what new tools we
that they might not have realized what
things we we've learned from the past
that maybe didn't work so well that had
been a convention right we're now saying
you know maybe you should think about
staying away from that do you have is
that and it sounds to me like you're
saying everybody wants to do things or
things you know when they're working on
their app maybe they have an idea for
how you get to point from point A to
point B and there are some basic there's
some basic functionality you want people
to gather around sort of standardized
you know here's how you here's where
your menu should be here's where your
back you know yeah well you're not a
back button because you've got a back
button but you know here's how you get
somebody from this screen to that screen
I mean I know that you guys have
instituted actly in an ice cream
sandwich the this kind of panel would he
call what you swiping the new pager the
viewpager that's that's the aps i
decided i didn't i didn't maybe but
you've got this like the thief of
swiping through an application for
Donald swiping right like in the People
app for instance you've got that's what
your diet house are you going listed
idea talks about the pattern of when you
should use that one that's appropriate
what kinds of screens is that
appropriate to use it for right um what
kinds of screens you know what kinds of
limits should you be aware of when
you're using that right you know for
certain applications we work very hard
to make sure that you never swipe
further than three screens away well
I've noticed is it three is that what
you're trying to box it too but not
always right so we do that very
deliberately in the phone app and the
People app but you'll notice in market
we actually have a much wider swath
right of swiping and it all has to do
with understanding what is the use case
of the user in that application so the
style guide starts to give you that
guidance starts to give you the the
heuristics that lets you know okay if
this is an application that i'm using a
lot and i'm really jumping between these
these three different states a lot or
these multiple states a lot probably
three is about the limit right but if
it's an application where this is really
intended to encourage exploration and
browsing and it's not about i always
want to get to one place really quickly
right then then it's okay to go broader
like in google reader you I mean google
reader in gmail or you have a constant
swipe our music as well right you're
swiping further I mean really it's
actually less of your moving between
panels and something like reader and you
just send
reading yes right so it has dual use
that functionality but you want people
to understand that because obviously
it's not saying its built-in and the one
what's interesting about that is there's
one app which is tweetdeck which is a
twitter app that I use that had that
functionality for a long time it was the
only one really until you guys brought
it to market was that an influence at
all I mean it was it was fairly unique
when they did actually not familiar with
tweetdeck are you kidding them no I'm
not kidding you I weighed her out I used
the the native Twitter client the the
horizontal swiping was was I mean it was
it was basically born in the launcher of
the original android OS right and then
it was a pattern that was really first
brought into our apps in the music app
right you just thinking what you just
think it's a really and that was like
around the froyo release but it's a
terrific pattern because it it's a way
to navigate that's much more engaging
than pressing a button and waiting you
just think having a builder just a swipe
between these spaces is really
satisfying right and it's also a great
way to segment information because it
naturally snaps to those pages it's not
like when you have a vertical scroll
where you want to get to the next page
well it doesn't scroll by page so you're
always in that like okay you know like
when you email you know you don't have
that same kind of confidence you just
can't kind of swipe it and then know
that you're going to get exactly to that
next set of content you want to read
right right you're a big fan of swiping
yes you did swiping in webos with the
car yes these these things that people
call gestures these manipulations on the
screen are much more satisfying to
people than then this cycle of you press
your release and then you wait and see
what happens right right it's tied much
more into the way that the real world
works right like our brains are wired
for this I mean you see rocks we bang
you can actually reveal around you can
actually reveal information as your I
mean one of the things I noticed that
you do it in the launcher is as you
start to swipe over to the next screen
in the launcher you start to see the
information coming in from that's right
you know you can say hey you know what
I'm halfway through this motion I don't
want to go there exactly where is like
pressing the button and having it loaded
up is like you're locked into that it is
true there's immediate feedback you feel
much more in control because as you say
if for whatever reason you realize that
that's not what you want you can cancel
it now you almost
never do that right but it doesn't
matter it still gives you a greater
sense of control so you mentioned that
you use the native twitter app are you
going to go to Twitter and say here's
what ice cream sandwich looks like
here's the way it works these right now
twitter is basically they have an iOS
version of an android version of a web
version they're all kind of the same but
ICS has has design and functionality
peridots that's a great question the the
this style guide is exactly for that
it's for people like Twitter to show
them like these are the basics of making
an ice cream sandwich app really as good
an Ice Cream Sandwich app as it can be
right now that doesn't mean that we
don't want applications to have their
own strong brand in their own strong
design conventions in fact we want them
to write the I think it's actually a
real problem if an applications brand is
so closely tied to one platform that
that it looks like that one platform set
of buttons or widgets on every other
platform except that means you're not
doing a service to your own brand right
right you're tying your brand is
somebody else's right right you're
you're getting majin eyes on the web
right you'd never see that right you
wouldn't see like hey here's a the verge
with buttons that we actually took these
buttons from you know chrome right no
like on the web well but you better
realize your own but you do want a
certain you do want some navigational I
mean this is the whole point because you
want to balance that I mean you want
Twitter to be Twitter but I think it
would be your priming to be your
preference they utilize some of the
motifs of ice cream sandwich like like
the panel swipe in or the
what-do-you-call-it viewpager yeah the
viewpager second heroin it is that just
call it panel / yeah panel swipe is
wiping uh Waco but again the trick is is
is um what are the elements that are
natural and native to the platform like
there's there's two parts to this
there's the you know this is the toolkit
that this platform utilizes you can pick
and choose from it but you should be
aware of all the things that are on this
menu right right and and that's one of
the functions of style guide and you're
making this all might not know about the
view page and capability or how to use
it or when to use it right the other
part of it is like these are some of the
convention
that make this platform feel cohesive
right these are the metrics these are
the sizes these are the corner radii
these are the conventions for how icons
use right you don't have to follow them
but if you don't your application is
going to stand out it's not going to
look like it's not going to be branded
necessarily if it's standing out because
it's branding towards your property if
it's branded towards the verge right
then that's that's an okay kind of
standing out right but if it's standing
out because you just you know copied
those elements from some other platform
you know that's not doing you any favors
wait aren't witter the place where
you'll want to target getting some of
this feel in there yeah absolutely all
third parties we'd want to we want them
to take a look at this you might have to
have to work extra hard your
relationship with Twitter right now I
think yes a little sensitivity there so
I have a couple of other questions
you're actually getting a bunch of
questions and I'd ok think I know the
answer to this one our developer is
going to be required to adhere to the
style guidelines or they just
suggestions the guidelines the
guidelines you're not nor seen anybody
to do it I mean this is this is the way
it is for every platform right the human
interface guidelines tend to be very
high level guidelines and what happens
and we've seen this on every platform is
that the the value of them accrues as
more people use them so really the
market pressures will will make the app
using a bargain that work the way people
expect yeah the ones that are more so
you to rise to the top here's a question
and I think this is an interesting one
will you also provide working code
snippets utility classes optimization
tips and such because you I
inconsistencies des need a standard way
to do common stuff like an endless
adapter for getting data from web
services so are you going to provide
kind of packages we login play package
right now Android design is almost
entirely focused on explaining the
design patterns and providing tools
purely for the designers and it's linked
with some examples back to the developer
site but we're going to continue to
build this out very closely with the
developers site so that everything that
we're talking about becomes as easy as
possible for people to do we've actually
done a lot of work already in the
framework for ice cream sandwich to make
it easier by default when you just
instantiate a bunch of stuff to have it
conform to these guidelines
interesting I am I have a question here
I think I know the answer to this one
too but i'll ask any how is this
something you think should have been
should have been done early on an
Android I mean had you been at the helm
from version one would you have
instituted this is this I guess maybe
and maybe to extrapolate from the
question that we got here is this
something that is just a it you know
sort of important to an operating system
this is scale and needs to be there
every never lat form needs to have this
but you know I can't cast blame on a
platform for not having up-to-date
versions of this throughout the past
I've been in the position where
platforms I've worked on haven't had
this when we launched either it's very
very hard the Android team is extremely
talented but also extremely small right
and I know not just from working at
Android but working at other companies
you know what a child it was with small
teams it's guy using a operating system
from scratch and even though this is
absolutely essential it's really hard to
do it's really hard to find the time
right I would have loved to have done
this and the gingerbread timeframe I'd
have loved to have done this in the
honeycomb time frame it just couldn't
happen to it and it didn't make sense to
either because we'd have to revise so
much of it for ice cream sandwich right
so that we're here I'm really happy to
do you're doing it you got Roboto you've
got a style guide it's all of a sudden
it's a different Android ok but so what
does this mean for sense and TouchWiz
and motoblur and all these skins I mean
these so so you're telling developers
and once I hey can somebody crack this
door by the way it is just a billion
degrees in here I mean I've died uh yeah
I thought this was I might actually
doing that the the interrogator is hot
as hell we can I apologize for me it's
very warm did any water anything
tomorrow you have something yeah but I
would love something cold bring some
cold water sunny with ice in it I uh
this is like it really is like I've
interrogating you well this is an
interesting comment Ruth mateus from
last year where I believe you tried to
freeze me today that is you know what I
want I'm trying to just get exposed
extreme see which one is more effective
and getting answers out of you so what
so what happens you're telling
developers to do something very
stringent I mean you're asking them to
do something very strange
you're saying we have design guidelines
we've got a style guide here and yet
just walk it over like and I'll take one
of those to my you jerk uh how do you
how do you how do you balance that
because here you're going to have touch
waves come along and throw out a bunch
of Ice Cream Sandwich style there's
actually two questions there first of
all it's kind of a misconception to
think that this is really something
that's very stringent right for a
designer that might be the impression
you know for somebody who's who's not
who's not a designer it might be an
impression oh my gosh a guideline that's
that's a constraint that sounds like
something terrible actually all
designers want this I mean designers
more than anybody else have been
clamoring to understand what our
conventions what is our style guide what
are metrics what's the grid right how
should I design an icon how do I make it
consistent right people want this yeah
no I mean we got our style guide our
developers were saying you know they add
they wanted more information they said
what about this what are these grid yeah
clearly I need that guy I mean I
actually feel bad about the version that
we're publishing today it doesn't have
enough detail it doesn't have enough
examples right so we're going to be
continually adding to that right so um
it's not it's not actually there's no
there's no tension between providing
constraint and and liberating people to
customize stuff right and that's
actually the answer for OEMs who want to
customize stuff right so this is a great
resource for third parties who want to
build stuff that's consistent with the
system this is also tool now that OEMs
can understand exactly how ice cream
sandwiches put together right so that
when they do expansions to it when they
do customizations when they are porting
whatever layer of modification they want
to it it can be coherent and consistent
with the system as much as they want it
to be right right it's not going to feel
like there's a part of it that was
customized and a part of it that wasn't
customized they now should have the
tools to make their customizations
really seamless without having to do
everything right it should should be a
boon to them so just so I'm
understanding what you're saying
completely this style guide is not just
for app developers but it also applies
to the
partners you work with who make who do
skinning or what did you call them
expansions mm-hmm customizations you're
saying this will give you a guideline to
on how to do that so that it actually
works with what we wanted to do with ice
cream sandwich yeah for example like we
talked about the metrics of things the
sizes of buttons the height of the
action bar how the action bar should
work and yeah and so that applies for
whether an oem for example is
customizing the launcher and wants to
use the action bar patterns in the
launcher wants to use icon grids that
that are consistent with the icon grits
everywhere else right or if they're
trying to create a custom skin for it if
you will that make all the buttons look
different like a different material or
have a different character when they do
that they can see that they're going to
conform to the metrics of the other Ice
Cream Sandwich elements they can
understand exactly what the corner radii
or lack of radii are so that they can
make those decisions right you know do I
want to do I want to modify that how
much do I want to modify that so that
it's consistent with everything else
have you shown this to any of the
partners a gauge TC or Samsung and said
no we're announcing it we're releasing
everybody's gay so right now there are
guys from Samsung going oh crap yeah we
got every we gotta rethink our ICS skin
that we've been working hopefully
hopefully now there's a bunch of guys
from Samsung better saying oh finally
now I understand why the heck they did
this yeah well I hope that's the case um
here's another question from from the
viewers how does it affect backwards
compatibility for applications while the
tools and guidelines work properly on
old versions of Android I'm guessing
this is a I don't answer for you but I
might get you tell me well the style
guide is for ice cream sandwich
unfortunately we don't have a style
guide for each previous version of it we
do have a section that gives advice on
how you can adapt our best thinking
patterns to previous versions of Android
right which patterns we think are
appropriate in which stylistic choices
we think are appropriate that you should
start using regardless of which version
of Android you want to run on and which
things you want to be aware of might
really only work inside ice cream
sandwich right so so in terms of
tablets and phones with moving into ice
cream sandwich territory for for app
developers and this is a question here
uh how are you handling different sized
screens are you and we've seen a lot of
apps that kind of just scale up to a
larger screen and just show you
basically more empty space what do you
advocate for that mean what is that what
is this so that's exactly one of the
reasons why I have the style guide now
now we have a section that talks about
adapting to different sized screens and
what are some of the common patterns
that you can utilize when you detect
that you're a larger screen right so in
honeycomb we actually did a lot of
exploration we came up with a large
number of different multi-panel or
multi-pane layouts but we didn't explain
to anybody why we did them how we chose
them what cases they would be
appropriate what cases they wouldn't be
appropriate we didn't give guidance as
to what heuristics you should use to
determine when your app should stop
using a phone type you I to one of these
multi-panel type you eyes now we have
sections in the guide that start to
explain that and again we're going to
flush them out which I that's gonna
that's gonna help you ease the
transition between i think if i make it
a nap and i want it to be you know
beyond in both places this style guide
is going to be the idea is that we've
done a lot of this work and so we want
to share the work that we've done so
that other people can benefit from it
right doesn't mean that people have to
make the same decisions that we did that
they can at least understand the
decisions that we did and don't have to
repeat the same work that way it so
somebody and i know you have to get
going in a little bit so we'll do a
couple more questions then wrap it up
but it i'd also know that you're gonna
melt if you stay in here and you're cold
right now right are you saying i
actually i think this completely drying
you out sauna type environment i think
is very good for the we try to you know
we try to present like a you know a
healing thing here uh so somebody
actually said it and I'm gonna I'm gonna
jump off of their question a little bit
but they said when do you think the
design quality vote android apps will
reach parity with iOS but I want to go a
little bit further and say I don't think
that that Android apps I think that that
there are some great Android apps but I
think across the board if you look at
percentages of really high quality
smooth beautiful apps that do a lot I
think that there are some some holes in
Android and some places where iOS is
just kicking your ass frankly i know i
mean really i mean it i hate to say
because i love i love you too bye I like
iOS I like what you guys do I mean I'm a
fan of both things but when I see an app
like garageband which is an al Apple
developed app incredibly powerful I
haven't seen anything that even couldn't
even come close on any of your devices
when are you going to get there when are
you going to say like we can go toe to
toe on something as complex and as
beautiful and as functional as
GarageBand cuz to me that's the high
water market for an iOS app personally
can you do it will you do it is it this
generation and well so I can't predict
the future I don't know what apps are
out there but I do know that in order to
do it this type of guidance is
absolutely essential right right I
believe that we're going to continue to
push the platform and an Ice Cream
Sandwich we've pushed the platform a
long way to enabling these types of
experiences and the style guide goes a
long way to letting developers know how
to create these kinds of experiences
right one of the things i hope the style
guide does is expand the conversation
beyond just the people who normally pay
attention to android but to all those
other you know brilliant designers out
there who would like to create beautiful
apps but have maybe been turned off by
the fact that android didn't have this
kind of guidance give them a framework
didn't give them context that they can
understand you sure you think you'll be
able to bring some of these many people
have been standoffish about maybe coming
over porting something from iOS to
Android to say look we're taking this
seriously we've got design guidelines
this is a framework you can fit your app
in to have a look at it absolutely I'm
are you gonna ding people who don't
follow these guidelines I mean are you
get are usually I'm gonna take me a you
just ding their car no but are you are
you gonna are you going to pull people
aside I mean can you do that I know you
guys are all about being open but you
know the store you kind of put whatever
you want in there and into the android
market but will you or even give users a
way to say hey this app doesn't fall in
the guidelines and it
make it it's making it harder to use
well comments we already provided but
are you guys are you guys scouting the
comments but reviews also provide I'm
sorry not reviewed the ratings also
provide a mechanism for that and we hope
that the community will become more
sensitive to the patterns will
understand the guidelines will help us
do that kind of thing I would like to
see more positive incentives right so
that we could we could you know extend a
hand of friendship to developers who
wanted you know personal attention right
in understanding the guidelines
understanding how they could take better
advantage of them what is what is
positive encouragement they're like what
would you well you know we could we
could we could I don't know I haven't
even thought of it but there could be
there could be making this operation I
am completely winging this he announced
here pause course coming positive
curvature developers on how to make
their apps better but I mean you know we
could we could do you know if we work
with with people we could endorse them
in various different ways we could
promote them in blog post we could
promote them in the market right I see
there's lots of potential positive
mechanisms which I'm a lot more excited
about the negative mechanisms we don't
have any concrete plans for any of those
things which is why I sound so vague and
I graspable about it right no I get that
but but I'm just curious me you know
Apple police's its store it says we'll
let this in we won't let this in and I
think that it has its pluses and its
minuses but you you but Apple and and
and other storm makers also one of the
other things they do which i think is
much more impactful is that they also
they promote the really outstanding
citizen right any and you're saying
something's really good will we want to
put in the front page of the market yeah
so that's the positive reinforcement but
you're not going to be looking at
people's apps and saying hey we noticed
me do you guys do this hey we notice
you're not using the guidelines and we
think the app will be improved I mean is
that something that you may consider
doing we we don't want to get involved
into that kind of regulation of it would
be somewhat helpful though I'm not even
saying like you can't have it in here i
think as it what any what I you what I'd
be delighted to do is offer some kind of
workshops or office hours or some kind
of model like that where developers who
want feedback or critique
we'd be happy to give it to the right I
mean I think you I thought I wouldn't I
wouldn't want to do that as part of a
punitive measure inside the market I
don't think that would be fair to them
what the market is supposed to be right
now I agree to more questions and i'll
let you go so you have a trip back to
hotel my this is my questions very
personal but you've got this limitation
where if i download a game and it's a
big game 600 megs or something I get a
little file that I download it's you
know a couple Meg's and then it says I
open the app and there's an there's
another screen that says you download
this big file and it's a totally siloed
you know company specific way of getting
that file sometimes it works sometimes
it doesn't what's going on like when I
download a game from the app from the
App Store on my iPhone it just downloads
the game and when it's finished I play
the game with you guys I download the
game it asked me to download another
file it sometimes a works or doesn't I
just got a game it took me six tries to
download the rest of the file it's
terrible well this is it was a I think
it was a gameloft item is a major
developer it was knows the new Nova Nova
to HD or something what are you doing
about that is are you gonna get rid of
this limitation we're going so I have to
look like a fool because I actually
don't know the specifics of that right I
you know what I'm talking about i
actually don't I'm there's there's a lot
of stuff that we work on so I this is a
topic I'm what is it tangentially
familiar with but I don't know actually
what we're doing what we've announced
that we're doing I don't know what the
actual state of play of things is right
now so I can't really comment right um
but what I can say is all of these kinds
of annoyances all of these you know pain
points in the market are things that we
take really really seriously they're
part of the growing pains of the market
oh you changed the market a lot in the
last few months like the last six months
yeah has been a sea change for the way
you guys are are managed and and that's
not slowing down we recognize that that
there's still quite a lot we have to do
to really kind of fulfill the promise of
what market is as a one-stop destination
for all of your media and entertainment
right and so we're going to keep doing
that well well has has the have the
redesigns and implementing some of this
ICS feel into your into the market has a
change sales is a change the way people
are getting apps and using apps I mean
have you seen any can you talk about
actually don't know and if I did I
probably couldn't talk about it right
that's great okay but but I do know that
that Android Market numbers and
downloads are just rising continuously
it's like one of those cheesy hockey
stick graph things that you know that it
keeps growing growing I but you I don't
know you can get the numbers from our
salon it's alex at a hockey stick it's
just shoot it up it is it's ridiculous
it's not a hot upside down hockey stand
it's a right side of icing a final
question somebody wanted to know what
the design guidelines of your shirt were
an American and I'm actually curious to
you always have some pretty intense
outfits I mean you're kind of a stylish
dude uh what is going on with your shirt
it's actually I don't know if you guys
can see this on camera but it's like it
almost looks like it's a machine
generated art is this like it's just
random shirt you found somewhere is
there a story behind it there's no story
behind you be asking it's just a shirt
that I thought was beautiful and I I
like it actually looks like a fractal in
some way like a weird yeah it has it
what I like about it is it's got this
very geometric detailed pattern if you
if you actually get up close to it yeah
but from a distance it's just this kind
of cloudy winter I'm guessing that's
what they can see on camera yeah I don't
think they actually rivals in squares
and circles in here and it's it's quite
beautiful hey I Matthias thank you so
much that's my pleasure oh we're in the
announcer with them and I think I'm
gonna want to talk to you more in the
near future my pleasure always and
thanks to the people at asking questions
I'm sorry we couldn't get to all of them
but yes thank you everybody please head
over to Android design and give us
feedback and go make awesome stuff yeah
please make beautiful applications I ice
cream sandwich deserves it yes in my
opinion alright thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
