finally lose any excuse for using your
phone behind the wheel earlier this year
the first cars are the Google's Android
auto started hitting showrooms and now
it's apple's turn as its carplay is
starting to hit the masses
Chevrolet is one of the first car makers
to enable car play across its lineup now
I've been able to test it out in a 2016
Corvette Stingray car plays very similar
in concept to Android auto it replaces
your cars native infotainment system
with an interface that's very similar to
an iPhone or an iPad that's a good thing
the vast majority of in-car infotainment
systems like the one in this otherwise
very cool Corvette are garbage with ugly
icons slow scrolling and confusing menus
carplay is just a basic grid of app
icons which any iPhone user will
instantly recognize and know what to do
with plug in your iPhone scroll through
the pages and tap on the app you want to
use there's even a button that mimics a
HOME key on your iPhone takes you back
to that grid of icons those apps are
fairly limited however and carplay only
supports a handful of them there's Apple
music Spotify I Heart Radio podcasts
audiobooks and a few other audio apps
supported plus Apple maps iMessage and
SMS phone calls and well that's pretty
much it unlike Android auto carplay
doesn't support any third-party
messaging apps and you won't find any of
Google's apps here such as Maps
underpinning all of this is Siri which
is your main point of interaction with
carplay scrolling through lists and each
app is very limited and rather annoying
especially on the lousy touch screen
that comes in this Corvette so most
things are done by voice commands you
can ask Siri all of the same things in
the car that you can do on the phone
such as what's the weather or what's on
your calendar send a message to Tom
comments all text messages are sent and
dictated by voice like Android auto car
plate doesn't actually let you read
anything on the screen so you can also
control Apple music but sadly voice
controls don't work in third-party apps
making them rather limited but on the
plus side dictation a series often
accurate making it easy to send messages
on the first try
Apple Maps is perhaps unsurprisingly
less accurate than Google Maps however
and it's the one thing that I really
wish I could change in carplay traffic
information doesn't seem to be as
up-to-date and when I compared routes
side-by-side with an Android phone
Google's directions are often faster and
easier to navigate carplay will get you
from point A to point B but it just
might not be the easiest right there the
other problem I have the carplay is that
well it's just too limited that's
largely by design both carplay and
android auto are built to lessen the
distractions you have one behind the
wheel but I'd really love to be able to
send messages in facebook Messenger or
Google Hangouts in addition to standard
iMessage or text I also personally
prefer Spotify over Apple music but in
carplay Apple music is a far better
experience because I can access my full
library with my voice which I can't
really do with Spotify carplay is also
less pretty to look at than Android auto
and it's app grid layout is more tedious
to navigate than the tab system that
Google uses requires you to bounce in
and out of apps more often than should
be necessary but carplay still miles
ahead of anything I've seen from
automakers including what's in this
Corvette and it's a huge step forward
for in car information navigation and
entertainment Apple's got a few kinks to
work out still especially with Apple
maps for the most part I can't imagine
driving a car without this kind of
convenience and functionality now if
only it would keep me from speeding in
the stingray</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
