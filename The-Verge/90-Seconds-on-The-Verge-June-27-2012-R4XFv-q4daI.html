ellis hamburger and you're about to
experience 90 seconds on the verge today
it was day one of Google's IO conference
where the first thing they announced was
the Nexus 7 7 inch tablet from Asus it's
a pretty powerful device but at 199 it's
more targeted at the Kindle Fire than at
the iPad the Nexus 7 is the first device
to launch with Android 4.1 jelly bean
the best feature of jelly bean is Google
now which is kind of like a creepy
personal assistant which uses everything
google knows about you if your location
data what you're interested in and where
you're going to give you information
about sports scores traffic routes
flights and of course notify precrime
division if you're about to commit
murder google also announced the Nexus Q
a social media streamer device that lets
android devices in the room play music
or videos from google play into your
home entertainment system the Nexus Q
only works with Android devices only
works with Google Play content and at
299 it's three times the price of an
Apple TV half the functionality of
google TV but by far the craziest thing
today is google glass which google
demoed using guys jumping out of planes
BMX bike and doing backflips and finally
making their way on this stage to
high-five sergey brin you can pre-order
google glasses today assuming your
developer and you're at Google IO n you
have fifteen hundred dollars to spare
even then you're gonna have to wait a
year or more to get your hands on it
that's it for today's top stories but
tune in tomorrow for 21 tips on how to
shake that hypersleep hangover</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
