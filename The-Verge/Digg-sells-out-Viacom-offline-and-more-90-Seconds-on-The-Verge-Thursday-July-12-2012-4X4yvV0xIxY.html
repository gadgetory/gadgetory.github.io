is now available in all four the major
US carriers now if you have a galaxy s
three from AT&amp;amp;T or Sprint or infer
rather nasty surprise and over the air
update this week restricts the universal
search bar to just Google search results
that bar previously included on device
results such as apps and contacts no

suspect it has something to do with that
whole apple samsung patent dispute in
addition to pull in 26 of the channels
from directv including MTV and Comedy
Central Viacom has yanked a number its
full length shows offline and their
plays Viacom is running ads urging
viewers to call DirecTV and essentially
give into Viacom's demands does the
company can't really tell who does and
doesn't have a direct TV streaming
videos wouldn't pull from just about
everybody you can still find a number of
the episodes online via hulu or at
amazon but that doesn't exactly wash
away the dirty feeling of being a pawn
in a large corporate feud the
once-mighty dig Empire has fallen the
school today for reported five hundred
thousand dollars at one point is history
the company was valued somewhere between
80 and two hundred million dollars the
company became best known as a
cautionary tale and punch line for
reddit the wall street journal also
reports beta works intends to fold dig
into its news mecom property
congratulations myspace that is one more
piece of internet history you have
managed to outlive and that's it for

a special report on sharing your
memories in the cloud who retains the
