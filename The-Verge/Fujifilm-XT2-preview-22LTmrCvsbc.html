verge and we're checking out the
brand-new Fuji XT - now for the better
part of two years I've used the xt-1
as my everyday camera it's my favorite
camera ever because Fugees done a great
job bringing it new features better
autofocus and stuff like that but now
the time has come for a brand new model
entirely now this is not our full review
it's more so first to look at what's new
and it's not a big reinvention of what
the xt-1 was but it's a lot of small
changes that add up to something pretty
fantastic so the two cameras look super
similar the xc2 is a bit heavier a bit
larger there are a few differences on
the dials and around back but for the
most part they're pretty much identical
so probably the biggest change is the
rear display now not only does it go up
and down but it actually goes out to the
side so you can make some tighter shots
via video or photos so it's pretty handy
I wish it moved a little bit more than
it does they went about half way but
it's a nice change should be pretty
useful in certain circumstances so
there's some other cool changes - there
are two SD card slots versus one on the
old model and the 3.5 millimeter mic
jack as well so as opposed to using the
buttons on bottom the focus the XD - now
use is this really nice joystick which
is really easy to control and a lot
better than the old method so the XT 2
is a 24 megapixel sensor the XT 1 at 16
and those 8 megapixels make a big
difference your photos are sharper and
you've got more room to crop and edit
and just kind of mess around with them
so Fugees also pumped up ISO up to
12,000 800 the xt-1 stopped out at 6400
so you've got more flexibility for low
light and dark photos there are more
autofocus points you can choose 91 or
325 which is pretty crazy so it's super
easy to just dial in on something to
focus on in your shop
so the XT 2 also gets 4k video for the
first time which is nice to have even
though foody's not really known for
video quality necessarily so if you buy
the XT 2 you should probably consider
this new battery grip as well it'll hold
three batteries counting the one inside
the camera so you'll be set for days and
days on a charge and there's a boost
mode that when you turn it on you can
take 11 shots per second which is pretty
nice for sports and action scenes so
what all these changes mean for picture
quality
well the xt-1 was great it's a bit too
soon to really speak for the xt - again
this is pre-production not the final
version so things could change
but so far photos are sharp detailed
colorful and they look great straight
out of camera -
so there's not much post-processing
necessary Fuji says the xt2 is coming
soon around the same price as the xt-1
so look for it later on this year for
more on tech cameras and everything
else
