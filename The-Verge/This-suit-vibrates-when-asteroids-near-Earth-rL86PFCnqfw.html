I'm currently wearing the saris jumpsuit
from wearable media and it's vibrating
and letting up right now based on
asteroid activity near Earth while other
wearable companies usually track our
bodies
wherever media wants to use the clothes
that we wear on our bodies to track the
world around us we are focused on
integrating meaningful data and
interactions into garments with
enhancement of Technology Cirrus is a
jumpsuit that senses asteroids in real
time I'm the first person hyper why are
they yeah we just we just finished this
new prototype it feels like I'm wearing
what I assume are swimming spacesuit
would be like so we're putting on what's
called a puck on the back of the
jumpsuit inside-the-park it has the
microcontroller that's receiving the
data and also sending data to the
vibration motors and the LED so the LED
is communicating two types of
information one is the speed of the
asteroid another one is the distance so
the brighter it is the closer it is to
the earth and then the faster the LED is
traveling the faster the asteroids are
traveling so the vibrations that I'm
feeling buzzing on my
those are from different asteroids
circling
it's basically an exploration of turning
our human form into a celestial sensing
body because you know space in many ways
seems imperceptible - less so we wanted
to create a story like how can we bring
the awareness of it on to our bodies and
know that we live in you know a greater
Kosmos and an exploration of that the
cool thing to me about this is it can
change from minute to minute basically
like the vibrations and the lights
you're I'm kind of existing in this in a
constantly changing thing which is cool
because my no rules let's don't do that
also I feel a little bit comforted it's
kind of like a heavy blanket but
randomly vibrates are these all parts
that you use in this particular yes yeah
and then here we have different versions
of the park design so this one from the
left side is the beginning of the
timeline basically and this is closest
to the final part which is what you're
wearing right now and so what's inside
the fact there is one micro controller
which you can think it as a brain of
this garment it has two Bluetooth
communication as wirelessly talking to a
mobile app it can up get the updated
mirrors asteroids data on your shoulder
which is the vibration motor so the raw
of schmolitor is a small disc that keeps
while keeps vibrating yeah so if you
touch that one these are really strong
would this be like the strongest one
yeah that's the strongest level luckily
we don't have any nearest asteroids
around us that's close that close if I
was out at about doing something and by
whole shirt started vibrating this much
I'd get kind of nervous next with a
little help from the people around me I
eventually managed to try on Audrey it's
an augmented reality shirt that reveals
the users Instagram aura I couldn't tell
what my aura looked like but the people
around me said it looked cool so when
you
worried and when we hold up in front of
you and we can see all the graphics
that's generated from our Instagram
account we're using code to generating
these particles that's like floating
around you and the colors are reflecting
our Instagram posts our garments we want
our audience when they wear it they feel
this is something they're passionate
about they know the designers cares
about something that they also cares
about as well and they feel a sense of
exploration and bravery and excitement
when they were into wearable media's
prototypes still feel pretty unusual
even in New York City you probably won't
run into someone wearing an asteroid
jumpsuit but all together they paint a
pretty interesting picture of what kinds
of clothes we could be wearing 20 30 or
50 years from now so the saris jumpsuits
going to be available in September of
2018 to buy until then keep it locked to
the verge calm and we're about to give
me the founders of wearable media
studios this is a Holloway damn it's a
cool building yeah that's us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
