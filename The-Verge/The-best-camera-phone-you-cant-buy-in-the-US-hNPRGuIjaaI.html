Pro, a €1000 smartphone
that's never gone on
sale in the United States
and that should make
Americans very, very upset.
(upbeat electronic music)
Why am I hyped about this phone?
Well, it's not the phone
part, in fact before I proceed
I should mention that I'm using
the Nova Launcher and Reduze Icon Pack,
both of them free on
the Google Play store.
Because Huawei default
themes are not good.
Anyway, the eye opening
thing about this device
is it's camera system, there's
a lot to talk about with it,
so let's dive right in.
First of all you get
three cameras on the rear.
There's an ultra wide
angle, a regular wide angle,
and a telephoto lens, the last of which is
the most interesting because it has
the new periscope system.
This uses a mirror which
reflects 90 degrees
into the body of the
phone and then runs it
through a series of lenses into a sensor
which sits perpendicular to the phone.
What that gives you is a 5x optical zoom.
I've been shooting around
with it here in London,
sometimes in bleak
conditions, sometimes in sunny
conditions, and I've
been really impressed,
it's really crisp, really
sharp, 5x optical zoom,
it beats anything else that you might get
from digital alternatives out there.
Huawei doubles down on that
zoom functionality literally
by giving you a 10x
hyper zoom which combines
the information from the telephoto
and the main camera sensor.
Huawei says it's lossless
I'm not so sure, I do see
a bit of a degradation
in image quality, but it's
only slight, it's very slight,
and it's still super impressive
for 10 times optical zoom.
You don't even get that
with pocket cameras
most of the time.
I've also been messing
around and taking shots
at 24x and 32x with this camera,
and they are surprisingly decent.
As far as zoom goes, the system
that Huawei's put in here
in the P30 Pro is the best
that there's ever been
in a smartphone, and
the shocking thing is,
that all the zoom action
is just the appetizer.
The thing that has me super
excited about this camera
is actually the main sensor,
which is still 40 megapixels
as before, it's still one
of the largest sensors
that you find on a smartphone,
but it's in a RYYB arrangement,
getting rid of the green subpixel
for two yellow subpixels.
Huawei says this allows
it to get as much as 40%
more light in because the
yellow subpixel are sensitive
both to red and green light,
as well as obviously yellow.
Where this comes in
really handy and helpful
is in nighttime photography.
I have taken some low light
photos which have just
blown me away with this phone.
Google's Night Sight was
a revolutionary upgrade
for smartphone photography in low light,
that came out at the
tail end of last year,
but so far ahead of everything else,
everything that Apple,
Samsung, LG and everybody else
who's doing it, and the P30 Pro
just kicks Night Sight's butt.
Now in order for you to get a good shot
with Google Night Sight, you need three
or four seconds or steadiness.
With this camera you it
takes a fraction of a second,
it's the default setting.
It's taking better night
photos than any other camera,
any other mode on a smartphone camera,
and is doing it by default,
it's a fraction of a
second, it's effortless.
Huawei has it's own night
mode, it has a pro mode,
it even has has a master
AI setting which tweaks
the contrast and saturation and so on,
and I don't feel the need
to touch any of those,
because this is a superb
camera by default.
Now is the absolute best camera?
I'm not so sure.
Video is actually one of the
weaknesses of Huawei P30 Pro.
A lot of the stabilization,
you've got optical stabilization
on the main sensor and
the telephoto sensor,
and a lot of the audio
recording those are great,
but the actual detail on the video image
that you get, not so great.
Huawei does quite a lot
of softening to get rid
of image grain and such,
and that's a real downside
with the video so iPhone,
Samsung Galaxy devices,
those have the lead on video.
I also prefer the Pixel's image processing
for the most part.
It allows more grain into the image but
that also means it gets more detail.
Huawei does a little
bit too much processing,
not as much as it did
on the P20 Pro last year
which was over the top, but
still a little too much.
I find that the default
Huawei P30 Pro photos tend
to be a little unsaturated,
whereas if you use the master AI
it tends to push them to oversaturated.
Flats are also not quite as
dark as I prefer to see them,
but that being said, even
though the P30 Pro by default
tends to put out slightly flat images,
they are perfect for image editing.
You see if you just do a
little bit of tweaking,
add a bit of contrast
and a bit of saturation,
they become pretty much perfect.
The 4th sensor that Huawei's
put on the back of the P30 Pro
is not technically a
camera it's a depth sensor,
it works pretty much on the
same principal as face ID
on the iPhone, and what that helps with
is three different things.
Firstly, it's part of
the auto focus system,
so when I'm auto focusing
with the Huawei P30 Pro
I can get it focus in pretty
much pitch black conditions.
It's something that no other
smartphone camera can achieve,
none that I've tested in any case.
Secondly, augmenting
reality applications so
you can point this at
things and measure things
like height, width, depth, even volume.
And the third thing
which is pretty cool is
it enhances this phone's portrait mode.
Firstly it helps it to nail
down even the fine details
which include strands of
hair and things like that,
but then it also affects the
bokeh that you can achieve.
So the closer you are to the subject,
the weaker the bokeh is,
and then it intensifies
it grows softer the further away you get,
and that's achieved with the help
of this extra depth sensor.
Returning to the phone itself,
the P30 Pro is built around
the same Kirin 980 processor
as Mate 20 Pro last year.
That means it's both familiar and fast.
It really is one of the
most responsive smartphones
that I've tested to date.
It gets me great gaming performance,
and with a 4200 milliamp
power battery it lasts
for a heroic length of time.
I can for a day and half
with this thing easily
no matter if I'm gaming,
listening to music
over Bluetooth, shooting a
bunch of photos, video etc.
whatever, it's an
absolute endurance champ.
Huawei puts 8 gigabytes
of RAM on this device,
you can get it with 128 gigs of storage
or up to half a terabyte, all of which is
kind of par for the course.
You get wireless charging and
reverse wireless charging,
you get super charge, 40
watt charging, we get to
up to 70% of battery in just 30 minutes.
So as usual for Huawei
it's a spec sheet stuffer,
all of these things are
great, but also as usual
for Huawei, the software is a letdown.
Beside being quite clunky
and clumsy in the design,
I've come across a few
bugs, most notably with
the Twitter application
which tends to turn
into a jumble occasionally.
Also the multitasking overview
which works pretty well
most of the time, it's
gesture based, which means
you swipe up from the bottom to go home,
swipe up and hold to multitasking,
or swipe from the sides to get
the equivalent of a back button.
That works well most of the time,
but then occasionally it
turns into a visual mess
and I have to lock the
phone and then unlock it
and just kind of try and
make my way out of that.
Huawei EMUI software
has just a few too many
little frustrations and
niggles, one of them is
for example when I have the phone locked,
I can't swipe down the
quick settings in order
to launch something like the flashlight,
which I do quite often.
Another reason and this is
a small thing, but it still
bothers me, Huawei
doesn't do the double tap
or the power button to launch the camera
which everybody else on Android does,
and it's a really handy physical shortcut.
Huawei also has a bunch of Huawei services
such as Huawei HiCare,
which tends to just nag me
all the time and just
remind me about things
which I don't want to do,
so the setup with this phone
involves a lot of wrestling
Huawei down and taming
the software which you
shouldn't really have to do.
Unfortunately I feel like Huawei are still
another year or two away
from doing something
like Samsung did this year with One UI,
which was just a major
overhaul, focusing on the user
rather than the company trying
to promote its own services.
So what don't I like about this phone?
Well one is the fingerprint
sensor is still embedded
into the display, it's an
upgrade over the Mate 20 Pro,
it's better, but it's still
not good enough for me.
I still prefer discrete
fingerprint sensors,
they're still so much faster,
it's so much more reliable.
This is slower than a
discrete fingerprint sensor,
and not as accurate.
The display on this, it's a
1080p display, 6.47 inches.
It's a downgrade from the
Mate 20 Pro unfortunately.
Any time you're looking at a white screen,
the curves on the side
tend to produce a shadow,
it's a bluish shadow,
which is a bit of spoiler,
and comparing this to
the Samsung Galaxy s10,
which is what the P30
Pro is going up against,
this is an obvious downgrade,
which is unfortunate.
It's still a good screen, but it's not
as excellent as Samsung's.
The P30 Pro is a phone
that will be remember
for the excellence and the
versatility of its cameras.
It really is the best
zoom that we've ever had
in a smartphone to date.
This phone also has the
performance, for the most part
setting aside the bugs,
and the industrial design
to match any other flagship of 2019.
