intimidating all gadgets start off as
watling's join us as we witness these
young gadgets boot up for the very first
time overcome challenges and take their
place amongst this incredible species we
call gadgets they roam the skies above
us and scurry beneath our very feet
surviving in some of the harshest
environments they're solitary and
community elegant and fierce for our
planet is full of gadgets so come with
us as we reveal the unimaginably diverse
world we call gadget earth like all
young bottlings are playful curious and
often need guidance here we see two
quadruped edits trying to teach their
young how to hunt through play the
parents passed down the skills their
offspring will need to have any chance
of survival the young gadgets however
don't seem to share their enthusiasm
undeterred the eager parents try their
best to encourage their bottlings into
joining the hunt but that's not always
so easy exhausted the parents eventually
give in to their stubborn young and
decide instead to teach them how to know
but not all bottlings are so adverse to
play in fact some relish it
for these young BattleBots play-fighting
is an essential part of their
development in later adulthood they will
need to fend off rival suitors and
battle to claim territory
therefore play-fighting gives them a
chance to practice their skills without
the dire consequences eventually they
will find themselves engaged in bitter
battles to win the attention of a mate
but for now they're just scrapping for
some attention from their parents but
this world is not always a safe
playground
this young drone has become stuck while
playing carelessly close to the ground
it lacks the strength needed to break
free and each attempt only tires it out
forward the large flock of gadgets is
already well on a move and is completely
unaware of this bottlings dire situation
let alone the fact that it's even
missing
this bottling is truly on its own though
sad these moments remind us that even
bottlings aren't safe from the harsh
nature of gadget earth but there is also
hope there are times when a bottling is
given another chance
this young gadget was found alone and
close to death but that's hard to
believe when looking at it now
fortunately there are gadget sanctuaries
we're willing volunteers are on hand to
help nurture bottlings like this little
fellow back to health once they are
healthy enough to survive on their own
they are released back into the wild
some of course are less patient and they
don't even want to wait that long with
each new generation gadgets will
continue to evolve becoming smarter
faster and living amongst us gadgets
will continue to change
they'll impress us with their skills and
remind us of their limitations but if
nothing else they have shown us that
they are here to stay on gadget earth
this gadgets just really stupid I mean
look at it what on earth is it for
nothing</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
