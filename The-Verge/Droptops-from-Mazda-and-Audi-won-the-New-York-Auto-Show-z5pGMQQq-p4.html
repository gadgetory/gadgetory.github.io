on the floor of the new york
international auto show 2016 with my
good friend jason harper who also
happens to be our columnist and you've
been on the floor most of the day today
I've been on the floor for part of the
day to day what have you seen this
interesting what's my first beer I will
say but I feel like here's well-deserved
so here's I mean there's really not a
ton here today you know but after Geneva
and CES and all these things and kind of
run out of news so the one nice nice
surprise to me is the sort of targa
Miata the mazdas sort of came out of the
box surprise yes gorgeous is it really
beautiful top up or top down is it just
it has the right look there's sort of
this angles that are just fantastic I
actually had lunch with the new designer
yesterday and he's talking about using
these organic forms getting away from
sort of hard creased edges which all the
car makers are using these hard crease
edges because they can do them but
Georgia he's talking about a car smalls
the miata that it's all the portions
getting the proportions right in these
smooth angles and it looks like a
throwback it's this beautiful organic
form yeah or with the reveal last night
and everybody was like wow they just won
the auto show yea there is a little bit
of that sense and it was it was kind of
a surprise right no one really saw this
coming they've done hardtop me out isn't
a convertible hardtop in the past but
not quite like this this is cool man i
like this one of those like I want
moment oh yeah I could see myself owning
something yeah which is the list you
know it is really weird to debut a bunch
of drop tops in New York because it's
New York and we have a real winner here
and there were a bunch of drops at La in
November which makes more
in LA but this is kind of a four-season
car right yeah it support and through
the summer is coming summers coming we
also just saw obviously r8 spyder which
we knew was coming that's not as big a
surprise yeah it's not as innovative
because as sort of what we just got
stock seen by a Mazda but the same idea
that's a cool car in venous generation
was one of my favorite cars you put the
top down ya hear the engine behind you
so you know it does have that little
frisson of spring coming now I just want
you I don't want to blow up Jason spot
but you did do a ridiculous r8 video
recently where you drifted on a beach if
we took it on a beach and we tore up a
golf course yeah in the old r 8 and then
we brought the new ra and actually in a
couple weeks i will take the new ra back
to daytona nice and play with it and see
how fast we can get it and we'll be
doing for the verge so you know let's
get a little a little inside action of
how the r8 is on the on daytona that's
what i like to hear and the r8 spyder
that's here is in this beautiful shade
of yellow audi they're really good at I
think picking the right colors for all
of its up tuned cars they have for many
years going back to like the b5 s4 and
those bright blues and yellows and
they're doing it again with the right
spider here what else is there there's
not a whole lot otherwise this there
yeah I mean speaking they re actually we
just saw on stage Stephan Winkelmann who
came from from Lamborghini who's now
transitioned over to audi sport and
that's interesting that they're sort of
sharing some brands here so outies sort
of up market really fast cars or gonna
be influenced by sort of this cloth
influence of Lamborghini which is kind
of cool so it was his sort of unveiling
here yeah which is kind of neat you know
your your Prius thing here's a Prius
prime which admittedly is a cool name
for a car Prius Prime that's the direct
transformers yeah very transformers but
you
it's a Prius and also the hyundai ioniq
which is the prettiest competitors not
far behind us we're also sitting in kind
of a cool nissan booth right now yeah we
have like six generations of skyline
around us including the actual card that
set the the lap record at nurburgring
dunivan camouflage for some reason now
one of the old versions to me with
somebody was asking which is the coolest
one and that one actually has the the
width of mirrors actually up on the
fender yes that's badass yes it's now
the new one man it's the new new is not
new you know it's told new it's the
all-new it's the old tired slightly new
way yeah Nissan meant Nissan's a brand
that needs a new energy showing us a
slightly slightly review that you've
revised GTR is not that new energy right
this is a company and it needs to spend
some money in some things and
desperately yeah I mean know it to be
fair like for what you get you know
you're still getting a zero to 60 in 2.7
second effectively supercar for honor
does nellore 110 whatever it is so it's
a budget supercar I guess but but it
yeah it's it's it's a you know debuted
in 2007 and its twenty sixteen ounce
that's why sexy give us something new
come on boys won't give us up new suit
you have homework Nissan and where have
you been lately show up alright well
Jason thank you and we're gonna have
some really cool stuff from him coming
up in the next few we're gonna have fun
I promise there will be lots of fun to
be had lots of fun and of course we're
gonna have more from the floor of the
new york international auto
