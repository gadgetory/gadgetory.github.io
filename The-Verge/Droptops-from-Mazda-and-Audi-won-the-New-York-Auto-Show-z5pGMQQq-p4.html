on the floor of the New York
International Auto Show 2016 with my
good friend Jason Harper who also
happens to be our columnist and you've
been on the floor most of the day today
I've been on the floor for part of the
day-to-day what have you seen that's
interesting what's my first beer I will
say but I feel like there's well
deserved so here's I mean there's really
not a ton here you know but after Geneva
and CES and all these things they kind
of run out of news so the one nice nice
surprise to me is the sort of Targa
Miyata the Mazdas sort of came out of
the box surprised yes gorgeous it was
really beautiful top up or top down is
it just it has the right look there's
sort of this angles that are just
fantastic I actually had lunch with the
new designer yesterday and he's talking
about using these organic forms getting
away from sort of hard creased
edges which all the car makers are using
these hard creased edges because they
could do them but Georgia he's talking
about a car small City Miata that it's
all the proportions getting the
proportions right and these smooth
angles and it's it looks like a
throwback it's this beautiful organic
form yeah or with the reveal last night
and everybody was like wow they just won
the Auto Show yeah there is a little bit
of that sense and it was it was kind of
a surprise right no one really saw this
coming
they've done hardtop Miatas and the
convertible hardtop in the past but not
quite like this this is cool man I like
this one of those like I want moment oh
yeah I could see myself owning something
yeah you know it is really weird to
debut a bunch of drop tops in New York
because it's New York and you have a
real winner here and there were a bunch
of drop tops at LA in November which
makes more sense in LA but this is kind
of a four season car right yeah it's a
port and summer is coming summer stop we
also just saw obviously r8 Spyder which
we knew was coming that's not that's
bigger
yeah it's not as innovative is as sort
of what we just got stock seen by
applause but the same idea that's a cool
car
this generation was one of my favorite
cars you put the top down
yeah here the engine behind you so you
know it does have that little frisson a
spring coming now I just want you I
don't wanna blow up Jason spot but you
did do a ridiculous r8 video recently
where you drifted on a beach if we took
it on the beach and we tore up a golf
course yeah in the old r8 and then we
brought the new RA and actually in a
couple weeks I will take the new RA back
to Daytona nice and play with it and see
how fast we can get it and we'll be
doing for the Virg so you know let's get
a little a little inside action of how
the r8 is on the on Daytona that's what
I like to hear and the the r8 spider
that's here is in this beautiful shade
of yellow
howdy they're really good at I think
picking the right colors for all of its
up tune cars they have for many years
going bet to like the b5 s4 and those
bright blues and yellows and they're
doing it again with the right spider
here what else is there there's not a
whole lot
otherwise this there yeah no I mean
speaking the r8 actually we just saw on
stage Stefan willkommen who came from
from a Lamborghini who's now
transitioned over to Audi Sport and
that's interesting that they're sort of
sharing some brands here so outies sort
of market really fast cars we're gonna
be influenced by sort of this Closter
influence of Lamborghini which i think
is kind of cool so it was his sort of
unveiling here yeah which is kind of
neat
you know your your Prius thing the
here's the Prius Prime which admittedly
is a cool name for a car Prius Prime
that's very transformers yeah very
transformers but it's it's a Prius and
also the hyundai ioniq which is the
prius competitor is not far behind us
we're also sitting in
kind of a cool Nissan booth right now
yeah we have like six generations of
skyline around us including the actual
car that set the the lap record at
Nurburgring done up in camouflage for
some amazing now one of the old versions
to me somebody was asking which is the
coolest one and that one actually has
the the width of the mirrors actually up
on the fender yes that's badass that is
yes it's now the new one man it's the
new new is not new you know it's old new
it's the old new it's the old tired
slightly new way yeah
Nissan meant Nissan's a brand that needs
some new energy showing us a slightly
slightly review that you've revised the
GTR is is not that new energy right this
is a company and it needs to spend some
money in some things and desperately
yeah right I mean to be fair like for
what you get you know you're still
getting a zero to sixty in two point
seven second effectively supercar
$400,000 110 whatever it is so it's a
budget supercar I guess but but it yeah
it's it's it's a you know it debuted in
2007 and it's 2016 now so that's why ii
give us something new come on boys come
on give us something new so you have
homework nissan and with no up all right
well jason thank you and we're gonna
have some really cool stuff from him
coming up in the next few weeks we're
gonna have fun I promise there will be
lots of fun to be had lots of fun and of
course we're gonna have more from the
floor of the New York
to show 2016 on diverse complex
transportation and on YouTube thanks for
