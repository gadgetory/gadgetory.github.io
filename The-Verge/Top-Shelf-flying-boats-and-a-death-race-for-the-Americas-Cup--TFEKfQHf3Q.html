welcome to top shelf my name is David
Pierce and this week we're headed out on
the water the America's Cup Finals start
this week and what used to be just a
boat race for billionaires is now an
incredibly high-tech incredibly
interesting boat race for billionaires
so we sent Casey Newton out into the San
Francisco Bay to see what the America's
Cup is becoming and how on earth
billionaires spend this much money on a
sailboat
you
we're weeks away from the America's Cup
finals this year the boats have been
completely redesigned in a way that has
made them much much faster but also more
dangerous we came down to San
Francisco's Pier 80 to meet with the
defending champions oracle team USA to
find out what they're doing to win this
race and also what they're doing to make
sure that it's as safe as possible
so you helped design the 2010 champion
the one America's Cup when it came time
to design this year's model what were
the goals the girl is the ways to make
an design an exciting boat something
that looks like fast and like amazing
machine that people that can see it said
wow that's different you know and that's
America's Cup so we try to get something
like an eye level of sailing so we ended
up with a platform which was I mean with
a rigid wing it was like similar to what
we did in 2010 so it looks like very
different like a wing of an aircraft and
and we worked a lot on for hydro foil so
now the boot can fly above the water so
for sure we are looking for something
really different any is it the flight is
what makes the boat faster than the wind
and gives it the advantage over those
other votes it depends on the condition
so it depends on the wind condition if
it's windy if it's lightweight with
wrong way if it's like you go a plane or
don't win so it depends a bit on the
condition but a lot of resistance come
from the heart itself so because we've
got a big volume immerse so it creates
some ID road drag so it's just like
prevent you to go faster so at one stage
if you are able to leave the boat from
your idle foil the drag created by the
hydrofoil itself it's much smaller so
because you've got less resistance you
can just increase your speed so that's
the way it worked can you talk to me
about how you try to design this boat in
a way that's safe for the crew it's I
mean the inherently the boat is not that
safe because a multi order is can
capsize you know and you can flip the
boat and you can have a pitch pull a
fishbowl situation these are dangerous
situation so it's it's a criteria we
always I mean we we always choose our
design creature a very carefully
regarding these maneuvers so basically
we we can recreate some maneuvers
on the computer and see the runge of i
mean the the limits we can see the
limits of the operating condition of the
board so we also give tips to the
sailors say okay in this condition you
should have these settings these setups
is probably safer when you are when you
start a given given maneuver but still
it's inherently is not the safe machine
what kind of technology do the sailors
carry on to the boat with them to help
them monitor conditions in the water
obviously as a every America's Cup team
we have a lot of technology that is
involved aboard we also have a lot of
stuff for the performance and for
example we are carrying obviously a few
computers onboard a lot of sensor we are
just to give you an idea we are logged
in 3,000 variables 10 hours 10 times a
second and it's a lot of that obviously
why we are sailing we are not carrying
about these all these information that
is more for designers when we are
sailing we have a lot of information and
we are using a portable device we have a
PDA head-up display and tablet around
and basically every single person on the
crew as a just information that he needs
in the past the cap was different you
have a navigator it was a person that
was sharing the information around and
it was basically just doing that so you
actually write some of the software that
runs on these PDAs that sailors are like
yourself or carrying can you give us an
idea of some of the things that you're
measuring that a sailor is checking
during the race honors PDA sure for
example I'm a grinder and my pedestal we
are the one they start controlling the
board the board are the boys are going
up and down so old obviously when you
are in the windward side you cannot see
the leeward board so all the angle and
the loads that we have there it's very
hard to judge by I so we have a display
that you are carrying it basically tell
us the information about the board about
some others numbers and that is just for
us we are basically the only one who
boarded care about that information is
what we have the tactician is it doesn't
really care about the boards is more
interesting win the situation and the
boat speed and to win the angle so yes
is on number and you can just look up
that let me ask you about safety these
boats are going faster than ever how do
you stay safe when you're out of the
boat that is a tricky question it's a
it's a new Borton just like I don't all
right I when I was kids I was skiing
and you don't think about how dangerous
key until something happened you go up
down the track you enjoy and you go
faster and faster every day here is the
same you like the boat you go faster
every day obviously when something
happen is bad but is what you like and
you can do it right we on the boat when
it capsized I had the problem of my end
called the day before so I was us
because checking myself and I get the
bed now okay don't you dodged that
bullet but when you're out there I mean
do you feel safe or you just try not to
think about it I think you forget about
it say when you go out there especially
now that we are in a pre-race face when
we go there we are not losing a much
time around the baby just racing and
when you're racing other cows are not
seem to worry about the safety right how
good are you feeling about your chances
next month we have we're feeling good
but obviously the team out there are
very strong game we have work to do
you've been on this team for 13 years
now sounds like a lot of your life is
just looking at data trying to maximize
the performance of these boats do you
feel like you're starting to hit an
upper limit or as you like look out five
years do you think these boats are just
going to keep getting faster and better
we barely scratched the surface with
these both when the rule was envisaged
for these boats in i guess it was 2011
we didn't even in visited boats would
fly above the water was imagine they say
like conventional multihulls with one
hole in now they're flying it's increase
the performance ten or fifteen percent
those sorts of steps are not common but
you could imagine that sort of paradigm
again jumping another hole another whole
environment so i can see big steps in
the future and what makes this America's
Cup in this class so exciting is that
we're really just starting out with
boats like this in the world of sailing
and um we learn something every day
fantastic so even with all of the
advances that you're making
technologically it is still the marriage
of man and machine that is making this
the fastest boat that you've sailed yet
the marriage of man and machine is what
wins the America's Cup always has been
but the balance of who does what is
changing all the time everything sounds
like it's starting to lean more to the
machine side a little bit yeah but you
know we made the environment that much
more complicated that the human beings
about the only thing that can deal with
all the inputs but anyway so it's a
great challenge
so there you have it millions of dollars
and tons of energy are being pumped into
making these boats incredibly fast as
well as safe but talk to anyone here and
they'll tell you there's no technology
that can guarantee the safety of anyone
on board and the reason they're willing
to keep taking these risks is because
everyone else on the water is gunning
for them the three other teams in this
race all want to be the one that knocks
off the champion all oracle team USA can
do in the meantime is keep training hope
the weather cooperates and with any luck
they just might defend their
championship against overwhelming odds
Casey Newton did survive his time on the
Oracle vote and he's here with me now so
Casey was it it was touch and go there
for a while maybe it was it was a little
bit scary but not as much for us we were
on a chase boat but we could see what
was going on on the oracle team USA boat
and it's pretty amazing well even then I
keep seeing clips of these boats going
by you know kayakers with cameras and
they're coming like this photo it's it's
scary stuff out there it really is i
mean the boats are enormous right this
is a hundred and thirty one foot sale
you have it's a boat that weighs 13,000
pounds and it is sailing faster than the
wind it's an amazing to the wind is
serious to the wind is serious yeah I
mean this was probably the windiest
America's Cup ever it's in the San
Francisco Bay people knew it was going
to be windy coming in but I don't know
that they knew exactly how would be so
okay so my big question is are these
boats too dangerous like there's this
big back and forth and everybody seems
to have on opinion but what's what's
yours are they too dangerous so I think
people didn't think about how the wind
conditions were going to affect the race
as much as they probably should have
they went into this thinking hey let's
just design the fastest boat imaginable
and it will be able to handle the
conditions I think in these conditions
these boats actually are much less safe
than people hoped that they would be
overall the America's Cup has a pretty
good track record of safety but at the
same time someone died in the
preparations for this race and that was
just during practice drills so the real
concern is when the final start and
these guys are pulling out all the stops
are they going to be able to keep these
incredibly
huge fast boats right side up right so
the solution it seems like might be you
know have it in somewhere other than San
Francisco which is sort of notorious for
this but also having it in San Francisco
makes great television it really does
and the whole idea behind this year's
America's Cup was let's take yachting
which is the sport for the super-rich
and try to make it more accessible so
we'll come in lately like this much more
accessible well I give UK if you flew
into San Francisco you could go right up
onto the shore and yeah and the boat
would sort of race by you just you know
get you get a decent shot of them with
your camera phone and so it would be
kind of a much more democratic event
than it ever been before but as you've
noted the wind conditions have just sort
of taken everyone by surprise I mean
everyone we talked to for this piece
just brought up the wind as being a real
curveball for them yeah ok so what's
what happens next like what's happened
since you did this why were they solving
these problems like a god I they can't
change that fact are they changing
things before the race to make it so
that doesn't happen again they have
implemented a number of recommendations
and changes that the teams need to make
racing I'm sorry sailing comes to be a
very litigious sport and so the
billionaires who are running all these
teams are suing each other to say well
know that that change is going to
disadvantage me and let's make this
change which will you know have an
advantage for me and so all of that is
sort of still being negotiated so do
that can the rules change up to
basically the minute of the race
essentially they really can uh sailing
appears to have just the absolute most
flexible rules of any sport I've ever
seen and they pretty much seem to change
like per the dictates of the
billionaires who are funding 100 million
dollar campaigns to win the america's
cup so everyone plays very sort of fast
and loose with the rules and the other
big thing that's happened since we shot
this piece is that there's been a
cheating scandal so Oracle has been
accused of putting weights on their
boats possibly to sort of keep them more
grounded in the water and they've gone
over the weight limit for their class of
boat this is all sort of still being
sorted out Oracle insists we didn't
cheat but in the meantime it has been
another black eye for a race that many
people are starting to view asked as
something of a fiasco so what you just
described something that it sounds like
would make the boat that
and safer and it's cheating to do that
right that was happening here that's
right well you know I mean all of the
all of the rules of saline are like
completely arbitrary but they do try to
come up with a weight limit for the boat
right so if you bring some illegal
weights on if you think it's going to
give you some sort of performance
advantage like it seems like it's
probably not right and they do the ideas
just it'll handle better yeah I just
make everybody else put the weights in
the book right I just solve your problem
welcome yeah I mean it sounds like NASA
almost what do you have the it's 11
people on the boat yeah and then there's
this whole control room behind them
keeping everything going well so the
control room is in a different boat okay
so another sugar also out on the on the
bay yeah okay yeah and they're actually
they're not allowed to communicate
during the races so that's a one rule
that is that sort of when you're on the
boat you have to kind of do it by
yourself but they do all have pda's that
are like sort of on their arms that have
custom written software some of the
sailors write their own software we're
pretty amazing and they dirty visual
that day that's gets very very good
julion I think it's hard to become a
billionaire without being dirty once you
inherit the well yeah so so what do you
think if you're you know looking forward
for the America's Cup and the team's
building these boats like what do you
see changing what would you prescribe
well we're Larry Ellison what are you
doing that if I'm Larry Ellison I'm
gonna have a very expensive dinner
somewhere out and then I'm going to go
back to my lab and see how we can make
these boats faster but I think that
you're going to see the sailing
community come under increasing pressure
to truly make these boats safer so they
wouldn't let you on one now would you
get on what if you could oh absolutely
yeah yeah I mean like the thing is you
know I keep saying this but the boats
fly okay okay not really like they're
still what kind of literally literally
fly right so there's like a dagger board
and it's in the water and like you know
the this like 7,000 pounds of force
lifts them and then they move faster
than the wind because they've reduced
the drag so much I want to be on the
boat when it happens it's not yeah maybe
not racing know maybe racing I don't
know I don't wanna be anywhere near the
book here's what I don't want to be like
actually like at the wheel like I don't
want to be the captain of this ship but
if they could just sort of like duct
tape me around the past so I could like
feel that lift to be great
yeah yeah just put me on a nice harness
we good okay well so you talked to
Julian Guthrie who wrote who literally
wrote the book on the America's Cup
she's sort of a historian and has
followed the crew especially Larry Alice
and the Oracle crew and so you talked to
her about all this stuff and more so
let's have a look at that Julian a lot
of the money for America's Cup has come
from Larry Ellison founder CEO of Oracle
why is Larry Ellison so interested in
sailing he you know that's a great
question sailing for him is where he
gets a break from being Larry Ellison
which is a really unexpected thing so he
gets to go out on these boats he gets to
be a member of the team and he's
expected to perform just like anybody
else on the boat and he can have Russell
Coutts you know as his technician
screaming at him you know what the did
you forget how to sail you know who else
is going to talk to Larry Ellison like
that so I think that he's measured
against how well he does on the boat so
having said that you know he loves the
water he loves the sea he's loved
sailing since or the idea of sailing
since he was a kid he was a very
accomplished sailor starting at around
1995 through year 2000 he got as far as
he could along with the sailing and the
maxi yachts at that point and the next
level was the America's Cup and Larry
Ellison is all about what you know how
do you go up to the next weight class
and it had gone from maxi yacht sailing
to the America's Cup the mayor America's
Cup is the pinnacle so he couldn't go
any you know that's the heavyweight
championship of the world and it seems
like now that he's reached that pinnacle
he's trying to take it to the next level
yet again right the boats this time
around are much faster maybe more
dangerous you talk at all about what's
different between this year's race and
the 2010 championship well one thing
that's different everybody talks about
these boats the ac72s being crazy fast
which they are I think team new zealand
logged 52 miles an hour last week you
know which is faster than the speed
limit on the Golden Gate Bridge and so
they are flying but the
look that really set this all in motion
is us a 17 which is in the parking lot
here which you should go and see and the
wing sale of us a 17 was 230 feet tall
too tall and standing up to fit under
the Golden Gate Bridge so that was the
trimaran what Larry Ellison called his
black pterodactyl that won the America's
Cup for oracle racing in 2010 and that
set the precedent for technological
innovation but these boats are flying
literally so you have this wing on top
of the boat the hard sale and you have
these wings under the boat that are
getting the boat out of the water and
therefore doing what's ailing you know
tries to do when I said its best and
that is reduced drag so you're having
these crazy fast boats I mean they're
really phenomenal to look at the
instability is coming from the speed
from the foiling and from San Francisco
Bay because of how extreme sailing is on
San Francisco Bay so without resorting
to hyperbole is this possibly going to
be the most dangerous america's cup of
all time oh definitely but but i think
it's important to keep perspective this
is 162 year old regatta and there have
been two fatalities you know san
francisco being a pedestrian is more
dangerous you know a teen fatalities
every year crossing the street in san
francisco so you have to have some
perspective you know you'll talk with
Jimmy Spithill you talk with some of
these sailors their adrenaline junkie
junkies and they want it to be safe but
they want to get to the finish line the
fastest I mean that's the objective NBC
has a deal to show this year's NBC or
this year's America's Cup how is
television getting involved change the
race is there sort of a desire among
television executives to have a race
that sure is fast but it's maybe going
to have a little bit more calamity than
the average regatta well you know NBC
it's my understanding didn't become
really interested in the americas cup
until russell coutts pitch pulled the
ac45 back it was more than a year ago
it's about a year and a half ago so
suddenly you know you have these
gorgeous boats you have this amazing
amphitheater of the San Francisco Bay
and you have these boats pitch bowling
which is like doing a cartwheel if
you're a boat and suddenly they thought
wow the executives the media folks
thought this is really exciting this is
you know Formula One racing on the water
so it was this yes it's getting faster
it's getting more dangerous and that
attracted the major networks I
understand now for the first time they
have PDAs they have wearables you know
you mentioned earlier that technology
has always been a big part of the
America's Cup what role is it playing in
this year's race Oh every facet of it I
mean it's really you know it's it's the
the technological innovation in the
grade of carbon fiber you know it's what
is the best carbon fiber you can get for
the boats the the Kevlar the Kleiss are
the aeronautical skin that goes around
the sales it's it is how these races are
going to be unpaired which is totally
changing because of the technology it is
how viewers people who know nothing
about sailing are going to be able to
understand the races because of the
lines they're laying out through this
through this totally new technology that
they're laying out on the water so
they're gonna understand which boat is
ahead and they're going to understand
what the boundaries are what the
objectives are so that is entirely new
you know the guys are miked the guys are
theirs there are hundreds of sensors on
board these boats the the the weather
data that they're getting the ability to
track the other boats performance and
compare it to their own you know it's
all technology-based it's it's
definitely cutting-edge I think it's the
most cutting-edge technology used in any
sport the like what people liken it to
is Formula One racing does that does
that analogy holed up in your mind is
this formula 1 racing on the water I
think it's a lot more complex you know I
think for one building these boats is
more complex you think about they it's
more complex than building at you know
an airplane even because they're having
to build these you know space-age flying
machines for the water and for the air
you've got the engine of the boat which
is the sale in the air
and you've got the other parts so the
engineering of these votes is super
complex more complex than cars more
complex than than airplanes you know the
wing sail that they built for us a 17
the winning boat in 2010 230 feet tall
too tall when too tall when standing up
to fit under the Golden Gate Bridge you
know is the largest wing cell ever built
wing ever built for error for see so as
you size up the competition this year
can anybody catch Oracle how competitive
is it I think it's very competitive you
know people have talked about how there
are fewer teams this year and complained
or lamented over there being fewer teams
but one thing that I heard Jimmy
Spithill say which made a lot of senses
yeah in the past there have been more
teams but they weren't all real
contenders I think the Kiwis are the
team to beat you know I wouldn't
although I think that you know team
Oracle Team USA is unbelievable you know
and and Jimmy and Ben Ainslie and their
whole crew it's a pretty cool thing you
know it's a dream realized whether you
like you know whether your fan of the
America's Cup or not there are a lot of
Dreams being realized with this event
that's our show thanks to Casey Newton
for being here and thanks to Julian
Guthrie and the whole Oracle Team USA
team as well the America's Cup final
starts September 7th on NBC and it's
going to be awesome but probably also
