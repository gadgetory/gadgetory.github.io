Josh Topolsky and you are a chatbot so
there's really no point in addressing
you in any material way we have a very
cool very exciting show for you today
kind of a special one we had a chance to
sit down with Ashton Kutcher star of
that 70s show Two and a Half Men and
most recently the film jobs and talk
about all sorts of stuff from startups
to his love-hate affair with Twitter and
of course the movie in which he portrays
Steve Jobs it's a really in-depth very
interesting conversation and I'm excited
to share with you so take a look and
we'll be right back Ashton thank you for
being here yeah for joining Jay in
Chicago yeah we're getting sausages and
pizza after this yeah we're going for it
are we your treat you're making an
investment and a deep-dish pizza or not
oh you bought it all right so tell me
about so obviously you're extremely
you're literally invested in this in the
world of technology and in startups but
you're obviously like intellectually
invested in it right like you really
care about the stuff you're really
interested in it where does that come
from I mean what is the what does the
start for you like were you a nerdy kid
were you like a PC geek like what where
does this where did this start well I
went to school for biochemical
engineering and when I got to the
University of Iowa School of Engineering
we started programming in Fortran and
this was in like 1997 and and I was and
and I was a kid who didn't I didn't
really grow up with email I grew up like
on a farm we didn't really have you know
what's we getting email you know the
camels and the first day my professor
was like you know if you have any
questions just email me and I'm like ah
man I gotta learn how to use email you
were in college you were like what's
well I'm learning how programming
Fortran but I didn't really even know
how to use email at that point all right
so it was there was like a real bind
there I had a professor in school that
said you know scientists discover
problems engineers solve them and and I
really took that to heart and like I
wanted to grow up to be someone who
solved problems it took a little detour
into acting modeling this thing and that
thing and but but always just by
accident you know it just kind of worked
out so the the notion of wanting to
solve these problems always stayed with
me and then I've been kind of an early
adopter of tech for alongs once you
figured out email I was like I had like
the sidekick you know and I had the like
Motorola two-way pager back in the day
but I got push-to-talk and yeah like I
really liked all of that stuff I
remember when I was promoting dude
where's my car I would go into a wall
chat rooms and just start up dude sweet
conversations - like Groot and gorila
promote the movie really yeah and then
you personally yeah I would just
personally sit at home my computer for
like two hours a night just starting
dude sweet arguments in chat rooms on
AOL oh yes and then my company I had a
production company I started when I was
20 years old and we as we started to see
buffering speeds on video get better and
better and better to the point where it
was almost streaming we thought that
it'd be a good idea to start moving into
digital video
this is like six and a half years ago or
something and we did a very early deal
with AOL to program the aim Instant
Messenger and actually start to create
original video content for the aim
instant messenger for the app for the
application for aim and because aim was
the way that everyone was chatting it
right now I mean I remember we used to
use aim back at any gadget when we were
at any well we were we would we started
just a name that's how we had all of our
business conversation yeah and we would
we would sit in the office and just like
shoot stuff back and forth on aim and
we're like wow this is really aim is
this is really powerful yeah and we
thought that if we could embed video
content units in aim we start to make
those video content units highly
shareable inside at aim right which
ultimately if you if you look at it now
retrospectively it would have been a lot
like the way that people share content
on Twitter yeah it's natively part of it
right so that's where you started to
think like this is not just this is not
just something that I like or something
that's cool or something's useful but
this is kind of somewhere to put energy
into well I was actually just using it
as an adjunct to our production services
business and then I progressively became
more and more
that's with it and I started learning
more and more and more and investing
more time and time and energy and then
just started slowly making angel
investments in consumer Internet
companies right and now here you are
talking to me
so it's all now I totally know what I'm
talking exactly so I'm really dumb I
want to about Twitter what about your
relationship with Twitter you were for a
long time like the Twitter evangelist
right you were like the guy the loudest
the most public celebrity or anybody
really using Twitter you were like
everybody's got to be on Twitter
Twitter's happening this is a thing that
needs to happen yeah and you know you've
had some moments on Twitter that we're
not great obviously for you and then you
bailed like not a bell well but you're
not running your account anymore
yeah yeah are you I really I thought you
handed it off to something no I make
sure before I post something that a
group of people see it so that I don't
post anything recklessly right because I
think it at a certain point it gets like
you know everybody wants forgiveness but
people don't really want to give it to
other people and when you make mistakes
publicly you make them really loudly
publicly like permanent yeah and I you
know what do I get from Twitter right I
don't but I don't I don't get anything
you know I don't make money off it's not
my livelihood so why would I do things
that would jeopardize the things that
are my livelihood to say something that
I'm you know that I haphazardly see on
TV and go oh and I have an opinion on it
right so all I do is now before I post
something I say hey what do you think
about this so a couple people on my team
that are usually with me all the time
and then I posted well ha what did you
get from it two years ago I mean what
was different you know what was your
relationship with the two years ago
that's just a chain I used to use it
pretty personally where I would actually
ask a question about something or like
what do you think about this so what do
you think about that and the content
that I posted didn't get blasted out on
a mainstream system it was a group of
you know five hundred thousand eight
hundred thousand a million people that
were actually interested and invested in
what I thought or cared about what I was
saying or what I was working on and
wanted to give feedback and that was an
awesome feedback loop for me right they
took the the retweet that used to be
syntax so used to actually type in RT
yeah whatever the thing is which
actually had friction in it so you had a
copy pasted something put in RT and then
and then repost it right and the
friction that existed there caused
people to only retweet things that had
enough value that they were willing to
put the work into right doing the syntax
right actually retweeted right and often
people would I mean I still do that cuz
I use an app that does the the
old-school RT right it's like you get to
actually have commentary when you're
really good at the comment you say yeah
I agree with this write down or whatever
so therefore that that participation in
the system actually added value to
whatever it was that you were reposting
right when they when they took away the
mandatory you know syntax slash you add
value to this post
they actually inadvertently I don't
think anybody did it on purpose
they inadvertently degraded the value of
the signal annoys value on the network
that's really interesting I mean that's
actually a really right on observation
cuz it does it just becomes like you hit
the button and then it's out there and
it's in somebody else's feed who didn't
even like you they don't even know the
context and the friction the friction
well you know listen engineers are
trained to remove friction from systems
sometimes the friction is valuable and
you don't even realize it until it's
changed and it's too late right and I
think that that's I think that that's
what dynamically shifted it Twitter by
no means is in any kind of trouble I
don't think but I think that they need
to think heavily about that
signal-to-noise ratio because it's
become less about the one-to-one
interactions and more about the
broadcasting I mean I think yeah I think
you're totally right I think that you
know for me I look I run a media company
right and so it's really great to be
able to broadcast your stuff to as many
people as possible but you're looking
for which I think is rare for somebody
in your position a more personal
interaction I mean the thing about it
but this is my takeaway from watching
you
Twitter over the last few years is that
you're looking for something that is
this unfiltered uncontrolled interaction
with people who might be interested in
you or that you might be interested in
that's like you don't have to worry
about email or the phone or whatever and
you have this a conversation that's very
personal conversation my discourse to
other places if I want like high-value
feedback against something now I go to
Cora
and I asked her you know pastor I ask a
question on Quora yeah okay but of
course it's so I mean Cora to me is such
a weird like single so binary it's like
ask a question get responses it's not
really a conversation exactly but it's
not not necessarily a conversation but
if you want high by you feedback it's a
pretty good place to go right so we so
you're just moving that stuff somewhere
else yeah move it there and then you
know if I get I still post things on
Twitter I just don't post intimate
things on Twitter because now my Twitter
feed has become a broadcasting feed and
why might I don't want to display it out
the other you know the other thing that
has sort of here's another inadvertent
side-effect of Twitter that most people
probably don't realize if I go to a
restaurant anywhere in town there'll be
people outside the restaurant waiting
for me outside the restaurant when I
leave the restaurant when I go how did
you know I was here they sell it on
Twitter yeah so the people do like a
search of my name on Twitter and then
they can find exactly where I am at any
given place this is like Gawker stalker
fully raised a little like not awesome
yeah for people yeah all right so let's
I want to talk about I want it I know we
don't have a ton of time I want to get
to this movie you made a small film
about a small topic jobs about Steve
Jobs so I have to ask you does it seem
trying to think the right way to phrase
this it's a pretty big ego kind of an
egotistical move to say I'm gonna play
Steve Jobs in a movie and I think this
is for anybody who plays like a great
sort of great figure from history it
takes a certain amount of ego to be able
to say I can embody this guy or a girl
what what was the what was your thinking
I mean how did this come to be and what
was your thinking when you're like okay
I'm gonna be Steve Jobs in a movie like
how do you wrap your head around that
well first I think it's it's I'm gonna
portray Steve Jobs in movie right I'm
not gonna be Steve Jobs I can't be Steve
Jobs I'm just so far removed from for
this be Steve Jobs but for the purposes
of the movie you've gotta like become
that care well so my decision to
actually take the role was a tough one
in that I have a lot of friends and
colleagues that knew Steve or work with
Steve cared deeply about Steve and you
know I read the script and the character
of Steve in the script you know if
you're gonna tell a true story about
someone you have to tell the good things
about them and the bad things about them
and in it and in certain places and
circumstances some of the things that he
did seemed extremely irrational and in
the when I read it I was like offended
for him right when I read the script
and so I was I I had an immediate
reaction of like well if I play this or
the people that I'm friends with that
knew him gonna be upset about it that
you know I'm trying to sort of balance
two worlds right and also wanting to
defend the legacy of a person I really
admired and I sat third sort of
imagining other people playing it that
didn't have the insights that I had as
to the fact that that yes he was a very
aggressive boss but yes he had like a
98% approval rating from his employees
and and I just imagined somebody else
playing it and not actually taking the
time to fully investigate right him and
who he was and how he was and why he was
the way he was and what he had to
sacrifice to actually make the great
things that we take for granted every
day and and almost felt compelled to
like defensively play the role right
really yeah like I want to attack I want
to make sure that it's protected that
like it's like even if I screw it up and
totally bomb it I love that guy
I love that again personally really yeah
and and so I'd rather have someone that
cared about him screw it up than someone
who didn't that's a really I mean did
not see that answer coming at all so I
kind of a bizarre reason to play a role
that was one - it terrified me and I
found that most of the great things I've
been able to accomplish in my life were
things that terrified me when I took on
when I felt like I was way over my head
on something and I just went for it
anyway and the third thing is it was
kind of the perfect dovetail of my
interest in my craft right yeah because
how many chances as a guy who's really
into tech and investing in it and kind
of living it when you're not doing your
day job as an actor how many
opportunities where you get to play that
kind of role exactly very few and then
the last thing was is it aligned really
closely with with what I feel about the
world right now which is I think people
need to build things and I think that
inspiring entrepreneurs to build really
great things and persevere over so much
challenge in the world I think that
that's what the world needs and and I
mean I wanted to tell a story about a
guy who did that to hopefully inspire
other entrepreneurs to go out and not
just live in the world but actually see
what it is and and and try to build
other things that make it the world that
other people can live in so how hard was
it to be jobs in that movie I mean you
got the walk I mean I got to tell you
guys you know you look really really
similar I mean my wife Laura was who's
also one of our editors was was like Oh
Ashton looks exactly like him if you
look at pictures of Steve Jobs when he's
young and he put them side-by-side in
fact I did I think I did the post when
they announced that you were gonna be in
it and there's a picture of you guys
side-by-side and it's uncanny so you
obviously look alike
you got that walk down that weird walk
which seems like I don't even know how
you do that because it's a you know it's
funny until I saw you in the movie I
kind of didn't think about it but when I
saw it I was like oh yeah that's exactly
how Steve walked the one thing that I
was wondering he hid a really distinct
voice and you have a really distinct
voice
and they're very different was there any
was there any consideration there where
you thought I need to change the way I
sound for this or I need to sound more
like Steve they're really three steps to
the research of Steve wood the first
thing was just like a data collection
thing where I was just read every book
about him and you know just anything I
could get my hands on it was Steve of
video and audio file and anything just
trying to understand get the kind of
whole story about the guy because I
think a lot of the stories that have
been put out there about him don't
always jive with each other and you sort
of go like what this is a little awkward
compared to that and why would he do
that and you know and trying to get that
and then then the second phase of the
research was trying to get to know why
he made the decisions that he made why
he got angry why he got sad why he cried
why he laughed what you know trying to
understand that and I met with a ton of
people that that knew him pretty
intimately to actually try to glean some
understanding of that because more
important at the end of the day then
then you know being exactly like him
from a you know gesture demeanor walk
talk look is to actually capture that
essence of like why he was doing the
things that he was right and then the
last part is kind of like the window
dressing which is the walk and the talk
and the things like that and what I try
to do is find footage of him whether it
was audio file footage or whether it was
video footage or photographs that were
him not in a public setting because he
had to there were two versions of him
and I got this from a lot of friends his
that I talked to there was the guy who
went on stage and presented things and
the guy who went up and gave a speech
and then there was the guy who was in
the boardroom and the guy who was
working on a product and a guy who was
having an intimate conversation and and
I tried to find like little tiny
snippets of stuff where he wasn't aware
that he was being recorded
or speeches that he didn't think other
people were ultimately gonna hear mm-hmm
so I could get a little bit more of who
he and how he honestly was and how we
honestly walked and how he honestly
talked and how he honestly gestured and
all those things and so and that was a
little bit that was hard to find but
once I got a couple things down like the
way he spoke was a combination of I
think he's father and it yeah his father
was from Wisconsin and his mother was
from the Northern California and so it's
kind of a combination of those two yeah
and while I don't have his exact voice I
can drop into it's a little bit more of
an open speaking pattern with a little
bit of a Midwestern Wisconsin act gives
a little bit of that but there's a
little combination he's got a tiny bit
of a list that I picked up from
listening to stuff so I just
I had like probably 20 hours I've liked
a SoundCloud file that I posted I
actually just posted yesterday I posted
this set of like I think to get 15 hours
of Steve just talking giving speeches
and stuff yeah and I we just listened to
it all day long and then gradually start
taking on some of the mannerisms of how
he talked it's interesting because
because it it's funny when he's on stage
he is a pleading almost a pleading
quality to his voice right where he
really is it's intense and it gets
higher and you have and I have heard
music he's a sales
he was a Salesman like when it's funny
when you watch it it's not that
different when he would present him in
stage not that different than what like
like it also got Ron Popeil or like one
of those guys like I'm he was selling
that product yeah and he would take
moments to think he would use the word
and a lot news good and and he used that
moment just to think about what he was
gonna say next
he was actually really slow it's funny
when when an IED liveblog him a bunch of
times and one of the things you notice
is that he speaks really slowly on stage
he gives you a lot of air is slowly very
deliberate exactly and he takes a lot of
time
to think about what he's gonna say that
yeah and each word sounds thoughtful
yeah it's like he's he's really in that
moment thinking about the stuff that
he's saying it's actually it's really
that's a very interesting I mean I guess
what you have you spent enough time
studying him and you start to pick that
up I mean I've spent years like watching
him do his thing
and so I saw a lot of that particularly
the slow that pacing of it made it nice
to do live blogs because when you're
typing furiously and you want to capture
everywhere that somebody says he was one
of the few guys that I knew when he
talked I always get most of it because
he actually was really deliberate and
it's been a and then there were a lot of
like nonverbal things that he did was
like when he would listen to people he
did this like thing where he just would
kind of take in what they were saying
kind of that you know even make you feel
like in an interview he would make you
feel like you were hurt other times
maybe not so much all right seriously
thank you so much appreciate it so there
you have it very interesting guy and you
should definitely check out jobs even if
you've seen pirates of Silicon Valley
they are different films now we've got
one of the things that I want to share
with you something I'm very excited
about next week on the verge we're
starting a new series called small
empires with Alexis Ohanian you may know
Alexis as the co-founder of Reddit he's
also a brilliant and hilarious and
fantastic host and he's gonna be taking
a look at startups in New York City it's
very cool and we've got a clip from the
first episode no one's ever seen it I
haven't seen it so anything could happen
in it take a look at this and we'll be
right back finding a doctor isn't all
see getting an appointment in the timely
manner seems to be even more difficult
than that but there's an app for that
there's not for that there's an app for
that
there's no an app for that dock dock
dock dock dock dock dock dock dock dock
dock dock dock dock dock dock dock dock
dock dock dock dock dock dock dock
you know the great thing about these
apps is that they're in our phone so
they're always with us kind of like our
teachers oh right so what is this three
years running cranes best place to work
in New York three years in the row we've
made the cranes best places to work list
this past year we were in the big
fortune top 50 best places to work in
America list and second year in a row
best place to work in healthcare and so
it's something that we really pride
ourselves on you know we're not lavishly
putting Aeron chairs throughout our
offices etc a lot of our furnitures
refurbished will be bought it that we
got it for free and so it's not about
like how much money we spend on the
actual physical infrastructure of the
space it's really about what we do to
enhance people's lives number-16 best
small places to work in America from
Fortune magazine so who are the other 15
men I don't know
yeah crush them yes and that is it
that's our show
I want to thank Ashton Kutcher the crew
of small empires and Alexis Ohanian
definitely tune into that show next week
here on the verge and of course I want
to thank you the human being that
watched this you didn't have to you did
it
and we created something magical
together that's our show for this week
we'll be back soon and until then there
is no until then</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
