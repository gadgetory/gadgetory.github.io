a lot of people they they feel like if
they have to go see a doctor there
should be like something really wrong
with them write something you know very
manifest very prevalent like something
you can see right off the bat like you
have a broken hand all right but it's
okay you can go to the doctor you have a
broken leg you need stitches you know go
to the doctor but they feel like
something that's internal they kind of
see as a weakness we impulsed I have a
very high rate of depression clinical
depression and then there is this very
big social stigma people don't want to
speak about it people don't want to
mention it people don't want even to
speak about family members will happen
you're in the u.s. we have all races and
nationalities it's sort of a melting pot
which has many benefits that the
university appreciates but it also from
a genetics point of view is a big a big
problem if so much variability from
someone who's from an Asian from a
Jewish from a Middle Eastern from an
African background it's hard to see you
know what's the effect of any one gene
Palestinians have been there for a very
long time and this fact makes them
genetically uniform and the fact that
you can study a genetically informed
population is is a great opportunity in
terms of research you can get rid of any
confounding variable you know and feel
the weight of sad and hopeless anxious
only I talked to my doctor in the US so
many people are on one or more
antidepressant medications you don't
even need to go to a psychiatrist here's
your report that you're sad they'll give
you a prescription for prozac or zoloft
once you have someone that's been on one
or more antidepressants and you're
trying to understand what's going on in
their thinking and reasoning skills you
don't know is it the disease is it the
depression or is it the medication the
quality of life here is I mean it's bad
it's not the best finances are bad so
everything is against people coming back
here if you look at the situation in
Palestine we not only lack basic
facilities for biomedical research but
we also like basic facilities for
clinical care they don't have a lot of
equipment they don't have laboratories
they don't have a lot of brain imaging
research magnets but one thing they do
have is a lot of patients who are
undiagnosed and unmedicated and that's a
gold mine all right I send you all they
do reason a bit of the scripts on our
depression work and I hope that all of
you have
look at that every Monday I'm seventh at
730am New Jersey timing i'm here in the
lab at rutgers to discuss progress on
research discuss scientific topics and
sometimes give lectures all of this
began back in about 2008 with a friend
and a colleague of mine Adele misc who
is the leading Palestinian neurologist
he had told me of his dream to build
neuroscience and neurology and
psychiatry for the Palestinians in the
West Bank looking about the needs of our
societies and our people here in
Palestine we start to build this narrow
sense love bananas University he tried
to recruit some students to work with us
to be the labor and it was very hard
because medical students don't have a
lot of free time and it was very hard to
find any any student willing to work for
free on a project that most of them
thought would go nowhere so we wound up
with three students of those three
initial students in 2008 one of them
turned out to be an absolute superstar
whose dream himself was to be a
neuroscientist but had never seen any
way in which he could do that growing up
in the West Bank I've always wanted to
be a physicist a nuclear physicist
unfortunately that never happened so
after finishing high school I was like
rankings number 73 on the west bank out
of 35,000 students my father is a
professor biochemistry and he was
telling me physics in Palestine is not a
good combo go for something else as an
eager young medical student who wants to
become a researcher there were no
opportunities at all and I kind of
realized that if I want to become a
researcher I should build that on my own
we were like ten students we were
selected from 27 students candidates so
I was the lucky one because I was number
10 ever since I was little I wanted to
like to discover something new and my
name would be remembered after
discovering it that's like my you could
say holy grail or something like that
something i want i entered the medical
school because i believe the most
notable thing you can do is to relieve
patients suffering but when you
understand how really the disease happen
and the aspects that affects you're not
treating an individual but you can this
way you can help the whole society you
have a lot of people from the older
generation and they would tell us why
research people need food or people need
this and people need that they don't
really see the need for science and math
and an education in their their own
countries what we want to is to invest
in people and make sure that we're
investing in people on the long run so
that they can come back to palestine and
help expand the initiative and hopefully
ultimately establish a neuroscience
institute we're not just going outside
to to like pursue a PhD or specialty and
never get back north to get back here
because they know what's going on
clearly by creating even a modest
biomedical research program that's
indigenous that's based at Al codes and
other universities you create a sticky
situation for the student sticky in a
good way meaning that they're more
likely to come back because many of them
would like to be able to both have a
clinical practice be able to pursue
internationally respected research and
yet be within their families and culture
with few natural resources and very
modest space the future of Palestine
cannot be based on politics but rather
the human capital building brainpower to
improve brain health which can turn a
dusty empty dark room four years later
into a room full of energy motivation
and individuals were willing to make a
change and shape the future of Palestine
thank you we faced a lot of skepticism
it we still face a lot of skepticism and
look at it as as an opportunity for us
to know how we can become better they
look at us like you want to do what you
know you know we don't have roads and
when you show them that we have our
collaborators are Harvard University and
Rutgers University all these very well
known universities they ease into the
idea like wow you know these guys
actually they've done something we have
trained around 35 Palestinian medical
students we have published four papers
we have four more under review we don't
like the brains we don't like the
ambition we don't like the available of
a smart people we only want to put
things together and have support of
elite institutions worldwide and thanks
God we had Rutgers to support us in this
regard it doesn't really matter what
people say it doesn't really matter what
people think it only matters what me as
a person or anybody who's doing
something believes in my dad still
thinks I'm crazy but I'm not against the
idea of being crazy because everybody
who achieved something important in
history was crazy
