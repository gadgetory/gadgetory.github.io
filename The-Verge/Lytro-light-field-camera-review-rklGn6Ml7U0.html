the light row it's a digital camera but
it's really unlike any digital camera
we've seen before and a lot of that is
because of the technology inside the
camera it's called light field
technology and what it does is instead
of just measuring the color and the
intensity of the light coming at the
camera it measures the direction the
light is moving to and that allows the
camera to do a lot more processing and a
lot more editing after the fact the
great thing about the LED show is that
you can actually change the focus of a
shot after you take it it takes all of
the light at once and then lets you edit
the focus after you take the picture the
light roll also looks different from any
camera we've ever seen instead of
looking like a rectangular camera it
kind of looks like a retracted telescope
it's about four inches long and it
weighs about eight ounces and there's a
lens on one end and a small display on
the other and that's basically all there
is to the camera part of it is a
rubberized grip with a shutter button
and raised dots that you swipe your
finger along to zoom and there's a power
button on the bottom along with the
microUSB port but other than that it's
just the anodized aluminum body
available in red grey or blue and really
nothing else as good-looking as it is I
can't help but wish it looked and felt a
little more like a regular camera partly
because I would avoid the weird looks
but partly because it's a little awkward
to hold and you never really get used to
the way you're supposed to use the
camera it would be better if it were
more in the style of a camera like the
olympus EP l3 which has small lenses and
this seems like it would mount perfectly
onto a camera like that and be really
usable just with this extra cool
photography feature on top of it the
other problem with the way that the
light show is built now is that the
display on the back is just not very
good it's a small one and a half inch
LCD 128 pixels by 128 pixels and it's
viewing angles are so bad that as soon
as you get off axis it becomes kind
almost negative colored and you can't
really see what's going on and it's
pixelated even in great lighting and it
just makes pictures look bad and hard to
see properly on the bright side the
displays touch screen is actually really
good the interface is super simple
there's a small menu you can drag up
from the bottom of the screen which will
show how much battery or how much
storage you have left on the camera and
you can swipe from right to left to see
your pictures and then double tap to
zoom and you can pan around
and again it's a small screen so the
touch screen isn't full-featured as it
could be but it does work really well
for one particular kind of shot the
light row takes really really cool
pictures if you have a subject close to
you close to the lens and one that's far
away being able to switch the focus back
and forth after the fact is really cool
and it does a really good job of
splitting the focus so that you can
really drastically change when you move
from the front to the back for any
pictures other than that though the
light show really doesn't do that well
and especially in low-light when there's
not a ton of data for the camera to be
collecting it just takes really awful
pictures with a lot of noise and grain
and the focusing effect pretty much
becomes useless a lot of the appeal of
the light row is because there's so much
you can do with the photos after you
shoot them there's a light row desktop
software which is only available for
Macs right now but it's coming for
Windows later this year and you can
import photos in there and then do some
neat things with them once you've
imported your photos the Lytro app is
pretty simple you can group your photos
or organize them into events you can
also tweak the focus of your photos
after the fact until you get them the
way you want and then you can export
them as JPEGs which you can use in other
apps but the JPEGs only come out as 1080
by 1080 which is barely over one
megapixel and is quite small right now
the light row is kind of an odd thing to
review the technology behind it is
really amazing light field photography
definitely feels like it's the future of
photography and part of the advantage of
this camera is that it's actually going
to get better over time we got to see
early builds of things like through a 3d
viewer and perspective shift which
actually changes how the picture looks
as you pan around it based on how you
would move your head that technology is
amazing and it can all be applied by a
software update but for right now light
show feels more like a feature than a
full-fledged camera system it would be
an amazing thing to have in a phone or a
DSLR but for right now if you're going
to buy this it's purely as an add-on to
another camera and this is definitely
not something especially at $399 that
you're going to buy as your only camera
