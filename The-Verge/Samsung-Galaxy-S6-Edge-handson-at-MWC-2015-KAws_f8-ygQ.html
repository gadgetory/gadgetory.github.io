we're taking a look at the new Samsung
Galaxy s6 edge it's an all new device
that utilizes a lot of brand-new things
that Samsung has really never done
before with its mobile devices it's a
complete redesign of Samsung smartphones
it really looks significantly different
than the prior Galaxy s5 or the galaxy
s4 the galaxy s3 which all kind of
looked the same this one's got a really
unique distinctive design primarily
that's because it's a front and rear
glass panels so it's a Gorilla Glass 4
on the front and the back and then it's
got this metal border around it this
metal frame it's a continuation of the
design elements that we've seen on the
note 4 and the Galaxy alpha from last
year but it's taken to a new level it
really does look quite premium and much
better than Samsung's earlier efforts as
you can see here the galaxy s6 edge has
a curvature to it it's on both sides of
the glass for the front here which is
different than the note edge which only
curved on one side it doesn't really
have a different display on the sides
like the note edge it's still using the
same display and it's mostly designed to
make it easier to swipe in from the side
as opposed to run specific apps like the
note edge used for the display itself
it's a 5.1 inch quad HD Super AMOLED
panel it's really bright really vibrant
and Samsung says it works really well
outdoors as well it's a really really
great looking screen I've got the
brightness turned significantly down
here and it's plenty bright and often it
can go all the way up and it will get
very very bright very quickly for
outdoor use below the display is the
HOME key and Samsung still has a
fingerprint scanner in there but unlike
the older models where you had to swipe
the scanner you only have to press down
on it to unlock the phone which is
similar to Apple's touch ID system
inside this particular one is using a
Samsung Exynos processor which will be
used globally Samsung is not confirmed
which processor will be in the US models
but it's an octa-core processor with
64-bit processing it's really fast and
snappy Samsung phones have always used
top-of-the-line processors in the s6
edge is really no different around back
is a new 16 megapixel camera it kind of
has a
a little cutout for the camera module
there it's not flush with the back and
then of course a heart rate sensor LED
flash and IR sensor the new camera is a
lot faster than before a samsung says
it's done a lot of effort to bring up
the speed and the image quality of the
camera compared to its prior models
including the image processing and the
ease of use the s6 edge will come in 32
64 and 128 gigabyte versions there's no
microSD card slot it's got a 2600
milliamp and our internal battery but
the battery is not removable which is a
significant difference from earlier
Samsung models Samsung's incorporating
quick charging features its built-in
wireless charging into the back panel
that's compatible with both PMA and Qi
wireless pads so you can pretty much
charge on almost any wireless charging
pad available and they've also moved the
speaker down to the bottom edge from the
the back samsung says that the speaker
is one and a half times louder than the
speaker on the galaxy s5 now the galaxy
s6 edge will be coming out samsung says
in q2 of this year it's gonna be
launched globally you can expect it to
see on pretty much every carrier around
the world but so far first impressions
it's a pretty nice advancement from
Samsung in terms of design significantly
better than their earlier efforts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
