we trained you to look at the you
samsung galaxy s6 edge it's an army
device that utilizes a lot of brand-new
things that Samsung has really never
done before with its mobile devices it's
a complete redesign of Samsung
smartphones it really looks
significantly different than the prior
galaxy s5 or the galaxy s4 galaxy s3
which all kind of looked the same this
one's got a really unique distinctive
design primarily that's because it's a
front and rear glass panels so it's a
gorilla glass 4 on the front and the
back and then it's got this metal border
around it this metal frame it's a
continuation of the design elements that
we've seen on the note 4 and the Galaxy
alpha from last year but it's taken to a
new level it really does look quite
premium and much better than Samsung's
earlier efforts as you can see here the
galaxy s6 edge has a curvature to it
it's on both sides of the glass for the
front here which is different than the
note edge which only curved on one side
it doesn't really have a different
display on the sides like the note edge
it's still using the same display and
it's mostly designed to make it easier
to swipe in from the side as opposed to
run specific apps like the note edge
used for the display itself it's a 5.1
inch quad HD Super AMOLED panel it's
really bright really vibrant and samsung
says it works really well outdoors as
well it's a really really great looking
screen I've got the brightness turned
significantly down here and it's plenty
bright and often it can go all the way
up and it will get very very bright very
quickly for outdoor use below the
display is the HOME key and Samsung
still has a fingerprint scanner in there
but unlike the older models where you
had to swipe the scanner you only have
to press down on it to unlock the phone
which is similar to Apple's touch ID
system inside this particular one is
using a Samsung Exynos processor which
will be used globally Samsung has not
confirmed which processor will be in the
US models but it's an octa-core
processor with 64-bit processing really
fast and snappy Samsung phones have
always used top-of-the-line processors
and the s6 edge is really no different
around back is a new 16 megapixel camera
it kind of has a
a little jut out for the camera module
there it's not flush with the back and
then of course a heart rate sensor LED
flash and ir sensor the new camera is a
lot faster than before a samsung says
it's done a lot of effort to bring up
the speed and the image quality of the
camera compared to its prior models
including the image processing and the
ease of use the s6 edge will come in 32
64 and 128 gigabyte versions there's no
microSD card slot it's got a 2600
milliamp and our internal battery but
the battery is not removable which is a
significant difference from earlier
Samsung models Samsung's incorporating
quick charging features its built-in
wireless charging into the back panel
that's compatible with both PMA and Qi
wireless pads so you can pretty much
charge on almost any wireless charging
pad available and they've also moved the
speaker down to the bottom edge from the
the back samsung says that the speaker
is one and a half times louder than the
speaker on the galaxy s5 the galaxy s6
edge will be coming out samsung says in
q2 of this year it's going to be
launched globally you can expect it to
see on pretty much every carrier around
the world but so far first impressions
it's a pretty nice advancement from
Samsung in terms of design significantly
better than their earlier efforts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
