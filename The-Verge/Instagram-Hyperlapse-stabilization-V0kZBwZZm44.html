more likely than not you're using a
phone you're literally just holding a
rectangle up in front of your face and
in that position you can't help but have
a little handshake especially when
you're walking we're humans we're shaky
but there's a free app that can take
your shaky footage and make it look
something like a Terrence Malick film
like a shot from the tree life
professional solutions to this shake
problem have come in many forms Trax
jibs cranes crazy vests and um this
but those are all extremely expensive
and also are you really going to attach
your phone to a stabilization rig do you
really want to be this guy no app has
made the verge video team as happy as
hyperlapse
when Instagram released the app earlier
this year the focus was on these really
cool time lapses and don't get me wrong
those are very cool but it has a second
function that's just as interesting
amazing stabilization that turns this
into this shaky shot fixed got the
jitters and they're gone this into this
okay wow this is crazy if you just set
the slider to 1x it plays back your
videos in real time with sounds but
perfectly stabilized basically the app
captures 1080p video but only outputs a
720p file hyperlapse uses data from the
phone's gyroscope along with the excess
footage from run the frame and well math
to remove all that extra wiggle this is
opposed to traditional stabilization
techniques that analyze frames after the
fact without the benefit of knowing how
your hand was moving we even tested it
against our best glide cam operator
Jimmy Shelton this was shot with $10,000
worth of professional equipment in years
of experience and this
this is just a phone
okay here's some tips for the clean
shots make sure you use focus and
exposure lock if you can this keeps it
from flicking through different
exposures a dead giveaway you're on a
phone that just looks bad the effect
works best in bright sunlight as is the
case with most photography if you're too
shaking low light you begin to see weird
blurry throbs and makes it seem like
there's a glitch in the matrix
sure that could be kind of cool in the
right setting and we're really just
scratching the surface here
there's an even more advanced version of
this technology being developed by
Microsoft for example that recreates a
3d environment and reconstructs the
video using different frames at
different times so now instead of having
to use crazy complex contraptions to get
stable shots we can just use our phones
and crazy complex math
