lurking in the distant shadows of our
solar system
it's not out of the realm of possibility
in fact a couple of scientists think
it's basically a certainty at this point
say hello to Planet nine or Planet X
well you can't really say hello to it
because we haven't seen it yet but to
researchers at Caltech mike brown and
konstantin batygin are convinced it's
out there based on the way objects are
moving around at the edge of the solar
system and if it does exist it's a
pretty sizable planet the to estimate
it's about 10 to 12 times the mass of
Earth so kind of like a smaller Neptune
and it orbits way out there at its
farthest from the Sun the planet is
somewhere between 500 and 1200 a use for
reference
Pluto's farthest distance is less than
58 years from the Sun so it's possible
that this planet takes up to 20,000
earth years to complete just one orbit
right now the stranger is mostly going
by the name of planet 9 but not everyone
is keen on that title I don't like I'm
calling it planet 9 astronomer that
discovered Pluto his name clyde tombaugh
he did it in 1930 he was 24 years old
and people had looked for a generation
and nobody could find the planet they
were looking for so the reason I don't
like the term planet 9 went by my count
the next one would be about planet 29 is
it a diminishes clyde tombaugh's legacy
what he did was absolutely an amazing
feat for 20th century astronomy and I
think it's insensitive and a little bit
rude to try to diminish that but Planet
9 is the name that stuck so I guess
we'll go with it for now
anyway the search really gained steam in
2014 when Mike and Konstantin decided to
look at the outer solar system a little
bit more closely they were inspired by
the discovery of a new object of the
Kuiper belt
that's the cloud of icy bodies that
orbits past Neptune the announcement of
this new object called their attention
to the most distant objects in the solar
system these are the ones that take more
than 4,000 years
orbit the Sun they noticed a strange
pattern with six of these far-out
objects including the one that had just
been found they all had common argument
of perihelion don't worry the Kuiper
belt objects aren't in a fight or
anything the argument of perihelion is
this really obscure orbital feature and
it basically means whenever these
objects make their closest approach to
the Sun they're all at the same angle to
a plane of reference that was
immediately strange because this
parameter should basically be random for
each object it was the first indication
that their orbits had been manipulated
possibly by another planet then a closer
look showed even more interesting
similarities all of their orbits lie in
the same plane and they're all kind of
tilted away from the plane of the solar
system by about 20 degrees plus they're
all highly elliptical and swing out from
the Sun in the same direction normally
these objects would trace out randomly
in a flower like pattern it's as if some
thing had arranged these objects so that
they cluster in space together that
something had significant gravitational
influence so the two researchers set out
to figure out what was behind this
strange pattern at first they rejected
the idea that a planet was the culprit
can't just be pulling planets out of
thin air I mean the vacuum of space but
after ruling out all the other
mechanisms that could be causing these
objects to cluster they decided there
was no other explanation except for a
planet set a totally crazy idea either
Neptune was predicted purely through
math in 1846 so inspired by that process
Constantine came up with a model of the
solar system as it evolved over four
billion years you through planet 9 into
this model
sure enough evolved beautifully to the
solar system we see today and since this
first discovery even more objects have
been found in the outer Kuiper belt that
fit this pattern but there are extra
clues that Planet 9 exists two for one
it may be responsible for why the Sun is
tilted for many years now we've known
that the sun's axis is tilted or oblique
by about six degrees in relation to the
rest of the solar system basically all
the planets orbit in
same flat-plane around the Sun but the
Sun looks like it's spinning at a slight
angle in relation to everything else
it's been a long-standing mystery for a
while but the Caltech researchers say
planet 9 could be behind this the
planets gravity has torqued the solar
system out of alignment with the Sun so
basically all of us are the ones that
are tilted then there's another clue a
bunch of objects right next to Neptune
are orbiting the wrong way in the solar
system one recently discovered object
niku is basically perpendicular to the
rest of the solar system and it's going
in the opposite direction of most other
objects konstantin says planet 9 is
responsible for this - it's doing
something called the koozai effect it's
actually tilting the orbits of objects
on their sides and with the help of
Neptune they end up orbiting the Sun in
the wrong direction alright so we have
all this evidence for planet 9 but we
still don't have the smoking gun seeing
the damn thing the Caltech researchers
have been observing the night sky with
Subaru a huge telescope located in
Hawaii the goal is to completely map out
the orbit of the planet so they can
eventually catch it it's a process that
may take a while probably a couple years
and it may be hampered if planet 9 is
orbiting against the backdrop of the
Milky Way
since this planet is so far away from
the Sun it's super faint so it'd be much
harder to see against a bunch of really
bright stars but it's not so ridiculous
to think that this planet might actually
exist
one of the biggest findings from NASA's
Kepler mission is that smaller Neptune's
like planet 9 are very common throughout
the galaxy so having one in our
neighborhood actually makes us pretty
normal konstantin says he's confident
we're going to find it eventually but we
may just have to wait a while that's no
fun in fact Mike Brown is actually
referenced in another video that we did
about what makes a planet a planet
because he's often credited with helping
demote Pluto to a dwarf planet so the
irony here is that he got rid of one
ninth planet and then replaced it with
his own night 2 planet</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
