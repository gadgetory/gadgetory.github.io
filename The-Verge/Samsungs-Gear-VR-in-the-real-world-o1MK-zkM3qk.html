fun little murder mystery game called
dead secret the thing on my head is the
gear VR and unlike the oculus rift or
the HTC vive it the first big virtual
reality headset that people can actually
buy and use
you might notice another difference
there too there are no wires because in
theory the gear VR is totally portable
but is it really I decided to put it to
the test I probably spend more time
playing games on the subway than I do
anywhere else technically I could do the
same thing with the year VR just think
of it as holding the phone really really
close to your face instead of candy
crush I'm checking out a shooting game
called Keegan Jack well in theory I'm
checking it out in reality I'm thinking
about how easy it would be to fall off
the platform or get my bag stolen
commuting is probably the least pleasant
part of the day for lots of people
so escaping it makes sense but virtual
reality isn't really the same as
escaping you're incredibly vulnerable
totally isolated in a crowd and that's
when things work perfectly which they
don't
the thing about VR headsets is that they
can't tell whether your head is moving
because you turned it or because your
whole body is going around a corner
eventually wearing a gear VR in public
just turns into a complicated mind game
everyone could see me but I can't see
them but then I turn on my pass-through
camera and I'm the one secretly watching
them until everybody's wearing headsets
and secretly watching each other at
which point society will probably just
break down I used to do a lot of work in
coffee shops so it makes sense to try to
have a little fun there too I can fire
up the extremely chill puzzle game Lands
End which doesn't require me to use my
hands at all I can just stare at things
to select them which is good because I
don't trust myself to drink this tea and
tap a trackpad at the same time
there
the great thing about coffee shops is
that it's socially acceptable to get
lost in your own world there nobody
thinks you're an a social loser for not
talking to them sure they probably think
I'm weird but it's a polite kind of
weird the bad thing is that coffee shops
are designed for sitting very still
Lands End is a totally 360-degree
experience but I can't actually turn
around
sowhat's otherwise a calm stroll through
a mysterious island is more like an
extremely uncomfortable yoga session the
first year VR was a huge pain to carry
around whatever problems I might have
using the new one outside the office
though it fits in the bags I carry
around every day even if I am constantly
scared of breaking it the only thing I
have to worry about is keeping the
lenses clean because there's nothing
more miserable than playing with a
blurry headset well except maybe for
motion sickness I've had some sort of
bad experiences using headsets and cars
it turns out that if you're making
frequent turns in the car games are
unplayable but if I boot up a 360-degree
movie and decide I just don't care what
I'm looking at it's sort of pleasant
actually it's more than pleasant its
bizarrely comfortable so now we're
putting this to the ultimate test which
is just doing circles around a parking
lot so this is like the worst situation
you could be in with a car
what I think is more interesting is I'm
actually more motion sickness right now
yeah I'm you're I'm really motion sick
everybody else in this car is incredibly
motion sick scientifically I have no
idea what is going on but I'll take it
it's reasonable to expect that I can't
play VR headset perfectly when I'm on
the train or in a car but what if I just
want to sit at home what if I don't even
want to play games just watch a VR movie
so I'm gonna watch waves of grace I'm
watching a progress bar it's a really
immersive progress bar the really
awkward thing about this just waiting
for it to load is that one of the things
I really like to do on couches is drink
is there whiskey over here right now
okay it's 3 p.m.
thank you I feel the dimensions of this
glass
yes unfortunately now everything's
happening behind me so this is the big
problem with the gear VR it's an
entertainment product that can't do the
one thing we expect from entertainment
products that they'll be there when we
get off work and want to relax
it requires totally rethinking the way
we fit games and movies into our lives
so how about the other end of the
spectrum how about I pick the absolute
nightmare scenario for people who think
we'll replace the best parts of the real
world with VR like say finding a park
with a beautiful view of the Brooklyn
waterfront going there just before
sunset and completely ignoring it the
really funny thing is that I think a
flight game is actually the absolute
best idea because I can feel the wind on
my face it's actually really
fantastically immersive the nice thing
about this game is that it's really
pretty it has that sort of low poly
aesthetic the big lesson from the gear
VR is that it's not actually very good
overriding reality in Neuromancer
cyberspace is called a consensual
hallucination and that's exactly what
the gear VR offers it gives you a
wonderful illusion if you put a lot of
work into keeping it up is that the sign
of a good entertainment system not
really
but until we get something better it's
at least a chance to live out some
real-life science fiction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
