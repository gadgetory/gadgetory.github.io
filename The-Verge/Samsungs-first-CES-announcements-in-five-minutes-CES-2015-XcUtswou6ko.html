start with TVs half of our UHD TV sales
are now curved TVs proving that
consumers clearly see the value of the
immersive curved TV experience so now
let's talk a little bit about 2015 our
connected world is giving us incredibly
rich experiences and generating more
data than ever before the portable
Samsung portable SSD t1 it's smaller
than a business card and has a terabyte
of capacity to hold thousands of files
Samsung's milk is another great example
and we're proud to announce that in 2015
we're expanding milk music and milk
video to samsung smart tvs let me
introduce you to milk vr this exclusive
service provides a daily stream of
360-degree videos which will make gear
VR they must have please welcome to the
stage david alpert executive producer of
Skybound entertainment's the walking
dead vr allows us to get really creative
and it's a great marker of what we are
learning with Samsung to create a
mystery suspense thriller entirely in VR
milk vr is available for download right
now from the oculus store on the Samsung
gear VR we're launching with 30 new
titles and we will deliver new content
daily ladies and gentlemen welcome to
the era of su HD this new era starts
without groundbreaking 88 inch j/s 9500
Samsung's first su HDTV our su HD is
also two and a half times brighter than
conventional TVs
and has deeper blacks which deliver
unrivaled contrast its spectacular color
technology gives viewers 64 times the
color expression of conventional TVs
please welcome the founder of fuse
project award-winning industrial
designer and branding agency director
Yves Behar we designed a new samsung TV
around that thin curved blade it's so
sculptural we looked at this television
not as a consumer electronic but as a
piece of fine craftsmanship the base
provides the intelligence it really that
makes a screen you know do extraordinary
things like move towards the viewer for
example this fantastic transformation
happens as soon as a TV is switched on
and the cube provides amazing sound as
well it's a design that enhance this
technology to an art form and I hope you
like it so consumers they want their TVs
to look great obviously but they also
want them to be smart so let me turn
over the stage to Samsung's executive
vice president for service business mr.
wanjin Lee all samsung smart tvs
including our su HDTV will be powered by
the Tizen operating system and our new
Smart TV is great for modern homes
because Samsung quick connect instantly
linked up devices to your TV let's say
you're watching a movie on your Galaxy
phone during the commute home at the
press of a button you can continue
watching on your Smart TV samsung smart
tv offers total entertainment of course
including games moving on line up
PlayStation now allows you to stream
blockbuster games without a console
introducing the Omni directional sound
experience unlike traditional
loudspeakers that beam sounds straight
ahead like a flashlight
these products deliver sound that's more
like a light bulb filling the room
evenly our vision for home appliances
over the past year was to inspire and
excite consumers across every category
today we're taking this great product to
the next level with the introduction of
dual door the dual doors unique design
allows you to access the top or bottom
sections with just one door in laundry
did it today we're introducing active
wash designed to save you time and make
doing laundry easier active wash is also
our first top loader to feature
SuperSpeed technology which reduces the
wash time for a normal load to as little
as 36 minutes finally today I'd like to
show you a revolution in vacuuming the
power about VR 9000 coming to the US
this spring delivers up to 60 times
stronger suction power than other
robotic vacuums one of its coolest
features is a handy remote to point it
where to go and I just want to thank you

time at CES and have a great 2015 thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
