you are looking at the motorola atrix HD
on AT&amp;amp;T it's essentially a tease take on
the droid razr from verizon but there
are a few key differences like the razor
it's quite thin with a kevlar back and a
big ol hump on the top the razor sharp
edges have been smoothed out here though
which in my opinion makes for kind of a
bland look but i guess that is fitting
with the atrix lines the whole it has a
fairly large bezel around the screen
which is 4.5 inches diagonally however
it's a 720p display using LCD instead of
AMOLED which means text is really sharp
and viewing angles are pretty impressive
the age of 60 is running Android 4.0 and
actually Motorola has done a remarkable
job holding itself back when it comes to
software customizations like the Galaxy
Nexus it uses on-screen buttons for back
home and multitasking and most of the
stock apps are pretty much completely
untouched one neat thing that Motorola
did is they took some of these stock
icons and had them do dual duty in
addition to launching their apps some of
them you can swipe up to open our
related widget like favorites or agenda
or recent text messages in a pop-up
window Motorola's circles widget is also
pretty neat it shows the time recent
text messages lets you toggle weather
for different cities and even shows
battery life and data usage Motorola
also kept its best recent software
innovation on board it's called Smart
Actions that lets you automate certain
features of the phone based on your
location calendar entries and more
unlike the last 28 reese's Motorola
hasn't kept the webtop software for its
lapdock however I did try plugging it in
and it does do straight HDMI mirroring
so if you happen to have a laptop lying
around you can still get some use out of
it the atrix HD is powered by a Qualcomm
s4 Snapdragon processor clocked at 1.5
gigahertz and in my testing I found it
be pretty fast but not quite as fast as
more expensive phones it only has eight
gigabytes of internal storage too but
there is a microSD card slot for
expansion I found the camera to be a
little disappointing with flat colors
and most of my shots and fairly niemiec
shooting options but you can set the
volume button to toggle the shutter if
you like to do that interest HD is only
99 99 on a two-year contract for AT&amp;amp;T
and at that price it's quite the
overachiever well it's still not quite
as good as either the HTC One X or the
samsung galaxy s3 it's half the price if
you're looking for an LTE phone on 18 t
this is close to stock
as possible the unassuming atrix HD
isn't a bad bet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
