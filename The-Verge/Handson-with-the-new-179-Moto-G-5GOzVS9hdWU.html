here in new york city at the motorola
vent and we're here with a new moto g
the 2015 model this is the company's
most popular smartphone the Moto X is
the flagship but this is the one people
buy more often because of its price the
new model is going to be 179 for an 8
gigabyte model and then you can also get
a 16 gigabyte model for 219 you can
order online at best buy amazon motorola
right now and you can customize moto g
through moto maker for the first time
there are 10 different batches to choose
from and you can also buy five different
colored shells so the film feels a lot
more premium than the last model you've
got metal here on the back and it's
plastic sides but it feels very durable
so the new Moto G is water resistant up
to 3 feet for up to 30 minutes long so
it can take a dive in the pool and on
the inside they've got micro SD cards
for putting cards up to 32gb size so you
can have quite a bit of storage you're
not have you with the 8 or 16 18 body so
the camera here is based on the same
woman in the Nexus 6 which costs a lot 1
money
motorola says they made some
improvements here and this is a really
fine camera but for what you paid moto
jen has a pretty stellar camera and shot
and upfront you've got a 5 megapixel of
selfie cam as well so that's there and
it's wide angle which is nice fit in
quite a bit so the Moto G ships with
android 5.1 point 1 just the most recent
version and it's got all of my roles
usual software customizations and
enhancements moto display no to assist
all the great stuff you'd expect that's
in the Moto X but also here as well so
you can see why the Moto G is so popular
it's a great value for the money and we
expect this model to be just as popular
if not way more so than the previous
models you've seen already</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
