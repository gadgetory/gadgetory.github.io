taking a look at the new ZTE axon M
which is a pretty standard smartphone
it's a five point two inch full HD
display it's running a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 820 one processor four gigs
of RAM it's got a 20 megapixel camera
all that stuff is pretty standard but
what makes the X on em unique is that
this doesn't have just one display it
actually has two and you can see this
big hinge here opens up and boom it's
now a tool screen phone so this has got
two 5.2 inch displays which you can do
some pretty interesting things with you
can hit the M button here and you can do
a mirror load like I'm doing now so
anything I do on the one screen is going
to be reflected on the second screen
which you can use for a couple of
different things you can tint it like so
and put it between two people that watch
the same video or play a game or share
presentation or something like that
another mode is an obvious one is the
extended mode which just basically
stretches the screen over so if you are
wanting to make full use of the screen
you can run an app across both of them
you can rotate it and use it in this
mode for watching video if you're on
YouTube you can then watch a video and
scroll through the comments section
below it's all pretty cool and then that
can rotate as well and then the other
mode is with an a/b mode that is labeled
here in the software and essentially you
can run two apps at the same time so if
you've got your phone app open and you
your Facebook app open at the same time
these are both kind of using androids
split-screen functions to be able to run
more than one app at the same time you
can then do certain things with special
apps so like this is Google slides which
if you are looking at a presentation
here you can use a gesture to push it
over to the other screen and then
continue to open essentially running two
instances at the same time the CTE says
this works with a lot of apps mainly
from Google that allow you to do this
kind of thing and they plan to add more
gestures and functionality to move texts
and objects between two different apps
here but it's kind of thing that lets
you take a better advantage of androids
built-in split-screen functions that
we've seen on other phones where it kind
of just divides the screen and half now
that you've got two screens you got
twice as much space to work with if you
are in the stretch download here apps
will use by default their tablet
interface so you get a little bit more
screen space you can scroll through
various things and see them a little see
more information about them better on a
larger display then you might if it's
just on one screen which is pretty
standard and ZTE says this just uses
allows apps to use their tablet
interface there's really nothing that a
developer has to do ZTE is offering some
tools for developers once this launches
to be able to optimize their apps and be
able to use the gestures to swipe
different things but right now most apps
will run just fine on these two screens
just like they would on one one of the
more interesting things that you can do
is run two videos at the same time so if
you're watching a video on YouTube pull
that back up and then over here will say
open up something on DirecTV you can
actually stream two things at the same
time it'll keep streaming both videos in
the background so even if you have audio
playing out of one the other one will
continue going so and then you can
switch between them on the fly so if
you're watching two sports games at the
same time and you want to keep up with
two different games you can do that
right here on your phone which is pretty
neat and you could do that anywhere you
have a signal basically you don't
necessarily have to be at home to be
watching more than one game at once
which is pretty cool one of the other
unique things is using the camera on
this
viously since it has a screen on both
sides it doesn't have room to mount a
camera on the back of the phone so that
the xnm has a single 20 megapixel camera
and when you launch it by default it
will show you the selfie mode in this
mode and if you switch the camera around
it basically tells you to flip the whole
phone over to use it like you would a
standard camera so as you flip the phone
over you switch between selfie and rear
camera modes and then it's a basically a
20 megapixel camera similar to what you
might find on other acts on phones this
is the first product in this line up
from ZTE and the company says that it's
going to be a platform going forward
it's not designed to replace their other
phones the axon lineup is still gonna
exist with the single screen but this
axon M is kind of the first of its
dual-screen efforts and it's going to
have more in the future
and be able to do more things with it as
time goes on and as more develop it
becomes we expect this to launch on AT&amp;amp;T
here in the US before the end of this
year it's also going to be coming to
DoCoMo in Japan before the end of this
year and then it's also planning to
launch in Europe and other parts of Asia
in next year's timeframe we don't have
an exact price yet but you can probably
expect it to be about a premium price
phone considering its specs and
performance so there you go that's a
real quick look at the ZTE axon M for
