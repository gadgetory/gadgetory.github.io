or your pocket was designed by an
American Korean or maybe even a
Taiwanese company but a handful of
companies are looking to change that and
make names for themselves in the West
with competitive devices at bargain
prices the most well-known Charlie's
companies in the West have been huawei
and ZTE but neither has been very
successful in breaking into the
mainstream high-end smartphone markets
in the US and Europe but elbow and its
recent offshoot 1 plus are taking a
different tack instead of trying to
buddy up with carriers they are selling
their phones unlocked direct to Western
consumers oboes new find 7a and the 1+1
are strikingly similar from the outside
in fact apart from slightly different
button placements the only difference is
between the two phones are the software
that they run and the prices that they
solve for both phones are nerds dream in
terms of specs they have 5.5 inch 1080p
displays current quad-core processors
support for European and American LTE
networks 13 megapixel cameras and clean
plastic designs with solid build quality
the 499 dollar fine 78 runs oppose
custom version of Android dubbed color
or less based on Android 4.3 color OS is
a heavily modified version of the
platform similar to HTC Sense or
Samsung's TouchWiz virtually everything
about the software has been touched by
opposed designers and looks
significantly different than what comes
out of google's software labs oppo
software design feels a bit heavy-handed
more often than not but it doesn't seem
to affect the find 7 days performance
and it's not nearly as ugly as some of
the custom interfaces that we've seen
from other manufacturers conversely the
299 dollar 1+1 is the second phone on
the market to run cyanogenmod out of the
box cyanogenmod is a very lightly
tweaked version of google's vision for
Android and its software looks and
behaves very similarly to a nexus 5
there are a few more customization
options with cyanogenmod and the one
plus is a custom lock screen but for the
most part it's a stock Android
experience but what's most impressive
about the find 7a and the oneplus is the
level of quality that they're offering
at hundreds of dollars less than other
more popular smartphones with the
exception of Google's Nexus series and
perhaps Motorola's Moto X lower-cost
phones have typically offered inferior
screens slower processors lousy cameras
and cheap build quality but that's not
the case at all with these two which
have great-looking high-resolution
displays impressive camera performance
so speed and batteries that can last all
day and more and the build quality on
either phone is better than even some of
the most popular phones available today
there's still a few things that will
likely hold the fine 7a and the oneplus
one back from really taking the market
by storm they are rather monstrous and
impossible to use with one hand and the
average consumer in the US isn't likely
to order a phone online sight unseen
from a manufacturer that they've never
heard of but buying habits are changing
and as more customers in the US make it
worthwhile to purchase a phone out of
contract instead of taking a subsidy
Chinese manufacturers are poised to
capitalize on that opportunity after all
when there's a price difference of
nearly four hundred dollars between the
oneplus one and another high-end Android
phone what would you choose</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
