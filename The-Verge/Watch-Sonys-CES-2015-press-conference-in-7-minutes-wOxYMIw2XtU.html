Cosmo he died I just wanted to spend a
couple minutes because I think it'd be
miss if I didn't mention Sony Pictures
Entertainment and of course the comedy
movie the the interview I think that all
Sony Pictures Entertainment former
employees and certainly current
employees they were unfortunately the
victim of one of the most vicious and
malicious cyber attacks that we've known
certainly in recent history but I have
to say that I'm very proud of all the
employees and certainly the partners
that we've worked with as well who stood
up against some of the extortionist
efforts of the criminals that actually
attacked Sony Pictures and I have to say
that freedom of speech freedom of
expression freedom of association those
are very important lifeblood lifelines
of Sony and our entertainment business
at Sony
we spent the past year emphasizing and
talking to everybody about what drives
us as a company and those of you who
have followed our conversations really
know that Sony's deep desire is to
deliver products and also experiences
that are both technologically innovative
but also emotionally moving and Sony's
sensing technology has the potential to
offer critical support to automobile
manufacturers seeking to provide better
advanced drive assistant system
or 8s as we call it the short now our
concept which we call life space UX
brings a new way to enjoy audio and
visual content by eliminating completely
a need for conventional displays and
casings and animating and illuminating
the walls lights and sometimes these the
ceilings of your home another concept
and we call that the symphonic light
speaker this innovative product allows
your favorite music to flow from a
beautiful lamp fixture the sound
radiates outward in all directions now
since I became CEO of Sony back in April
of 2012 we've continued to accelerate
our transformation efforts becoming more
focused and driven I have been committed
to putting Sony on a course for future
growth in fiscal 2015 and beyond let me
introduce some categories where we're
already seeing some promising results

more than 4.1 million units during this
holiday season and the total sell
through has now reached more than
eighteen point five million units since
its launch

fasulo the real showstopper at this
year's show is our X 900 C series 4k TV

point to pinch it is the world's
thinnest LCD TV and even slimmer than
our Xperia smartphone and all of our
2015 bravia 4k television series bring
you the best viewing experience possible
by upgrading the picture quality of
everything you view whether broadcast
download screen or playback and the key
to this is our new 4k processor we call
