been about more more screen more battery
more specs more power more features and
the new note 9 is the most more of them
all it has the biggest screen fastest
processor the biggest battery the most
storage and the most features of any
note phone and also is the biggest price
this thing costs $1000 and up and it's
way more than any prior mainstream
Samsung phone so is all of this more
stuff worth it well if you're a note fan
or someone that's owned a prior model
yeah totally this is the device you've
been asking for and wanting you don't
even really need me to tell you that you
probably already know you want this
thing but for the rest of us it's a much
tougher sell especially since Samsung's
other big phone this year the Samsung
Galaxy S 9 plus can be had for hundreds
of dollars less and offer many of the
same features the note 9 doesn't look
much different from last year's Note 8
it has the same basic design of the past
few note models there's lots of screen
curved glass on the front and back and a
metal frame this time there's a six
point four inch screen which is just
barely basically indistinguishably
bigger than the screen on the note 8 but
in a cool twist the note 9 isn't really
bigger as a phone it's still the same
size as the node 8 though it's still a
massive phone and then the other thing
is Samsung moved the fingerprint scanner
on the back to a much easier position to
reach so it is easier to hold now I
don't really have much to say about the
note 9 displays just like the S 9 plus
it's a big bright colorful OLED screen
that's about the best you can get in the
smartphone world right now and if you
hate the trend of notches that cut into
the screen the note 9 is 18 by 9 panel
has no notch whatsoever now in terms of
performance and specs the note 9 is
basically the same as the S 9 plus it
has the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 845
processor that every other Android
flagship phone is using this year and
it's paired with 6 or 8 gigabytes of RAM
now the no tonight's performance is
smooth and fast never did I really run
into an issue where there was choppy
performance or lag or even an app not
being ready for me as soon as I expected
it
and one of the more things that you get
with the note is more storage
the base model has 128 gigabytes but you
can get one with up to 512 gigabytes if
you're ok with spending 1,250 bucks for
it either of those models also have a
micro SD card slot so you can max this
thing out with up to one terabyte of
storage if you really want to but the
most more that you get with the note 9
is more battery Samsung put a four
thousand milliamp hour battery in this
phone that's 500 milliamp hours more
than the s9 plus and a full 700 million
hours more than the note 8 that really
makes it an all-day device even if
you're a really heavy user that's always
looking at your phone if you're not as
heavy of a user you might even get two
or three days of use without much
trouble and of course because this is a
note phone the other difference between
it and every other Samsung phone is its
S Pen Stylus now the S Pen has been
around for years and it can be used for
all the same things that you do before
you can jot down notes or doodle or just
use it to navigate the interface but
this year it's got a couple more tricks
it has bluetooth added to it so you can
use as a wireless remote to snap photos
pause music or page through a
presentation now personally that really
doesn't make the s-pen all that much
more usable to me but for you you
probably already know whether the s-pen
is something you're interested in using
at this point or not no ties camera is
also exactly the same as what we saw in
the s9 plus earlier this year the rear
camera has a dual 12 megapixel system
with switching aperture wide angle lens
plus a telephoto lens for portrait
effects and then the front cameras 8
megapixels and autofocus the pictures
that the nolan produces are therefore
very similar to what you get from the SI
and they're sharp and colorful and
low-light performance is great but they
still look like Samsung photos so
they're gonna be warmer and brighter
than what you get from a pixel or an
iPhone so if you didn't like the way
that Samsung photos looked before you
probably won't like the note nines
either one thing that's new in the
camera app is it's a bit smarter it has
an automatic scene optimization system
that of course uses AI to determine what
you're taking a picture of and then
change the camera settings for the best
results there's like 20 different things
that can recognize and it's pretty neat
to watch it do it but if I'm really
being honest I didn't know it's much of
a difference between this optimized ones
and then not
nice ones but one thing that is new and
useful is it can tell us someone that
you're taking a photo of has blinked or
moved and the image is kind of ruined
and it will alert you to take that photo
again that's something that's actually
useful when it shows up for software the
note 9 is running Android 8.1 Oreo and
it's got Samsung's user interface on top
of it it's not really changed much from
what we've seen from past few years from
Samsung it looks fine but the biggest
issue is and always has been Samsung's
insistence on duplicating a bunch of
googles apps with its own there's two
browsers to email apps to mobile payment
apps to gallery apps to assistants and
so on
and then of course Samsung's really bad
with software updates I have no idea
when this is getting Android 9pi and
then there's Bixby's Samsung's
universally panned virtual assistant
which has been updated with a new
interface and some deeper integrations
with third-party services but it's still
Bixby which means that it's slow and
more cumbersome to use in Google's
assistant and of course there's a
dedicated button on the side of the note
9 that can't be used for anything else
now the version of Bixby that's on my
review unit is said to be non final so
maybe update it before it hits stores
but I honestly don't think it's gonna
make much of a difference it's clear
that Samsung has invested some time into
this though and Bixby's not going
anywhere and finally we have Dex
Samsung's attempt to make your phone
work as a computer and it's easier to
get Dex up and running with the note 9
you basically just need a USB C to HDMI
adapter but it's still just as clumsy to
use as it was a year or so ago when Dex
first came out it's slow it's limited
there's many assets are still
incompatible with it and to really make
this work you need a keyboard mouse and
display to do it all which at that point
you might as well just use a laptop so
there's the note 9 it's the most more
phone from the line of phones it always
gives you more than others it's really a
great phone there's a very little
complaint about here if you need more
screen more storage and more battery
life you can't go wrong so long as
you're willing to spend more to get
those things but Samsung's own Galaxy S
9 plus offers a lot of the same features
as Dino
for a lot less money which means that
you really have to want the most for the
note 9 to make sense that's 500 milliamp
hours more than the s9 + battery and a
full seven hundred milli amp hours more
than no 8 that makes the note 9 a real
all-day device even if you're a heavy
user that's been listening to crickets
