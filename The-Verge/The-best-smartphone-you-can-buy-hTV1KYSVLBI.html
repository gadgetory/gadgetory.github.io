really five things you need to pay
attention to battery life camera app
ecosystem design and software every
phone does the basics well they make
phone calls they send text they browse
the web and you really can't get a bad
smartphone anymore but what if you want
the best phone
if you want to buy a phone you know
you'll be happy with and just not worry
about it anymore
you should buy an iPhone 5s it's just
the best all-around smartphone on the
market it's beautifully designed a
little metallic rectangle of a thing
that scuffs pretty easily but is both
sturdy and handsome it screens small by
today's standards yes if you want bigger
than a 4-inch screen you're better off
looking elsewhere but the screen is high
resolution viewable outdoors and
generally every bit as good as it needs
to be two things really set the 5s apart
its camera and its eco system the 8
megapixel camera is the most consistent
sharpest simplest smartphone camera
you'll find other phones offer cool
features the iPhone doesn't but there's
just nothing that matches its picture
quality and ease of use and then there's
the App Store filled with hundreds of
thousands of great camera apps games
productivity tools and pretty much
anything else you can think of sure
every platform has Twitter and Facebook
and Angry Birds but iOS gets the best
apps first and it gets great apps that
no other platform ever sees and that's
all not to mention the huge ecosystem of
speakers Doc's Apple TVs and cases that
only fit the iPhone it may not be
perfect in every respect but if all you
want is a phone that you know you'll
love that you'll never have to worry
about you should buy a 5s but what if
you don't want an iPhone what if you
want a big screen or really killer
battery life that's when you should take
a long look at the new HTC One it's one
of the best design phones I've ever seen
a truly beautiful object it's big big
enough to be hard to use in one hand but
it's just gorgeous it is a 5-inch 1080p
screen that's easily among the best on
the market it is a battery that lasts a
day and a half without trying very hard
and it has one of the better
customizations of Android you'll ever
find
it has great speakers too and seriously
it's just beautiful the one has just a
single big compromise the camera it does
a nice job taking pictures in low light
since HTC uses big pixels to take
deceptively well lit shots and dark
rooms but the photos just don't look as
good as I'd like it has some neat
features and a second lens that lets you
sort of refocus your shots after the
fact but pictures just aren't what I
want them to be in anything but the most
ideal situation it doesn't hold a candle
to the iPhone if you do want an Android
phone that takes great pictures you have
a couple of options
there's the Samsung Galaxy s5 which has
a 13 megapixel camera that takes goodbut
unspectacular pictures pretty much all
the time actually everything about the
s5 is good but
spectacular it has a good screen some
useful software features and great
battery life and it's waterproof which I
really like but it has a plasticky
design which is better than last year's
s4 but still not exactly attractive and
it's still too full of overbearing and
unnecessary software and bloopy sound
effects to really be a great enjoyable
device
there's nothing terrible about the s5
except maybe the design but there's
really nothing to be all that excited
about either I like the Nexus 5 - it
feels a little more expensive than some
other phones even though it isn't and I
like that it comes with pure
unadulterated Android but it's battery
life and camera can be spotty at times
and there are some dangers with things
like customer service when you buy a
phone directly from Google if you're a
picky purist you won't want anything
else but most people can probably get a
little more for their money those really
aren't one-size-fits-all different
things work better for different people
the best example is probably the Samsung
Galaxy Note 3 it's huge with a 5.7 inch
screen it's too big for your average
skinny jean and for your average
customer but if you want a big phone or
you want stylus support don't even
consider another phablet Samsung
invented this kind of phone and it's
still King on a similar note if all you
want is crazy insane outrageous battery
life you want to splurge for the
Motorola Droid Maxx I don't like much of
anything about the way this phone is
designed but in the last two days in
Venza now for a slightly smaller phone
the Moto X is designed to be a
straightforward iPhone competitor simple
software easy to use easy to understand
its problem is that has slightly
outdated specs that are only going to
become more outdated over the course of
your two-year contract it's a good phone
for basic users and I love the ability
to customize it but you might find
yourself wanting a little more honestly
that's really the end of the list of
phones you should consider you might
find yourself looking at a Windows Phone
like the Lumia icon with Lumia 925 but
even though those have good cameras and
hugely improved software thanks to
Windows Phone 8.1 they still don't have
the app selection or general performance
that the best Android and iOS devices do
and if you're looking at a blackberry
well you either desperately need a
physical keyboard or you shouldn't be
buying a blackberry
honestly though no matter what you leave
the store with you can leave knowing you
bought a phone that will do just about
everything you absolutely need it to
where you're choosing among is the
details which design do you like best
would you rather have a killer screen or
a big battery or a great camera do you
like iOS or Android better for my money
the iPhone 5s is an easy choice it may
not be the best in every cat
but it's the best smartphone you can buy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
