dollars to get a good even usable
smartphone but that's far from true
anymore
now there are a ton of great phones
below that price and you can even find
some great phones bloke $300 I've been
testing a bunch of them and one stands
out clearly above the rest and it's only
250 bucks
that's the Moto G 6 first thing the Moto
G 6 does not look like a $200 phone and
I actually find that strikes one of the
best balances between shape and size out
there the phone is a 5.7 inch full HD
display with an 18 by 9 aspect ratio
that nearly fills the front of the phone
it's a really great size if you're like
me and read a ton of articles on your
phone an hour browsing Twitter and the
web all the time on top of that is just
a really good screen now it is an OLED
so you don't have those perfect blacks
that you'd get from a top-of-the-line
phone and it's not always on but I
really like the color tuning on this
phone and I even like it better than my
own pixel - which cost merely twice as
much the colors look both richer and
more accurate to my eyes the phone also
has this nice curve on both back edges
and it isn't too wide so even though you
have this big screen it's actually
really easy to hold and doesn't look or
feel like a big phone model it doesn't
change Android too much either and
that's a good thing this is very close
to stock and we're motorola it does make
changes they're anywhere from
inconsequential like a gesture to shrink
the screen down for one-handed use to
slightly helpful like an option to keep
the screen on while you're looking at it
and if you don't like those changes you
can actually turn all of them off which
is great software performance is about
as good as you're gonna get in this
price range in general I didn't run into
any issues when using this phone
day-to-day scrolling is smooth and apps
and web pages loaded quickly
I suspect that over time it probably
won't stay as fast as a more expensive
phone but right now it's smooth and
snappy and that is not something every
other sub $300 phone can say the one
major downside of this phone is its
cameras the rear camera is slow to fire
so I sometimes miss shots and while you
can get nice images out of it when
you're in bright daylight darker
settings deliver mushy or noisy photos
the front-facing camera isn't much to
get excited about
now you can't really get a better camera
than this without spending a lot more
but it's still disappointing that you
have to forego quality on what firm
myself and a lot of other people is a
key part of a phone there are a bunch of
other little things that I love on this
phone for one it has a headphone jack
everybody loves that it also you charges
over USB C which is easy to use the
micro USB and a lot more modern pretty
much every other phone at this price is
still on micro USB the g6 also has a
fingerprint sensor it's on the front
instead of the back which is not my
favorite position but I got used to it
and you can even take advantage of the
sensor by using it to control the entire
phone with gestures that lets you remove
androids on-screen buttons and free up
screen space aside from a few flaws like
the camera there's very little lacking
on this phone that separates it from
something twice its price which is
pretty incredible
like I said performance will probably be
a longer-term issue but there are no
problems as it stands today now if
you're in China or India you do have a
lot of other options at this price point
from companies like Jami and Oppo but
many of those phones aren't available in
the US and the other budget phones that
do make it to the US just don't hold up
they're often missing key features like
a fingerprint sensor or support for 5
gigahertz Wi-Fi both of which the g6
hats motorola also sells two other
variants of the g6 the g6 play which
cost fifty dollars less and the g6 plus
which cost fifty dollars more the GCS
plus is a slightly better camera and is
a bit faster but it's a little bit
bigger in a way that I don't like quite
as much the $200 g6 play is a bit slower
and thicker with the worst screen but I
got its battery to last me through three
days which is pretty amazing so if
you're looking even cheaper that's worth
considering but by far I think the best
choice below $300 is the regular moto g6
it doesn't just check all the right
boxes actually impresses on a lot of
them and every time I pick up the g6 I'm
surprised if just how good a budget
phone can be hey thanks for watching if

really love the video they just put up
