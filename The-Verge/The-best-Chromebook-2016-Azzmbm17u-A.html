complete back to basics computers that
show how much you can get without
actually spending that much if you're
looking for a cheap computer right now
this is the first place you should look
but not all Chromebooks are created
equal and some are pretty bad so we
tried out a ton of them to figure out
which is the best here's the deal a
great Chromebook is three things first
it has to have a good screen something
you'd be okay with working on for hours
second has to be relatively cheap you
want to spend right around $300 and
third has to be able to handle a lot of
tabs without choking up there's one
phone book that hits all three of those
marks it's the one that I'd recommend to
most people looking to buy one that's
the Acer Chromebook
or 11 I really like the r11 it has this
white chunky body that almost looks like
a kid's toy but it's pretty light and
sturdy so you're not going to have a
problem throwing this in your bag and
toting it around to a coffee shop it has
an 11.6 inch touchscreen display which
is bright and clear and it's not going
to hurt your eyes which is legitimately
an issue on other Chromebooks it also
has a great keyboard solid trackpad and
enough battery life to get through most
of my workday plus the price is spot-on
at 279 there are 11 has been a pretty
great performer for me too I've been
able to handle well over a dozen tabs on
this thing without any issue it doesn't
get the regular lock ups that other
Chromebooks seem to have all the time
here's the other big thing the r11 is
one of the first Chromebooks to support
Android apps the screen flips around so
you can use it like a tablet or you can
prop it up I sort of just like to use it
as a normal laptop and then tap on the
screen every now and then when it makes
sense but it's really nice having the
option there now you may have noticed
that I didn't say the r11 has the best
screen or the best performance or the
best price or size that's because it's
not the best in any one particular area
but does have the best combination of
all of those things every other
Chromebook has one or two serious flaws
but the r11 is the only one that does a
great job all across the board now if
you don't think you're going to need a
touchscreen there's one other Chromebook
you should know about
it's a little bit bigger a little bit
more powerful and a little bit more
expensive
that's the Dell Chromebook 13 this is
one heck of a Chromebook it is one of
the best screens out there excellent
battery life and great performance it's
better than our eleven on all of those
counts and with this 13-inch display
I actually think would be great for
someone who wants a Chromebook primarily
for use around the house but there are a
few big downsides the first is its price
its 429 dollars which is a little
expensive for a Chromebook second is
it's kind of big and bulky I definitely
wouldn't want to carry us around all the
time
and the third thing is if you do want a
touchscreen upgrading this gets way too
expensive to bother with it's just not
worth it now not having a touchscreen
might not be a problem for you
especially if you're just gonna be
browsing the web but keep in mind that
for Android apps it's a really great
option to have of course there are a lot
of other Chromebooks out there including
some other good ones if you want
something a little bit smaller and more
portable
I really like the asou scrum book flip
if you want something a bit bigger
Acer's chromebook 15 is a really great
option it's just a little too big for me
personally you might also be wondering
about more expensive Chromebooks like
Google's Chromebook pixel it is
phenomenal but no one no one should pay
that much for a Chromebook maybe in the
future with Android apps but not yet
there are some stylish cheaper options
like Samsung's Chromebook 3 and Acer
Chromebook
14 but neither quite hit the mark for me
now that I didn't have touch screens and
performance just wasn't quite there and
then there's the stuff you should just
never buy like the asou c300 which has a
disqualifying lee disgusting a screen or
the HP Chromebook 14 which has a display
that actually made my head hurt very
wrong I think some of these Chromebooks
are the right Chromebooks for certain
people but you want to make sure that
they're not missing any of the core
functionality that you'll need there's
no perfect Chromebook yet but it's still
surprising how far three or four hundred
dollars can get you if you want a cheap
laptop that can get the job done look no
further than these two because they are
absolutely your best bet
