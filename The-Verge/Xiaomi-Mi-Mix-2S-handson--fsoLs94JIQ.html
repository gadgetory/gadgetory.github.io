is the new gemiini mix 2s which doesn't
look a whole lot different from last
September's me mix too now it shares
many of the same features and overall
design but there's three new things to
talk about here it's got a new processor
it's got wireless charging and it has an
all new camera system it's got a five
point nine nine inch 18 by nine LCD
panel with full HD plus resolution
it's got qualcomm snapdragon 845
processor you can get it in up to eight
gigabytes of RAM and 256 gigabytes of
storage
it runs Xiaomi's me UI software it's up
to version 9.0 and this one is based on
Android 8 and it is available in China
starting next week and then OB in
Johnny's other global markets following
later on in the year the me mix 2s has
wireless charging through its ceramic
back which is new and nice to have it
also has wired quick charge 3.0 charging
through the USB C port now there isn't a
headphone jack here but there wasn't a
headphone jack on the last model either
so that's not really much of a surprise
the biggest change this year is
definitely the camera system it's a new
dual camera system unlike the single
camera on last year's phone it's - 12
megapixel sensors there's a wide-angle
lens and a telephoto lens like you might
find on the iPhone 10 or the samsung
galaxy s 9 plus the wide-angle lens has
an all new sensor with larger pixels on
it and dual pixel autofocus so better
faster focusing and hopefully better
performance and low light while the
telephoto lens is pretty standard
comparable to other telephoto lens
cameras of course there is a portrait
mode here that Joey says uses new AI
features to separate the forefront from
the background or your subject from the
background as well as to optimize the
colors for the scene I'd love to see how
well that works in practice as Yummy's
won a lot of awards for the Munich's
twos design so it's not really a
surprise to see them use the same basic
design for the me mix 2's you get that
really big screen and almost no bezels
all the way around it it's an LCD panel
it's not AMOLED like you might find on
other phones but it stills pretty bright
and vibrant and really looks pretty nice
to my eyes the weird part of course is
that the front-facing cameras in the
lower right corner of the frame which
makes it kind of odd when you're taking
selfies you're basically supposed to
flip it over upside down so that you can
take a normal selfie but other than that
it's a pretty great looking phone of
course the new camera is you know
familiar looking but it's kind of nice
to see that Jamie's actually added the
dual cameras to the me mix line and of
course because it's as yummy and it's a
flagship jamming phone it has the latest
and greatest processors and internal
specs that you can get in terms of
battery life the battery is the same
it's a 3400 milliamp hour battery but
Jamie says that because it's using the
new snapdragon 845 processor they're
getting better performance without any
hit to battery life so you should expect
about the same battery life as the name
x2 this is definitely one of the nicest
phones from jomi that I've ever used and
it'd be really great to see them expand
this to other parts of the world that
they haven't been selling yet but
they're still really no story on when
we're gonna find that out the new mix
2's is available in two colors you can
get it in black with it's pretty sharp
looking white model that I have here and
pricing is going to convert to roughly
$500 u.s. depending on how much RAM and
storage you get in there it's gonna be
available in China starting next week
and then Jimmy's gonna roll it out to
its other global markets in the coming
weeks after that fund unfortunately it's
probably never gonna come to the US for
