honeycomb was a crash-landing
emergency when emergency but you know we
actually crash you landed we were able
to walk away but you weren't I am still
here I have both legs so you weren't
totally satisfied with what you did well
I'm never satisfied if anything but but
honeycomb was a time-boxed effort right
and now ice-cream sandwiches come in and
it's you're taking a really strong
attitude towards design with this I mean
you're not only revamping the phone OS
and you're unifying tablets and phones
but you're also doing some more daring
stuff like you guys have designed your
own font that's right for this called
Roboto that's right and a lot of people
are very angry about that do you guys
know about the contant Roboto
controversy it's actually like a font
reverse a tree lit but waiting all night
to say that no but people have
complained that it looks too much like
Helvetica that it's an ugly font that
it's got weird edges and you've actually
written some posts about this on Google+
talking that's right that's right you're
very you're very upset that people with
disorder Doug Lee nobody likes that
that's that's justice it over this end
of the couch actually about to go all
the way down but John Gruber from daring
fireball he wrote him he was pretty
angry about it some some some typography
nerds have written yeah it's kind of two
different types of critiques of Roboto
one of which I totally get which is what
we set out to do which was kind of
provoked some discussion in the and the
typographic community about you know
some of the choices we made right we we
knew that traditional choices for
grotesque weren't going to work that
we're going to have quite the legibility
we wanted but we wanted something that
had a little bit of that geometric
purity right so we did some we did some
stuff that was you know a little bit
designed forward and you know that is
part of the discussion if you can't tell
the difference between Roboto and
Helvetica I don't think you're part of
that discussion really well what about
what about the attacks that it's it's
just like a bad font that it just isn't
designed well does that feel like that's
a valid argument
I don't I don't and actually that that
is the the conversation we want to
engage in right I mean when sans serifs
were originally invented the first
designs they were called grotesque as an
insult because people thought oh my god
this is like a horrible mishmash of
these you know styles that just don't
matter like how can I read this without
the things hanging you know that's right
it's not pointy enough I don't what is
this no no it's literally it's a it was
an insult that says these letters are so
crude they have to have been drawn by a
cave man living in a cave right and
that's grotesque telling people Roger
Roboto yes yeah but you just a cave
robot fundamentally I actually think
it's a good-looking fine I think it's
great you did this at Palm yeah of you
guys no you know he basically designed
all of webOS well not all of it but
you're there by myself you're the father
you're the Godfather is paying you to
see the story of webOS I don't get
sidetracked but yeah now every every
everything that you work on that doesn't
succeed the way you want it to you know
it's sad when it doesn't succeed the
people are stripping off cards
everywhere so they're kind of winning a
little bit but good ideas tend to
survive but I think it's cool that you
guys are doing something where you're
like hey we're gonna do we're gonna just
create a font out of nothing because
what matters I mean it no it is really
important to have good good font choices
good typography underpinning what you're
trying to do and so it's important for
webOS we did a whole suite of custom
fonts at danger yeah because I mean the
these mobile devices right these
interactive displays they're a different
type of font challenge right so you know
like like I talked about Adam for Roboto
I mean if you're really really care and
you're really a big font geek read the
posts go on for pages and pages but
there were there were really unique
problems right we couldn't just take
something off the show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
