we're looking at the Lumia 950 XL and
the Lumia 950 these are two new Windows
10 mobile phones announced today
so the one on the right here is the XL
the 950 XL and it has a 5.7 inch quad HD
display and one on the left is a 5.2
inch display they're kind of similar and
they've both put 20 megapixel cameras
this one has a triple 18 flash actually
and so does so just the 950 as well so
very similar inside they're both got a
USB type-c at the bottom and I'm going
to focus mainly on the XL because that's
like the VP aversion out there too
so as I said we've got 20 megapixel
cameras at the rear here and the sort
stand out feature this is Windows hello
so it's using a camera at the front here
and just to basically let you log into
this phone with your face and I'm not
going to demonstrate it right now
because this is a demo device so I can't
show you it but essentially it works it
pops up says hello Tom lets you into
your phone and you can use it and it
stops you running Windows 10 mobile and
so you got access to the usual office
apps all these the universe works
they also gives you the ability to
connect up to a PC with a monitoring
keyboard and a mouse and just use it as
a PC which is kind of that's the sort of
thing the mice was going for here it's
the phone that works like a PC but other
than that it's kind of this is sort of
look of the Lumia phone it's not really
changed much from other devices we've
seen in the past it certainly feels a
little bit thinner a little bit lighter
Bates two-square Lumia phone so I defeat
the design has changed that much with
this Lumia so yeah that was a real quick
look at the lumia 950xl
I know I hear and the
Lumia 950</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
