two really big iPhones this is the
iPhone 6 and as you probably already
know by now it comes in two sizes this
is the 4.7 inch device and this is a 5.5
inch device it feels pretty massive but
it doesn't feel so massive that it's
completely unwieldy it's pretty narrow
so compared to really giant Android
phones it's not too bad to hold in one
hand now if we compare these models to
the iPhone 5s you can see here that it
is quite a bit bigger the 4.7 is however
it is thinner and the buttons are a
little bit nicer they've got this iPad
style button here nicer ringer switch on
the back the camera sticks out a little
bit but you still have the true tone
flash so there's one more feature that's
really worth noting on the new iPhone 6
if you double tap you don't press you
just tap on the touch ID home button it
pulls down the screen so that you can
reach the stuff at the top there are a
lot of apps that don't support the back
gesture and so it's convenient to just
be able to double tap on that thing to
bring down stuff from the top of the
screen so you can have those buttons so
we've got a faster processor in here
it's the a8 and it's running iOS 8 of
course with the new healthcare app which
works with the Apple watch but the
really exciting thing at least with the
5.5 is you can turn it into landscape
and you get some extra features so if we
jump into messages here you can see
you've got a two-tone tropane thing
look at and then when you go into
portrait you actually get little avatars
whereas on the 4.7 inch model when you
go into messaging you don't get those
avatars so not only do they just give
you a bigger screen they also give you
more information on inch screen and then
when you turn it sideways you can see
you get different interfaces there both
of these models are available for
pre-order on Friday and they should be
available for sale on September 19 the
4.7 inch starts at $1.99 on contract and
a larger 5.5 starts at $2.99 on contract
and then it goes up as you get more
storage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
