I'm taking a look at the new moto 360
smartwatches from Motorola these are
Motorola second-generation Android wear
smartwatches
and this time around it's an entire
collection we've got different sizes and
different finishes here in my left hand
is the 46 millimeter men's version in my
right hand is the 42 millimeter women's
version you can see there's different
size bands as well as a different size
face you'll also be able to get a 42
millimeter version for the men's watch
as well motorola is of course that its
various customization options available
so you can customize the case color the
bezel color the strap all kinds of
different things that motorola scissors
over 300 different combinations that you
can do now this time around one of the
big design changes is the new lugs here
which allow you to easily swap the band
out you can see this particular band is
quick-release strap so you can quickly
swap it out for something else making it
a lot easier than you could with a prior
model and the button has been moved up
to the 2 o'clock position otherwise it's
very similar it's still round face still
has the kind of the flat tire down there
at the bottom which Motorola says is
necessary to get as large a face in a
small space as possible and then of
course there's the heart rate monitor
and motion tracking and water resistance
features as well Motorola's also added
some new software it's improved its moto
body software but there's this new
customizable dials on the watch face
here that are kind of like the
complications that you get on a standard
watch or even on the Apple watch and you
can get various pieces of information
right there without having to do
anything but glance at your wrist
in addition Motorola is also offering a
360 sport model which has a 42
millimeter display with a silicon band
it's got a couple of unique features
like built-in GPS and the ability to
have the screen display in any sunlight
or lighting conditions however that
won't be available until later this year
you'll be able to pre-order the new moto
360 starting today from motorola calm as
well as suit best buy calm and Amazon
calm and the prices will range from
about $2.99 all the way up to 430
dollars</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
