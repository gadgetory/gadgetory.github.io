Android for its el release this fall and
starting today it's letting developers
take an early look at it naturally we
wanted to try it out too so we got the
preview up and running on a nexus 5 to
see what it's like there are three major
changes to pay attention to here the
first and the most obvious is that
there's going to be design changes all
across the OS you can see it right away
and androids new buttons a triangle
circle and square new designs aren't in
place across most of the operating
system just yet but you can already see
it in action a few places like the
calculator and the dialer Google is
calling the style material design in
most places you'll find splashes of
bright color simple geometric shapes and
basic shadows to let you know when a
menu or a button is above or below
something else pretty much everything
you touch animates - and in a really
playful way at first glance it's all
pretty stylish and smart
the next big changes to multitasking now
all of your apps will display as
separate cards almost like a Rolodex but
more importantly every tab that you have
open in chrome will eventually appear
here - blurring the line between apps
and websites for now the layout seems a
little bit more inefficient but it
certainly looks good the final major
changes to notifications for one big
interactive notifications will now pop
up when you're inside an app you can
also now interact with them all straight
from the lock screen swiping to dismiss
them or dragging to interact with them
it looks like a really useful addition
Android that looks good so far on the
surface now we're just looking forward
to seeing what the rest of it looks like</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
