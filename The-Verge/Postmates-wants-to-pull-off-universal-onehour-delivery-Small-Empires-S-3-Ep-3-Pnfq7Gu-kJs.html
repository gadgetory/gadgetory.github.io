service with a fleet of local couriers
who purchase goods and deliver them to
customers across a city but within the
expanding on-demand industry post mates
faces growing competition
we're the largest on-demand delivery
company in the world we will try to do a
delivery from anywhere within an hour no
one does as many deliveries as us and if
it's serviceable on Foursquare you can
put in a note what you want to have done
and we will try and do it
post mates is an app that lets say you
need something picked up from the Apple
Store or you are looking for a burrito
from Chipotle you can go into your app
you can request delivery and for a fee
you will essentially get that delivered
to you
we'd like to believe it helps a whole
bunch of people so if you if you think
how it works it's local products
delivered by local people purchased by
someone who lives in that city so when
you press that button when you purchase
food from a restaurant when you purchase
something from a store in your city a
local merchant makes revenues a person
comes picks up the goods and he gets
compensated for that and you pay tax in
your own City post meats has made
certain things very simple top a couple
of buns you're done and it shows up and
that's great
postdates has evolved from its original
idea to better fit the market and serve
its customers once the concept for post
mates was solidified they face the
challenges of compiling inventory from
local stores and building their business
the first version of post mates was way
closer to the original idea of being a
ride-sharing for stuff he would open the
Avenue selected a pickup in a drop off
and you could describe what item should
have been picked up and where it should
be dropped off to but there was no
commerce element there's no one to tell
us like what our problems will be there
is no playbook out there
we can't copy FedEx we can't copy other
people in this space we can't even
really copy uber or lyft like they they
kind of we kind of understand some
things from them but our core business
how to deliver this like triangle that
exists there's no one to teach us so we
discover our challenges as much as we
solve them and we actually said this
weekend only you can have the items that
you want to have purchased you can have
them purchase through the app and we
deliver them and I think that first
weekend we sold good
anywhere between eight or ten thousand
dollars after that test we knew that we
had to build this app which we didn't
really wanted to build so the next
version of the app would allow you to
actually browse stores the permutations
of things that could go wrong are really
really high you have a consumer you have
a courier you have a person placing an
order you have a merchant who's
preparing an order you have a courier
that goes there and drops it off that's
four different people all aligned within
45 minutes to get something done people
do care about affordability when it
comes to on-demand services like post
meets but there are certain instances
where you'll almost pay any amount in
some cases just to get something
delivered postmates sets themselves
apart by bringing merchandise to
customers directly from local stores via
their couriers this freelance workforce
is crucial to make the transactions
happen and a big part of postmates
success but it's not without issues
especially as more and more companies
start to depend on independent
contractors FedEx and UPS they enabled a
lot of the commerce that is happening in
the world or companies like them and on
a local level really your only
alternative to move things around is
your other do it yourself you ask a
friend to do it you have an assistant or
you call a messenger for post mates the
ideal scenario is that businesses find
themselves making so much money by post
mates coming in to deliver to their
customers that they want to work with
postman it felt like something that is a
real problem right connecting local
merchants with customers giving the
power back to local economies or just at
least trying to provide them with better
tools so that they compete with big-box
retailers and outlets it felt like the
right thing to do I do think it is gonna
be a challenge for posts mates to figure
out what can they do better than Amazon
right it's not just enough to exist
alongside them they're gonna have to
figure out something they can do either
faster cheaper or better in some other
way I think people would simply just not
purchase anything from Amazon anymore if
you can have the same product delivered
within a couple of minutes in your city
and if you can have it out of comparable
price our Trojan horse is the fleet is
the fleet of Paulo states 16,000 of them
that are available in these cities and
that are doing deliveries a huge part of
what we're doing at post minutes is we
want to provide the infrastructure the
people on the ground they do the
deliveries that allow
these transactions to happen a lot of
the success is dependent on this
part-time workforce something has
shifted in the American economy there
are more and more freelancers more and
more contractors so I think that we're
gonna continue to see a lot of you know
part-time workers working on demand and
people are going to be utilizing those
services but there are so many right now
that I just don't see how all of them
are gonna continue to exist and some of
the bigger players are ultimately going
to scoop them up the on-demand industry
is growing quickly which is great for a
start-up like post mates but it also
means growing competition post mates has
made a name for itself in the industry
but will they be able to keep up among
major players like Amazon and uber when
I think about the on-demand space it's
probably gonna have a significant impact
just like e-commerce had in the world it
took a while for it to actually blew up
but now you have a Buy button on every
website and guess what Amazon won that
right Amazon won the entire category
they won the e-commerce app to cadres
and they're a great leader in it some
people think that eventually uber will
just sort of be V on-demand startup that
it will buy up startups like post mates
and we'll sort of just become kind of
the global logistics network for getting
you anything you need within a few
minutes I think if we look at the
portfolio of on-demand businesses we
have right now I think we need to just
continue to watch it it's evolving and
we'll see the things that succeed and
fail and I think we'll see a lot of them
continue to consolidate and some of them
become massive on-demand offers an
interesting twist it offers the ability
to have access to a service or a product
within a couple of minutes so it
fundamentally shifts how we're
perceiving a product or a service so on
a long enough timeline
I believe that just like we see biood
button or we see a net to Cart button
you will see a get it now button a lot
more around and people will get used to
the idea that they can press a button
and something happens to them
