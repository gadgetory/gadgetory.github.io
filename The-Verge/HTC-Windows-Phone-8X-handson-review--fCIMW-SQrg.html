is the windows phone 8x by HTC as the
name will tell you this new 4.4 in
smartphone runs Microsoft's latest
mobile operating system Windows Phone 8
and it does so proudly squared of
corners echoed the regular shape of
Microsoft's live tiles with the 8x HTC
is finally giving Nokia some competition
for the price of best-looking Windows
Phone device the tapered soft touch back
flow seamlessly into a curved gorilla
glass screen which is optically
laminated making images appear to float
on the a Texas surface almost every
external surface on the 8x is curved or
rounded in some way HC claims this is
the most comfortable phone you ever hold
however the design is not without its
faults the 8x is unusually tall for 4.3
inch phone and make it a major pain to
reach its top mounted power button the
8x gets the benefit of two major
upgrades of its predecessors comes with
a dual-core Snapdragon s4 chip which
makes it more powerful and more power
efficient but more importantly as a 720p
HD display windows phone has been crying
out for a resolution upgrade and seeing
its newly updated home screen on high
pixel density display it's truly a joy
to behold the edx can't quite render a
perfect black color which is a bitter
disappointment considering the black
terminated windows phone interface and
experience some issues with its
automatic brightness but those are mere
quibbles this handset has a great
display with excellent color accuracy
and viewing angles you also enjoy the
advantage of the high resolution when
browsing the web reviewing pictures
you've taken or watching HD video on the
device the 8 megapixel camera also takes
good pictures but isn't quite in the
same category as the iPhone 5 or the
Galaxy S free HTS seen fit to include
ass Beats Audio branding and
enhancements on the 8x so I advise
keeping and switched off on the plus
side you get a really loud loud speaker
and higher voltage through the audio
jack to help you drive more power-hungry
headphones the 8x feels like the first
device of its kind that can truly stand
up against Android in the specs race it
is LTE an HD display a modern geo core
processor and a truly cutting-edge
design price at $99 with AT&amp;amp;T in the
United States the windows phone 8x is a
flagship phone
mid-range price point make it an easy
recommendation for anyone looking to
give Windows Phone 8 a try</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
