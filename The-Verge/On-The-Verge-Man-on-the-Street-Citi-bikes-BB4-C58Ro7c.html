Bloomberg and Citibank have unveiled the
city bike bike sharing program I am
thrilled to declare that as of this
moment city bike is officially launched
then met with a lot of criticism and
praise all we want to know how the
people of New York feel sir sir
you just got off the city bike how was
it that's cool I like it's tough when
you're wearing a suit sometimes right
and it's it's really hot
excuse me sir you have a giant tennis
racket what do you think about a city
bike you have a giant spoon how do you
feel about the city bike about the city
bikes yeah I think the city bikes are
awesome at yeah parking sucks
traffic sucks but the bikes in out in
out and then you don't even got to worry
about you can drop it off somewhere and
call it a day you just wrote a city bike
for the first time yeah I wrote it all
of about 15 feet because I just got my
key oh oh you're an animal why don't I
test it do you wear a helmet no you do
not wear I should wear a helmet the only
thing to start carrying the helmet
around as a pain yeah yeah but you know
what else is the pain is yeah yeah yeah
I do you wear a helmet with it no but
I'm gonna get wound up would you use
city bikes at all no but I wouldn't wear
a helmet either No
what is it knock it's not cool to wear a
helmet it's the hair you don't want to
mess up the hair those two lovely folks
came prepared
have a safe trip so you said you've been
riding for a while you have a bike
helmet you're are you pretty up to date
on those new yorky by Klaus a big show
we joined if I ask you for it sure yeah
we lost the plan okay
how fun and freeing is it to ride
without any hands on the steering wheel
it's kind of like you're in an indie
movie yeah that's awesome it's also very
much illegal looks like this month in at
least one hand on the handlebar at all
okay Oh keep that in mind
let's see here how many earphones is a
cyclist allowed to wear while riding a
bicycle the correct answer would you
would enter well your you're allowed to
wear one do you realize you're only
allowed to have one earphone in it's New
York state law excuse me sir sorry sir
how do you feel about the city bikes no
okay it's just I only like to have one
year phone in by law it's against the
law what you're doing people all right
so our first attempt at obtaining a city
bike was unsuccessful okay English get a
bike in 24 hour one pass yeah I'm an
adult
stop I hit my neck
get this bad boy just want to get on the
bite sir if you wait I'm getting a bike
here now it is gone back to zero
nope nothing yes I want to pass yes I'm
an adult dip oh that was it
wait it just worked that quickly your
ride code expires in five minutes we're
gonna go three three two one three ah
there we go
I finally have a city bike and I am
absolutely terrified now to ride it also
I just realized now I have this bike in
one of the busiest places it's been many
years since I've ridden the bike and
I've forgotten a little bit excuse me
sorry
sorry sir first time on a city bike okay
I am I'm on the bike no bike lanes over
here yeah but this one's so much closer
to the cars okay I'm just gonna ride to
the end of the street I'm gonna do it
I'm riding my first city bike in New
York City I'm riding my first city bike
guys first time on a city bike thanks
thank you
that was absolutely terrifying and
exhilarating I did it okay I'm gonna
walk it back when I first came out here
I expected to find people hated city
bike that they found them to be a
nuisance to litter the streets he's be
sorry first time welcome back to Citi
bike sorry I'm sorry I was surprised
people love that people use them to get
to work they found it convenient they
found that it was a great way for them
to get exercise my experience on a Citi
bike has taught me that there's no
better way to experience this and
surrounded by 8 million people who will
support you through your first steps
I love them
when they love me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
