this is the toshiba excite 10 le it's a
10.1 inch tablet starting at five
hundred twenty nine dollars and its
claim to fame as being the thinnest
10-inch tablet on the market that does
seem to be true but it's a really small
distinction at 7.7 millimeters thick
it's less than a millimeter thinner than
the Galaxy Tab 10.1 and only slightly
over a millimeter thinner than the ipad
2 it is thin and it's nice and light at
a little less than 1.2 pounds but again
it's a pretty small distinction over
some of the other tablets out there
toshiba also make some pretty big
sacrifices to get the tablet to be so
thin the magnesium alloy body and grill
glass display are both good but they're
not put together all that well there's a
weird lip on the back that actually
sticks out and you can feel it and
almost pry it apart plus the tablet
creaks and bends a lot as you move it
around there's a headphone jack a
microUSB port a micro-hdmi port and a
microSD port they're all really
accessible and it's nice to have them
all there especially the microSD port
which is usually hidden and pretty hard
to access on the bottom there's a
proprietary dock connector which is
enormous even bigger than apples and
just seems unnecessarily large there are
two cameras on the device there's a five
megapixel camera on the back and a 2
megapixel camera on the front both are
basically just like every other tablet
camera we've seen neither is
particularly impressive but both work in
a pinch especially the rear camera the
front camera is fine for video chat and
actually takes better pictures than some
we've seen but it's still not something
you're going to want to use a lot we've
been hearing about this tablet for
months now and when you look at the spec
sheet or use the device it really shows
it uses a TI omap 4430 processor which
is fine but it's definitely an aging
chip basically everything you do just
takes a beat longer than you expect
there's some real responsiveness issues
with the screen and it'll often take two
or three tabs to get something to happen
and games play at really low frame rates
and we tried to play Grand Theft Auto 3
and either couldn't play it at all
because it would crash or just had some
trouble with frame rates and lag as we
tried to move around it has a 1280 by
800 IPS display and in general looks
pretty good it's not nearly up to par
with the retina display on the new iPad
but it's still pretty solid it has good
viewing angles and good colors it's not
really bright and again it has some real
responsiveness issues but it's hard to
tell how much of that is due to the
screen and how much is due to the
processor it also oddly lets you see the
touchscreen technology on it it looks
almost like an alligator skin and it's
really kind of bizarrely visible as you
look
otherwise what you're getting is pretty
much a pure stock experience of Android
3.2 honeycomb toshiba promises that
android for pointing this spring but
again we're always wary of it until an
upgrade actually comes with the Excite
tenant lee it feels like to schubas goal
is to have the thinnest tablet possible
at absolutely any cost so it's too
expensive at five hundred twenty nine
dollars for 16 gigs of storage or 599
for 32 gigs it doesn't perform very well
and it doesn't even seem like a
well-built tablet despite having pretty
good materials you're paying a price
premium over the iPad certainly and even
over most competing Android tablets like
the Galaxy Tab 10.1 or the asuste
Transformer Prime and it really doesn't
seem like it's worth it just to give a
thinner tablet</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
