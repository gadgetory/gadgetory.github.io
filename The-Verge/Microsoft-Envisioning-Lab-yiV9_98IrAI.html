lab with Harold Becker who's a senior
product planner this is the place where
we share a long-term vision for
productivity we bring the top enterprise
customers in here and the idea really is
to share some ideas get some feedback
and make sure that we have good ideas
for the next versions of office this is
a touch screen wall what is this it's a
28-foot touch enabled wall and we use
this in this facility to kind of set the
context and this is this is a this is
not capacitive touch what kind of
touches this it's a laser-based touch
system so here lasers that kind of
create a wall of light you've got this
bad boy over here this thing is kind of
a this is all the relevant content for
one project that I'm working on it's
live real life content I can see who's
touching that content I can communicate
with those people directly and so it's
very simple for me to kind of have a
look at all the things that are going on
related to this project we all know that
we get disrupted many many times every
day and there's a high cost associated
with those disruptions what I just did
is I switched the context now I'm
looking at content that's maybe more
relevant to my personal life is this is
this Windows and in five years and take
this as a concept car tried to approach
most likely or very likely will look
very different from what we're sharing
here this is about the kernel of an idea
what if you had more transparency into
people's projects
this one is our latest edition so you
see how the camera is starting to
recognize me I want to use my move my
hands so that the camera really tracks
them well and then I can move in and out
of the sky
what I'm on a trip here I'm not going in
it so what is this here this is a very
small cellphone one of the key ideas he
is what if you could interact with the
content on the device by touching the
back so you're not covering up the front
side of the display just think about all
those folks those frontline task workers
that are not connected right now what
idea is that
you know you can develop those devices
very low costs and just provide the
information to those people when they
need them right
that wall is live yes it's a live green
wall
it feels so a lien in the room like this
and yet maybe I'm crazy but I feel like
the air is cleaner in this room am i it
doesn't it just have that benefit I've
got to get one of these in my house is
this expensive it seems like it'd be
very pricey okay Harold I have one more
question
are these some kind of digital retainer
what what exactly am I looking at on
this shelf because it's very is very
Cronenberg ask are these for the mouth
yes but they wouldn't would it and what
do they do well so you can move you can
interact with system you can basically
move your cursor with your tongue really
yes well I see how with with people with
disabilities this may be that's probably
right that's what you're thinking about
the application okay
so then I shouldn't be creeped out by
the concept of Microsoft trying to put
computers in my mouth which wouldn't be
a problem for me personally but well
this is great stuff thank you so much oh
my dog really very cool if you don't
mind I'm just gonna hang out here a
little bit is that a beam I guess that's
a very comfortable chair so this that's
over here ooh ooh this is comfortable
now how do you get if you want to have a
drink here and you have somebody who can
bring it in or is there an after-hours
we have a voice application for this is
the drinks please Chris we need some
single malt whiskey here and go cigars
and cigars ASAP whiskey will do close
enough
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
