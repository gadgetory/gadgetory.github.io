migicovsky who is the CEO of pebble and
they had a very successful Kickstarter
campaign to launch a SmartWatch called
the pebble I am borrowing one right here
right now and we've got some big
announcements from them here at CES I
thought we thought we'd sit down and
talk about what's going on our spring
announcement is shipping yeah so what's
what's the story what do you guys
shipping we're going to start shipping
to our Kickstarter backers on january
twenty third and you know we're proud
we're proud of what we've made and we're
really happy that we've our factories
just entered mass production and we're
ramping up you know as we as we you know
start shipping those out I mainly
excited to hear what people think of it
because you know we've been working on
this with our heads down for eight
months and it's gonna be really exciting
so you're shipping on the twenty-third
and obviously you're not going to be
able to get to all of your backers right
away because you guys had how many
backwards on Kickstarter so we had
68,000 backers on Kickstarter pledged
towards 85,000 watches right our
production line will be you know at its
peak spitting out 15,000 watches per
week right um so it'll be a little while
before every single Kickstarter backer
gets there watch them and you know the
good news is it's finished and we're
going to ship okay and once you get
through your batch of everything you're
making for backers you're making 50,000
a month are you just going to keep
making 15,000 month how're you guys yeah
a week excuse me we are you just going
to keep on doing that yeah so after our
Kickstarter project closed on
Kickstarter we we opened up a website
that took pre orders and sort of like
people who are interested could sign
their name down and we have tens of
thousands of people who have signed up
for that so our goal is to just keep
pumping at pebbles as you know as much
as people want so the software I want to
talk a little bit about it you've got
different watch faces and you can
there's more watch faces coming from
developers zooms that you've got people
able to soon be able to make their own
watch faces to put onto the watch yeah
so there's several aspects to this sort
of customizability of pebble one is the
ability to run or install or download or
create your own watch faces there's also
the ability to have notifications from
the web sent to your pebble or even to
have apps on your phone send messages to
your pebble right and that works
basically it from what I understand that
for to send a notification your pebble
right now it supports SMS email and
phone calls yeah and then a control
music on iphone it also does I message
as well does I'm us a hand on Android
we've got google talk notifications and
google voice already integrated are you
guys hoping to build like an app
ecosystem because i mean you know i know
you've got your partners with RunKeeper
and that's going to be coming in a
future update but it seems like you know
as far as when you put smart in front of
something that sort of you assume that
means a bunch of apps and so you know
buddy able to change my watch face is
cool and getting getting those alerts
coming in as cool and that's but you
know better than just a simple watch you
know for something that wants that sort
of thing but are you guys looking to
expand beyond that to get you know more
apps and more apps able to talk to it
and if so how would that work so we've
talked to believe we've explained sort
of the the roadmap that we have as it
relates to sort of apps we're starting
with watch faces because it's kind of
like a discrete problem that we can
solve and make sure that it's you know
the sdk is working well from there we'll
expand to apps that include buttons or
interaction so games I think that casual
gaming will be pretty cool in pebble I'm
really looking forward to a snake or
something like that just to start with
but really you know from there will be
including API support for accelerometer
reading so if you want to write an app
that reads from the accelerometer and
analyzes that data you can do that right
on the wrist okay bottom-line it for me
what do I be able to get weather on a
pebble so right you can do that with if
this than that actually okay how does
that work so if this then that is a
certain is a web service that kind of
connects two different connects a web
service to another web service yeah and
we build and have in place a web service
that talks did this and that and acts as
a endpoint so if you go to the website
if calm you can set up various alerts to
push messages to your pebble and one of
them is whether a notification so I have
one that's set up so if it's going to
rain in Palo Alto it the next day it
will send me a little text on my watch
is that now how does that get to does
the app itself send it in or does that
come as an email or a text message or
something right now it's interpreted
right now that message comes as an email
and pops up on my watch okay but we're
working on getting the the final push
system set up so that other applications
besides if and push notifications to
users watch think of it like you know
how you have a login with Facebook
button right a lot of apps we're making
log in with pebbles so if your use if
you use a specific maybe traffic website
or stock website or something like that
we're building a system so that website
can add a login with pebble button so
their users if they have a pebble can
get notifications pushed directly to
their watch but that sort of thing also
be able to work on like smartphone apps
presumably yes exactly yes it's just a
web endpoint to North to end point right
okay and what are you targeting for that
sort of so the endpoint is down points
done other people can do that now and
push off by email and then at some point
in the future it'll push out it'll be a
plea without having to go through the
email oh yeah well our congratulations
on shipping shipping on the twenty-third
and thanks much for talking to us and
we'll see you soon thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
