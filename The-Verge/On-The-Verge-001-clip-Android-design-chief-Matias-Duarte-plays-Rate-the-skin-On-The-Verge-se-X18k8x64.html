were just talking about a you and I
discussed it before it came out and you
said you liked the fire because it had a
really different skin and you liked the
fact that it had been reskinned let's
just get a look at this again obviously
this doesn't look anything like the
android that you guys how much you're
shutting down again they put this button
in the worst place okay I don't like
that part but you don't like that part
but you like the fact that this doesn't
look like Android yes I mean I like the
fact that they are taking Android and
they're trying to do something right
really different with it right I always
got the impression that you weren't
crazy about skinning but i want to i
want to bring out a couple of different
tablets and devices here and get your
opinion on what you think of the skins
for these phones so here's one this is
HTC Sense right you want to go ahead and
yeah yeah what's your opinion on this
yeah this these guys you know they've
got that 3d bling going on you know we
talk about sexy moments when we're
designing software we always kind of
make fun of you know where's the sex
appeal saxy moment for you right now not
for me personally huh but but these guys
these guys are paying attention and
they're trying to do something you know
a little bit less you like this i think
i Signori you get in it I'm not gonna
give it out you don't score design what
are you talking about you out no guess
you'd ever read The Verge how about this
one hotly contested TouchWiz seems
somewhat reminiscent of other phone os's
woody what do you make of TouchWiz look
at that now now what I like the TouchWiz
was the the tablet version where you can
drag up and get your way without doc yet
do you feel that this is there you know
Apple and Samsung you're in heated
battle right now you know about this do
you feel like it's is a derivative of
objection overruled I'm sorry you can't
talk you actually hockey yeah so then
you do think it's riveted interesting Oh
you guys heard it here first so this is
a this is a really crazy one this is the
grid 10 this is made by fusion garage I
got us just signed to unlock here that
work have you ever used this before I
haven't I haven't we just got one of
these but I haven't actually and what do
you think of this I think it's really
cool that they're doing something
totally different i mean amazon went one
way but it still has a metaphor that
people recognize these guys are really
taking risks of this is it possible that
you like the ones that are really crazy
because they look less like the stuff
that you do we want it you want a havoc
if nobody's willing to take risks then
everything will be derivative hmmm
that's a good place to end it I think
Matthias thank you so much for coming
really appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
