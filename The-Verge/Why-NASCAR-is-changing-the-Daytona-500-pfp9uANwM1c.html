if you do you're probably fed up with it
NASCAR's been changing the rules the
cars and drivers for the past decade to
try and get people to care again and yet
NASCAR ratings are at an all-time low
NASCAR is desperate and the people who
run the series want you to start
watching so badly that they went out and
changed one of the most sacred things
about what makes NASCAR NASCAR it
changed how the races work this is a
huge change it's like when Coke came out
with new coke and everybody freaked out
until they changed it back and if it
works the races might be more exciting
and competitive and you might not change
the channel and if it doesn't work well
yep I'm flying through the air this is
not good so here's what NASCAR did
before races were anywhere from about 90
laps to about 500 laps depending on the
size of the track those distances aren't
changing but this year every race has
been split into three segments there's
two shorter ones to start and one longer
one at the end so now instead of the
Daytona 500 you're basically going to
have the Daytona 150 150 200 NASCAR
hopes that this change is going to
encourage drivers to be more aggressive
earlier on in the race before the change
you could basically hang back in the
pack and hope to strategize to win at
the end of the race after the change
you're still gonna have to win that last
segment to win the race but the better
you do in the earlier segments the more
points you'll get towards the
championship the end of the season but
the other reason for this change is you
the viewer NASCAR races can be long
boring affair so long sometimes that
it's even hard to figure out where and
when the good racing is happening
there's more than one reason for this
decline to the on track competition
arise in popularity of other sports the
way the cars don't look like Road cars
anymore but the biggest are a struggle
to bring in new fans and a general drop
and attention span and a drop in
attention stand is what could really
kill the sport you see NASCAR is really
expensive and the way the sport
maintains itself financially is through
sponsors and advertisements the longer a
viewer stays on one program the better
chance that brands message will pay off
so even if you have a million viewers if
those viewers are only watching for a
few minutes advertisers are not going to
find it very beneficial for them to
advertise and so they pull out we saw
this this past year when Sprint decided
not to stick around as the title sponsor
for NASCAR what's really sly about
NASCAR's format change though is that it
opens up a ton of new opportunities to
sell ads against that programming NASCAR
already ropes in sponsors for little
things like the pass of the race and now
it essentially has three times the
number of those opportunities perhaps
the biggest problem with NASCAR's format
change is that it just makes everything
so much more confusing NASCAR does still
have a really robust culture around the
series and it's dragging that culture
into the digital age the sport has a
good sense of how and when to use
snapchat many drivers are on Twitter
Facebook or Instagram and they use those
services to engage with fans not just
advertise
is the series even puts full race
replays up on YouTube for free
NASCAR's problem is in the execution
it's why the series has spent the last
15 years trying to change every little
rule and even the cars themselves to try
to get people to start watching again
NASCAR started as a novelty it was a way
for bootleggers to prove who have the
fastest car but now with the automotive
industry switching towards electric
vehicles NASCAR is going to have a
chance to become a novelty again
changing the race format doesn't need to
save NASCAR this year it just needs to
buy them a little more time we're
rolling along to Darlington South
Carolina to the track we're fast highway
servicing covers the mile and a half
oval on which they run the southern 500</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
