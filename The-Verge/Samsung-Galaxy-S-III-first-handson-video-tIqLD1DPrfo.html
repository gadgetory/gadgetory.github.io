Samsung's unpacked 2012 event taking a
look at the Galaxy S free it has just
been launched it's a quad-core device as
a 4.8 inch Super AMOLED HD display
that's 1280 by 720 resolution
it matches the HTC One X in that respect
it also matches in terms of screen size
and general dimensions so you're just
gonna try and take a look at them in
size comparison right now actually both
of these phones run Ice Cream Sandwich
Android 4.0 the both of them have skins
on top so there's sense fall on the One
X and as I believe it still called
TouchWiz with Samsung but it's a it's an
upgraded it's a new skin they're trying
to go with a more natural user interface
so they say has been acquired by
inspired by water and pebbles and leaves
and all sorts of natural things like
that part of the unlocking process with
the Samsung is actually this whole idea
of you essentially dabbing your finger
into water which you can take a look at
now it's not particularly intuitive you
don't really know when you've done
enough to unlock it but it's there if we
take a look at the window shape menu up
at the top is still quite familiar for
samsung suhd 3d users you have a bunch
of launcher icons at the very top then
you have your notifications underneath
ongoing items which you can swipe away
presumably yeah that's very much like
the standard Android 4.0 so you're gonna
see a lot of the standard Android 4.0
features in there but you're gonna be
buried under a lot of Samsung
customizations which not many people are
going to love but we'll give them a
chance a lot of these software features
we'll need to try out in more depth to
get a good idea of how are they going to
work as you can see down at the bottom
you'll know you don't get the free
software keys you do it Google stock
Android we have two capacitive and one
physical home key and in terms of
physical
accoutrement service device you have a
1.9 megapixel front-facing camera that's
up you have already use your senses next
to it very thin bezel in the size this
is why it also doesn't feel like such a
massive phone over here inside left side
you have the volume rocker it's a pretty
thin phone as you saw with the size the
person with 1x going all the way around
to the back its plastic back cover it's
not the best it kind of reminds us of
the original galaxy s you have an 8
megapixel camera backside illuminated
sensor LED flash and speak grill on the
back and the power button is mounted on
the right side usual place and you pay
your Samsung that is and then you have a
headphone jack at the very top so that's
it our first look at the Galaxy s3 with
Samsung it's launching on the 29th main
Europe and should be coming to the
United States with LTE in June</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
