what I have here is the Dell Venue 10
7000 this is the newest tablet in Dells
venue series of tablets and you can see
it's a little bit bigger than what they
released back in the fall the Dell Venue
8 7000 you've got a ten and a half inch
screen and the resolution is gonna be
2560 by 1600 you're gonna get about 300
pixels per inch but it's an OLED display
so you've got the same vibrant colors
attack sharpness and all the texts and
all the graphics obviously you can see
here the form factor is a lot different
this time around though we've got this
hinge that runs along the side so you
can really sort of rotate it however you
want whichever is more comfortable for
you to grip that hinge is there because
Dell is gonna sell a keyboard alongside
with it it's really similar to what we
see in a lot of laptops now where we've
got two and ones with more Portability
you're gonna be able to separate it and
bring it with you so the keyboard is
actually powered by the battery which is
here in the hinge along with some of the
other components and when you snap it
into place the backlight lights up and
the keyboard is running right off the
power for me inside the battery Dell
says that the battery will actually last
you 15 hours so it's improving even on
the great battery life of the Dell Venue
8 and that's with the keyboard attached
there's also a trackpad down here so
when you have it in sort of laptop form
you're gonna be able to just sort of
comfortably browse instead of having to
reach up to the screen that way you can
ease your way into getting used to
reaching up and using a touchscreen the
good thing is that when you reach up to
use that touchscreen you're not gonna
easily tip over the whole rig this is a
problem we've seen with some of these
Bluetooth keyboards this actually gives
you some pretty good weight down here so
it holds it in place overall the package
is actually extremely thin the tablet
itself is only six point two millimeters
thick which is just the hair thicker
than the Dell Venue 8 so like with the
Dell Venue 8 you're also going to get
intel's realsense depth camera and that
means there's actually a couple
different cameras here on the back
working in tandem to give you some
actual depth in your images so you can
refocus after you shoot so you can have
to focus on a different subject in the
foreground or the background or you can
slide and
more things or less things in focus so
the Dell Venue 10 7000 going to run you
$4.99 and with the keyboard it will be
$5.99 and it's going to be available at
the end April</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
