and today GoPro announced two brand new
action cameras the hero five black in
the hero five session let's start with
the hero five black which on the inside
is really not that much different from
the hero4 black before it first it's
water-resistant out of the box this time
that means you won't need a waterproof
housing the camera alone will be
protected if you submerge it in up to 33
feet of water the second big difference
is that the hero 5 black has a
touchscreen now instead of last time
where it didn't have one in the hero4
silver did the hero 5 black has a two
inch LCD touchscreen where you can
control all the settings from but it's
an all new menu system this time around
so it's definitely going to take some
time to get used to it if you used a
gopro before it's got the same image
sensor inside that's capable of taking
12 megapixel stills 4k video at 30
frames a second or 1080p video at 120
frames per second GoPro did say that
there's a new image processing chip in
this camera that lets it do all that
extra stuff and better yet it's going to
help give it 50 percent more battery
life than the hero4 another big addition
is voice control you can use your voice
to say things like GoPro start recording
or GoPro stop recording or GoPro take a
photo and seven different languages will
be supported at launch when the camera
goes on sale on October 2nd when it does
go on sale the Hero 5 blacks actually
going to cost less than the four did
it'll cost 399 now the Hero 5 session
will cost $2.99 and this is a camera
that's an update to the hero4 session
that was released last year and this one
actually has some upgrades inside its
now capable of 10 megapixel stills and
the session can now shoot 4k video at 30
frames a second just like the hero 5
black it does have a smaller image
sensor though now the hero 5 session is
also water-resistant and the biggest
change to both of these cameras that I
haven't mentioned yet is that both of
them are cloud connected because GoPro
also today launched Go Pro Plus which is
a subscription storage service kind of
like Google Drive or anything else like
that you'll pay $4.99 a month for GoPro
plus and the way it works is pretty
simple you essentially go out and shoot
the footage you want to shoot when we
come back home and plug it in to charge
the camera hooks up to your home Wi-Fi
and just automatically starts backing up
all that footage and all those photos to
the plow
and from there you can just go on your
mobile device you can go on your desktop
anywhere you are you can essentially
access all that footage in those photos
download them edit them whatever now the
one drawback is that you can't say
download a video to your phone start
editing it and pick up where you left
off on your computer you're downloading
it to a certain place and doing
something with it there so there are
some limits here but this is the kind of
thing that GoPro can offer that a lot of
its competition can it's not something
you're gonna find on a sony 4k action
camera or the Garmin VirB ultra 30 now
will that be enough to make people want
to upgrade to the hero 5 black from one
of the hero4 cameras it's kind of hard
to say right now but the hero 5 session
is a huge improvement over the last
version and the hero 5 black is a pretty
big one as well now the hero 5 session
is an update to last year's session
camera sorry I got distracted by a dog
yeah he just looked so happy
