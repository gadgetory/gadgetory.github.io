program manager on the windows user
experience team today I'm going to show
you some improvements we've made to
multi-model windows 8
you can a bring up start switch back to
your apps and access terms from any
monitor simply move your mouse to the
corner on the moderate of your choice
this works across all your monitors here
you can see me switching back to my apps
on the Left monitor or switching back to
my apps on the right monitor I can
access terms on the right monitor and I
can access charms on the left monitor of
course as you saw earlier in the video I
can access start on all markers
one way I can move metro-style apps
across monitors is by dragging and
dropping the app using the mouse I am
able to grab the app and move it across
monitors this also works for snapped
apps
you
in the release preview we've improved
most targeting along the shared edge
we've created a six by six pixel target
along the shared edge corners that
catches the cursor as it hits the corner
this provides the confidence of a real
corner but is not in the way when I want
to move my cursor to the next monitor in
this example you can see me moving the
cursor quickly and confidently to the
shared edge corners to demonstrate this
in more detail let's zoom in here I'm
applying pressure to the left edge as I
move my cursor down along the shared
edge once I pass the six pixel threshold
my mouse will move freely to the next
monitor
I showed you how you can bring up start
switch to your apps and access charms
from all monitors I showed me how you
can drag and drop apps between monitors
and improvements that we've made to the
shared edge that provide a great most
experience we can't wait for you to try
this for yourselves</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
