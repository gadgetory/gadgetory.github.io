morning and welcome I'm gonna start with
Apple TV now of all the great channels
that we have on Apple TV there's one in
particular I'd like to talk about this
morning and that is HBO we are thrilled
to be here this morning to announce our
standalone streaming service HBO now we
will introduce our new product in early
April for $14.99 a month and if you
subscribe in April you will get the
first month free and have it in time for
the April 12th premiere of our global
phenomenon Game of Thrones we are
lowering the price today to $69 if you
don't have one yet now's the time but we
have always wanted to make the biggest
difference we could make and that is on
medical research
I know Medical Research is not what you
are expecting but let me explain
researchkit is a software framework made
specifically for medical research you
decide what apps you participate in what
research you participate in the first
five apps that you saw are going to be
available today next up I'd like to talk
about the Mac the definition of
portability has changed in the last
several years led by iPhone and iPad so
we challenged ourselves to take
everything that we had learned in
designing iPhone and iPad to reinvent
the notebook
can you even see it I can't even feel it
there it goes
the new MacBook weighs just 2 pounds
it's just thirteen point one millimeters
thin it is an all new keyboard and that
all adds up to a key that is much more
precise in accurate well the perfect
size display to match to that full-size
keyboard is a 12 inch display and to be
beautiful of course it's a Retina
display with 23:04 by 1440 pixels
next up the trackpad we call it the
force touch trackpad for the first time
in the trackpad our tactic engine to
provide feedback of your cooking and for
the first time you can cook anywhere and
get the exact same feel over the entire
surface those four sensors sense a range
of pressure from your lightest click to
a deeper press we've created a new
gesture for those deeper presses we call
them a force click and this is a range
of pressure that this the sensors can
sense so in drawing applications or
signing your signature you get a much
more accurate illustration so let's take
a look inside because what's on the
inside is just as innovative as these
features we're looking at on the outside
this is the logic board of the 11 inch
MacBook Air for the team designed this
new MacBook with removing all fans and
vents to make it the first famous battle
ever it's powered by an Intel Core M
fifth-generation 14 nanometer process
you can configure it with speeds up to
1.3 gigahertz which can be turbocharged
running up to 2.9 gigahertz so what do
we do with the rest of that space we
filled it with batteries and that allows
us to deliver up all day battery life
one connector supports USB data
DisplayPort power
HDMI VGA
all through one connector this is a
brand new standard called USB see it's
easier to use because it's reversible
and it's the most versatile connector
you'll see adapters from Apple as well
as many third parties to support all
these different interfaces all through
one connector the new macbook starts
with 12.1 inch Retina display a 1.1
gigahertz Intel Core M a large 8 gigs of
internal memory and a large 256 gigabyte
flash storage device at just $12.99 we
get a faster processor and twice that
internal storage for just $15.99 will
begin to ship in a number of countries
just a month April 10th comes in silver
space spray and a stunning gold hash tag
mat book lust now we have some updates
to the others as well the MacBook Air is
being updated to faster 5th gen Intel
Core i5 and i7 processors they have
faster Thunderbolt connectors and the
13-inch configuration gets flash that's
now twice as fast as before and those
will be shipping starting today in the
13-inch MacBook Pro as an update as well
it's getting the new force touch
trackpad getting faster processors with
faster Core i5 and i7 processors and
it's getting twice as fast flash as well
and we've been able to get another hour
of battery life and that's shipping
today as well and that is our news on
the MacBook Tim now I'd like to turn to
the newest addition to the Apple family
and of course I'm talking about the
Apple watch every Apple watch has many
different faces and many different
configurations so you might like this
traditional face you also might like one
that expresses time in a way that's
never been done before or one that is
just fun now Apple watch also has a new
feature that's called glances so if you
swipe up from the bottom of the watch
face you can see things like whether
your calendar glances allows you to
control your music
and you can even check your heart rate
right from your wrist you can receive
messages and the taptic engine alerts
you by tapping your wrist you can also
with the built-in speaker and microphone
you can receive calls on your watch you
can read full emails and you can connect
Apple watch to Apple watch with a new
technology called digital touch digital
touch allows you to do things like
sketch on your watch and that sketch
will be animated on your friends watch
exactly as you drew it and so the Apple
watch tracks your daily movement it
tracks how long you're exercising or
getting brisk activity and it even
reminds you if you've been sitting too
long Apple watch also has a new workout
app and it will provide detailed metrics
about your workout that you can see
during your workout things like how many
calories you're burning you can receive
any notification that you receive on
iphone today you can receive on your
watch so you can keep track of your
favorite sports teams you can connect to
social media so to give you a sense of
what it's like to use these apps on the
watch we reuse some moments in time so
let's start out at work and I can see
important notifications messages from
VIPs quick looks at information with
glances so for example I might be going
to New York pretty soon and I can see my
departure information here so I'm going
to ask Siri here what's the temperature
in New York
well it's getting warmer there how I can
get notifications of course while I'm at
home or incoming photos for my friends
and over here I have an uber app so when
I get near the airport my boarding pass
will just show up right here and my
notifications if I tap on it you can see
my flight information including a
barcode that I could use to just wave in
front of the scanner and get through
security I've got this great app from
alarm calm and my garage door is hooked
up there so let's open the door for
Maddie so open the door it's gonna send
the command to my garage door and it
should open there it goes Apple watch
