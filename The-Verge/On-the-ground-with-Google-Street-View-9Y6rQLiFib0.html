2007 Google started building Street View
it's on the ground map of every street
and trail that the company could get
access to and last year Google
introduced trekker
a customized backpack that would let
Google go places they could never get to
before from the bottom of the Grand
Canyon to the top of Mount Fuji we
wanted to know what it's like to
actually make one of these maps so we
came with a street view team to the
Presidio in San Francisco where I got a
try on the trekker and actually see what
it's like to make Street View happen
so the trekker is a mobile image capture
platform we took some of the same
technology from the Street View car with
the camera and made it portable ultra
portable before that if we wanted to go
you know down some steep stay you know
Hills up stairs I think we were only
able to do me like maybe one of those I
think we carried our 350 pound trike up
the stairs at the High Line in New York
just because that was a really cool
location but there was no way we were
gonna go to the bottom of the Grand
Canyon or the top of Mount Fuji and so
that is like the whole justification for
the trekker is making it ultra portable
and being able to go to places that
we've never been able to go before
people are used to the image quality
that we have with Street View so we
actually took this camera and it looks
very much like the car because it's the
same lenses it's the same sensors it's
the same interface electronics and we
had to figure out a way to get that off
of a car onto someone's back so that was
our biggest challenge so the trucker was
again somebody's 20% project really
garden team named Gary Ambler and and
colleagues just decided that yes we
should try to put you know our camera on
a backpack because there were so many
places we could go with either cars or
tricycles and and that made sense
again we we're always you know we're
we're that more ideas and we have people
to execute on them so it's not
surprising that this story is a 20
percent all these are the way projects
their genesis is somebody getting
excited about something or trying to
solve a problem and then
getting that colleagues excited to work
on it our process here is somebody will
think of an idea so the trucker was a
20% project in 20% projects here are hey
boss I'd like to think about this a
little more and the answer is usually ok
and it started growing and becoming
developed our engineering team said ok
we're going to build one and then when
they got one working they said ok this
is gonna work so to a place like the
Presidio it starts with an idea this
place would be cool to go on maps and so
then we will reach out to the partner or
partners will reach out to us through
the there's a partner portal on the
Street View site and they'll request
that we come out or we request of them
that hey wouldn't it be cool if we got
together and made these imagery
available to everyone
15 5 megapixel cameras with slight
overlaps between all the imagery if you
just take that and you plot that on your
desk it looks like these distorted blobs
with unique images the colors are off
the exposures are all a bit off because
the sensitivity is all a bit different
so what we do is we will take those 15
images we'll blend the scenes will
adjust will match the color will and
match the exposures and then even beyond
that we collect 75 megapixels wrong
there's 65 megabits of unique pixels
then we do the magic there to resample
that imagery and serve it up so that it
gets to your to your device in the way
that's appropriate for your device it's
it's really a phenomenal bit of work
that goes on after we put these pixels
onto a disk and the way I think about it
now I mean the analogy I would give to
people is that we you know Street View
is like the physical equivalent to the
Google crawler but we just sort of crawl
the physical we're taking pictures and
try to make sense of them try to make
them useful there's so many amazing ones
I mean
I mean where do you start so the White
House or the temple of the pyramid and
Sun down into akan in Mexico five weeks
going out doing ski resorts in the
Colorado mountains of the Grand Canyon
NASA Kennedy Space Center so there's me
some really really Colin's of all we
have data in 54 countries and that's
time I checked and we of course we like
to expand that I mean the world is very
large so I think when we start the
project we're very opportunistic we just
went wherever we could right so now
we're trying to do better planning and
we we we tend to go first to places
where there's more user interest but you
know we we want to go everywhere we
won't be comprehensive one thing that's
of huge interest to us is all the your
landmarks in the world where we there's
a trust-fund tourists from around the
world but but of course we're gonna go
will be comprehensive so it's just a
matter of time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
