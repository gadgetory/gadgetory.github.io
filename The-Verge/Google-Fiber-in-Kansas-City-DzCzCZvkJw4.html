we are here in Kansas City for the
Google Fiber launch at the beautiful
Google Fiber experience and the service
is going to come in several different
tiers most of which are going to be a
full gigabit broadband which is a
thousand megabits up and down Google is
going to decide where they build out the
fiber based on a thing called they're
calling of rallies or different
neighborhoods need to pick but if you
choose to pay the $300 and your
neighborhood gets to be wired up then
you have a couple of options your first
option is $120 for Google Fiber plus TV
and the only problem with that is it
looks like there's some limitations on
the TV channels we're not seeing CNN HBO
or even ESPN in their current lineup if
you pay $70 a month you can get just the
the gigabit broadband which is still
pretty good and then if your
neighborhood is getting fiber but you
don't want to pay $70 a month you can
actually get standard regular broadband
five megabits down for free for seven
years if you pay for the construction
cost for them to wire your house up the
hardware that powers all this is pretty
interesting there is of course you know
a router that will have some Ethernet
ports and provide Wi-Fi on top of that
there is a storage box with two
terabytes of storage that has used to
store all your DVR material for all of
your TVs and then every single TV needs
to have a relatively small box in order
to be wired up and
in addition that TV box is also a Wi-Fi
router so it can extend your Wi-Fi
network the remote for Google TV is a
nexus 7 if you sign up for the the TV
package you will get a free nexus 7
tablet there will also be a small
Bluetooth remote if you prefer to use it
that way the rollout should happen
sometime soon they are having people
register right now by September 9th in
order to sign up after that we will seek
a gigabit broadband in Kansas City as
for when it'll hit the rest of the
country Google's not saying yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
