we're going to tell you about two of our
most personal products let's get started
with the Apple watch Apple watch series
for everything about it has been
redesigned and re-engineered it all
starts with a stunning new display we
push the screens right to the edges and
we've curved the corners to perfectly
match the shape of the watch and the
screens are significantly larger in fact
they're over 30% larger and we've done
this with minimal changes to the case
size series 4 is thinner so there's
actually less total volume than in
series 3 you'll see more in max and
photo and calendar we've created new
complications they look beautiful and
they show even more information in
detail and we've also designed a brand
new watch face with up to 8
complications that really brings them to
life
you can add loved ones to your watch
face and simply tap to connect with them
or if you're traveling you can customize
a watch face to track the different time
zones or maybe you want to create the
ultimate health and fitness watch the
digital crown has been completely
re-engineered and it now includes haptic
feedback giving you a more responsive
and mechanical feel it's especially
great in apps like podcasts and calendar
where you precisely flip through each
item the speaker has also been
completely redesigned it's fifty percent
louder which is great for phone calls
and walkie talkie Orsi request we move
the microphone on series four to the
opposite side as far away from the
speaker as possible to reduce echo
making phone calls even clearer and the
back of series four is absolutely
beautiful it's made entirely of black
ceramic and sapphire crystal radio waves
can now pass through both the front and
the back resulting in improved cellular
reception the brain of series 4 is our
fourth generation silicon in package or
sip
and we call it s 4 s 4 contains a
powerful new dual-core 64-bit processor
and a new GPO both custom designed by
our Apple silicon team to deliver up to
two times faster performance series 4
has a next-generation accelerometer and
gyroscope with twice the dynamic range
measuring up to 32 G forces and can
sample motion data eight times faster
Apple watch series 4 can detect a fall
for the new accelerometer and gyroscope
the watch analyzes risk trajectory and
impact acceleration to determine when
the fall occurs and after detecting a
fall series 4 delivers an alert and from
that alert you can initiate an emergency
call we wanted to do even more in this
space and so we're announcing three new
heart features first a notification if
your heart rate appears to be too low
the second feature is related to heart
rhythm Apple watch can now screen your
heart rhythm in the background and it
sends you a notification if it detects
an irregular rhythm that appears to be
atrial fibrillation a third feature is
made possible by a new electrical heart
sensor on series four we've added
electrodes into the back sapphire
crystal and the digital crown allowing
you to take an electrocardiogram with
all of these features in a slimmer
design
you're probably wondering about battery
life I'm pleased to tell you this series
4 has the same 18 hour all-day battery
life that our customers of joy series 4
will be available in 3 aluminum finishes
silver gold and Space Gray and the
stainless collection is absolutely
beautiful with polished and space black
all band colors and band styles fit any
generation of Apple watch Apple watch
series 4 with GPS starts at 399 series 4
with cellular starts at $4.99
and we're keeping Series three in the
lawn at more affordable prices starting
at just 279 you can order series 4
starting Friday and it will be available
the following Friday September 21st
series 3 at the new prices is available
right after the show and watch OS 5 will
be available on September 17 now let's
talk about iPhone this is iPhone 10s it
is the most advanced iPhone we've ever
created it is made of a surgical grade
stainless steel it has a gorgeous new
gold finish on the front and on the
glass and it's covered on the front in
the black back with a new formulation of
glass that is the most durable glass
ever in a smartphone iPhone 10s comes in
three finishes gold silver and Space
Gray and they're protected from dust and
liquids to an even higher level now ip68
of the screen and iPhone 10s is a superb
Retina display the best we've made yet
it's an OLED display 5.8 inches on the
diagonal it's 2.7 million pixels 458
pixels prints the highest quality
display on an iOS device
well the iPhone 10s is not just one but
two sizes of display the 5.8 inch and a
new 6.5 inch Super Retina display it is
an OLED display as well 3.3 million
pixels 458 pixels per inch again you can
see it's not the same size phone with a
much larger display we call it the
iPhone 10s max and the team has worked
so hard to make every generation of the
a series chip better than any in ever
ever - smart phone and this year is no
exception what the team is done is truly
truly breakthrough it's called the a12
bayan and
12 ionic is the industry's first seven
nanometer chip is an apple design six
core CPU this is a fusion system it has
two high-performance cores for high
efficiency course you are going to be
blown away with the pictures you can
take but the iPhone 10s is camera it has
a 12 megapixel wide camera a 12
megapixel telephoto camera and an even
more improved true tone flash on the
front side you have the true depth
camera system and that's a new sensor as
well a seven megapixel sensor that's
twice as fast increasingly all
smartphone users want more performance
bigger screens but longer battery life
to iPhone 10s get you up to 30 minutes
longer in your day than iPhone 10 date
and that's really great
iPhone tennis max has the biggest
battery we've ever put into an iPhone
and he can get you up to an hour and a
half longer in your day one thing we've
had requests for is dual SIM capability
to do this into iPhone 10s and 10's
match we've got the technology called
dsds or dual sim dual standby we want to
reach as many customers as we can with
this incredible technology so that's why
we are very excited to show you one more
i phone is incredible we are so excited
to introduce you to the iPhone 10 our
it's made for the 7000 series aerospace
grade aluminum and has more durable
glass it is absolutely stunning it comes
incredible new finishes white black blue
coral yellow each beautifully design
with that aluminum finish
there's even an incredible product red
one as well and it is beautiful all of
these are protected from dust and
liquids to ip67 this display is really
what strikes you though it's an LCD
display it's called the liquid Retina
display
so it's 1.4 million pixels and it's 326
pixels per inch so true Retina image
quality now let's bring that iPhone 8
plus next to it because it's really
interesting
it is a bigger display than the iPhone 8
bus in a smaller design it supports
tapped awake and as that 120 Hertz touch
sensitive layer so it's pearls super
assist fast now it doesn't have 3d touch
but here again the team payment was
something really smart it has a new
feature we call optic touch so to get to
the camera from the home screen you just
press on it you feel a haptic tap and
you're taken right to the camera it has
space ID there's a true depth camera
system the same true depth camera system
and iPhone 10s and 10's max so it's an
infrared camera flood illuminator of
proximity sensor ambient light sensor
dot projector front camera speaker
microphone and inside the iPhone 10 R is
nothing but the best chip we make a
brand new 7 nanometre a 12 Bionic chip
so this is a powerhouse and it has a
great new camera system as well it's a
12 megapixel wide-angle camera the exact
same wide-angle camera in the 10s and
10's Mac so it's our new generation
sensor that's larger with bigger pixels
optical image stabilization fast F 1.8
aperture Apple Design lens and the new
improved two-tone flash as well and it
takes beautiful photos like this one
it's probably something you've noticed
about this photo though it's a portrait
mode photo with that beautiful
background blur take it from a single
camera system this is remarkable what
the team is able to do is combine
hardware software to create a depth
segmentation map using the focus pixels
of neural-net software so that we can
create portrait mode photos and the
brand new iPhone 10 R but what about
battery life but here the story
continues to be just great
so let's compare it to the iPhone 8 plus
so many customers love the long battery
life of that iPhone 10 R gives you up to
an hour and a half more on your day than
the iPhone 8 plus have iPhone tennis 10s
