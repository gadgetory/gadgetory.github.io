theaters the movie opened like this but
a long time ago in a script far far away
we're just Los Angeles the opening went
something like this
the first thing that came into frame was
a hand with a lightsaber a severed hand
that enters the atmosphere of the hand
burns away and the bone and everything
burns away and then the whole it goes
sticking into the surface of jakku the
desert planets and Rey lives on the
daisy ridley character and this alien
hand comes in I don't know if it was Maz
but it was an alien hand takes the
lights it away and then the movie
proceeds as you see it okay first off
it's easy to see why this got changed
for one opening on a Star Destroyer is a
much more iconic look and it's a better
call back to the original movie and we
all know how close this movie was the
original copy but also this new opening
doesn't make any sense the last time we
saw Luke severed hand it was falling
down the air shaft of cloud city's core
so unless the bottom of that air shaft
had a wormhole that went to jakku
doesn't make any sense why this would be
traveling through the galaxy at high
speeds
plus I have serious doubts that loot an
actually makes it out of Cloud City with
the lightsaber in it in the first place
I mean I know we see that happen in
Empire but it's not like rigor mortis
kicks in right away on a severed limb
and even if it does that you aren't
making this cosmic journey together
without separating even though that is
what happens to the novel's Vader finds
Luke's hand with the lightsaber and he
gives it to Joyce of both and person
except clone regardless the biggest
thing is that biological matter isn't
the only thing that's gonna burn up
during atmospheric reentry basically
anything is gonna burn up if it's small
enough so unless the lightsaber had some
magical midi-chlorians going on that
made it indestructible that thing is not
going to make it during the descent to
jakku so I'm really glad that this
wasn't the opening to the force awakens
cuz so I might have walked out yeah
thankfully the writers got their heads
together and decided to cut this from
this craft or else a lot more people
would have had to leave force awakens in
the name of
of practicality so let's give those
writers a hand yeah I really just
couldn't grasp this opening maybe they
came up with it make lunch my favorite
character is hands solo doesn't really
hold together for me I don't want to
point any fingers
we've got his hand puff hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
