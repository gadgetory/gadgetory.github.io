we're here looking at Amazon's new
kindle fire HD this is the 7 inch model
there's also an 8.9 inch model both were
just launched today at an event in Los
Angeles and the biggest new change is
just the general look and feel of it it
looks a lot more it's a lot less
blocking and looks a lot more like some
of the tablets we've seen before it also
has a 1280 by 800 display the same as
the Nexus 7 and it looks really great
they've showed a bunch of demos of
videos and some of the new features on
it and screen is really good it's really
sharp and there's some new interface
stuff the it comes with a lot of new
technology that was one of the big
things they talked about there's two
antennas in it so wherever your hands
are you can't block the signal comes as
16 or 32 gigs of internal storage and
it's going to be on sale this fall for a
hundred ninety nine dollars</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
