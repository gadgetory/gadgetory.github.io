house responsible for the
oscar-nominated films Coraline
ParaNorman and the boxtrolls their
upcoming film Kubo in the two strings is
their biggest most complicated an
ambitious feature to date it uses the
biggest puppet they've ever made and the
most sophisticated technology they've
ever incorporated we went behind the
scenes with some of Kubo's key personnel
and looked at what Leica stands for and
what it took to make Kubo happen
our culture here there is something of
an inherent restlessness in the in the
creative culture we always want to
challenge ourselves we always want to
try something new we always want to tell
new and original stories to dive into
new genres to explore different aspects
of what it means to be human and and we
do it in kind of a strange way and that
we are are styled our execution of the
way we make our films is is a
convergence of art and craft and science
and technology stop motion animation
involves building puppets and props and
moving them around on miniaturized sets
shooting their movement one frame at a
time with high def cameras pushed close
enough to make tiny things seem huge
like I use the CGI to hide the armatures
that support the puppets and to erase
the seams in the puppets 3d printed
faces but most of their effects work is
done practically an in-camera by team of
stop-motion veterans as you're
developing a film for the first you know
two three years all you're doing really
is figuring out who these characters are
what this world is what are the themes
that you're addressing what parts of
your own life are you weaving into the
movie to give it resonance and meaning
and then it's only once we feel pretty
confident in our foundations that we
start developing the film visual that we
start think thinking about what the
characters look like what does the world
look like how are we going to bring this
to life how we going to execute
physically to make this thing happen
each supervisors Department breaks down
into teams that work simultaneously on a
variety of production aspects at once
across 72 different sets the sets
rigging support character bodies are
custom-designed and mostly built by hand
once we've got the character design and
the character lineup the first thing we
do is sit with the director the head of
animation and the production designer
and we want to get three really
important sort of things from them we
want to get the director's vision of the
whole film and really what the storyline
for all of these characters is we want
the production designer to give us the
key sort of visually what is important
on this one what is the pattern language
and what is what line are we using using
a straight line or
using a curvy line to create our
character and then of course the head of
animation that person will know
everything there is to know about these
characters before we go into that room
and they tell us what they want from
that movie generally it's like we wanted
to do everything angle really again
again you know we are constantly trying
to raise the bar we're constantly trying
to redefine what we think is possible
for the stop-motion medium and that is
what makes it absolutely exciting and
wonderful to get out of bed and drives
you to get to work and you can't wait to
get here but also causes for a lot of
sleepless nights because you never quite
know how you're going to solve the
problem the fun thing about each show
and also the stressful thing is the
problems and every characters of line
that we walk into on a film will have a
whole line of problems usually about 24
24 puppets who will have 24 problems the
monkey character needed to have
realistic but poseable fur so the design
team wound up coding fur fabric with
silicone rubber they used a similar
technique on Kubo and his mother who
have really human hair on their heads
coated with silicone butyl had to have a
complicated armature that would support
his armor plates but when a move so the
rapid prototype department got involved
in designing interior wireframes for the
puppet rather than just working on the
face and the costumes were meticulously
researched and designed but because the
fabric had to hold poses the clothing on
the puppets is full of wires and tiny
weights that hold each folding place on
Kubo Georgina and her team started
working extensively with laser cutting
and etching the fabrics we always try to
do as much as we can practically an
in-camera and only through experience
are we able to like make those decisions
quicker and and we can look at something
earlier the idea of it and go okay well
I can tell you from experience what the
problems are going to be from an
animation point of view what the problem
is going to be from a camera point of
view what the problems are going to be
from a set building point of view how
much it's going to cost and then it
becomes just a choice by the director
and the producer with Kubo the effort to
use practical effects including building
immense sets that break apart so
animators can access any part of them to
which the characters these sets include
multiple copies a huge sailboat that
appears to be made of tiny leaves a
snowy landscape covered in a crunchy
foam that moves just like snow in the
character step on it and it also
involved making some giant robot eye
balls so the rigging is changed
immensely since Coraline has got a lot
more nuances got a lot deeper into the
actual puppetry and we've taken on a lot
more automation and we're developing a
lot more relationship with our most
control departments the robots can also
be controlled with a bowling ball
interface from live interaction
cooperation cross-platform has become a
key discipline at Leica because when the
designers or directors have creative
goals they don't know how to meet
mechanically they don't necessarily know
which department will be able to solve
the problem the films flying moon beast
became an issue for several departments
because it was such a detailed design it
needed to glow and it needed to fly moon
Beach was unusual just because it was
asking people to exercise a muscle that
they typically don't ever think about
using and we're very familiar with
working with different departments for
different things but when you were
thrust together on a common problem
it was difficult just for little things
like who's who's running it how are we
who's what's the idea do we we go with
and that was where like his sort of
mentality really fell into place in
order to achieve the the look of some of
these characters on and Kouga on the two
strings we knew we needed to try a
different printing technology the powder
printing technology was not going to
afford us what the director wanted out
of these characters so we had an
opportunity because of our reputation
within 3d printing industry to talk to
3d printing companies and start to see
if they had anything in development our
challenge within the RP department is to
never allow the technology to dictate
what we can do and that's I think one of
the things that has made us so
successful as a department because there
was no ceiling we never knew what the
limits of this technology was that
whenever we would see a challenge or
whatever we would see a character design
we had a group of really talented
artists and technician
and wizards that were just willing to
accept it and figure it out I love that
aspect of it I still I'm you know I've
been doing this for nearly 20 years and
I still think it's as close to magic as
anything that I've ever seen so much of
the magic of Laika's movies involves the
care and detail that goes into every
piece
it comes from their staffs experience
and it comes from their willingness to
make each project more ambitious than
the last I worked on Nightmare Before
Christmas in those days we would bring
everyone together to make a movie and
when the movie was over everyone would
kind of just disappear and go their own
ways find other jobs like is different
we you know it's set up as a studio that
will continue to make stop-motion
animated pictures and there's a the
consistency of it allows you to really
refine your processes and really hone in
how you end up making these movies and
when you're able to refine the processes
then the scale of the movies can get
bigger because you're not having to
reinvent every time you come back and
then just the ability to constantly push
the medium you know in new directions is
exciting part we always strive to be as
good as we can we always strive in our
art to be perfect to be isn't to make
these things as beautiful as powerful as
they can but we are human after all
and we always fail the entire film is
filled with all different kinds of
imperfections and failings and it's
something you have to come to terms with
and I think there is something beautiful
about that I think that it's one of the
things that makes stop-motion so unique
is that inherent in what it is it's
crafted by human hands and so it has
that raw human quality it's frustrating
sometimes it's maddening to work in this
medium because of the imperfection but I
think that's one of the things that
makes it inherently beautiful and so we
really embrace that side of it because
it makes these things you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
