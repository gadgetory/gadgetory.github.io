58 years old I was always very
interested in technology even when there
wasn't any I was interested in you know
telling a story in a powerful way you
know I had theater background and I knew
that the people that really got away
with murder literally in the case of the
military or in the case of corporations
I wanted to really borrow from their
their successes in that way and so I
decided to call it survival Research
Laboratories and found it as a company
several times a year we would do these
large and increasingly larger
demonstrations with a bunch of equipment
out in parking lots or sometimes gas
stations and a lot of times just
completely unpermitted and really things
that were as out of control as they
could possibly be
I think that it's important that they're
professional people working to inject a
sense of Anarchy into our day-to-day
lives I think it's more important than
it used to be we had like there was a
Trojan horse it caught on fire the props
who did some junkie in some movie
properties
we had a yeah we closed off poetry do
this art show here that thing got caught
on fire was the only thing that burned
was just that one thing we did what
happened was there was a jet engine that
caught on fire wasn't a special effect
we don't we don't use any pyrotechnics
at all those are illegal when I was in
high school that was when all that
Weather Underground crazy stuff was
going on I mean Bill Ayers was like my
hero you know along with all those other
crazy people the FBI said The Weather
Underground organization which took
credit for the bombing is the same
radical group which was responsible for
the bombing of the US Capitol in 1971
and the Pentagon in 1972
you know I wanted to grow up and be like
that I wanted to be one of those people
like burning down the banks and all that
stuff you know they call them terrorists
now back then they didn't call him that
but you know I wanted to grow up and do
that I want to grow up and fight the
power and you know I ended up growing up
and doing this instead I'm really banned
from San Francisco I pled guilty to
misdemeanor arson with intent to injure
the public which is a terrorist charge
that Ronald Reagan came up with after
they burned down the Bank of America and
Isla Vista the facts on the ground are
that technically it's legal and it's not
that big of a deal but somehow it just
seems a lot of times because people
really get bent out of shape you know
for instance this huge burning prop got
blown by a giant gust of wind that
started in the middle of a show and it
blew this burning debris into a crowd of
people but one person got a very slight
burn on their face I caused a little
panic but the police just the FIR their
first instinct was to seize all my
machines and they didn't like someone
didn't like the mr. Satan head that
started the fire and so they fined me
six thousand six hundred sixty six
dollars and sixty six cents or they
weren't going to give me the machines
back they were gonna keep them we're
doing something right in two senses
because on the one hand we still have a
reputation of being really out of
control and crazy but on the other hand
we're doing it in a safe enough way that
nobody can point to any any injuries
that have happened because of what we
so and I think that's a good balance I
got ahold of a whole descriptive manual
on how to make test batches of rocket
fuel for from Morton Thiokol and it was
the real thing like real space shuttle
feel like the chemicals you need how to
test it how to test the sensitivity I
was like wow this is cool I just
remember I went up in the air
and I remember looking up and seeing the
roof which was about 13 feet up and I
remember it seemed really close and then
I landed on my back and then I looked at
my hand and it was just bones and then I
just blood what I couldn't see cuz my
face was covered with blood because I
had rocket fuel tore my face up the
doctor said you know guy like you we can
help you out and so he hooked me up with
this other hospital where they were
doing micro surgery research on digits
and they for free they put two toes on
my hand and so that's how the GIMP and
came to be a reality so this is the
spine robot here this is the most recent
addition to the srl family of machines
and robots
it's Doctor Octopus or whatever his name
was his things didn't really work ever
but this is an actual functioning
version of that
I'm 16 hours a day you know I go home
and hang out with my family for a few
hours
I'll usually come back at night and work
till midnight I do that five times four
or five times a week and so that's how I
do it because I have to fund all this
stuff too
I'm the guy that if you see me walk into
your company you know that it's the end
I buy tech companies when they're having
a hard time and I sell all their assets
I also buy excess assets from all these
big companies like Genentech and the BAE
Systems
Intel and all these companies I'm known
around here as the guy to go to if you
want to have someone look at your stuff
make you a cash offer on the spot
San Francisco is transitioning from a
manufacturing kind of base to you know
to high-tech and so what happened was
there's all these factories that were
just abandoned with full machine shops
and complete storerooms full of
equipment I went into one of them I was
like this is a magazine you know it's
like they like walked out here one day
and left all the equipment in here and I
was like holy shit and I was like wait a
minute these places are all over the
city from 78 to 1992 they were the last
ones went away in 92 and so you know I
would go out a couple times a week and
just load I never got arrested so I must
not have been doing anything wrong and
that's where all this equipment came
from yeah by hook or by crook you're
rummaging through the pockets of
billionaires because they just need to
get rid of their junk and if you know
how to play it right you can there's
just endless streams of money
in the Bay Area you know so being a
parasite here is a good good place to be
we got a bunch of stuff from Pixar
things from their projection rooms and
stuff and then last week somebody bought
one like that I paid 50 bucks for some
one from Pixar I was like oh someone
bought it for 1,300 bucks it was this
rackmount
PD rackmount audio thing and I looked
and it was like somebody in Emeryville
from Pixar where they came from and I
was like no you're kidding me we had a
couple times with the Defense Department
called us the people from the place that
sold at us accidentally they were do
panicking on the phone we had to take
pictures of a bunch of weird stuff that
looked like it might have come from them
we had to bring those pictures there to
look like we were cooperating and then
we had to bring some stuff back there
they destroyed it in front of the
unnamed federal people I'm 58 and I have
no regrets
I said is this you know should I really
be doing this and I thought about for a
while I was like you know what what else
am I gonna do my ultimate fantasy about
what people should take away from these
shows is that when someone who's been to
a show is on their deathbed the images
from an SRL show or some of the last
things that are crossing the path of
their mind before they expire if you can
get into people's minds so that you're
one of the last things they think of
before they die then you've really done
it so that's always been my goal but I
can't prove that that happened</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
