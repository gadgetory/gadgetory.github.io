we're looking at the Motorola Droid Razr
HD and max HD which are now available
from Verizon Wireless the new phones
look really familiar they're very
similar and parents the last year's
razor and razor max right down to their
sharp rectangular corners and excessive
border around the new 720p display as
you can see the razor HD in the max are
really similar to each other the max is
slightly heavier and even more slightly
thicker but it still provides a 33%
larger battery and double the internal
storage of the standard razor HD over
all the hardware is slightly less
impressive than last year's razors the
general shape of the phone doesn't mask
its large size as well as phones from
HTC and Samsung do which makes a razor
HD feel noticeably larger than the
competition and the angular edges and
abundance of Kevlar on the back of the
phone aren't very attractive but what is
new and improved here is the display
which has been upgraded from an
unimpressive 4.3 inch qHD Super AMOLED
unit to a new 4.7 inch 720p HD Super
AMOLED screen the new display is much
sharper than before it's really bright
and it has great viewing angles but once
you dig a bit deeper into it the cracks
start to show
like other Motorola displays the razor
HD screen is extremely saturated and it
also carries a very bluish cast which
makes whites look really inaccurate
software-wise the razor HD is
unfortunately launching with Android 4.0
Ice Cream Sandwich though both Motorola
and Verizon have promised that an
upgrade to 4.1 jelly bean will be
available before the end of this year
the razor HD features the same minimal
modifications to Ice Cream Sandwich that
we saw on the razor M and they are
pretty much limited to new icons a
modified launcher with quick settings
available to the left of the home screen
and a revised lockscreen with shortcuts
for camera phone and messages inside the
razor HD we find a dual-core 1.5
gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
processor and it performs just as well
here as we've seen in other smartphones
for the most part day to day activities
are fast and responsive apps open
quickly and switching between them is
very easy and it has no trouble running
even 3d games but at the end of the day
the razor HD and razor HD max don't
really bring anything new to the table
that we haven't seen from other Android
manufacturers already
if Motorola's design is your cup of tea
we strongly recommend just going with a
max version since it provides
significantly longer battery life
than the regular model without a huge
difference in size or weight you can
pick up the razor HD from Verizon
Wireless right now for $1.99 on contract
and you can also get the razor max HD
for $2.99 on contract of course with
Google expected to announce a number of
new and ex smartphones in the very near
future it might be best to just wait a
few weeks if you possibly can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
