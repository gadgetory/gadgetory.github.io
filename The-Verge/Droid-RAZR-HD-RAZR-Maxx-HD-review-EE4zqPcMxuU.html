we're looking at the motorola droid razr
HD and maxx HD which are now available
from Verizon Wireless the new phones
look really familiar they're very
similar in appearance to last year's
razr and razr maxx right down to their
sharp rectangular corners and excessive
border around the new 720p display as
you can see the razr HD into max are
really similar to each other the max is
slightly heavier and even more slightly
thicker but it still provides a thirty
three percent larger battery and double
the internal storage of the standard
razr HD overall the hardware is slightly
less impressive than last year's razors
the general shape of the phone doesn't
mask its large size as well as phones
from HTC and Samsung do which makes a
razor HD feel noticeably larger than the
competition and the angular edges and
abundance of Kevlar in the back of the
phone aren't very attractive but what is
new and improved here is the display
which has been upgraded from an
unimpressive 4.3 inch qhd Super AMOLED
unit to a new 4.7 inch 720p HD Super
AMOLED screen the new display is much
sharper than before it's really bright
and it has great viewing angles but once
you dig a bit deeper into it the cracks
start to show like other Motorola
displays the razr HD screen is extremely
saturated and it also carries a very
bluish cast which makes White's look
really inaccurate software wise the razr
HD is unfortunately launching with
Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich though
both motorola and verizon have promised
that an upgrade to 4.1 jellybean will be
available before the end of this year
the razr HD features the same minimal
modifications to Ice Cream Sandwich that
we saw on the razr m and they are pretty
much limited to new icons a modified
launcher with quick settings available
to left of the home screen and a revised
lockscreen with shortcuts for camera
phone and messages inside the razr HD we
find a dual-core 1.5 gigahertz Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 processor and it performs
just as well here as we've seen in other
smartphones for the most part day-to-day
activities are fast and responsive apps
open quickly and switching between them
is very easy and it has no trouble
running even 3d games but at the end of
the day the razr HD and razr HD max
don't really bring anything new to the
table that we haven't seen from other
Android manufacturers already if
Motorola's design is your cup of tea we
strongly recommend just going with a max
version since it provides significantly
longer battery
than the regular model without a huge
difference in size or weight you can
pick up the razr HD from Verizon
Wireless right now for 199 on contract
and you can also get the razr maxx HD
for 299 on contract of course with
Google expected to announce a number of
new index smartphones in the very near
future it might be best to just wait a
few weeks if you possibly can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
