Michael Shane and I've got two words for
you thermoplastic polymers this is 90
seconds on the verge AT&amp;amp;T has decided to
give itself a little something extra
this month the carrier introduced a new
mobile administrative fee for its
postpaid customers it adds 61 cents to
customers monthly bills to quote help
cover certain expenses such as
interconnection and cell site rents and
maintenance 61 cents may not sound like
much but AT&amp;amp;T has over 70 million
postpaid customers so that comes out to
about half a billion dollars in extra
revenue per year as if things weren't
bad enough for HTC Facebook has decided
to delay the UK launch of the HTC first
Facebook confirmed to the verge that it
was going to quote limit supporting new
devices with its Facebook home software
until it addressed user complaints
apparently new devices also means phones
that have already been released just in
other countries Facebook home currently
has an average rating of 2 point 3 out
of 5 stars in the Google Play Store and
finally Microsoft's new Kinect is coming
to Windows the company has confirmed
that the latest version of its motion
tracking device will arrive for pcs in
2014 announced alongside the Xbox one
the new Kinect features a number of
enhancements it can even read your
heartbeat Microsoft will show developers
how they can take advantage of the new
Kinect at the build conference next
month and that's it for today's top
stories coming up tomorrow we sit down
with the first dolphin to have a paper
published by the journal science</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
