here looking at the final build of
windows 8 Microsoft announced the rtm
two weeks ago and now it's available for
developers and manufacturers to download
the changes at this point are small it's
mostly minor aesthetic changes one of
the cool ones is you can now go in and
change the lock screen start screen and
you get a lot more options than you used
to get the default one is kind of a
funky picture of Seattle but you can
change it to a number of different
things and especially on the search
screen you get a bunch of wild options
it's simple and you get all these color
options and you can put really
minimalist ones or really kind of wacky
ones that just don't look good at all on
your computer but it's up to you you can
do whatever you want to do the other big
change is that the arrow glass interface
that was on Windows 7 is now gone
everything's been flattened and made a
little more metro style and it all stays
in line with the color scheme you picked
for Metro so it feels much more cohesive
than it used to and the taskbar and
everything up here has been changed as
well Microsoft's continuing to develop
some of the core Windows 8 apps like
Bing and the news app and even these
aren't necessarily the final versions
that we've seen but you're getting much
more of a sense of what they look like
when they are final from SkyDrive and
Bing to weather and minesweeper and the
metro-style looks pretty good across a
lot of these apps speaking of apps this
store is now open and it's now open for
paid apps and free apps alike it's just
been out today so there's not a lot of
new apps out there but some of the apps
that we've seen like NBC News or
minesweeper or Evernote they're starting
to be developed more and more and they
starting to look really good and again
as Metro as possible and everything's
very unified and looks really great but
that's it that's the final version of
Windows 8 that's going to be available
to consumers October 26th even if you
can access and download it now I don't
really recommend it just because driver
support and apps are still kind of
lagging far behind where they need to be
but two months should be plenty of time
for all that to get sorted out
