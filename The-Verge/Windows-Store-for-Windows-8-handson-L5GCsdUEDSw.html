verge and we're checking out the windows
8 consumer preview specifically here
we're checking out the the new windows
store so first I'll you load it up and
it's it's pretty similar to most stores
you're seeing you know the top paid top
free in the list of new releases seems
to be pretty fast very responsive and
you've got you know things you've got
cut the rope you've got selections from
USA Today the usual finance Vimeo the
Telegraph and there's a lot of apps here
so we're going to hop in check out the
top free apps and we don't have maps
installed yet so let's check that out
you'll find a full overview couple
screenshots here much like most other
app stores basic description full
details and then user reviews and we've
got one already and then over here on
the left you have you know where it
works the basic requirements and user
ratings and so to install all you do is
tap install and it immediately starts
first time you try to install something
when you're logged in its going to ask
you for a password otherwise it'll start
downloading and as soon as it's
downloaded you get a notification and
you can just pull it up here and here's
New York and then you'll also find that
you'll have a tile installed on your
Start screen so early earlier we
installed vimeo and it here and with
maps it's right here additionally
updates are built in so if you go to the
App Store and click on the top right
you'll see all the updates that are
available and fortunately don't have to
go in and select each one you can just
click install and it gives and installs
all three apps or the updates for all
three apps so the Windows Store is
broken down by categories up at the top
in the first view you'll see all stars
top paid top free across all categories
but then as you move to the right you'll
see different categories broken out so
game social entertainment and quite a
few others and some of them you can dig
down and look at top paid top free but
for things like social where it seems
there there aren't too many
there's only a couple apps and to you
don't have full breakouts yet but we
expect as you know more apps are
available on the store you're going to
see these additional breakouts but yes
you see books and reference news and
weather food and dining shopping travel
finance productivity and on and on and
then clicking any of the icons on the
individual page takes you directly to
that app and you can install there
although it's not obvious at first
search is integrated into the App Store
it's not here and you won't see it on
this on the primary pains but we what
you can do is swipe in from the right
and you'll find the search button and so
if you want to go and download evernote
you can type it in and recommendations
will start to show up here live as soon
as you hit search they'll show up over
here on the left and if you have a look
if you have a lot of results you can go
in and search by sort by relevance sort
price and sort by category it's also
worth noting that with Windows Store
whenever you download anything these
apps are going to be available across
all of your windows 8 devices so if you
install this on a tablet here and then
you know install windows 8 on your on
your desktop machine you know you'll be
able to find Evernote synched up on both
of those devices or Vimeo and all of
your other apps so it's consistent
across the entire your entire into
windows 8 ecosystem this is the Windows
Store and it's available now for anyone
that's downloaded the windows 8 consumer
build so go check it out
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
