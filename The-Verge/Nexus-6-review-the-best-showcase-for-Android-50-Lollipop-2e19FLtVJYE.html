phone even if a lot of us act like we
don't having the bigger screen and the
bigger battery gets addictive fast no
matter how hard it is crammed in your
pocket Samsung phones led the trend then
the iPhone jumped in and now Google is
here with a gigantic slab of Android you
asked for it you got it this is the
Nexus 6 it's gotten really cliche to
talk about how big phones are but
seriously the Nexus 6 just feels massive
with a six inch screen technically it's
5.9 six inches it's bigger than the
Galaxy Note 4 it's bigger than the
iPhone 6 plus it's just plain huge the
thing about using a huge phone is at
first it's weird but then it's great and
eventually everything else just feels
too small you can't really use it with
just one hand but because of its curved
sloped back it Nestle's nicely in your
hands it's thicker at the top than at
the bottom which can make it feel a
little unbalanced sometimes the power
button and the volume buttons are smack
in the middle of the right-hand side
which is fine but it does make it a
little weird in landscape it has the
same metal rim around the edges as a
Motorola MOTO X which gives it a
solidity and probably contributes a bit
to the heft it weighs just a half an
ounce more than the iPhone 6 plus the
back is a hard plastic and either white
or midnight blue and it has a sort of
eggshell feel that I actually kind of
like it really is just like a blown-up
Moto X and that's pretty great but it's
a more powerful phone than the Moto X it
has a quad HD display a faster more
powerful processor more RAM a bigger
battery and a second speaker on the
front basically it's top of the line
specs for Android and more importantly
all that powers put to good use the
phone is fast and doubled anything I
asked it to do with no problems the only
time I ever found it to be slow was when
I was wishing the animations in lollipop
or tune to move just a little bit faster
and then there's the screen you already
know it's big and it has an insane pixel
density of 493 ppi you absolutely won't
see the pixels on this thing but what
you will see if you look close enough is
some weird textures and colorations here
and there basically if you tilt the
screen you can see the colors shift a
bit and maybe even see some rainbow
banding but really that's just a nitpick
and it's one of the only knocks I have
against his hardware but on a phone
that's expensive you'd expect it to be
immaculate at any angle there's a big
benefit to using an AMOLED screen though
it's one of the new features on Android
5.0 lollipop and it's called
being displayed right now it only works
on the Nexus 6 your notifications show
up right on the lockscreen and lollipop
and on the Nexus 6 they show up in a
subtle black and white only mode right
when they come in it doesn't light up
the whole screen and it doesn't drain
the battery and it's super useful Google
Motorola also crammed an extra
loudspeaker on the front so you can get
true stereo sound front-facing speakers
are great and even though this doesn't
have quite the audio quality of the HTC
One m8 it's still much better than most
of the competition there's a 13
megapixel camera with a dual LED flash
here and I'm pleased to say it's the
best camera I've used on a Nexus device
it's just wildly better than the camera
on the Nexus 5 but the bitter truth is
that cameras on Nexus devices up until
now haven't been very good so I'm
grading on a pretty serious curve here
the shutter speed is fast enough for me
in a lot of cases it's basically
instantaneous though there's still
sometimes an annoying lag especially in
low light but thanks to the optical
image stabilization you can get some
pretty decent low-light shots the truth
is that it's still not as good as the
iPhone 6 or 6 plus or even as good as
Samsung phones at their best I kind of
feel like the best way to think about
this camera is like golfing every now
and then you get that one perfect shot
nice saturation and tack sharp focus the
kind of shot that makes you think you
could get that shot every time and with
practice you can be really good with it
but sometimes you're just gonna Duff it
we've come to expect impressive battery
life from these ginormous phones and the
new Nexus doesn't disappoint I easily
made it through a day and a half of
regular use and if you're gentler on it
you can probably extend that to two
there's a quick charge feature that will
give you multiple hours after it's just
15 minutes when it's plugged into the
included charger plus lollipop has a new
battery saver mode and lollipop really
is the star here it's a complete and
total redesign for Android based on a
new philosophy for how touchscreen
software should work it's called
material design it's a fuse with bright
colors depth and helpful animations that
give you clues about what the phone is
doing it's just gorgeous and friendly it
sort of sits in the middle of a Venn
diagram of reserved elegance and andy
warhol style pop art which is kind of
not a space I would have believed
existed but it works more than the
design though there are really
thoughtful tweaks you'll find all over
the OS and there's also a new priority
mode that you can tweak so only
important stuff will come through and
you can set that mode to only last an
hour or two so you don't have to worry
about forgetting to go back to a normal
mode the multitasking button now gives
you a basically infinite overview of
your
some of those apps like Chrome or Gmail
can stick multiple cards into that
overview stack which makes it easier to
deal with complicated tasks you can even
set a guest mode if you want to hand
your phone over to a friend there's new
battery improvements under the hood
speed improvements and a bunch more we
have a full review of lollipop to cover
at all but the bottom line is this is
the best improvement to Android in years
my biggest complaint about the software
is that I wish Google had done more to
take advantage of this massive screen
Android was the original home for big
ass phones and you'd like to think it
could be better designed to take
advantage of all that space but when you
turn the phone sideways only a few apps
really give you a noticeably different
view there's one more big thing to talk
about with the Nexus 6 and that's the
price we've all gotten used to Google
selling phones for dirt cheap but this
one retails it's $650 that's on par with
other top-tier phones and like those
other phones Google has finally brought
the Nexus back to most US carriers so at
least you'll be able to buy it with the
subsidy if you want the best Android
phone you can possibly get right now the
Nexus 6 is undoubtedly it but that's
assuming your definition of best phone
includes really really big
we've been watching phones and their
screens get larger and larger every year
and every year we think okay that's
enough that's as big as these get nobody
would want anything bigger and every
year we're wrong but this year I'm
calling it anything bigger than this
phone and it's not a phone it's a tablet
anything bigger and we'll need a fashion
revolution to redesign our pockets and
purses to accommodate all our new
gadgets the Nexus 6 is the limit and it
turns out that the limit is a pretty
great place to be
