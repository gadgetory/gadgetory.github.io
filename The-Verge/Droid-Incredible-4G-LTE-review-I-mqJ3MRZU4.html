you're looking at the droid incredible
4G LTE by HTC a new LTE phone on Verizon
for 149 99 it bears a small resemblance
to the One X series but it is much
smaller and has just slightly different
internals this is a droid incredible
through and through down to the custom
back which has got all those angular
designs and that ribbed thing for grip
there so it's a easy to hold in the hand
and actually doesn't feel too bad
because it has a 4-inch screen on the
inside there is a micro SD card slot for
memory expansion if you like that in
addition to a removable battery the
camera is an 8 megapixel shooter and it
does seem to have the HTC Sense stuff
it's very fast and very high quality I'm
actually quite happy with the camera in
my testing here you can see if i zoom in
it's doing pretty well and relatively
low light of course we have android 4.0
here and HTC Sense customizations on top
of that so that means you're going to
have the multi-tasking menu and all of
HTC's crazy widgets I found that it's
relatively fast performance is pretty
decent I don't have a whole lot of
complaints it's a 1.2 gigahertz
dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
processor so it's really not all that
far off from the rest of the One X
series here you can see I'm taking a
look at the standard browser not the
Chrome browser and although it does a
fairly decent job of keeping up with my
swipes and zooms it's not quite as good
as chrome in this case and it which was
a bit faster of course LTE on verizon is
second to none it is ridiculously fast
which makes it all the more strange that
verizon is being incredibly aggressive
about asking you to turn Wi-Fi on all
the time there is a persistent
notification in the notification area
for Wi-Fi that lets you know you should
turn it on and even when it is on the
notification is still there and I'd like
to thank myself pretty good at sense and
pretty good at understanding Android but
I can't seem to make that notification
go away and I'm not really sure what the
intention is here Wi-Fi is a pretty
standard smartphone feature these days
you'd think that they wouldn't need to
throw it up in your face all the time
other software complaints there is a
bunch of a verizon software added on
top of here this is verizon video which
i also was not able to get to work it it
says it needs to be upgraded but then
the Play Store thinks it has the most
recent version that could be because our
review unit is technically not out yet
so we'll see if that works tomorrow
although I did have more success with
HTC's watch hat for renting video at 149
99 on contract it's pretty difficult to
recommend the droid incredible 4G LTE it
only has a qhd screen which by today's
standards is relatively low resolution
and compared to the galaxy s3 it's not
that good of a deal but if you really
want a 4 inch screen and a relatively
small phone the droid incredible 4G LTE
isn't a bad bet</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
