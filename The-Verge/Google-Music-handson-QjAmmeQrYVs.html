google music got a huge update today and
though the biggest stuff was about
content they had lots of new partners
and new music that people can download
the android app also got a big update so
so you can see it's got kind of a whole
new user interface it's very Ice Cream
Sandwich e you can scroll between albums
and songs and you got playlist and
artists and there's this recent tab
which shows all the things you've played
recently so if you go ahead and play a
song it gives you the option to well it
will give you the option to share by
Google Plus and you can share it with
your circles and whoever you share it to
can actually play the song all the way
through once you can't for some reason
by songs within the app and there's no
link to the market you have to go back
out and into the android market where
you purchase the song but as soon as you
do it'll show up right in here you can
easily make all your music available
offline you can see we've got stuff
downloading here and there's a lot of it
and it's slow but it works and otherwise
it's it's just a pretty basic Google
Music app it's it's nice looking and
it's much faster than before that seems
to be the biggest change it was kind of
buggy and crash prone before and now it
works really really well so that's it
that's the new google music</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
