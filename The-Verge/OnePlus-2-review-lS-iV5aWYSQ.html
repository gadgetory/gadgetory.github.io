great smartphone anymore lots of
companies are selling really nice phones
for hundreds of dollars less than the
flagships from Apple and Samsung no
company has pushed this harder than one
plus and it's one plus two might be the
best smartphone deal you can get
the oneplus 2 follows the oneplus one
which came out roughly a year and a half
ago it carries on the idea of a high-end
smartphone with a price tag that's well
below an iphone or galaxy s6 but the two
is a better device in almost every way
than the one better design has a nicer
display a better camera and has a faster
processor and it's still really cheap
you can get one for as low as 329 bucks
though most people are probably going to
want the 389 dollar 64 gig model
despite its price the oneplus 2 is
really well built phone that can go
toe-to-toe with most any full-price
flagship it's got a nice metal frame
clean lines and it's solid feeling but
not too heavy
the default back cover has a sandpaper
like finish that I really liked it
reminds me a lot of the grip tape on a
skateboard and has a similar effect in
keeping a large phone from slipping out
of my hands you can also swap that back
for wooden design or other materials and
oneplus is selling a handful of these
for about 25 bucks a pop there's no
getting around it though that the
oneplus 2 is a big phone it's between
the iPhone 6 and the 6 plus and notably
bigger than the galaxy s6 it's big
enough that I find it mostly
uncomfortable to use in one hand but not
too big to fit in my pockets that's
largely thanks to its 5.5 inch 1080p
display it's considerably improved over
at predecessor it's the same size and
resolution as before but it's brighter
punchier and has better viewing angles
other phones may have more pixels but I
didn't really miss them here there are
three other things of note in the
oneplus 2 S Hardware it's got a
fingerprint scanner that acts as a home
button and as a way to unlock your phone
without a password it's accurate but
it's not as quick or responsive as ones
I've used on Samsung or Apple devices
there's also a cool hardware
notification switch which is kind of
like the ringer switch on an iPhone it's
awesome maybe my favorite thing about
the oneplus 2 the last hardware
curiosity is its USB type-c port which
is the only way to actually charge the
phone the two comes with one USB type-c
cable and one plus of selling extras for
only five bucks but there's a good
chance you don't have any just lying
around your house like you might with
standard microUSB cables you also won't
be able to easily find replacements in a
store if you're traveling or forget to
pack one these likely won't be problems
in a year or so but right now they're
valid concerns and make using the one
plus more annoying than it should be
fortunately the battery life on the
oneplus 2 is solid I'm able to go a full
day of use without much issue some
people might even be able to go a couple
of days without charging I really wish
you had fast charging though as it is
now it takes three hours of
charged on one plus two while other
Android phones can charge fully in about
a third of that performance is also
really great the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810
processor and four gigabytes of RAM
never feel like they're stressed and the
phone is responsive for most anything I
needed to do oneplus software is also
really light it's a slightly modified
version of standard android 5.1 with a
few minor tweaks but it's mostly a stock
experience the two new camera is a 13
megapixel unit with optical image
stabilization and laser assisted
autofocus it's a much better camera than
on the oneplus one and it's capable of
taking great shots and good to medium
light it can struggle in low-light
though and it's not as good as the s6 or
LG g4 in those situations it's also a
bit slow there's a noticeable lag when
taking a picture than annoying
processing time between shots oneplus
has promised a software updates are
coming to improve the camera software
and performance and I hope they
specifically address that lag but
overall there's really a lot to like
about the oneplus 2 it's well designed
performs well and is really cheap but
that's where the slight hang-up is it's
still really hard to buy a oneplus 2 if
you're interested in it the process
involves signing up for an invite and
waiting for the opportunity to spend
your money on it that's probably enough
of a roadblock for a lot of people to
just go find something else but for
those that are patient the oneplus 2 is
a nice reward</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
