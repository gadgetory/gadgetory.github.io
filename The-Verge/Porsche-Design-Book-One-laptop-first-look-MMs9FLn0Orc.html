we're looking at the Porsche design book
quanta laptop it's kind of a surprise
from overall Congress this year and if
you look at it right away probably the
most obvious comparison I can make into
the surface book this is a little bit
different than the surface book and at
the top we've got the tablet portion
it's obviously a Windows two-in-one I'll
show you that in a minute but it's a
13-point free inch display that's a
little bit smaller than the surface but
display and you've also got six thinking
around in here and you've also got a 512
SSD and a core i7 processor the latest
one so kb lake and seventh generation
Intel processor and put in terms of the
actual design of the laptop yep it does
look like a surface but everyone's going
to make that obvious comparison but
really the main difference here is the
hinge and this is a really kind of
unique hinge I'm kind of seen this on
any other two-in-ones that I've looked
at in the past and as you can see from
the actual hinge here it looks like the
sort of gear box and that you'd have in
a car like a Porsche so what this hinge
really enables you to do is just bid to
push the display all the way down and
you can actually flip it over just like
a yoga book then straight into a tablet
mode and and also what you'll notice is
the actual hinge enables both parts of
this with the keyboard and the tablet
section to be flush and that's the same
when you're using it in the laptop mode
as well and when you close it and put it
in your bag so you're not going to get
that unsightly gap that you get on the
surface book and in terms of actually
using the hinge for more than just the
tablet mode you can also just use it as
a tablet and what you do is you just
enable the little button here and it
unlocks so you can just take it off you
can't put the display on like you would
on the surface bit like that and we
don't really need to because you got the
other hinge and then you've got the
tablet mode so you can use it as a
tablet like this away from the keyboard
and when you're using a way like this as
just a pure tablet you're only going to
get ran about three hours and push your
design to me but if you're using it
docked straight in as a regular laptop
probably around about up to 14 hours and
then in terms of ports and features on
the actual app top and down the side
you'll notice that we don't have any
ports here it's just the button to
release for the tablet mode and on the
left hand side you've got two years B
ports and a micro SD slot and then
you've also got a type C on the laptop
section here and it
type C on the tablet portion which is
actually a fundable one as well and and
the interesting part of these ports
being on the laptop is they're on
they're on the very side but they're
actually at the bottom see if you plug
in an accessory it's not going to dangle
over your keyboard like they do when
they're up the top on the laptops and
same codes for the headphone jack as
well and you've also got a precision
trackpad on here and which feels pretty
good for navigating around windows and
Porsche designers are also added in a
Windows hello camera so there's infrared
cameras at the top here which just
basically allows you to use your face to
log into Windows 10 and then you've also
got a stylus which snaps onto the
right-hand side of the porsche design
laptop and basically this is a Wacom
stylus so it's not quite the same
technology that we have in the surface
devices and but you could do exactly the
same sort of stuff so you can get
Windows ink drawn navigate all around
Windows all that sort of stuff that
you'd expect from from the stylus and as
I say that snaps on right side of the
tablet there okay then the obvious
comparison is the porsche design laptop
versus the surface book so they do look
very similar they obviously the display
on this one's just that tiny little bit
smaller but not really all that
noticeable and but really the difference
I want to kind of point out is the hinge
so also you can both lie these both flat
like so but you'll notice there's a big
gap in the surface book hinge and
Porsche has been able to totally
eradicate that and which is summat we're
hoping to sort of see in the next
surface book so that we don't see this
this massive gap in the hinge and in
terms of like the weight and stuff they
feel they feel very similar in terms of
weight even when you lift a tablet
section off they're pretty similar but
the real the real big difference is is
just literally been able to open these
up and you'll notice on the surface book
I cannot push that all the way down and
I can't flip it straight into the
slightly yoga style mode tablet mode and
whereas I'd have to like take off the
display and then turn it around and then
docket that to get the same sort of
thing so obviously this a pretty good
innovation with the hinge going on here
to allow us to do this mode without all
of that complex moving around so I'm
kind of impressed with Porsche designs
Book One Laptop it's a unique take on
the windows 2 in one thing that we've
seen so many manufacturers try and
attempt
and get some crazy hinges and just some
really ugly designs this is really
polished and it feels premium and which
there's a bunch of you premium Windows
laptops out there but this one just
feels really polished it does feel a lot
like the surface book but it's just got
those additional features just being
able to use the hinge freely like that
and detach it and just like the surface
book and stuff it's it's a nice Laptop
Per I'll be interested to see how it
performs them in review the porsche
design laptop will be available in april
in the u.s. priced at two thousand four
hundred ninety five dollars for more
videos for mobile world congress don't
