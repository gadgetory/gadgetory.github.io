technology editor with the verge and I'm
here today with Paul Pugh he is the vice
president of connected fitness products
for Under Armour and if you happen to
miss Under Armour's announcements
earlier this week at CES then you might
have missed the healthbox which we're
going to talk about as well as some
other stuff that's going on with Under
Armour right now Paul thanks so much for
being here
urghhh how are you feeling so far how's
your si es going well somebody said it
was day one but it's definitely not day
one it's been a busy week and months in
preparation for being here so it's super
exciting but exhausting too yeah it's
definitely exhausting all right well
let's get into it so a couple days ago
Under Armour and HTC put out the
healthbox for people that maybe didn't
see the healthbox it's a bunch of
connected fitness devices all put in the
same box
they're also sold individually tell us a
little bit about what's inside the box
yeah I think I mean it it is a bundle
but it's it's a point of view about
really what it takes
as an athlete to have Total Performance
and so we very carefully curated what
was going to be in the package so it's a
risk-based wearable a connected scale
and a heartrate monitor and the the real
goal here is that we move the
conversation just beyond workouts which
is I think on Dharma as a sort of
traditionally operated and brought
products the workout space but we're
really looking at the total total
lifestyle of the athletes so that it is
their sleep
their fitness level there are general
activity and nutrition and so the health
box really brings that together so you
can track all those things and get a
greater awareness of how you're doing
and then being able to improve your
performance mm-hmm and I'm actually
wearing the the new UA bands which is in
the box I've been wearing it for a
little while now you've got one on two
well you have to be you have to be on on
point right so I mean in a lot of ways
to me as I've been using this I've been
thinking it's a lot like some other
activity trackers that we've seen it
tracks your daily steps your sleep it
has
optical heart rate sensors which may be
some other wristbands don't have and
attracts a variety of different
exercises so when I look at something
like this I'm saying to myself it's not
really the band you're necessarily
trying to sell as the valuable thing
here I mean you're really seems like
you're really trying to get people more
into Under Armour suite of apps yeah I
think so apps now I've also been using
the scale so there's a connected scale
that now is in the health box it's 180
dollars scale on its own health box is
400 and it's kind of fun because when
you step on it it says your name like
for me it says hi Lauren it recognizes
my weight and it tells me like how much
more my don't have to lose or whatever
it is but we've seen a few of these this
year at the show polar has one now a
connected scale and Fitbit has one
whippings has one I like to say with the
with the connected scale like you can
truly never escape your weights yes if
you step on it and you're and you're
maybe you're appalled and you just you
don't want it you don't want to remember
what it is and it's it just gets sent to
the app and it's there and the next time
I open the you a record app it's my
weights there yeah I mean I think it's
you have to decide that that's okay I
mean I think whether you're you know
like whether you're logging food or
logging your workouts or logging your
weight you're just the general awareness
of that process forces improvement so
like there's behavior modifications that
come with the awareness of that data it
may not always be the number that you
want to see but it does sit in your
brain and may encourage you to make a
better decision or in any number of
directions in order to get you know so
the next time you see that number it's
the number that you want it to be right
and you know I could think we try to be
worse a serious company about
performance and so you know like we
don't want to sugarcoat it it's not we
don't do sort of the you know good job
like we're want to be very transparent
about the information and
let's you you know like come to terms
with it and then but we're going to give
you those actionable insights on top of
that in order to you know achieve a good
result and the idea is that when you
send your weight or your activity levels
from these different hardware products
into the you a record app it's also
going to your other apps it's going to
MyFitnessPal stuff from that might run
your goes into you a record right so
you've got you've now have this family
of apps that Under Armour's been
building up over the past few years that
you want people to sort of live in yeah
I mean I think um the roots of the
company to some degree it's been a very
organic growth in itself and and Kevin
the CEO he realized that community in
the same way was helping to help
propagate some of his agenda with
getting people to be more aware of their
fitness so he an armor made some major
acquisitions in this space at bought
MapMyFitness a couple years ago and then
this year excuse me in 2015 they
purchased My Fitness Pal and endomondo
and we've just built an entirely an
enormous community of users of around
160 million now on the platform and we
really believe that community is a
central element to you know like
understanding like you know I gotta be
motivated and then also having the data
to extract really good insights about
athletes that are very much made up like
you then you can learn from
one of the products that's outside of
the health box you guys also announced
our Under Armour's first pair of
connected sneakers they're called the
speedform Gemini and they have a sensor
in them right so to track your runs so
this to me says more than anything that
it really gets back to Under Armour's
core you are an apparel company you make
a barrel and so if you look at the
health box you say okay well there's a
wristband there's a scale there's a
heart strap right but all of that I mean
at the end of the day you guys are just
driving people back to buy more clothes
right you know I mean it's we do believe
that it's all connected like you know
like the it is I mean that is the
business that's driven the company's
growth and and around you know making
great apparel making great running shoes
but we really understand that like it's
not just like that can only get us so
far we really want to be an experienced
company where we're able to help people
at every level of an increase in
performance so like the company mission
originally was you know to change the
way athletes dressed and and make them
down to the very bottom layer of their
clothing and so now the transmissions
really shifting to change the way that
athletes live so that they have a total
awareness of everything it takes and you
know it's all additive it's not just
what you wear but all the preparation
that you went into your sleep previous
night and what you're eating as well but
then the next obvious question would be
when does this tech actually just go
into Under Armour clothing like I've
been using a sports bra yeah I talked
about this on the verge cast last night
I think the li-like didn't know what to
do about it I was like I've been wearing
this bra but I have been wearing a
sports bra that is connected sports bra
from a company called ohm signal when I
first liked that it looked at it I
thought well this is really just a heart
rate strap attached to the sports bra
but the more I've been wearing it the
more that I realize it's actually
providing information like respiration
rate and heart rate variability and
things like that while I'm working out
it seems to me like that's the kind of
stuff like you know the hardware that
you're working on the connected fitness
products you're working on when are
those just going to end up in Under
Armour
you know I think of all those things
like I think the shoes a good example we
like I like to say we want to be
opportunistic about where we can put
sensors and get good economy of scale to
make difference I mean Under Armour II
operates in you know millions of units
volumes and like we want to be able to
deliver that functionality to everybody
all of our customers and the shoe was a
really good place to start and with that
you know we also had some requirements
around usability like with the shoe the
the sensors in there the batteries in
there the customer does nothing there's
nothing to attach there's nothing to
replace they just connect it to their
phone and boom they can get their
workouts instantly well we've got to
wrap this up but I do have one more
question for you what is the coolest or
weirdest thing you've seen so far at CES
the coolest the weirdest thing you know
like I've had so little time to be out
on the show floor I'm super I want to
check out the VW bus because I used to
have a 78 VW bus and it's always held a
special place in my heart and always the
wish that they would bring that product
back so I hear that there's an electric
prototype on the floor someplace oh cool
Paul thank you so much for joining me
I'm really fun talking and good luck
with the rest of CES hope to catch up
with you soon okay thank you write for
