policy emails lately from companies like
Facebook Twitter venmo Spotify this
dating app I used to use or remove which
to be honest I have no idea what movie
even is but I know they updated their
policy so the emails don't always say it
but those new policies are the result of
something called the general data
protection regulation or gdpr
which goes into effect May 25th it's a
new rule in the European Union that's
rewriting how data sharing works on the
internet and almost no one is ready for
it most people don't even know what it
is even a lot of The Verge staff
what is gdpr um data privacy really
personal I've heard of the term GDP our
global I work here but I I really don't
know so it's totally ok to not fully
understand that UDP art because it's
really complicated but basically it sets
new rules for how companies can treat
user data with a particular eye towards
tech companies and even if you don't
live in Europe companies are rewriting
their policies for everyone which is why
you're seeing all those emails the big
difference is that the GDP ours idea of
consent is a lot more intense than
previous regulations so companies have
to ask for permission more often in
concrete terms that means a lot more
click to proceed boxes although the
transparency requirements also mean the
text inside should get a lot more
explicit probably the most important
change is how companies share data
behind the scenes right now visiting a
single website might feed data to dozens
of different companies for analytics
logins and above all advertising but the
gdpr means any company that gets that
data secondhand will have to explain why
they need it and what they're doing with
it so no more sharing data willy-nilly
another cool thing is that EU residents
now have the right to request their data
from companies and ask for certain
information to be deleted or corrected
if it's inaccurate once you put in the
request companies will have 30 days to
respond or face penalties for a big
company like Google or Facebook the
scariest part is the fines if they're
found to have violated the GDP our
regulators can find companies up to 4%
of their global revenue so if that
company is Amazon for instance that
would mean a fine of up to 7 billion
dollars and remember no one knows
exactly what compliance means so there's
no surefire way to avoid the fine
although it's bound to have a messy
start the assumption is that regul
we'll treat the May 25th deadline as a
kind of soft opening giving more
guidance and adjusting as time goes on
still the GDP are really does Marcus see
change in how data is handled across the
world bit by bit the Internet's getting
less creepy and while the u.s. is maybe
rolling back Internet rules and
grappling with privacy concerns around
Facebook the gdpr is a reminder that the
government really can protect your data
when it wants to I'm gonna do is your
data privacy and we're getting a lot of
emails about it from everyone you've
ever given your email to yeah I have no
idea what that stands for all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
