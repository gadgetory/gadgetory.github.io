it's a sporty er version of the regular
Moto 360 smartwatch - which came out
earlier this year this sport watch costs
two hundred and ninety nine dollars and
it's start shipping in early January but
at first glance the two watches look
strikingly similar they both run on
Android wear and have the same round
face the same touch screen display the
same flat tire and the same single
physical button on the side and they
even use the same wireless charging dock
so what are the differences between the
two watches the first thing you'll
notice is that the sport watch has a
silicon band that unlike the bands on
the Moto 360 can't be swapped out it's a
comfortable sweat proof band but the
downside is if your strap breaks you
likely can't replace it without
replacing the whole watch the second
thing you'll notice is that the default
faced on the sport watch shows your
daily goals steps calories burned and
has a shortcut for starting workout
sessions although like the regular Moto
360 there are more than a dozen other
digital watch faces you can use if you
prefer those also the display of the
sport watch has a different hybrid
display technology called
any light it's a cross between your
usual backlit SmartWatch display and a
front lit reflective display so that you
can see it even if you're out running in
bright sunlight like the regular Moto
360 the Sport version has optical heart
rate sensors that read heart rate
through your wrist but the Moto 360
sport watch has built-in GPS which the
regular Moto 360 doesn't have and a
sport watch includes one specific
workout app called moto body running the
batteries on the Moto 360 sport watch
and the regular Moto 360 smartwatch are
the same size with the promise of a full
day of life with mixed use but it's safe
to say that if your workouts are super
long and you're using GPS during that
time on the sport watch the battery life
on that one will drain more quickly
so the idea here is that the regular
Moto 360 is something you'd wear
throughout the day but it's not really
meant for workouts whereas the Moto 360
sport is meant to be the kind of watch
you'd wear for workouts and then still
could wear throughout the day that's
really cool in theory and the Moto 360
sport is definitely
sporty-er but it still feels a little
like the same SmartWatch with some work
out features thrown in rather than a
full-powered sports watch that could
compete with something like a
multi-sport garment which means that
maybe right now the perfect blend of
SmartWatch and workout watch still
doesn't exist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
