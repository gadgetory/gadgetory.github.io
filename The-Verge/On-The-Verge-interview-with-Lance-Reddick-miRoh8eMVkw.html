really appreciate it we turned up the
heat in the building for you I can tell
ya it's very warm and I apologize a good
thing is that when black people get seen
it looks good so you know just keep that
I wish I were black I mean I'm just I'm
just gonna sweat and look like crap well
we really look amazing let's see that's
what fair see that's how you know God
works in mysterious ways because white
people look good dry so it's just I do
look I do look amazing dry that is as a
well known what are we document I like
this interview already this is good so I
want to talk a little bit about your
earlier career I know you've got new
stuff that we're gonna talk about but um
maybe you hate bringing this up maybe I
you don't want me to talk about this but
I want to about the wire a little bit
okay there's a very rabid fan base for
the wire a lot of people say it's the
greatest show greatest drama ever put on
television so that must be cool to be
part of that but but that character your
character in the show is a character
that seems to be people seem to like you
in this character which is sort of kind
of an asshole like a little bit of an
asshole but just get shit done it's
funny because I think embroil is much
more than Astin at least at least for a
season is similar in a similar vein Paul
Giamatti now buddies from drama school
and we were shooting the first season of
Fringe you know we're having lunch and
he was talking about yeah the first
season of French is really was the very
end was the win the last season of The
Wire aired and that's when he really
kind of blew up right and we're shooting
in New York and it was the first time in
my career that I just like I just could
get down the street without being
stopped and I was talking to Paul about
it and he said man is something about TV
- because I didn't he you know cuz
Paul's a movie star
but he said it wasn't a telly did John
Adams that I started getting that and
it's something something about coming
into people's living rooms you know on a
consistent basis and it's not just that
they see you often but they see you as
that person I mean I remember we're
shooting the first season of Fringe and
the makeup artist the head make a person
told me the story she said that a couple
of cops were doing security we were
shooting in New York they were doing
security and they they came to her and
said that guy's a badass and she looked
around she said why and well that's the
character yeah you use Aria playing
badasses do you not do not think of
yourself as a badass
you mean in real life well I don't know
I mean you get cast as a badass my kids
they'll say no really yeah I mean it's
funny cuz like I always think you know
when you see somebody who you know it's
a kind of a gruff character yeah I mean
III said an asshole but it's which is
kind of insulting I now realize but but
it is a character who's kind of like you
could see how that's the character who
kind of gets in some ways can get under
people's skin on the show in a way that
is very forceful and and it's a very
specific role you know it's kind of
gruff but then ends up being a good like
a really good guy and I feel like that
must be something that people see in you
naturally because it's so you're so
often in such a similar kind of role
well but once again the point about it
is it wasn't until the wire I mean you
remember I auditioned for three
different roles for the water and that
was the last they didn't want to see me
for Daniel's at first yeah I just did
four bunk three times that's so insane
because to imagine it as anybody else
seems impossible yeah I just have a bunk
three times and the third time I went in
they wanted to see me four bubbles
really yeah because in my third audition
David Simon was there and he had cast me
as Marvin in in in the corner whose it
was crack head so he knew me as a crack
head and I just played great crack head
and in Oz you know I played in
undercover cop but a guy who gets
addicted to heroin right boylar
yes boiler in case you're watching Oz
hello you know what that shows it's been
several it's like a decade I think
there's got to be a statue of like to
think so that's interesting so it's
crazy though because I show you so
perfectly embody that character I mean I
think it's a job playing Broyles after
that kind of that's what it's like okay
I may be in danger of becoming
typecast yeah I don't think it's
typecasting I mean I think that it's
it's a
I think it's a role that's hard to play
I mean in my opinion it's kind of
because you kind of have to like it's
almost like in some ways you think that
guys kind of a jerk but then you sort of
love them and I think that's a fine line
to walk
am I in my you know Lin I did feel that
I had to get really get into the guy's
head because it wasn't just a matter of
saying the lines and you know acting
feelings so
so obviously the wire is is a big deal
for you but then fringe comes along with
sci-fi something that that you have an
interest in naturally or was that did
you have to come around to the concept
of doing something that was because it
really is you know there is a pretty big
difference in the tone between something
like the wire where like it's like
really gritty really real and then and
fringes obviously feels with it's almost
straightforward action-adventure yes
right exactly was that was that
something was with sci-fi something that
you you you love to start with or was it
did you have to come around to it I mean
I will say I'm a huge Star Wars and Star
Trek fan yeah particularly I mean I have
all seven seasons of Star Trek Voyager
yeah yeah and kept the Kirk but I mean
will William Shatner's portrayal of
Captain Kirk was one of my like I
growing up I just always wanted to be
him yeah I mean I remember when I think
about like I'm over a moat and that's
like one of those Shatner's very throws
himself into the emotion well I mean in
all I'm missing shatters this is blowing
my chances of shattering well
essentially because I feel that um if
you watch his work in the first season
there's really a lot of subtlety and
nuance I mean it's peace he's
mesmerizing to watch right and I just
think that quite frankly as iconic as
that original series has become once you
got into the second or third seasons it
really kind of a lot of the writing
became more and more ridiculous yeah so
he's character that I played that yeah
and when you you know when you're kind
of being the guy mostly who carries the
show and get into me right I just think
he kind of fell into some habits then he
became more like Kirk right and he
almost became like a parody of himself
right but right yeah but no I guess
that's true again I just feel like he
was really
you don't know me yeah I think there is
more subtlety in general in the first
season of that show and and yeah it's
weird to see how it did become it well I
mean look once you establish the
character and this in the place then
it's sort of easy to play inside of that
but it also gives you more rigidity to
the to what you can do
yeah and also you're it's the kind of
thing where and once again I don't I
don't want to spend too much time trying
to defend shadows really you really are
a Shatner defender you well know it's
it's it's I'm just thinking about the
difference in SE the wire for example
you know I remember I I can't say what
shit was but I went I had a meeting at
the end of the last season of The Wire I
started going on auditions for new
pilots and I wanted this pilot edition
in one of the the creators of the show
was big fan of my work and he had he had
been a showrunner on an HBO show and now
this was a network series he said you
know the difference between Sean HBO and
a show network is on HBO they hire you
to do your show a network that how are
you to do this and I know and I and you
know from the things that I've read
about the original Star Trek it was as
groundbreaking as it was it was a
constant fight to keep it just from
being a Western in our space right so
you've got a new thing a new very new
project that everybody's very excited
about White House was it because there
is there's all this other thing to talk
about white house down
explaining white house down to me tell
me what this movies about I mean I think
I know it's about but I want to hear
from you
well it's basically about terrorists
attacking and almost it's successfully
taking over the White House they're just
so crazy to hear it out loud
yeah terrorists taking over the White
House yeah and and it's about kind of
the the channing tatum is the hero and
we could say to heroes and jamie foxx
prison president and almost yeah yeah
the god it just badass ass president
ever and you're in your character is I
play the Vice Chamber the Joint Chiefs
of Staff okay so you're a military dude
yes
and I'm basically the guy in the
military whose in charge of the military
got the host some reason it's given but
it's a little shaky but for some reason
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff is not around so I falls to you
yeah he's like on vacation something
like that listen I know you got to go
thank you so much for doing this
