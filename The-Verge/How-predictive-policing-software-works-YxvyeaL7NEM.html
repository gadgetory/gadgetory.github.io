early 1800s to try and understand where
and when crime happens in the hopes of
better predicting where and when it will
happen again today's crime maps are made
by computers and fed by detailed crime
data police departments routinely scan
their precincts for hot spots places
experiencing a disproportionate amount
of criminal activity with the help of
these maps many departments simply put
cops on the dots in order to prevent
future crimes this hotspot analysis has
become more sophisticated leading to
predictive policing most predictive
policing begins with a grid dividing a
city into squares that can be as small
as half a block beginning with data of
previous crimes computer programs create
a forecast for each square estimating
the risk of a crime occurring there
during the precincts next four-hour
shift but beyond that predictive
policing systems differ in their
approaches pred poll was one of the
first predictive policing tools on the
market and its forecasts are based
solely on crime data what kind of crime
happened where and when it builds on
techniques for forecasting earthquakes
with the aftershocks of the crime
reverberating across the city's grid
then there's risk terrain modeling which
draws on the same basic crime data as
well as features of the city like
proximity to a public transportation hub
a collection of bars in the current
weather or even the phases of the Moon
punch lab uses the same advanced factors
as risk terrain modeling and adds a
learning algorithm a tree based
technique for assigning risk to grid
cells you can think of this like a game
of 20 questions
have there been complaints about
disorderly conduct in nearby recently is
there concentration of bars or liquor
stores nearby is there a subway stop
nearby answering each question sends you
down a different branch of the tree the
end of the process being a risk value
ultimately hunch lab creates hundreds of
these trees and combines them into a
forest to create a robust forecasting
tool will we ever really be able to
predict crimes before they happen maybe
not but even the idea prompts important
questions about how we manage police
resources</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
