you're looking at not ia's new 3310
there's a blast from the past
it's literally 17 years ago almost that
the first 3310 was introduced it was one
of Nokia's most popular phones and they
bring it back for 2017 positive fresh
model and got really sort of vibrant
colors on it this time but it's a 2.4
inch display and it's not really that
spec heavy obviously because it's a
feature phone it's running Nokia's
series 30 platform you're not going to
get a whole bunch of apps and that sort
of stuff is literally the most basic
component knocking sort of offers you do
have snake so they bring back a modern
version of that so if you really
nostalgic that with old Nokia phones and
this is the one to get but yet so the
main sort of features of these sort of
phones perk one days of standby
he got 22 hours of talktime so it's
going to last forever and but yeah it
looks pretty much like the the old 3310
it's not obviously not as chunky as the
last one so nobody dropping it on the
floor like the sort of brick like phone
that it was known for and but yeah and
it's the new twist on on an old classic
and you've got a camera at the back it's
charged by Mike who used to be at the
top and you've got a basic headphone
jack at the bottom that's pretty much it
and you've got the old keys no touch
navigation on this this is really
talking back to the good old days of
2000 before the iPhone and so it's a
real quick look at Nokia's new 3310 for
more videos check out youtube.com slash
