dismantle the NSA's phone record
database my weed guy feels better
already i'm ross miller and this is 90
seconds on the verge i am therefore
ordering a transition that will end the
section 215 bulk metadata program as it
currently exists and establish a
mechanism that preserves the
capabilities we need without the
government holding this bulk metadata
that was from a January 17th speech
where bhama gave his administration
until March 28 to lay out its plan well
one day before that deadline we have an
answer under the new proposal the NSA
will no longer keep its massive record
collection instead the data will remain
in the hands of phone companies like
AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon while the NSA currently
hold his records for up to five years
according dinner at times there will be
no mandate for film companies to hold
anything beyond the 18 months or so
that's already federally required but
how exactly did the NSA get clearance
for this bulk record collection in the
first place well it actually all has to
do with section 215 both the FBI and NSA
have been using section 215 of the
Patriot Act as legal justification for
collecting large amounts of metadata
which was being done in secret until
news of the program was leaked by Edward
Snowden last summer some limitations
have already gone into effect as of last
month the NSA must now get approval from
a judge to access even its own records
where Obama's proposal goes from here is
up to Congress in the meantime the
administration has asked the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Court to renew
the program as it currently exists for
another 90 day cycle for more on this
and other stories check out the verge
coming up next we reveal the names of
more secret NSA programs</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
