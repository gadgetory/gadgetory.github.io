supposed to be inexpensive hardware good
design and clean fast software but the
Moto X has also always been the worst of
Android bad cameras and mediocre battery
life now there's a new Moto X it's
called the pure edition or style in some
countries it's cheap at $399 and it
works on every carrier in the US and
Motorola says that this time the camera
is amazing is this the Moto X that
finally lives up to its promises
the Moto X pure edition looks a lot like
last year's Moto X just bigger as the
same curved shape same metal frame same
front-facing speakers and same
customisable design like the walnut wood
back and our review unit the only
noticeable difference is the rear camera
housing which feels more like a change
for the sake of changing something
rather than having any real purpose but
where the new Moto X is different is in
its size it's now a big phone with a 5.7
inch display but it doesn't feel as big
as it looks like the Galaxy Note 5 the X
pure is a big phone that gives you a
giant display but doesn't feel totally
unwieldy to use and actually fits in my
pants pocket
it feels significantly smaller than the
Nexus 6 despite having nearly as large
of a display the size of the display is
about the only thing the exterior has in
common with the note 5 however the X is
a well-built phone but it doesn't feel
nearly as premium as the note and it
becomes readily apparent which is the
more expensive device when you pick them
up the 5.7 inch quad HD display on the X
is not only bigger than before it's also
got a lot more resolution it's also an
LCD instead of an AMOLED panel and the
colors and blacks aren't quite as
impressive as it used to be it's by no
means a bad screen but it's still far
from eye-popping or class-leading the
exterior has an upgraded processor in
the form of Qualcomm Snapdragon 808
paired with three gigabytes of RAM it's
a powerful chip but it's not quite
top-of-the-line and though there aren't
really any performance issues of note
with the X it doesn't feel as snappy
fast as other high-end Android phones
this year it's perfectly fine for the
vast majority of people but if you want
the best of the best this isn't it that
can also be said for Motorola's new 21
megapixel camera it's far better than
the mediocre cameras on prior moto
phones but despite Motorola's claim it's
not the best in the field it takes
perfectly adequate pictures and good
lighting though it has a tendency to
make them overly sharpened and
aggressively digital and appearance in
low lighting the ex-missus focused more
than the LG g4 or galaxy note 5 and the
images exhibit softness and a good
amount of noise reduction you also
shouldn't bother with a new LED flash on
the front camera which produce unnatural
lighting and put spots my eyes a bright
light shining 2 feet away from your eyes
is exactly as terrible as it sounds
battery life has also been a pain point
for the Moto X line in the past but the
new X is 3000 milliamp hour battery
strong enough to get me through a busy
day without issue I'd love for it to
last even longer especially given the
size of the XP or addition but it's
better than it used to be and par for
the course at this point
the X doesn't have wireless charging but
it does have quick charging can rapidly
refuel using Motorola's included charger
Motorola's approach to software hasn't
changed here and the new X's version of
android 5.1 lollipop is about as close
to what google intended as one can get
outside of the nexus line the few
pre-installed apps that do come with the
phone consists of Motorola's helpers
there's moto display assist motion and
voice controls and a migrated app to
help move things over from your old
phone and since Motorola is only selling
this direct and through a handful of
retailers there won't be any carrier
apps on it regardless of which SIM you
put inside of it
the Moto X pure may be the top of
Motorola's range but the reality is that
it's a really good mid-range phone with
an attractive but appropriate mid-range
price it's not really a flagship
whatever that actually means at this
point and it's not as good as an iPhone
6 plus or Galaxy Note 5 but to do better
than the Moto X you have to be willing
to spend a lot more money and it's not
clear that investment is worth it for
most people to just get a slightly
better camera and maybe slightly better
feeling device as it turns out in 2015 a
really good mid-range smartphone is also
a really good overall smartphone and the
Moto X pure Edition is a best mid-range
smartphone you can get</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
