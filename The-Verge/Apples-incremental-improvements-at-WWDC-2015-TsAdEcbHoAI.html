flocked to San Francisco for Apple's
Worldwide Developer Conference which
gives them their first look at all of
the new features apple is bringing to
its increasing number of operating
systems iOS for mobile devices OS 10 for
the desktop and now watch OS welcome to
WWDC 2015 this developer conference
continues to be the epicenter of change
for not only Apple but the industry
first big thing Apple announced today
iOS 10 El Capitan the next version of
their desktop operating system this is a
very incremental release they emphasized
improved graphics performance there are
some new ways to manage Windows a little
bit more easily and there's going to be
various new gestures for managing your
mail things like that some people are
going to look at this and say it's kind
of boring but me personally I'm okay
with the operating system taking a year
to just get really stable get a little
bit faster work on the graphics
performance and not worry about
introducing some major new feature so El
Capitan is going to roll out as a free
upgrade in the fall it's not going to
change your world but it is going to
make things just a little bit nicer iOS
9 another fairly incremental release for
Apple although it does come with a
handful of big new features one of them
is called proactive a new kind of Siri
that will attempt to anticipate your
needs without you having to do anything
so swipe to the right and you'll see
people you often talk with you'll see
apps that you often use and it will try
to kind of help you get where you're
going without you having to do as much
as you used to before another big
feature in iOS 9 that's interesting if
you have an iPad you can now do split
screen so you could say work on a
document in most of the screen and then
have twitter running on the right-hand
side or you could have you know a web
browser open with a picture and picture
video of something that you're watching
on Netflix if you have an iPad I have a
feeling this is something you're going
to be using a lot apple also showed off
news news reader that will remind you a
lot of Flipboard you tell it your
interests and the publication's you like
and it will
organize all of those together in one
place still a lot of questions about
this as we're heading outside the event
is Apple's splitting revenue with
publishers how exactly is that going to
work I don't know generally speaking I'm
pretty down on these kinds of apps but
apple says they found a way to make
reading beautiful on ipad and iphone
Zanda that's going to be coming out
shortly the third thing Apple talked
about today was watch OS which is of
course the operating system for the
Apple watch which just came out and the
big news here is that starting soon
developers are going to be able to write
apps natively for the watch whereas
before you used to have to route
everything through an iphone so now
developers can build brand new
experiences just for the watch and you
should start seeing those roll into the
app store shortly the last big thing
Apple talked about today Apple music its
long-awaited Spotify competitor you pay
apple ten bucks a month you can stream
anything you want on demand without any
ads it also comes with a global radio
station called beats one that streams
24-7 and a service called connect that
will contain extras from your favorite
artists like lyrics or song demos
there's a lot in there I want to get my
hands on it and play with it it didn't
blow me away but it does have a really
cool integration with Siri so you can
just activate Siri tell it what you want
to hear it'll start playing immediately
the big theme of today was incremental
improvement we saw lots of things that
are getting a little bit better some
people are gonna say that's boring I
actually think it's great this is how
software improves over time at the end
of the day I saw a lot of stuff that I
can't wait to get my hands on</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
