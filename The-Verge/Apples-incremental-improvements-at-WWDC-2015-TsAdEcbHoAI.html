flocked to San Francisco for Apple's
Worldwide Developer Conference which
gives them their first look at all of
the new features Apple is bringing to
its increasing number of operating
systems iOS for mobile devices OS 10 for
the desktop and now watch OS welcome to
WWDC 2015 this developer conference
continues to be the epicenter of change
for not only Apple but the industry
first big thing Apple announced today I
OS 10 El Capitan the next version of
their desktop operating system this is a
very incremental release they emphasized
improved graphics performance there are
some new ways to manage windows a little
bit more easily and there's gonna be
various new gestures for managing your
mail things like that some people are
gonna look at this and say it's kind of
boring but me personally I'm ok with the
operating system taking a year to just
get really stable get a little bit
faster work on the graphics performance
and not worry about introducing some
major new feature so El Capitan is gonna
roll out as a free upgrade in the fall
it's not gonna change your world but it
is gonna make things just a little bit
nicer iOS 9 another fairly incremental
release for Apple although it does come
with a handful of big new features one
of them is called proactive a new kind
of Siri that will attempt to anticipate
your needs without you having to do
anything so swipe to the right and
you'll see people you often talk with
you'll see apps that you often use and
it will try to kind of help you get
where you're going without you having to
do as much as you used to before another
big feature in iOS 9 that's interesting
if you have an iPad you can now do split
screens so you could say work on a
document in most of the screen and then
have Twitter running on the right-hand
side or you could have you know a web
browser open with a picture and picture
video of something that you're watching
on Netflix if you have an iPad I have a
feeling this is something you're going
to be using a lot Apple also showed off
news newsreader that will remind you a
lot of Flipboard you tell it your
interests and the publications you like
and it will
organize all of those together in one
place still a lot of questions about
this as we're heading outside the event
is apples splitting revenue with
publishers how exactly is that going to
work
I don't know generally speaking I'm
pretty down on these kinds of apps but
Apple says they've found a way to make
reading beautiful on iPad and iPhones
and that's gonna be coming out shortly
the third thing Apple talked about today
was watch OS which is of course the
operating system for the Apple watch
which just came out and the big news
here is that starting soon developers
are going to be able to write apps
natively for the watch whereas before
you used to have to route everything
through an iPhone so now developers can
build brand-new experiences just for the
watch and you should start seeing those
roll into the App Store shortly the last
big thing
Apple talked about today Apple music its
long-awaited Spotify competitor you pay
Apple ten bucks a month you can stream
anything you want on demand without any
ads it also comes with a global radio
station called beats one that streams
24/7 and a service called connect that
will contain extras from your favorite
artists like lyrics or song demos
there's a lot in there I want to get my
hands on it and play with it
it didn't blow me away but it does have
a really cool integration with Siri so
you can just activate Siri tell it what
you want to hear it'll start playing
immediately the big theme of today was
incremental improvement we saw lots of
things that are getting a little bit
better some people are gonna say that's
boring I actually think it's great this
is how software improves over time at
the end of the day I saw a lot of stuff
that I can't wait to get my hands on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
