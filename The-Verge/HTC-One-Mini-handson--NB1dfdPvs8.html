graham wheeler director of product
commercialization for HTC is going to
walk through the brand new HTC one
minute so here's the HTC one mini it
follows the same design to the HTC One
so the unibody metal construction with
the antennas built in to the actual back
it has the same pillars that we talked
about with the HTC One so that is a boom
sound so dual frontal speakers it also
has our ultrapixel camera same as the
HTC One and it also has a software with
blinkfeed integrated so that you get all
your news in one place at the same time
the HTC One compared data to a mini
compared to the HTC One is exactly the
same in terms of the experience that we
offer but we've shrunk down a few
aspects for example the screen is a what
a 4.3 inch display we compared to the
4.7 or the HTC One this is a 720p
display it also is running a dual-core
not a quad-core from the HTC One and the
camera module itself is the same
ultrapixel sensor however the HTC One
has the OIS integration to the optical
image stabilization integrated right and
the other thing that's missing is the
NFC antenna that is correct the NFC
antenna is on the top of the HTC One and
we couldn't put it into the design on
the back of the HTC One mini and there's
no longer an IR blaster to top of the
answer again it is for size and
comparison as well the battery is at
1800 milliampere battery as well so it
allows us to have a full use as well so
it is a mini version of the HTC One with
no compromises apart from the ones we
just mentioned but but really your whole
idea is to condense the experience down
to smaller form factor four point four
inch display size and I think you
mentioned you're targeting this to be to
price points lower than the HTC One yet
is there a slightly lower in the price
point to the HTC One to allow it to be
more accessible to the market but it's
actually it offers the same as with
those key things we talked about there's
no compromise to the end-user so there's
a real bad
in that when the handset itself all
right and when is it launching so it
launches in August rolls out country by
country from August thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
