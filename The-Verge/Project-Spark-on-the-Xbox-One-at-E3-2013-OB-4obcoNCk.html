project spark it's a game that lets you
create a game it's on the Xbox one so
right now this is running on the Xbox
one I can control this with my with the
one controller but it's also a running
Chris smart glass so this is just
showing exactly what's on the TV but
when you're using smart glass you get a
slightly different UI so I can move
stuff around I can I can do everything
on here that I can do normally so this
is my player character and I'm gonna add
a goblin right here and so let's go back
up on the screen and so you can see the
the interface is different now and I'm
gonna give this guy a
a brain you've all seen all that all
that sculpting stuff
so this is his regular he's that melee
enemy I'm gonna give him a different
brain say bird brain so it feels fine
this bird
it's a birdbrain now he's got a
birdbrain so if I exit out and I want to
start playing I just start testing and
now I'm playing the game as this guy so
I can fight people I barely can do magic
things
and he's a bird so I ran up to him and
he flew away so now I'm gonna I'm gonna
get back out of here
and edit so I've dried some trees are
popping up but if I want to all of this
is edible so I just go down here add and
edit props move in here
get rid of that one and then if I want
to I can give this tree a brain I don't
know what's on a braid you had a lot of
give a tree but see what sort of braids
we have we're going to make
to make this a third-person adventurer
and now when I took your care what how I
got to delete my character
we sleep that guy now when we test out
this game
I'm a tree
somebody got that goblin but come pick
me up again oh yeah so this spells
there we go now the cops and I'm a
flying tree and that's what project
spark is all about as being a flying
tree and I'm a falling tree nope I'm a
stationary stranger I can still jump so
you can play world's made by other
people you can get objects played by
other people they're gonna sell you a
bunch of stuff to have more objects to
use you can create your own playable
characters out of objects and applied
physics to them
there's a sort of a whole sort of remix
your own adventure game thing where you
kind of choose two permissions and place
objects you can always edit the world
you can cut ahead atever ething it was
kind of like a lot going on in this game
I made a bird that can pick you up and
then I became a tree and got picked up
by bird over but I think that's kind of
what this whole game is about so it's
it's come to the xbox one
coming out in the Xbox one launch window
so
November is probably so we'll look
forward to that and it's free-to-play
and you're gonna spend a lot of money on
DLC
it's projects market</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
