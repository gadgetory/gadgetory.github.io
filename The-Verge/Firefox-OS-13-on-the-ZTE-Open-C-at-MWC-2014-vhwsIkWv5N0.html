we're here in Barcelona Spain checking
out some of the latest things that
Mozilla is announcing towards Firefox OS
platform this particular device is a new
ZTE smartphone that's going to be
released very shortly within the next
month or so to a variety of emerging
markets across the world what's most
significant about this phone and
compared to the earlier Firefox devices
is it's got a much better quality
display it's a higher resolution it's
much faster than the earlier devices but
it's still very much an entry-level
device it's going to be priced around
the entry level it's going to be
marketed to the first smartphone
customer and there's a good chance that
we're not going to see this in develop
markets such as the US or the UK the
other thing that we're looking at here
is the latest version of Firefox OS this
happens to be version 1.3 it's got a new
launcher on here it's powered by the
same technology as what powers
everything me which is an Android
launcher that's been around for a while
so it's able to do intelligent searches
that search both the phone and the web
to give you access to shortcuts and
various things depending on the context
that you add to the search a couple of
the other things that they are adding to
this is a new ways to multitask between
various apps Mozilla doesn't have it in
this version yet but next version will
allow you to multitask by swiping across
the screen to other open apps but right
now you can hold down the home button
and then access your your open apps and
sort of a card like you overall the
entire OS just feels much more complete
and faster than we've seen before
especially compared to the first Firefox
OS devices that were announced here in
Barcelona last year the lag is not
nearly as great as it was on earlier
devices you're able to open apps and
change apps much quicker than before it
really is a much better experience even
though it
is still considered an entry-level
device we should see more from firefox
and mozilla over the course of this year
but we could expect to see devices such
as this ZTE and others from huawei and
Alcatel hitting markets next month</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
