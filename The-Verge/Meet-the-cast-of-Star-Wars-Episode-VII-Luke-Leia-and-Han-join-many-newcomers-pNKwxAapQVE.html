and a perpetually naked Brooklyn I'd
have in common ladies and gentlemen this
is your new Star Wars cast I'm David
Pierce and this is 90 seconds on the
verge speculate no more the cast of Star
Wars Episode 7 has officially been
announced and Hey Hey the gang's all
here Luke Leia Han Chewie r2d2 and c3po
are all returning all played by the
original cast members those six will be
joined by seven newcomers so let's break
it down John boyega probably best known
from attack the block he'll also play a
big role in the upcoming 24 revival live
another day Daisy Ridley she's the
newcomer here not a lot of IMDB credits
at the moment Adam driver who you can
see in his entirety on HBO's girls Oscar
Isaac mr. Lewin Davis himself andy
serkis AKA Gollum king kong and ceaser
from planet of the apes Donal Gleeson
son of Brendan Gleeson but more
importantly bill Weasley in the last two
Harry Potter's and rounding out the new
cast is Max von Sydow a legendary actor
who is in both Seventh Seal and The
Exorcist but more importantly was the
voice of Vigo in ghostbusters 2 but
here's the big follow-up question who's
everyone playing variety is long been
reporting that Adam driver will be the
main villain for the film the
publication also says that boyega will
be a Jedi and that Isaac will have a
quote han Solo look to him and
statistically speaking there's a really
good chance circus will be playing some
kind of CGI creature with surprising
emotional death episode 7 is set 30
years after the return of the jedi shoe
demons in May but the movie won't hit
theaters until December 18 2015 for more
