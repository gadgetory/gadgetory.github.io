is the Acer Chromebook c720 acer's new
Chromebook c720 is an update to last
year's ultra cheap C 7 the C 720 slimmer
faster lighter and longer-lasting than
before and at 249 bucks it's likely to
be the cheapest new Chromebook announced
by Google this year though the C 720 has
been more or less ignored by Google thus
far it is a considerable upgrade over
the c7 Acer has tightened up
manufacturing on the device resulting in
a much nicer laptop the display hinge
isn't wobbly the laptop doesn't flex
when you pick it up the keyboard is
actually pretty nice to type on and the
trackpad is remarkably usable for
scrolling and other multi-finger
gestures the C 720 is also thinner and
lighter than the c7 but it still has a
pretty boring utilitarian design
compared to the flashy gloss and fun
colors at the Chromebook 11 the C 720 is
a snoozer to look at with its dark red
color scheme and pedestrian looks but
it's functionally much better you won't
leave fingerprints all over its lid
every time you touch it for example the
11.6 inch display in the C 720 is the
same size and same 1366 by 768 pixel
resolution as last year but this time is
a matte finish which all but eliminates
reflections and glare the screen is
nowhere near as nice as the panel on the
Chromebook 11 it's not as bright doesn't
have as amazing viewing angles and
doesn't have its deep blacks but it's
perfectly usable and acceptable for this
level of laptop you do lose some neat
design features found on the HP speakers
are on the bottom of the computer
instead of built into the keyboard they
get loud but they really don't sound all
that great you can't charge it using a
microUSB charger and there's no cool
light-up strip to be found on the C 720s
lid in exchange you get a USB 3.0 port a
full HDMI out port along with the USB
2.0 port a full-size SD card reader and
a Kensington lock port while the HP
might be the fashionista the Chromebook
family the C 720 is the workhorse the
improvements to the C 720s design and
build quality are all welcomed but the
biggest difference between it and the c7
and frankly every other Chromebook is
found on the inside the c7 is one of the
first Chromebooks to hit the market with
Intel's new processor known as Haswell
this offers much better performance and
usability but more importantly provides
dramatically improved battery life the C
720 is quoted at 8.5 hours of battery
life by a certain Google nearly double
that of the C 7 in our tests it really
lives up to that claim it lasted over 9
hours and 40 minutes in our rundown test
and in real world use we've been able to
get well over 7 hours of use from it the
biggest complaint we've had from
Chromebooks in the past is battery life
and fortunately the C 720 has no issues
there
along with the new processor Acer has
swapped out the C sevens antiquated
spinning disk hard drive for much more
fitting SSD you lose a lot of storage
space the SSD is only 16 gigabytes
compared to the old versions 320
gigabytes but you gain a lot in
performance and with Chrome OS you're
supposed to be living in the cloud
anyways the new machine powers on much
faster can handle dozens of tabs without
choking doesn't drop frames and video
playback and it's just snappier and more
responsive than any Chromebook I've used
save for the top-of-the-line pixel I
can't say it's as fast as my MacBook Air
but it's fast enough to where it doesn't
get in the way of my work and that's
really the most important factor at
under $250 the C 720 is pretty much the
cheapest laptop that you can buy these
days and fortunately it's performance
stamina Balai it's bargain-basement
price Chrome OS still isn't for everyone
you really have to give yourself over to
Google services and be content with
web-based apps but the C 720 is still a
very capable machine which can't really
be said for many other Chromebooks
Google may be calling the HP Chromebook
11 the Chromebook for everyone but the C
720 seems to be the Chromebook for me
and probably you too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
