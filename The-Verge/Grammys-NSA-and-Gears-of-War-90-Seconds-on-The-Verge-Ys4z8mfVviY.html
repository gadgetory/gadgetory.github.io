Miller and I predict it's gonna rain
right about now no rain this is why we
have rehearsals people may forsake this
is 90 seconds on the verge a surprise
performance by Beyonce and jay-z kicked
off this year's Grammy Awards
perpetually silent robot staff pump took
home four awards including both album
and record of the year grammy
performances are iconic for their
bizarre almost mad libs collaborations
this year exceptionally so as the story
goes after winning Best New Artist
Macklemore actually texted kendrick
lamar fellow nominee to say quote it's
weird and sucks that i robbed you much
love speaking of the Grammys here's one
government agency who probably knew all
the winners well in advance The Guardian
in the New York Times have published new
documents showing how both the NSA and
his British counterpart GCHQ collect
massive amounts of data from smartphone
apps says one slide quote it's on a
phone we can get it all right then well
enjoy this one finally Microsoft has
firmly locked down when its biggest
franchises of last generation the
company this week has acquired the Gears
of War franchise from Epic Games it
appears to be a similar arrangement to
when Microsoft nabbed halo from Bungie
in 2007 while no games have been
announced development for the series
will be handle by Microsoft
vancouver-based black tusk studios
that's it for the day sob stories coming
up tomorrow Madonna pledges to appear in
every performance on the planet oh you
made it strike a pose Ross</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
