Google's Hardware event holding as you
can see the all new pixel 3 and the
pixel 3 Excel so there's a lot to talk
about these devices I'm just gonna start
with the price this one starts at $7.99
for 64 gigs of storage it's an extra
hundred bucks to double that and then
this is 100 bucks more so it starts at
$8.99 and then an extra hundred bucks to
double the storage on this side as well
in terms of design they feel pretty much
identical to the last one so this is my
pixel to XL and you can see they're
pretty much identical in size the
difference of course is that this has
that big ol notch on the front and as I
was expecting as I was hoping the notch
actually doesn't look that bad in person
it looks way better in person than it
does in photos but it is still a
gigantic knife now in terms of specs
they are exactly we expected so we are
looking at a Snapdragon 820 5 processor
4 gigs of ram on both models and a 12
point two megapixel camera on the back
which has an F 1.8 aperture on it on the
front you have two lenses they're both 8
megapixels one of them is F 1.8 and it
has a 75 degree field of view the white
is a 97 degree field of view and the
wide mode is one of the first features
are going to talk about here so what you
do here is you're just looking at a
regular selfie but then you can slide it
out to get more or you know slide it
into zones so it's a nice wide-angle
selfie camera but really the story here
is they've added a ton of just other
features on it so there's Dan Seaford
over there I can zoom in on him
and google says that they have a better
zoom feature that's using the same
technology that astronomers used to fix
zoom we will have to really see if this
is any good because digital zoom is
traditionally bad but Google's talking
big game about it so another feature
they've talked about is top shot which
is supposed to like pick the best photo
if it's you are not smiling in a photo
so I'm gonna take a picture here and
blink and whatever so there I took a
photo and if we tap into the photo you
can see it's blinking and it says pick a
better shot here so I can tap that and
so it slides over to what it thinks is a
better shot I don't know if that's a
better shot or not but there's like a
bunch of stuff here so you can just go
through to the best one obviously the
best one is where I look like a goon and
then it will just save a copy of that
shot in addition to the original shot
the other thing they've done is they've
added a whole bunch of new a are
stickers they've called it playground so
we can go to playground here there's
Neil I there's Dan I'll tap here and
we'll just throw Ironman in the frame
he's just super in their way but I'll
slide him over there now he's out of
their way so there's those guys there's
Ironman he's just chillin doing as Iron
Man thing it will also work in selfie
mode so I can take a selfie here and I
can have Iron Man just he is just
creeping on me he's a creeper another
feature they talked about is night shot
or night mode or night night something
it's able to do really incredible
low-light photography that brightens up
the entire scene so much so that it
doesn't even look real so we're really
excited to give that a shot I have taken
just a couple of photos of this we
haven't had a very long but it does seem
like a very fast camera it seems like a
very good camera and it was able to pull
off portrait mode with some backlighting
on that portrait motor that looked
pretty good so really excited to try
these cameras out there now maybe the
most whiz-bang new feature they showed
is call screening so if a call comes in
you'll see here there's a new pop ssin
for screen call when I tap it it shows
some text here so the first year calling
is using the street
and on the other end this sounds like a
pretty regular conversation because it's
using Google's duplex technology so I'm
just going to speak to this person and
it's going to hopefully Auto transcribe
what what I'm saying and there well it's
pretty loud in here and you can see now
it is Auto transcribing what I'm saying
and then on this end I can just reply
yes it's super urgent please please
please transcribe this call
so that's called transcription it's
pretty wild it also happens completely
locally so that nothing gets sent to
Google servers is happening directly on
the phone going back to the design a
little bit it is a glass back and that
allows for wireless charging and when
it's on a wireless charger it's going to
have a bunch of special features on the
screen so it will wake you up slowly by
brightening the screen before the alarm
goes off it'll show you stuff that you
can see from across the room in order to
do that they did have to make it a glass
back but they've maintained a matte
finish so it's a single piece of glass
here but the top is glossy and then they
sort of I don't know sanded this side
down here fingerprint sensor of course
is still on the back and it it feels a
little bit less recess than before but
it's still you know it's a fingerprint
it works fine now since the back is
glass and of course the front is glass
it is Gorilla Glass 5 and so I'm hopeful
that it won't be to shatter prone but
you'll see there is of course no
headphone jack to speak of there is USB
C for charging and it can do fast
charging as well overall I am happy with
the designs that I expected and probably
tempted
get the smaller one because it does have
a bigger screen than the last pixel
because they made the bezel smaller and
I'm not offended by the notch but I
think it's time for me to go to a small
fall I'll be interested to see what that
what more people want to get so both of
these phones are available for pre-order
right away and in the US they're gonna
be exclusive to horizon but of course
you can go ahead to Google and get them
unlocked we're gonna have much more
about these phones in the coming days
and weeks so keep it locked to the verge
thanks so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
