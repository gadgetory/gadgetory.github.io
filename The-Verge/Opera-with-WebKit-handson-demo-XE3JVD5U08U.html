we're here at Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona checking out the new opera
browser for Android smartphones what
we're checking out here is a very early
build of the browser that uses the new
WebKit rendering engine which is a
marked change from opera which used to
rely on its own presto engine WebKit is
a much more popular engine same
processing engine that the Android stock
Android browser uses as well as iOS a
couple of different changes here they've
cleaned up the speed dial here so they
made a little cleaner you can create
folders from your bookmarks very similar
to icons on your home screen they've
also added this discover tab here which
is designed to provide you content for a
variety of categories and then you can
swipe over and see more of your history
there the whole design of this app
itself has been freshened up to better
fit in with android style guidelines it
looks and feels very similar to Chrome
for for Android you've got an omni box
here for searching and looking up your
various web pages they've got a new tab
interface here that you can browse
through your open tabs and then you have
a drop-down menu to access various
settings one of the things that they've
added to the new version of opera is
this off-road mode which uses the data
compression technology that the they
pioneered on the opera mini browser
which allows you to save data when
you're on the go and it doesn't use as
much data plan upper claims that you can
save about ninety percent of your data
usage by using its off-road compression
browsing within the Opera browser is
pretty good web pages scroll pretty
quickly the WebKit rendering engine
seems to be a lot better than the older
presto engine as far as Brendan
negating scrolling is fairly smooth once
a site has actually loaded and features
things like double tap to zoom and
standard pinch to zoom and all those
work pretty well this is a very early
version of the Opera browser that we're
looking at here but the company says it
will be available in the Google Play
Store later this year</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
