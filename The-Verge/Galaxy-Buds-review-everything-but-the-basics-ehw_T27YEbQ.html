It's like I was so ready for the future
to change my present, yet
here I am stuck in the past.
- Disappointed!
- You know, there's always next time.
But right now, this is not the future,
and if anything, it's
a teeny tiny step back.
This is a Galaxy Buds review.
(mellow hip hop music)
So I've been waiting for technology
to slim down, cut cords,
and be forgettable in a way
for a long time, and
these $129 Galaxy Buds
were my shiny gleam of hope towards that
in the Android ecosystem.
(mellow music)
Now, I've tried AirPods.
I didn't like all the ambient noise.
And although the Jabra Elite
65ts have good audio quality,
they just don't stay in my ears.
So for someone who's either wearing
or carrying headphones
around almost all day,
I was excited to try the Galaxy Buds.
But once I started living
in this cord-cutting future,
I realized the importance
of the necessities.
Like headphones have three jobs, right?
They need to take calls,
they need to play music,
and they need to be comfortable.
Anything past that is a luxury.
And although I want
that luxury in my life,
I'm not willing to give up
the necessities to have it.
But let's first talk about the
luxuries of the Galaxy Buds
because it does pretty much nail those.
Now, coming from the Jabra Elite 65ts,
these buds feel like feathers.
Like, the Jabras are just
way too big for my tiny ears
and every time I put them on,
I'm just like &quot;Becca, in the name of tech,
you must keep wearing these.&quot;
To seat the Galaxy Buds in your ears,
it's as easy as a little twist
and once you get used to that motion,
you kind of feel cool doing it.
Because they just sort of click into place
using the shark fin-esque bit on top
and the earbud tip, it's
surprisingly comfortable.
And if it's not, there's three
other different sized tips
and fins for fitting included in the box.
The case is super small and light
with a USB-C port or the
ability to charge wirelessly.
Now, I am a wireless charging super-fan,
I just love it so much.
So, for me, that's a great feature.
Not to mention if you have an S10, S10E —
or for my European friends,
a Huawei Mate 20 Pro —
you can just pop this right on the back
and via the Wireless PowerShare feature,
they'll charge.
I really don't think you guys are giving
this Wireless PowerShare
feature enough props.
This is super cool.
I've been traveling all week
and when I left, I only had
to bring one USB-C cable.
Every night, when I plug in the S10 Plus,
I just pop these on top
and everything charges at the same time.
That's freakin' cool and I'm all about it.
Anywho, the Buds claim six
hours of music listening
battery life off a single charge,
which I found to be true.
And then seven additional hours
when charged via the case.
Since I was charging them
with my phone each night,
I never really had a problem
with the battery dying.
I even found the touch controls
to be easy to use and responsive.
You cannot change the single,
double, or triple-touch settings,
but I changed my long press
to trigger the Google Assistant.
I do wish Samsung had gone with
swipes for volume adjustments
like the Pixel Buds have,
simply because tapping on a
headphone that's in your ear
is kind of loud and abrasive.
But let's get back to fundamentals
because that's where the future
just isn't beating the past.
First, Bluetooth. Now, I've
tested these on a Pixel 3,
an iPhone X,
a Galaxy S8, and S10 Plus.
And I found that they by far
are best on Samsung devices.
And before the latest
Galaxy software update,
there were definitely Bluetooth dropouts
across all of those devices.
But the video lag on non-Samsung
devices is still real.
Second, let's talk audio quality.
It's fine.
You'll definitely want to go
into the Galaxy Wearable app
and adjust the EQ settings.
I kept mine set to dynamic
for some richer tones
and just a little more bass,
but even with the EQ adjustments on,
I was never blown away
by the sound quality.
In switching between the
AirPods, Galaxy Buds,
and Jabra 65ts, I found the Jabras to have
far superior bass and range.
I even found myself suffering through
the pain of wearing them
in order to keep listening.
Next, I tried the AirPods,
and while they are pretty colorful
and full of bass for their size,
you're just not immersed
because of the design
and the lack of isolation.
But the Galaxy Buds, well,
there's absolutely no mistaking
that the audio is coming
from a very small source
and being shoved directly into your ears.
It's just flat and tinny.
But where the Galaxy Buds really fall flat
is the microphone quality.
I talk on the phone a lot
and it's mostly because I'm
way too impatient for texting
and I'm really bad at spelling,
and well, the list goes on.
But, it's impossible to
make a call in these,
nobody can understand me.
So, let's dive in and do
some real testing together
because you guys need to see this.
Okay so, I have the Jabra
Elite 65ts, I have the AirPods,
and I have the Samsung Galaxy Buds.
I also have an S10 and the S8.
I'm going to be using the S8
connected to all three of these buds
to call the S10.
The S10 is going to be connected
to an H6 Zoom audio recorder
via this giant, kind of crazy cable
that plugs in from the aux port
into the recorder.
Let's hit the road and
let's test these guys out.
So when you're talking on
the Galaxy Buds inside,
it's not the worst.
But when you bring in the Jabras
or you start talking on the AirPods,
or you just go back to talking on a phone,
you start to realize
there's going to be a bigger problem here.
Can you hear me now?
Probably not.
Now, when you take the
Galaxy Buds outside,
that's when the problem
really starts to show up.
And the Jabras, they're a little better
but they still really hurt my ears.
But the AirPods, because of this stem,
it gets the mic a lot closer to my mouth,
so it sounds a little better, right?
So that's when I end up just going back
to using my phone because
I want the other person
on the end of the line
to actually hear what I have to say.
&quot;Hey, what's up?&quot;
(mellow music) Another
feature that uses these
not-so-impressive mics
is the ambient sound.
Now, turn that on to go full robot.
Literally, it sounds exactly
what I image robots hear
because the buds are
taking in the ambient sound
via the external mic
and broadcasting it through the earbud.
It's bad, you probably won't use it,
but it does make you feel like a robot.
Now, the funny thing about all of this
is that Samsung is typically known
for nailing the necessities.
Their devices last a really long time,
their screens are beautiful to look at,
they've even kept the headphone jack,
which, thank you Samsung.
But, with these Galaxy Buds,
they totally lost sight
of those necessities.
Wireless charging, a
great and compact design,
these are all things I want,
but what I need is good audio quality
and a solid microphone.
And, yes, the AirPods exist
and they are most of those things,
but as soon as you connect
them to an Android device,
you lose way too many features
to justify their price.
Which is why I was so excited
about the Galaxy Buds.
Maybe next year, Samsung.
Alright, Jabra Elite 65ts,
AirPods, Galaxy Buds,
what do you guys like, what are you using,
what do you want to be using?
Drop a comment down below,
and we'll see ya next time.
Thanks, guys.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
