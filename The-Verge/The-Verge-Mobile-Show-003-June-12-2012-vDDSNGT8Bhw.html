place called rug Depot it's totally
interesting they don't sell drugs at all
I don't know what they do but they smoke
a lot they're outside smoking all the
time and it occurs to me and I know I'm
not the first person to have thought of
us that cell phones today occupy the
exact same social space that cigarettes
occupied in the 50s they're probably
gonna cause you cancer for you later
down the road and there's this
interesting mix of social and
introverted when you're on a phone it's
just about you just like a cigarette is
just about the drugs going into your
lungs the sweet sweet nicotine but it's
also social because you go out you do it
in a group you're actually talking to
other people it's it's the same thing
basically so we're going to talk about
actually I can't talk about that at all
but you should still stay tuned for the
Virgin Mobile show hi I'm to your bone
I'm glass hello and i'm chris sigler and
welcome to episode 3 of the Virgin
Mobile show for the week of June
eleventh we are sponsored by the Samsung
Galaxy Note and I'm having a really hard
time with this decision to quit smoking
I miss it I intro I think that you need
to just pull the trigger I really do
just pull the train just just go back to
smoking I should smoke in the office
during the Virgin Mobile show that would
be no no no oliv it last would be cool
that way that would actually be pretty
boss if you smoked while you're you were
on the mobile show but no I actually
meant that you should pull the trigger
on quitting cold turkey it's what I
meant oh no I did I mean I stopped using
the the lozenges you know I'll bum a
cigarette every now and then but um you
know I mean the thing the thing about
quitting smoking is it's so painful I
just don't understand why I keep doing
it over and over again well you just
want to do more lies you don't know
about right what's I've lab the quitting
part is a pain for one right I just keep
looking at your right
months well you know what we're not
going to quit any of us is cell phones
that's right whether they cause cancer
or not right it's you know but I think
that we are all too far gone at this
point even if we quit phones cold turkey
we would probably get some weird stuff
on our faces from heavy actually not on
her face is because none of us actually
use supposed to talk anymore we get
right hand cancer is that such that I
don't know if there is such a thing as
hand cancer but you know it's
interesting so there will be let's let's
stop talking about cancer in hands is
getting weird you should get off talking
about other things that are cancerous
specifically iOS 6 and icing always
cheap listen so WWDC is this week here
in sunny beautiful freakishly strangely
beautiful and sunny San Francisco and
Tim Cook on stage he announced a whole
bunch of stuff new macbooks macbook with
retina and they gave a I don't want to
call it a preview they talked about
features on iOS 6 and they said that iOS
6 is going to exist so I mean we need to
run down the features that they talked
about but the reason I call it cancerous
is I at overall with what they showed
with iOS 6 am underwhelmed and
disappointed and I dearly hope that all
this was was a teaser about features and
not an actual preview of what iOS 6 is
going to look like and be my guys leave
pretty strongly no I believe pretty
strongly that they are they're holding
iOS 6 very close to the chest right now
because they're probably going to do
some interesting things with the the
next iphone hardware that will tie into
the software and I even think that we
might see a new UI altogether
significantly reskinned UI and i say
that because if you look at the passbook
app which we should talk a lot about
yeah yeah I get the impression that that
is a very different ux than what we're
accustomed to seeing on iOS going all
the way back two thousand seven until
now and and there are some tweaks in the
app store that kind of for tell where
they might be thinking to you I is going
to go
so yeah I'm cautiously optimistic that
this is going to be very
different-looking OS by the time fall
rolls around I mean discuss this on the
previous podcasts or perhaps the one
before that as well about how this
four-inch iphone with a new aspect ratio
is going to affect the introduction of
iOS 6 and then you software and it does
seem to be the case that Apple is kind
of firewalled the stuff that has to do
with the expanded vertical resolution
what one of the one of the things that
we kind of expected and didn't show up
at WWDC this week is new widgets right
so if Apple ends up using that vertical
resolution primarily to introduce
widgets primarily to introduce new
functionality that is why we're not
saying it today because Apple is
essentially said we'll take that won't
tell anybody about it yet will tell the
guys about all the other new features
among your especially where they hand
here's the source my doom and gloom the
widgets like that's exactly the thing
that makes me concerned because this
would have been it's a developer event
this would have been the time to talk up
here's how to add your own widgets to
the notifications right even if they're
going to do it differently later that's
fine they should have at least like put
out some api's for it the second thing
about widgets is they introduced two new
buttons into the Notification Center the
tweet button and the post to Facebook
button and i gotta say like that's
really troubling that's like i don't
know it's like a Microsoft move it's
it's that's just let's just randomly
sticks and buttons in the Notification
Center because we've got Twitter and
Facebook and you know sure maybe some
people want quick buttons to tweet to
and to post a facebook but to stick it
in like the core of your UI just slap
two buttons into the Notification Center
it just seems a really like scattershot
thing and if they're fighters each of
you think let me hang it if they're
really planning on getting on like
overhauling the whole UI then why would
you even bother like you know putting
these things that you're going to get
rid of later like they mean to put those
buttons in the Notification Center and I
think that it's indicative of a lack of
thought about the iOS core you I maybe
but
we're going to say I want to clarify the
most clarify them for myself so how do
they function because think about
covering the WWDC live event is you end
up focusing on particular issues
particular topics and then you miss out
like half the events why are you writing
about them so they basically news to me
is the idea that you essentially drove
down the notifications pain and then
tweet whatever you're doing at the
moment whether it's a thing in an
application or a browser page whatever
or we share it via Facebook is that what
it's supposed to be there's none
happening by the share button there's a
there's a there's a universal you know
share functionality right i think is
going to let you share via the services
you want to share by no this is just a
quick you know quick tweet or quick
facebook update button in your
notification so it's just a social
update but send a notification Spain
right which by a way that doesn't seem
like pretty superfluous stuff it's also
if you don't know this dude with it we
don't know that those can't be room go
ok let's just say we don't know that
those can't be rude I'll bet you that
those can be turned off in I hope so um
but I mean the thing that drives me
crazy about it is that's not the best
way to do it if you want to have like
really quick social updates do it with
your you're just tight I mean I guess
I'm i guess i'm asking for west but like
that was that's a much better system you
just type out the status update you want
you attach a picture and then you pick
the services you want to post to rather
than having just random but install the
notification erica i got a house i'll
get off this hobby horse but I really it
really does bother me it really does
make me concerned I make well that's a
few calor that's how not thinking
through it like they ought to be your
suggestion is also how Windows Phone
works yeah when you want to post status
update it actually there are some
checkbox it's like you want to post this
to windows live Facebook or Twitter I
think are the options yeah yeah and also
let's also get some credits windows
phone for the addition of deep linking
within applications um the fact that you
can take a subsection of an application
and pin that to your home screen in your
lifetime yeah um it makes oh yeah yes so
my thinking is that's exactly the sort
of thing that Apple and Android should
be
to emulate I think some applications and
some things in Android allow you to do
that particularly with axing your
contacts immediately and all that stuff
but yeah Apple Apple's iOS has been
really limited in that respect this is
why we're talking about widgets well
John Gruber actually wrote about this
recently the fact that uh Android and
Windows 8 both have this notion of
windows 8 calls them contracts i believe
and android call some activities and
they're they're things that they're
they're functionalities that
applications can expose to other parts
of the system and other applications so
they know automatically how to interact
one another that's one thing that iOS
has lacked and I totally agree it's
something that is putting them further
and further behind in some regards and
we're seeing them catch up a little bit
with this share functionality that you
talked about dieter but I think they
could go further and and I want to
believe I mean that this is probably
overly optimistic but I want to believe
that we're going to see a lot of
additional iOS 6 news before the next
iPhone is actually released I hope so do
it go this is this is totally an
underwhelming like why then why are they
calling this iOS 6 it should be iOS 5.5
take Syrio to beta replace the map but
then again I suppose so but then APK oh
yeah the counter-argument though is
don't we go through this same range of
emotions every single year with iOS
where we're we're underwhelmed with it
and then we're like oh yeah this is
pretty cool and then it gets us through
another year it happens every year happy
yeah so hang on so should happen with 45
got me through the year just because it
was like okay I accept that you'd like
you know polished off the edges and fill
out all the features but yeah I just
have a really hard time thinking that
you know basically iOS 5 refresh if
that's what I OS X is is really not
going to be boring to a large group of
people like its iOS 5 got boring to me
but that's because you know I'm a insane
person who's addicted to mobile phones
and so I love trying new you eyes
but I think that not insane regular
people are going to be like really the
you know this doesn't doesn't feel as
you know fluid an elegant and
interesting as some of the other you
guys that are out there I just think is
going to happen I agree with these but I
mean let's not listen go too far i mean
fluid and elegance is probably going to
be something that apple continues to
keep up with iOS i think the issue is
that the last really major and notable
upgrade to iOS came with iOS four in my
opinion when that was introduced iOS 5
was really like ok we'll do a
notification Spain because we need to
catch up with Android and we won't do it
as well as Android I mean I'm still not
impressed and honestly I can't be the
only person who absolutely loathe the
stupid patent that Apple has on this
notification paying I mean this is um
this is consistently morosely iPad the
idea uh I'll tell you what's over there
is one thing I mostly agree with you
Vlad there's one thing however that
Apple does really well with
notifications and that's the granular
control on a per application basis of
how you want those notifications to
appear I wish they had that on Android
okay but they're totally look at you
know ticket yet and if you look at your
notifications playing on your iPhone
actually it really doesn't make
particularly good use of the space like
it's already a small screen and then you
have you know a title for Twitter and
then you have a subtitle for the other
thing and then I think it's you press
the X and then you have to press clear
to confirm and in order to you know
clear away as you say a subset let's say
all the tweets older Twitter mentions
things like that and some particularly
good implementation I I just find a
particular ice cream sandwich I just
find look it's so much slicker now how
do you feel like I always needs to get
away from all of this you know all these
was the word skill morphisms yeah yeah
oh great I was just guessing at I got
the word right um but but yeah it's all
of this chrome that they stick in there
which is just
outdated and it's part of like mac OS 9
or whatever I mean it's pretty ancient
stuff an apple needs to get away from it
I think who is going really in the right
direction with a visual vocalize chris i
wish the stock ice cream sandwich and
apple hasn't really caught up with that
and and i also totally agree with dita
were saying it's kind of moving into
this area words adding features that we
don't necessarily need a guy also got
this vibe with the mounted lion
reintroduction that I cloud is being
pushed so hard when not too many people
that thrilled or excited about unlock
for example I'm not I don't see any
reason to be using iCloud whereas with
mountain lion it's everywhere sooo big
word is kind of being pushed on you and
I do fear the Apple might get into this
area where is trying to push its
features on you too hard which are not
all that useful and not all that
official well there's a specific example
a where there I think that they're
they're stepping on Facebook's toes a
little bit with the shared photo streams
so one the features that we should talk
about but um that you know that I don't
I don't understand why they would both
push Facebook integration very hard in
iOS 6 which obviously is a headline
feature for this platform and then in
the same breath announced that you're
going to be able to share your photo
stream with it with friends or selected
photos out of your photostream with
friends and they can comment on those
photos right but I'm a very two-faced
announcement so let's talk about some of
the other features i mean the the photo
stream thing I mean it's I feel the same
way that I feel about iCloud like it's
super interesting but I really don't
have any idea what the uptake is gonna
be you know it's sort of like I message
I don't know what the apt I mean they
gave a big age stats on high message but
it didn't really seem like whoa insane
to me the thing about I message the
thing about I message is that if you're
an iPhone user you're pretty much an
iMessage user right they did such a good
job about automatically pulling iphone
users into the iMessage ecosystem it was
brilliant
it was a masterstroke on their part I
think that that they can claim pretty
big numbers for that system and and of
course face time is now getting pulled
into that with the integrated phone
Apple ID think that they're doing which
i think is also very smart and a big
slap in the face to two carriers but
it's another story altogether Apple as a
long let's talk about that like why is
it why are they still two separate apps
I mean I there at least are unifying it
right so I mean that's important they
had to have done that but they can go a
little bit further with this oh yeah
yeah I think it's just a matter of time
I think that it's it you know there's
still you know that they're they're
invading the carrier's space and turning
them into dumb pipes so slowly that the
carrier is barely perceive it oh you
know but facetime was introduced in 2010
right and we're just now seeing them
turn turn it on for cellular and the the
next step is going to be a you know it
using facetime is a voice-only
application and then it pretty soon it's
all apples gonna own the entire
communications back that's a pretty um
that's pretty realistic yes yeah yeah I
like this idea of apple just kind of
sneaking it in under their radar yeah
that's very slowly it's like the video
of the the ninja cat where every time
you look look away and look back the
cat's a little bit closer like not that
far that's a yes yeah yes that's Apple
with facetime and imessage in order this
strategy that doesn't seem to make sense
and she was like right up on top of you
and you're like oh yeah they got me yep
but I so guys we hate area that's cool
what does it okay we gotta talk about
Siri like cuz that was yeah part of what
they announced yes that does the one
aspect of iOS that I covered it extreme
depth and then completely ignore what
everything else um well Siri has been
just over hold to the high heavens
honestly I I don't know if it's still in
beta why why is it every part
have to say be 20 beta I think I started
talking about preview software at this
stage I don't know if it left the B
stage yet and if it's an official proper
apple application at this point but
there was just a massive stack of new
announcements with Siri starting off
with now they they have sports scores
from yahoo sports they have player bios
to have stats data a whole bunch of
sports introductions they have rotten
tomatoes opentable um was there on Yelp
so they have a whole bunch of
third-party partners they've added the
abilities tweet by a series so now you
can do completely hands-free devices in
the way that I to open an ice-free
bottom they have nine car companies as
partners which are going to integrate
the button into the steering wheel you
can activate Siri without using your
hands to actually you know hold down the
button on that now that was I want I
want to I want a deep dive on that
particular announcement because I think
that Apple was mincing words there if
you looked at the slides that they were
showing they had a circle or like
virtually every car in the market now
has has a button with like a talking
face on it 4444 it's Bluetooth
connection and that's just it's just a
like a talk about not a bluetooth
headset it's the exact same
functionality it in the slide that they
showed they had that button circled on
the steering wheel in the same breath
that Tim Cook was announcing that they
were working with these 9 car companies
so what I think is going to happen it's
possible that they'll rebrand that
button is like a quote unquote Siri
button on these manufacturers but i
think that with other car companies with
any car that has bluetooth integration
you're going to be able to press the
bluetooth talk button and activate Siri
in fact you can now can't you that's
already feature in iOS 5 yeah the
question is what does what does the
Bluetooth talk button map 2 on iOS i'm
pretty sure master Siri now but I guess
yeah I have
using so long I could be dead wrong
about this so like what they're showing
off their is pretty stupid now it could
be that like the standard protocol for
the Bluetooth talk button doesn't isn't
that compatible with Siri just because I
think that protocol kind of sucks and so
maybe they're working to like create a
custom protocol for Syria that
manufacturers can map to that button I
guess I mean it could go a bunch of
different ways I do take apple at their
word that they're doing something to
make it more compatible so I don't think
they're just like lying that they're not
working with these companies to do
something but whether it's just making
it work a little bit better with the
standard Bluetooth talk button or if
it's like we're gonna give these
companies money to put a serie logo on
their steering yet no I just looked it
up and I'll it already works with the
the Bluetooth call button so okay and I
was five so I don't I don't know if
there's actually anything new here other
than like you say maybe a Serie
rebranding of that button which is gonna
be insane if you buy a car with like
generic Bluetooth compatibility and then
your Bluetooth talk button is going to
have a serial oh go on it or maybe the
the Bluetooth will be engineered in such
a way that it's only compatible with the
iphone I don't know how this is going to
play out i'm not sure the car companies
do yet either so it was just a very very
like hand-wavy kind of announcement that
part I just want point that out sorry to
interrupt you that Ashley's oh that's
okay I mean I do admit ignorance in this
respect because I see I haven't even got
a driver's license battle on the car in
which to use bluetooth gottesman and
where it's true I know it's a big
revelation and come on me no driver's
license and is it there's no time how is
this gonna work when I when I come to
the UK and I'm like Vlad show me show me
your England like let's listen your show
me Wales let's go to Wales like how are
you gonna drive me to Wales and we'll
drive through the the Welsh countryside
how is that gonna work and will use my
chauffeur beautiful we'll have to sell
them it'll yeah but ok and take the tray
yeah but aside from that so from that
this is the funny thing about Syria
announcements I don't know why Apple let
this brat until the end
but Siri is now going to be available
for the iPad it's part of iOS 6 which in
itself is probably enough of a big Syria
announcement because hey the iPad will
kind of expected anticipated it now is
being rolled out um but i also i don't
know how excited or interested in this
we should be do you guys think syria
might be more useful on the ipad you
know aside from one of these extra
features it is with the iphone oh no no
i don't think so i think that emits a
much it's a much more interesting
concept on a phone than it is on a
tablet I mean I'm glad it's on the
tablet I mean I'll use it on my iPad but
i think you know in terms of hands for
use and just you know quickly launching
things and searching for stuff it's much
more interesting on a phone i mean the
thing that actually I like about Siri is
that it sucks slightly less than apples
you know search on the iphone which for
some reason it just takes too long for
me to like initiate the search but now
that Siri can actually search apps which
I can't believe it didn't do this before
you can actually use it as kind of a
quick universal launcher or queen of
universal do stuff on your phone which
it wasn't before and so it's it might
not be a hundred percent there but the
fact that you can tweet from it that you
can launch an app then you can you know
do general google searches like i would
say i don't know twenty to thirty
percent of the times i'm pulling my
phone out of my pocket i'm looking to
you know do one of those things maybe
more actually and so the fact that siri
is now actually able to do that stuff
makes it really compelling and means
that i won't have to worry about the
tiny bit of lag that there is on the
universal search thing that on the
left-hand home screen I mean my biggest
problem with Siri on a mobile phone is
the fact that when i'm actually using a
phone and when I mean a hurry to achieve
something it's usually in public or
surrounded by a few other people with
who I'm not necessarily comfortable to
have a conversation with my phone in
their presence you know so um you know
Siri google such and such
I don't know I mean maybe you American
guys are more relaxed in this uptight
then also we're here in Britain but it's
just not something I would necessarily
think to do or be comfortable with doing
on a daily basis yeah we want me to
wonder if I'll say the one thing I'll
say about ipad integration is that they
might be able to do some interesting
things with the Serie you I that they
can't do on the phone video more screen
real estate but they're not doing it
they like popping it up in a small
window right some way the Notification
Center on the ipad is like a little it's
got a set width I think the Serie thing
is the same set with because I don't
have to redo all the assets for the ipad
i thought i saw a screenshot of like the
microphone taking up the full screen am
I crazy am i imagining you're you're
pretty much imagining that okay and if
you can think of is the voice recorder
app that's the one that dominates the
whole screen there Mike that could be
yeah no it isn't look don't really wrong
like what when I had an iphone 4s I
don't right now but I used to have a for
us um I loved like I was surprised at
how into Syria I got uh mainly for
setting alarms like ninety percent my
usage was setting alarms but that usage
alone like the difference in workload
between setting an alarm on your phone
using Siri and and setting it on like an
Android device where you're fiddling
with it for like ten minutes you screw
up the time you have to go back in and
set it again is immense and you multiply
that by five or seven times a week and
yeah that alone makes it worthwhile so
I'm excited to see Apple push even even
if if Samsung's implementation is a
pretty blatant rip I'm still glad that
Apple's introduction of Siri is pushing
manufacturers in the direction of having
to launch it and in fact I think even
going back to before the android 4.0
launch there were rumors that that
Google was going to introduce a
siri-like service and maybe we'll see
that a tie
this this month who knows it's possible
I mean we haven't actually touched and
the big Google Apple point of contention
which is actually maps right yeah we
should definitely talk about maps they
look so I maps and I 06 looks like a
combination of awesome and a little bit
underwhelming so I mean we're comparing
it against google map and the woman
ilysm is yeah underwhelming an awesome
but Google Maps is the same thing and a
lot of the other so what's awesome that
the turn-by-turn directions look better
than anything else I've used in iOS and
maybe that's damning with faint praise
but it looks really solid and the fact
that it's integrated deeply into the OS
so it shows up on the lock screen and
you know it Siri can that can do turn by
turn navigation like it looks like it
people are going to deeply deeply love
this and they're probably not going to
be unhappy about the loss of google maps
on iOS because I always their google
maps and I almost didn't do turn-by-turn
so I don't think that the vast majority
of people are going to look at this as a
huge upgrade even though I think 60 it
what is it lacking it doesn't have
proper street view right right doesn't
have street view but they're working on
traffic solution which is important and
the aid their crowdsourcing it like
Google does which means that it's going
to be very accurate very quickly when
you roll that out to a few million
iPhones which is good and I'll tell you
what if if the if turn-by-turn
navigation in google maps on android it
didn't kill the PMD market dead this
certainly will like if I were if I were
garm if I were garmin I guess not Tom
Tom they only have to worry since they
have this this deal with Apple but
barman right now I would be going number
two in my pants I mean it's it's serious
for those guys right now it is not
looking good and don't give you our
garmin has this huge non-consumer
business right like they're deeply
embedded in the aviation industry and in
in the in the boating industry and i'm
sure that they can survive on those
divisions alone but the consumer side of
their business is going to start to
become very bleak i think so if Tom Tom
should be worried too I mean
the fact that some of this map data is
coming from Tom Tom like it's like it's
like tom tom is selling the parts to a
burglar to eventually shoot him like oh
you wanna you want to clip for that gun
yeah I got a clip well you want you know
a hammer yeah sure I got a hammer all
you want to trigger yeah i guess i can
give you a trigger oh yeah bullets sure
here's some bullets and then us a lamb
was a shot sample that is a perfect
example of that happening in real life
is skyhook skyhook was providing a Wi-Fi
location surfaced both Apple and Google
and do either those guys use skyhook
anymore nope cuz while they were you
know they they used him for a couple
years to get them you know while they
could ramp up and you know god only
knows that they actually stole skyhooks
data I would have to presume like even
if it was completely accidental I would
have to believe there was some stealing
of that data going on but in the
meantime they ramped up their own
services so now they don't need guy hook
anymore yeah I mean but only the only
question in my mind is whether
openstreetmap gets to survive or you
know Apple and Google stop giving
information openstreetmap but there's no
way that they're planning on you know
licensing maps from from navteq and Tom
Tom and whomever you know they're
getting these maps from long term
they're not going to need to write this
is a disappoint to be made here guys um
and that's the same one that relates to
Nintendo becoming a software vendor for
smartphones yada yada yada that's a
that's a whole other a bigger
conversation but um just because Tom Tom
let's say wants to move into software
doesn't mean that some time assigning us
out there for like you just can't so
dedicated p andy's anymore you can't so
setting up units the same way you can't
sell PMPs I mean Apple in the ipod touch
still the pinnacle of what's been the
most generation most generational most
successful you know portable media
player we have seen right but every
single quarter in spite of all the
growing sales that Apple has I put such
there was a car going down ipod sales in
general going down it's just not a
categorical really has any reason to
exist anymore
so tom toms best idea is actually to
become a software services vendor and
this is the biggest deal that tomtom can
get the biggest day of that anybody can
get in this business so good get that
deal and what you need to do from there
is actually continue to evolve and
continue to be ahead of the other guys
like it's really complacent the thing
that just because you do one do and you
let you let these guys have access to
your data there was somehow you know
beat you or advanced ahead of you I mean
Abby I'm a tom tom tom tom isn't isn't
gonna be able to pull out tom tom was
literally years ahead of everybody else
in mobile mapping there was you know
there was the copilot there was navteq
whatever was but Tom Tom on windows
mobile and palm OS was an incredible
experience they managed to get a mapping
and turn-by-turn navigation experience
on those old slow platforms that was
great and what have they done since then
they've turned into a company that
licenses map data and still tries to
sell some you know some software a
little bit some GPS devices a little bit
but they're right there licensing the
map data to the companies that are going
to kill them I just don't see any way
around this and that's one thing that
they are they there's what what
direction could they possibly innovate
towards to to stay around at this point
well this is the thing the fact of their
licensing the dates out isn't the thing
that's dragging tomtom down the finish
dragging some time down is that the
company hasn't done anything innovative
or interesting over the past two or
three years I just what are they gonna
do nothing well I mean one of the ideas
maybe they shouldn't have licensed it
out maybe they should have not taken
that money and kept the maps proprietary
and made really good software and that
apple would be playing Google off of
tomtom for their mapping solution
instead of just rolling their own right
sure I mean that's a certainly the
better solution if tom tom is doing
better what all i'm trying to point out
is that sometimes demise right now is
owing to the company's own complacency
at least in my judgment i recall maybe a
year ago maybe even longer than that
they did a presentation about doing
some really live up to the minute
traffic updates and monitoring in a
really grand scale like all across
Europe right so you sign up with some
time you get the gps navigation unit and
i think it was something like live
traffic or live traffic plus live
traffic HD it was some really terrible
branding name whatever but the point was
there was ambitious and it was like
we're gonna get you because we have so
many people using our setting that units
we're gonna get you you know the most
up-to-the-minute most accurate data
about traffic everywhere right right and
I was like a big vision of this and
what's happened of it nothing really um
but it usually it doesn't matter what
matters is what he's gonna buy in a
candy based on that yeah fine I mean
granted but two desus point if you could
develop that and then put it on a phone
if you if you could be the person or the
company in charge of that piece of soft
wave if you turn that into a nap then
you have a business model and it's a
very well I mean ways is try to do that
right now TeleNav is trying to do that
right now we'll see if any of them
either am are able to be successful but
you can't fight you can't fight Apple's
own crowd-sourced data they have
millions of iphones in the field there's
no way around that fact and and as much
as the App Store has changed the whole
industry the bottom line is being on
deck matters being the default app on
the home screen yeah that you see
without having to install something
matters and this is just gonna I mean
there's gonna be so little money in this
space but but hmmm Christmas a apples
number of devices in the field I don't
know how useful they are relative to tom
toms gps units because when a tomtom gps
unit is enabled when it's in use it's in
a car whereas most of the iphones when
they're in use on being driven around so
in how does that how does the millions
of millions of iphones out in the field
you know outweigh items because where is
your phone when you're driving
it's in your pocket yes with you or it's
on the dashboard yeah right right okay
but I mean I'm just trying to understand
also how Apple is going to filter that
information because um what if you're
cycling for example and you're moving
along a road or the day goes on my game
these are all basic big data problems
they can they they can see that there
are slow iPhones and fast iPhones
adjacent to each other and they can
deduce that the slow iphone is a
pedestrian or a biker and the fast
iphone is a car I mean Google is out
there are many other companies already
doing this most notably google which
integrates this into every Android
device sold as far as i know i mean like
way in downtown Chicago when I pull out
my when I pull out google maps and turn
on traffic like every single Street in
the city is color-coded by how fast the
traffic is currently moving and that's
because there are hundreds of thousands
of Android devices going up and down
these streets all day that was a bit of
Education for me so it's all right so we
go back to our original point which is
that tomtom is doomed yeah but you don't
see me there till it sells email II
agree that tomtom is totally screwed
right now I don't you sad because it's a
freaking European company and even
though and to be fair to be very fair
put yourself in the shoes of tomtom CEO
or CFO where you have two options you
can either take apples blood money this
you know God knows how much they were
paid I'm sure it was in the tens or
hundreds of millions of dollars for this
deal or let it go to navteq or outer
worlds but yeah someone is getting that
money yes you might as well be you I'd
totally right but speaking of money
let's talk about verizon and what
they've announced today wait wait we
have to talk about passbook we have you
know we totally need to yeah by the way
one one really quick kota google had
their Android Maps so their their maps
in google earth event like a week before
WWDC just so they could get it in and
not look ridiculous yeah and I just want
to point out that like the offline
feature for Android Maps is not new it's
there and it has been there for over a
year in labs all they've done is like
clean up the UI and put it on the main
app so like Google's not feeling very
good about their incoming map data
either right now I look you know it
without I don't I don't often agree with
mg Siegler but I have to say he he wrote
a post after the event that I think hit
the nail on the head which is that they
had nothing to announce and they put
them so they looked really weak I mean
they are in a position of power right
like Google Maps is dominant in the
industry like when you right now when
you think online maps when you think
real-time traffic when you think turn by
turn on a phone you think about Google
Maps they have all the power Apple has
everything to prove they made themselves
look really weak and desperate by
throwing together an event where it was
patently obvious that they had nothing
to announce a week before apple's event
because they knew that Apple is going to
break free of Google there's not the
right move no okay so passbook we got it
thus okay so the the basic functionality
of the app is what you can get like your
your membership rewards cards and like
get them save that information in this
app so that you can like you know flip a
QR code instead of having to pull the
card out of your wallet is that what the
app does my rock yes that's what the app
that is it all it does at the boarding
passes and movie tickets right oh and
and like sports tickets like I think
basically anything that that will accept
admission via bar code can be like put
into passbook right so what in in and of
itself this app is like are there a
million is this a huge problem that
people have that they have got too many
apps for their different ticketing
systems when the reward card systems
looks like money make and market I mean
this app is all about what this app has
a potential to be now what this happens
right I mean I creately it
this is the same this is the exact same
play as facetime and imessage where
there is it's the stealth cat all over
again we're within a generation or two
all of a sudden passbook passbook is
going to magically tie in to these four
hundred million credit cards that they
have stored in Apple IDs and then boom
Apple suddenly has the the most
pervasive mobile payments network on the
planet think about it none of that's
true i mean the immediate thing that I
think of when I hear about this
application is where's the NFC and it's
mo I mean it really does T's to the next
iPhone having NFC because everybody else
is doing it essentially and it's growing
into a hardware stand that if not
necessarily a you know an industry
standard because everybody's trying to
have them over wallet so the does seem
like the yeah exactly they laying the
foundation the building up to this big
announced at FC but like with geofencing
so Apple can do this tomorrow if they
wanted to um well I'd have to take time
but they say here's your iPad and here
is the apple approved checkout system
here's how you can use iOS to have it be
your cash register and you can click
this checkbox and when you click this
checkbox we will automatically create a
geofence around the iPad that you're
using to take payments and people that
walk into that geofence can pay
automatically when they walk in get
something and leave like the same thing
that you know squared paypal and all
those guys are doing for their you know
touch let's just walk in and say hi to
your barista and get your coffee and
leaves thing Apple's already doing that
Apple's already doing that with the
apple store app right right so yeah I
mean I totally believe it so yeah this
is going to be this is this is the start
chris is exactly right it's the it's the
ninja cat of them getting into mobile
payments the only question is we haven't
seen the other shoe drop of who are they
going to partner with who's gonna win
who's going to lose is this going to
involve Isis or not is basically what
I'm getting at
and to be honest the I'm getting kind of
tired of NFC like it's at the end of the
day NFC is as interesting to me as a
magnetic stripe all it is is the way to
transfer a number and it's relatively
secure so even if the next iphone
doesn't have NFC I don't care I think
that this passbook is a sign that
they're getting into mobile payments and
everybody from square to paypal to visa
has been put on notice yeah yep it can
also raise another point which is that I
am actually really reluctant if Apple
doesn't announce a big partnership with
wider industry conglomerate like Isis or
does something with visa that you can
use more expensively than just within
the apple ecosystem if it is indeed
something that Apple tries to keep as
close to in-house as possible I am
really really reluctant to get into it
like I've been thinking about this and
the limitations that I poo imposes on
you in both in software and hardware are
just really annoying and frustrating to
me and one particular one is I've been
working with some multi-monitor setups
on the desktop recently and it's so
freaking frustrating to not be able you
know I have free extra monitors hanging
around my living room / office at the
moment so frustrating not to be able to
just get one of those and plug it into
the imac the reason I can't do it is
because the imac is so freaking advanced
that it can only accept a video or
output video to other Thunderbolt
equipped displays or machines which
essentially means Apple only and it's
just really read them and all of these
limitations that the companies making
and imposing on people I just you know
starting to get on my nerves and if
Apple does this with mobile payments as
well it defeats the entire purpose of
doing it's like okay you take all of my
loyalty cards which I have like zero but
let's assume I have loads you summarize
them you put them together you make my
life easier but then you won't let me
take that and transfer it along to let's
say I decide to go to Andrew
phone what is the point in me committing
myself to you like this is just building
more user dependencies of our socket set
and actually makes me nervous like I am
a little bit worried that I'm going to
not be able to have equivalent services
on Android to what Apple is doing
because Apple has got enough power to
like become say the stamp for mobile
payments and if they don't join Isis and
if that's not then I just I need to use
an iphone or I don't get to do mobile
payments until you know five years down
the road when everybody else gets their
act together right there might be other
areas where that's concerned I message
is certainly one people might be like
you know what I'm turning out by some s
if you don't use an iPhone I'm not gonna
text ya ya sigmax possibly another one
but probably won't like none of that
stuff has actually come to pass but like
it's they're all like it's not crazy to
think that that could happen in any one
of those categories and it right that
bothers me yeah I was my ways is the
only iOS is the only ecosystem where
that is a risk because Android I mean
like I message is a perfect example
android does not seek to replace SMS and
the funny thing to me is that Google's
had I mean Google's been sitting on
google talk since before long before I
Android existed and they could have very
easily turned google talk into I message
long before Apple he even dreamed of the
iphone but what they didn't and and so
yeah I think that that iOS I mean like
you know in my social circle i'd
estimate between sixty and seventy
percent of my friends and family have
iphones so that they are they're clearly
the only ecosystem that stands a chance
of really locking out the entire
industry in key areas like mobile
payments in a very frustrating way yeah
but since this is for talking about the
industry i wanna try and reboot my segue
from earlier on yes and talk about it's
not a segue anymore though because you
just brought it you if you identify it
as a segue is it a segue it's only a
psychic told if you identified
segue it's only a segue if you're
segwaying to talk about segways fair
enough I cannot argue with that argument
eater you are the victor in champion um
seriously i don't know about verizon
because this is this is actually some
really major news and chris coveted but
it as usual and predictably it's not as
good as it sounded from the initial
announcement so Chris please tennis
ladder so I just like to point out that
this announcement this morning fired me
up so quickly and completely yeah I
wrote an editorial in 14 minutes see a
dude editorial st you said it was gonna
take you 40 not 14 Wow ya know 14 14 to
change but is under 15 I like I just
banged it out and got it up because it
was uh yeah I mean it's it's what what
happened was you know we've been hearing
about the promise of shared data on
American carriers for a long time that
the idea is very simple right you'd have
a bucket of data that you could share
among multiple devices in your household
whether it be other family members or
you know you yourself have a laptop a
tablet a smartphone and maybe a car that
uses data because that's a thing now
right like Audi's have 3g connections
for google maps for instance so it makes
a lot of sense to be able to share a
single bucket of data amongst all those
devices what verizon has done is
bastardized that concept by tacking
unlimited minutes and text into that
concept which gives them essentially
carte blanche to charge ridiculous
amounts of money for each additional
device that you add to the bucket it's
almost as much as just at you know
having a separate plan so like maybe if
you had a yet a second smartphone to a
shared bucket of data on verizon it's
forty dollars re are you kidding me like
is so and to put that in perspective
they have a 1 gigabyte shared bucket
plan that is fifty dollars it's
unlimited that the cheapest plan you can
get is unlimited voice unlimited text 1
gig of data for fifty dollars so if you
have two smartphones
you're paying ninety dollars to share
one gigabyte of data between those two
devices hey it's a joke it is a complete
joke and nobody should be surprised I
certainly wasn't that Verizon screwed
this up this badly because they did so
intentionally I mean this was their plan
all along I'm sure that ett is gonna
exactly the same thing AT&amp;amp;T is gonna do
if they do exactly the same thing
they're essentially doing nothing I'm I
have two lines on AT&amp;amp;T and we share a
bucket of minutes and each phone has to
pay for its own data and text messaging
and i'm pretty sure that like the data
and text messaging together comes out to
like 45 bucks so like this is basically
just a glorified family plan right and
right i mean it's kind of interesting
that you can add you know tablets and
USB sticks for relatively cheaply and so
I'm a little bit tempted by that and I
you know I hope ATT follows suit but
it's yeah i mean i have no more analysis
to put on an other than my collaborative
exasperation yeah it's it sucks like I
mean I guess it's cool that now you can
have like a Mart phone and USB stick on
verizon 470 bucks like I guess that's
cool if you want one gig of data to
split between them but but still this is
I think this is a slap in the face to
people who have been advocating for
shared buckets for years now and Rogers
correct me if I'm wrong I think Rogers
does in fact they were the first North
American carrier to introduce shared
data and I think they do it in a more
logical and sensible way some Canadians
might have to correct me in comments but
I think that they do something that
makes a lot more sense than this so a
bit but again it shouldn't surprise
anyone anyone that this happened AT&amp;amp;T
will follow suit t-mobile and Sprint
will probably do something more
reasonable it is the way the industry
works yeah but they also feel like
Verizon is specifically trolling all of
the guys who've been saying give a share
data
give a share data it makes so much sense
because like the actual announcement was
like a very direct no its wording or
phrasing necessary but it was a very
direct response to that demand from
people so Verizon might very well be
just trying to manage the conversation
so previously we could all kind of
gather round this idea that shared data
among the devices make sense you should
only pay for the data the carrier
shouldn't care about which device you're
using it with that makes sense it's a
step in the right direction etc etc so
now Verizon can literally say that it's
taking the step in the right direction
that all of us have been advocating
while at the same time making absolutely
no difference in terms of how much it
charges you and how much it essentially
abuses your wallet while it's providing
it to service right oh oh no I mean it's
it's a pretty villainous glory and make
no mistake right neither verizon or AT&amp;amp;T
in particular really any publicly traded
company but these guys in particular are
never going to do anything to jeopardize
their their profits or to put their
earnings in harm's way if this if this
stood to save a lot of people a lot of
money on their under monthly bill it's
simply 11 happened and indeed it hasn't
happened because they can't I mean the
executives know that they can't put that
money in jeopardy so it this should
absolutely come as no surprise to
anybody it's disappointing yes but not a
surprise so it's not it's not a new plan
it's just it's a it's a marketing
rebranding is what we should sell we
should think of it basically the
remaining you know what we've been told
by both AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon for the past
year we cuz their executives have been
saying for a long time that this is
coming and you know that of course they
didn't give any details on exactly i was
going to work how much it would cost and
they led the world to believe that there
was a lot of work to be done and
figuring out the logistics you know the
behind the scenes infrastructure stuff
on how to share a single bucket among
small to multiple devices and perhaps
that that's true but have this be the
end result of that
effort is is very disappointing but to
your point you theatre and I said this
in the editorial as well really is just
a glorified family plan because this is
a mean that the concept that they're
presenting is the same thing that I'll
resist and family plans the only
difference that they're writing on data
now which they didn't before that's it
all right okay we can move on heaven
actually seen on topic list and I have
no recollection of any other ponies so
what one of the things I wanted to bring
up and we don't need to get into this
for very long but it is interesting the
this one up late last night in us time
the HTC One S is being sold in basically
everywhere in Asia except South Korea
and Japan and certain European countries
and actually thank Eastern European
countries specifically it's being sold
with the s3 processor instead of the
Qualcomm s4 processor and basically the
reason is like the s4 processor is just
really hard to come by because every
single LTE phone needs to use the thing
and so it's you know it's hard to
justify putting it in a non LTE phone
when they're just not around and so HTC
is basically swapped in the s3 crank the
the clock speed from 1.5 to 1.7
gigahertz and is selling it now I mean
it's not a bait and switch because they
are like labeling the phone as an s3 but
if you're in one of these regions you
should you know look at the box before
you buy and decide if you care about
having an s4 processor talking about it
go ahead as you say as far as I know
TSMC is still having some 22 nanometer
ramped up problems and that I think
that's the root cause here you know cuz
s4 is 22 nanometer and s3 is not as far
as i know right right so i mean i think
that this could become a thing at some
point that it could be we might be
seeing just a difficulty getting LTE
phones with the s4 processor I mean is
that crazy to worry about that I think
it might be because the thing would
ramping issues is that they don't tend
to get worse over time they tend to
better so whatever limitations of supply
we're seeing right now I don't think
they would last long enough or what I
mean okay so supply it probably isn't so
much limited as it's not growing as fast
as demand is growing because as as the
HTC One S is being rolled out
internationally a whole bunch of other
companies are rolling out their phones
LTE phones the galaxy has fries about to
come out without tea and the s4 in the
USA is going to sell like hotcakes
presumably so my impression is that this
might last like a month or two but then
actually after that HTC might choose to
just continue with the S free because
the territories that you've mentioned
are generally um was there was a
politically correct sister having this
markets with less of a disposable income
okay so are they charging less for this
was actually brought up in chat here are
they charging less for the actually very
meeting I don't they are someone said we
we definitely need to bring that up so
yeah I don't know I don't think that
they are but I could be wrong well I
mean the Jeff is a HTC guy and he
doesn't miss a bubble show so I'm sure
if I've got an email from waiting for
him right so he's sending centigram not
right now so listen guys a very a very
controversial question that might make
her some debate uh do you think that the
FTC should investigate Qualcomm for
antitrust concerns regarding its
treatment of LTE modems and do you think
that there is some collusion between
Qualcomm and carriers to make sure that
they are preferring Qualcomm modems in
the marketplace because that's
ultimately what's screwing Tegra 3 and
and and other XO knows specifically in
el question markets yeah the question is
are Nvidia and Samsung getting the
cooperation that they need in order to
solve the technical issues of
communicating with Qualcomm's modems
with their own processors nobody seems
to write it that's not it is a Qualcomm
is that Qualcomm is giving them the
middle finger they're like bffs we have
the best LTE modem and we make our own
processors so fu now that I have this
for a fact I mean this LTE she was a big
topic for me to snoop around while at
mwc and I ask the video million
questions about it and they were saying
you know we would love to have Qualcomm
LTE motives in our phones like will love
them we know the best like they're not
even making any bones about it obviously
because in videos LTE modem isn't coming
until next year so they're not competing
directly at the moment they say we would
love to have cocoa melty motives in our
phones or phones with tegra it's just
that Qualcomm won't cooperate with us he
won't work with us the welcome says if
you want an LTE modem you better have a
Qualcomm applications processor in there
with it and you know to me that is
actually fair enough um being one of the
Verge's resident communists I shouldn't
be arguing about free market capitalism
like this but actually welcomes and lt
modems are the freaking best so if
you're making the best modem why would
you not be allowed to exploit it to
improve your market position in order to
keep going with your leadership I mean
it just makes the most sense to me um I
don't really think that carriers are the
ones preferring cocos LT modems I mean
Samsung is essentially forced into it
nvidia is definitely forced into it
because it doesn't have a proper
solution with tegra into using welcomes
modems and application process and and
are just tough you know others make LT
modems they just don't make them well
enough clearly I mean Samson is going to
sell the quad-core Exynos processor with
its own LTE modem in the unit united
states now in Korea so it's doing that
there but what is the point let me ask
you this what is the point of selling
of Qualcomm continuing to sell mDM's
versus integrated msms if they're not
going to work with any any processors
except a peak use what why what why are
they even two separate units at that
point like it stop pretending like you
can buy this MDM and not not connect it
to a to a Snapdragon that's fair enough
that's uh but but but then again maybe
this is just a short-term situation I
mean I don't I don't think like I do
expect this with this visual lift to be
honest when others are going to catch up
walk up this is this is something that's
really arisen over the past couple of
months and also let's don't forget the
Snapdragon s4 is like a really nice chip
in terms of book no it is it is it is a
little time I see it I don't see this
being a lot different than then uh when
Microsoft got into all sorts of hot
water over a bundling internet explorer
with with Windows I I don't see it as
being a lot different than that no no it
is it is because the s4 is good is Laura
not so much a deadtime Internet Explorer
was not bad at that time it explore was
i okay pretty good at that time yeah
right but but here's the thing because
the Snapdragon s4 is a very strong in
terms of performance applications
processor and because of its great power
efficiency people actually liked it and
and there they they look at the other
process and they say whoa I'm not really
losing anything by using pork absorption
so what Qualcomm actually has is a
really strong applications processor and
the best LTE modem so of course program
is going to try and force people into
that combination and of course people
are accepting it because they don't see
that much of a loss it's just kind of a
confluence of events or maybe just
Qualcomm kicking everyone's ass and
being better than everyone um that leads
to the fact that everybody is buying
into kockums hardware I I feel like
Qualcomm is going to continue selling
its LTE modems individually in the
future when others start to actually
compete with what
whether by having much better
application process or by having equally
good LT modems and that's when Qualcomm
won't be able to folks people I mean I
think what size and Internet Explorer on
Windows 95 or whatever was back in the
day is that it is using your dominance
in one market to unfairly compete in
another market and so the question is is
dominance in one type of cell phone ship
mean that you shouldn't be allowed to
leverage that for dominance in another
type of cell phone chip and so you might
look at it regulars might look at that
go there their processors and cell
phones i don't know i don't care or they
might look at it you know the way that
they they looked at it or explore be
like well yeah actually it is a little
bit unfair for them to dominate in the
processor market because they dominated
the LTE radio market right i guess i
don't know i guess i'm with vlad like I
kind of not worried about it because I'm
still able to get the s4 I think it's
you know one of the better processors
out there right now and that's totally
amoral of me but there it is I think
that that what what really caused me to
think about this was that I I knew this
was a problem and I didn't think
anything of it last year in the take or
two /o map for days and and to have that
continued into error and the X in those
days i should say the original X nose
but now to have that continued into 2012
with the next generation samsung and
NVIDIA processors that's when the alarm
bells start to go off for me and I think
that I mean you guys are right like if
welcome legitimately has the best
processor and modem great and carriers
are demanding that modem just because
they know it's the best that's fine but
it you know a within a generation or two
of these processors I think that DC is
gonna have to start saying yes
something's not right here we need to
take a look at it but if they if they
don't maintain um leadership right I
every feel like my Christina because yes
Microsoft getting investigated for
internet explorer uh came up when
internet explorer sucking so bad and
bacliff was essentially forcing a bad
user experience of people but the same
time the EU is also investigating google
for allegedly having antitrust
infringing practices with a search which
is just bonkers to me because google
also exactly like welcome has the best
web services images google images google
maps so i actually want those like my
user experience improves when google
integrates its other vertical web
services into its search results so
excuse doing um yeah it's not the best
but but you right course antitrust
regulators are bit more sensitive to
these things as you should be then we
are it's true uh we talked about the
PadFone just really quickly it's finally
out and it was reviewed and as expected
it's it nails the idea but it misses on
the execution is the quotient or review
that I think pretty much wraps it up I
mean how long I've been waiting for this
bat phone exactly not exactly he's
exhausted yeah that's right yep and it
went through a big revision since then
right right I still want to ruin this
concept I really do like that's why the
phone is still compelling to me you're
crazy man just this is a DOA DOA
actually there was a rumor going around
last week completely unsubstantiated
that eighty was going to be carrying the
PadFone or some variation of it and I
don't know what happened that I think
that rumor evaporated into thin air but
if 18g carries this thing i'm going to
loll ilona flip at phone I'm gonna flip
a pad phone I they're not gonna I mean I
don't know how they're gonna sell it I
don't understand the concept I hate this
thing get out of my face the guy hey I
hate the concept so much like it is
pretty damn just fit right let's break
it down quickly because not every
one of us has been waiting for this full
year I think a lot of us haven't
actually been waiting for it for you
it's just say can I seuss that long to
bring to the market and the concept is
that you have your phone and i believe
is hdmi and mini USB connectors slot
into a tablet which has 10 inch tablet
which has a little port at the backlit
where the phone slides into and then
that in turn turns it into a tablet so
the processor and the 3g modem inside
the phone also function power up the
tablet which in itself is just a display
with a large battery as two speakers in
it and some extra ports that's the whole
idea I really think though that nobody
should be surprised by the fact that the
execution is not good it's as concepts
go and as ideas go this is one of those
really really futuristic ones it's kind
of like back of the day when I was
really excited about consoles and what
the next generation of consoles might
bring I used to think about controllers
that you could like collapse into
smaller shapes you know kind of like
collapsible bikes and the reason we
don't have those controllers nowadays
and every controller is kind of just
moded out of plastic is because they're
horribly horribly difficult to execute
and to do correctly this is why these
things don't exist and it was actually
think these things don't exist because
nobody would ever want a collapsible
controller like what what is good what
problem does that solve space and you
know you have is your apartment that
small that you dont have space for an
xbox of control over i'm really confused
oh okay i was i was a teenager I had a
wild imagination I think I had a dream
about this it was like a PlayStation
controller that you could I don't know
it was kind of like a Rubik's Cube
something you could just you know do
things with it and make it smaller or
like a cube and it would just be like
pretty good looking and then just unwind
it again and in its controller again
I mean come on let's be honest if you're
going to move your console around and
maybe you want to carry in a backpack I
mean these are big consoles nowadays but
back then they comes was used to be
smaller I'm glad control to us all not
it not a collapsible controller okay
well fine collapsible consoles are also
really hot execute stop take an issue
with my teenage concept okay I know this
but it is the same kind of thing it's
like in your imagination it's like yes
we're gonna do this um it sounds like
awesome it's a really awesome idea and
stop saying that mighty isn't awesome ah
but this is what a powerful represents
it's one of those things that a lot of
people can or one of those things that
really resonates with a lot of people
because they see the idea of I'll take
my phone a plug it in to establish all
of us anything now there's also a
transformer parts of it so you can plug
the phone into the tablet and then plug
the tablet into a keyboard and the
keyboard itself also has a battery so I
mean you can get some stupendous battery
life out of the whole figment David gave
this a 10 out of 10 for battle in life
so that's a point for credit okay is
loot liya Motorola going in the same
direction with the next atrix or are
they doing that now where the the stupid
laptop laptop thing is basically just
the same thing just Ice Cream Sandwich
just blown up like the thing that kills
me about the execution being so bad on
this is Android seems like it's at the
point where the execution doesn't need
to be inherently bad about this and you
don't need to have anything insane and
create and magical to make it feel
elegant just like tell Android that it
has a different screen resolution and
you're done right I mean or is it is
that just is that so hard it I wanna
believe this can work and that there's
no reason there's no inherent reason
that we can't just have this work
resolution independence is one of
androids grave strengths and great
weaknesses because that is one of the
main reasons that Android apps look like
crap is because the the app is
is putting too much effort or not the
app the framework the application
framework is putting too much effort
into ensuring resolution independent so
you can scale this to you know anywhere
from hvga to to a tablet and and and so
I I personally think that is I mean look
google has to obviously support very
very rich resolution independence in
android there's no way around it but i
also think that's one of apple's great
strengths and iOS is the fact that they
don't have to you well don't sugarcoat
you message about how apps on android
look Chris Wow they what they look I
said they look like crap I know but now
let's about right actually hey Sascha
Segan actually um we should we should
find this link for our listeners Sascha
Segan of pc magazine put together a
really awesome gallery and article a
couple months ago in fact we wrote about
it on our site about how bad android
tablet apps look and and going into the
details the resolution independence a
bed but never that you talking about
just a minute up see well I'm talking
about I'm talking about the the
resolution independent nature of Android
and the fact that in many cases you're
running the same apps on on the article
3 as always your iPad win the ipad wins
because android tablet apps suck an
illustrated guide and its really that's
great honey we can't disagree with that
and that much is valid and fair enough
but then hey Google why you is coming
fun times well I really get what Google
i/o does mean that the Android tablets
can matter beyond amiable wait we will
be in attendance will probably get one
of those a 27 inch nexus tablets that
nobody wants to announce but everybody
knows gonna run Tegra free right and
jelly bean yeah jkb oh these names I
hate these days so let me just let
yourselves in jelly big man I mean how
can you feel a professional in your
industry if you spend half your time
talking about these things
now in the worst part is that brings
everybody else down so during the WWDC
keynote somebody at Apple they're making
fun rightfully so of you know iOS is on
a huge percentage of devices iOS 5
whereas android 4 is on a very tiny
percentage of devices and they referred
to it as a dairy product and I'm sorry
you're above that pun Apple you are
better than that pun and the fact that
Google is picking these cutesy names
means that everybody gets forced to make
these sad jokes it's like calling the
iphone the fruit phone it's like come on
really it's okay to just call it the
iphone it's okay to just well it was a
public area I'm missing a missing ice
cream sandwich dairy yeah but but why
would the other blue velvet a dairy
product because they were there trying
to be clever and not refer to it by name
because I don't know oh oh okay well
that's not really a pun it's kind of um
I know as an English resident to think I
am an authority on puns okay it's kind
of a euphemism to avoid it's open it's
like it's like it's like a collapsible
pun it was upon but then it got broken
down and it's really hard to get those
right and so I just I missed the mark on
it it's a pun phone oh no it just smokes
from everybody in Chad dixit Vlad and I
hate each other and it's could be
further from the truth the truth is that
I'm just simply afraid of Vlad I cuz
i've seen these two fist fight before
it's come to blows do it got crazy see
yes it was out of control I think you
know what bugs the the PadFone is is the
kind of device that everybody thinks
they they want or that you know
everybody thinks they like the concept
but nobody buys same thing with web top
how many web top docs do you think
Motorola is sold i would guess it's
under 5,000 total whoo that's probably
true no they must have they must have
snookered some corporation into buying
like 10,000 over for their entire fleet
i guaranteed yeah maybe but but you
never would even when it was announced
when the atrix was announced at CES 2011
everyone was like wow that's pretty cool
and then they went on to sell none of
them so i think i think that that the
PadFone is the same thing it's something
that we like the concept of at least you
guys do I think it's stupid but but when
this thing hits the hits the Martin why
do you think of it because because
there's no in it there's literally no
advantage to putting the phone inside
the tablet just have a phone and have a
tablet just do it you save money on RAM
on processor on storage you save money
on the board to put all that stuff
together you don't have to worry about
sinking stuff anymore it's all just on
the phone you don't write a book
services so you save money on data it's
just it's all it's your one device and
that's all you have to worry about and
then you just have different terminals
that you plug it into to get a bigger
screen if you want it like I don't see
what's not compelling about that dream
y'all be trippin good on ya I can tack
on give you the victory on it but it's a
good argument I'll give you that but
there's another point oh um which is
taking the longer term and also the
environmental view on this which is
there we're sticking process into way
too many things and way too many things
that suck that's the other thing I
really really annoys like the galaxy ace
and the galaxy mini eleventy just stop
making those folks just stop it okay um
make cheap phones that people who can't
afford smartphones can buy and then make
good high-quality smartphones and make
like one or two of them I'm so freaking
tired of guys without you just yeah yeah
yeah and that's actually a good thing um
I mean why does LG need something like
seven smart phones with android which
are interchangeable but anyway besides
that point if if you could actually buy
into a sous and trust a sous to that
degree which I don't think anybody can
do with Hardware outside of Apple and
you could make the argument with a pear
phone that you buy this once 23 years
pass the phone
gets out dated before a way the phone
you keep the other parts no particularly
the keyboard like I feel like you could
buy a really solid keyboard attachment
and so long as the connection is
something long-term something like hdmi
and USB which is hopefully gonna be
around for a while you can then keep
interchanging with new additions
upgraded every couple of years let's say
provided you know the company in
question is actually reliable yeah I
mean and let's be clear i would say that
like if you just do this over a wireless
standard then that you definitely could
keep that tablet thing for a while but
we've now seen two attempts at making
this work that have both failed
spectacularly this we know obviously and
then the blackberry playbook just I mean
but it's hard to know maybe the PlayBook
would have been crazily successful
people would have been all over
blackberry connect if you know people
were excited about either the tablet or
the smartphone which they're not in both
cases right yeah this'll really
depressing it really is hey you brought
us all down Peter we were we were riding
that that that that high until you
brought up the damn playbook yeah and
now it's all done let's just let's end
on a high note the hideout is that apple
vs motorola some patent case they're
just got straight up dismissed in by the
judge who basically like like said you
guys have no reason to have court case
right now just figure out the settlement
and you're not coming to court through
his microphone down walked off the stage
yeah it was pretty amazing he raged quit
the case it was amazed yeah wait did it
just happen this nodoz I'm right it
right I'm beyond the seventh okay oh
good and yeah I am terribly excited the
case should be dismissed with prejudice
because neither party can establish a
right to relief that's lawyer speak for
screw you guys I'm going home yeah
I mean screw you guys glad I mean I have
very little to say about this because
the legal world is a complete black box
to me but but you know we've we've had a
few contentious patent discussions on on
this this podcast before and and i will
say that i think that that there is much
to be done to avoid this mess in the
future and it is going to continue to be
in a mess especially as long as I mean
there's the end doesn't wrong there's
still a ton of cases going on right we
have situations europe between Microsoft
and Google and Apple and Samsung I mean
there's still million cases going on
this is the tip of the iceberg but but
yeah we could be more like that's the
problems we don't have a good we don't
have any quote let's go back to
equivalent to the the Microsoft monopoly
case now we've got a thousand cases to
track instead of like one big case that
everybody knows is important and nose is
going to set standards for the industry
you know now you know it's everywhere
and there's lots of standards to be set
and you know lots and lots of different
courts to fight this out in right what
we need is a big giant scary case to
bring it all together I think I think
the government should just sue apple and
google together just put well in a room
and just everybody yell each other for a
few months and then whatever comes out
of that that's that's the end of it no
more cases actually we should just have
a gladiator fight Tim kawaii Iran and
Julius Genachowski we should just put
them in a giant stadium with swords and
spears and release some Tigers in there
and whoever comes out wins I totally
agree and who would be who would be the
the Emperor giving the thumbs up thumbs
down and in his from his you know his
shaded luxury box in the Collis clearly
that would be Vlad that would be go
ahead yeah oh no good suggest Mark
Zuckerberg is a democratically elected
you know president of 900 men people but
oh ok you think Facebook held a vote
last week for their new
data policy and privacy policy although
they don't call it a privacy it's a mess
anyway they had this governance rule
where they would make the public vote
binding and Facebook would be forced to
comply with it if thirty percent of
their user base participated in that
election and then like three people
voted yeah that would be 270 million
people that would be it wasn't the
biggest election of all time as I went
to India a few years ago but it'd be
like in the top three or four biggest
elections of all time in the history of
man so obviously they knew that wasn't
going to happen and so I think it would
the the actual vote was like I don't
know 370,000 something like that and
this was after like a whole bunch of
sites including us linking to it so yeah
to say Zuckerberg is democratically
elected anything is not quite true see
all they needed to do was bundle it
during American Idol and had had people
vote with their phone I guarantee you
they would have blown past 270 million
no glad you make a much better Emperor
than Zuckerberg III really deeply
believe that I mean could you imagine
the Emperor wearing a hoodie I couldn't
that wouldn't be cool no look thank you
thank you d-2 although I do you think I
do suspect you're thinking of me as the
Emperor in the actual gladiator movie
who is a sadistic guy who died miserable
death again but okay picky yeah oh but
what he workin Phoenix it matters no yes
thinking that no he was awesome of that
movie did you that he had the best line
of all time in that movie he vexes me
I'm terribly vexed I mean that's just
this terribly vex come on and you know
glad like Joaquin Phoenix you will later
go through a period where you grow
really long to shovel beard and we're uh
Wayfarers at all times really dark
wafers and and mumble and coherently on
the David Letterman program and trying
to solve this is your future
I actually working on the bid right now
by complete accident to have to admit
okay see you step one in t-town now you
just need to book your david letterman
showing and you're you're you're good to
go yeah and i need to i should buy my
first set of sunglasses ever what what
it's true yeah you're gonna have
cataracts by like age 40 dude well dude
I at bar other people sunglasses but I'm
just too picky and I've know for one of
my own oh my god that's insane that bad
and driving his license yeah please do
things are missing in life yeah you got
to work on this okay well well we have
been podcasting for a really really
super long time and so I'm going to say
