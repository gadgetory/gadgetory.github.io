Michael Shane I'm throwing my hat in the
ring to be the next Secretary of State
and this is 90 seconds on the verge
google maps for iphone is finally
available the native app has been hotly
anticipated in the wake of Apple
switching to its own controversial Maps
client with iOS 6 it's fast the design
is clean and elegant and it's not
entirely unlike the new gmail app for
iOS unfortunately there's no offline
caching at the moment there's also no
iPad app but Google promises that will
come later stop us if this sounds
familiar but Apple might really truly
maybe be building a TV someday that's
according to The Wall Street Journal
which says Apple was working with sharp
and Foxconn to test various designs
however the report is careful to note
that this isn't a formal project yet
Apple CEO Tim Cook has upgraded Apple TV
from a hobby to quote an area of intense

tweet is a blessing sent earlier this
week via ipad and it's been retweeted
about 60,000 times so far but the Pope

before he joins in on trending topics
like hashtag something I get a lot
spoiler probably nice hat that's it for
today's top stories tune in tomorrow
when we take a culinary tour of Middle
earth and find out once and for all if
Orkney is kosher</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
