might be making a comeback it's 3d
printing the future I'm David Pierce and
this is 90 seconds on the verge 3d
printers are far from a household
commodity but startup new matter thinks
it has something that will break through
to the mainstream the company this week
unveiled the mod T printer which is now
up for pre-order on IndieGoGo and new
matter thinks it can differentiate in
two key ways one it actually looks good
the hardware was made in collaboration
with frog design an influential firm
whose clients have included Sony and
Apple the other way a new matter hopes
it'll stand out is price and there it's
absolutely gotta lega at $249 the mod T
is significantly cheaper than virtually
every other 3d printer on the market
that includes the $499 solid doodle and
the thirteen hundred and seventy five
dollar replicator mini the cheapest
printer for MakerBot which is arguably
the most well known company in 3d
printing but you can only stay
competitive on price for so long and the
price of 3d printers is bound to come
down as the years or even months go on
their biggest roll and the one they
really have yet to answer is why would I
need or even want this right now 3d
printing is still very much for
hobbyists and while the things you can
make are indeed cool or at least fun it
also falls within the broad category of
knickknacks doodads and personalized
trinkets still the advancements in 3d
printing are the stuff of dreams from
Pizza for astronauts all the way to a 13
room Dutch canal house that isn't the
kind of thing you'll get with an at-home
3d printer anytime soon but it's not as
far off as you might think for more on
the mod T and 3d printing in general
check out the verge and coming up we'll
be releasing the CAD file for your very
own printed home David Pierce</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
