long time now and every year it's the
same story
GoPro makes the best one other companies
try to match that and they failed
obviously the most important thing about
an action camera is that it needs to
take great footage but it also needs a
great system of accessories and mounts
and it needs to be light and small
enough that you can put it anywhere and
use it in any situation it should also
be really easy to use and that doesn't
just mean on camera controls it has to
have a good companion app to the camera
that still does this better than
anything else is the gopro hero4 black
it shoots excellent footage in any
situation whether you're outdoors and
sunlight indoors in low light or even at
night it's just the best image quality
you're gonna get from any action camera
the hero4 black can shoot 4k footage and
has a few different super slow-motion
modes it's also tiny even in a
waterproof housing this thing's kind of
hard to notice GoPro menus used to be a
chore to navigate but the company has
done a really good job making the on
camera menu system a lot easier to use
and honestly I like using that better
than using the companion app but the app
still does a lot that the camera can't
it offers a live view with little lags
so you can easily frame up your shot and
you can also trim your clips save them
and share them right from the app right
behind the gear before black is the
hero4 silver the hero4 silver is nearly
the same cameras it's more expensive
counterpart and it's just as great you
still get really great image quality in
almost any setting but unlike the black
there's a touch screen on the back so
you can frame up your shots and change
all your settings I can shoot 4k and I
can't shoot in some of the same super
slow motion modes is the hero4 black but
it's still a really capable camera
GoPros been the industry leader for so
long that not only does it have its own
really great system of mounts and
accessories other companies make them
for them too and there's a mount for
anything there's a mount for your head
come out for your chest even a mount for
your dog it may not be able to do all
the things that the hero4 black can do
but if you've never used an action
camera before the hero4 silver is
probably the best one for you Sony's 4k
action cam is probably the best
competitor ever to the top the line
GoPros it's got great image quality with
built in
stabilization pretty good battery life
and Sony's actually built out a pretty
good system of mounts the problem here
is the 4k action cam is just a chore to
use the on camera menu system is
powerful and it often takes a dozen or
more taps just to accomplish a simple
pass the good thing is that Sony's
finally made a good app one that you can
even edit your footage in if you're
looking to shoot ultra high resolution
or slow-motion video and you don't like
GoPros for some reason this is the
action camera for you now GoPro released
a few lower end cameras this year and
the most fun one to use by far is the
hero4 session it doesn't shoot 4k
footage but it's a tiny one and a half
inch cube that works with just the push
of a button seriously there's literally
only one main button there's no screen
and the camera quickly turns on and off
every time you start and stop recording
so the battery can last you for hours
you have to use your phone if you want
to frame up your shot though and it's
not cheap but this thing is waterproof
out of the box and it's just the easiest
action camera to throw in your pocket
and use Garmin has been in the action
camera game for a few years now and the
verb X is its best effort yet it's
smaller and lighter than previous models
and the image quality is way better it's
not as good as GoPros or Sony's but it's
better than everything else the verb can
also overlay a bunch of cool data on
your footage like speed g-force altitude
and more if you're really looking to
gather a whole bunch of data while
you're recording this is definitely the
camera for you Tom Tom broke into the
action camera market this year with the
Bandit and there's a lot I really like
about this camera for one you never have
to use wires you can pull the battery
right out of the camera and plug it
right into a USB port to charge or dump
your footage also the app will edit the
footage for you marking cool moments by
taking into account changes in things
like velocity and altitude the results
are a little here miss and unfortunately
the image quality just isn't that great
for the price that you're paying and
then there's the drift ghost s it's not
good don't buy it the drift is one of a
bunch of action cameras that are trying
to eat up the lower end of the action
camera market and if we were talking
about it a year ago it would probably be
a pretty good competitor the problem is
all these other cameras have really left
it in the dust the action camera market
looks a little different this year that
it has an ear
pass GoPros models might still be the
best but they're the same models that we
saw last year this needs to competitions
had a year to catch up and the gap is
closing really fast some of these
companies are doing some really clever
stuff with their action cameras but none
of them can offer the top-to-bottom
experience that GoPro is so good at
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
