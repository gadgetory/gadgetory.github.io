started off on a somber note this year
over the past two months Facebook has
been shaken by the Cambridge analytic a
data privacy scandal which ultimately
saw Mark Zuckerberg called before
Congress to defend Facebook's data
collection practices at the same time
critics are raising hard questions about
Facebook's impact on society with some
calling it a breeding ground for
misinformation and hate Zuckerberg
started FA with a speech that addressed
those questions head-on now I know that
hasn't been easy being a developer in
these last couple of months and that's
probably an understatement but what I
can assure you is that we're hard at
work making sure that people don't
misuse this platform so you can all keep
building things that people love in the
midst of that crisis of trust Facebook
is rolling out one of its most socially
ambitious projects and years a dating
app we are announcing a new set of
features coming soon around dating now
this is gonna be it's gonna be for
building real long-term relationships
all right not just hookups where most
dating apps focus on matching specific
people
Facebook's system focuses on common
events and groups giving you something
to do on your first date Facebook also
promises not to match you with people
who are already your friends an awkward
situation that's unavoidable on most
dating apps I want to be clear that
we've designed this with privacy and
safety in mind from the beginning your
friends aren't gonna see your profile
you're only gonna be suggested people
who are not your friends who have opted
into dating you feel your preferences
although I can't promise that you're
gonna get emai it's a really ambitious
project potentially opening up a whole
new side of Facebook but it also takes a
lot of trust the new app is entirely
opt-in and Facebook says it's built it
with privacy in mind but it's hard not
to worry that some dating profile pic
won't find its way back on your Facebook
wall or some old Facebook post won't
somehow make it onto the act do we
really trust Facebook to handle this
right at the same time there are already
a lot of dating apps including ones like
tinder that use Facebook's social graph
to connect Pete
if you want an app that knows your
Facebook friends but isn't run by
Facebook you have a lot of options so
how much of an advantage does Facebook
really have here Facebook clearly thinks
users will trust them here and you can
see why the companies had a lot of bad
headlines but people aren't leaving
Facebook and they're making more money
than ever at the most recent quarterly
earnings Facebook reported adding half a
million regular users every day so by
the numbers
it looks like Zuckerberg apology tour is
working but if Facebook's bond with
users is starting to turn sour you'd
expect it to hurt projects like this the
most it's really hard to launch a new
app even for a company as powerful as
Facebook past developer conferences are
littered with good ideas that just never
took off it's too early to say if
Facebook's dating app will be one of
those failures but if it is it might be
because after so many bad scandals and
bad excuses users decided they just
didn't want to risk the thing is it
would have been really easy for Facebook
to delay this announcement pushing it
closer to launch or outside the f8 cycle
entirely but Facebook didn't do that
they bet that the hangover from
Cambridge analytic adjust wouldn't be a
problem and they made that bet with
dating one of the most private and
sensitive things we do as people now
we're gonna find out if they bet right
thanks for watching would you trust
Facebook's new dating app let us know in
the comments and we just launched a new
verge science YouTube channel we're
gonna do some really awesome stuff there
