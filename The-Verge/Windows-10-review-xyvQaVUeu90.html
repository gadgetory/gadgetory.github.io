publicly it's finally officially here
it's a free upgrade for most people -
but should you upgrade Windows 10 is the
realization of Michael's big dream to
have a single windows that runs across
pcs tablets phones and even the
company's Xbox one console right now
Windows 10 is mostly about fixing the
mess that Microsoft crave Windows 8 one
of the first signs of that is the return
of the Start menu you know in love it's
not just the regular one from Windows 7
instead Microsoft has combined the best
aspects of the last two versions of
Windows to create a redesign Start menu
the live tiles from windows 8 remain but
you no longer booted into an entirely
different full screen interface there's
a traditional list of apps easy access
to power options and settings and the
ability to resize the menu freely
windows 10 is a nice dark theme and it
blends in well against laptop screens
that usually have black puzzles if
you're not a fan of the darkness there
are plenty of color options to change
the look of the Start menu and taskbar
there's even a little transparency
effects the finish off the look and feel
navigating around Windows 8 was painful
with a laptop or PC and Windows 10 is
improved massively the annoying hot
corners of Windows 8 have gone and
Microsoft has removed the weird charms
bar in its place is a new Action Center
that works as a Notification Center to
collect any alerts from apps and provide
quick access to a bunch of settings
snapping apps has been a popular feature
of Windows and Microsoft has tweaked it
slightly hear there's a new snap assist
feature that makes it a lot easier to
find what apps are open to snap them
side-by-side there's also a new task
View feature that's a lot like Mission
Control on the Mac it displays all your
open windows and a single screen and you
can find what you're looking for quickly
it's also a gateway to a new virtual
desktops feature yes you can finally
create separate virtual desktops without
having to install a third-party app it's
mainly a power of user feature but it's
useful if you want to separate apps on
the laptop we don't have a lot of screen
space
one of the biggest additions to Windows
10 is Microsoft's virtual assistant
Cortana it's designed to look and feel
like an extension to the Start menu just
like the Windows Phone equivalent you
can use your voice to search or typing
queries manually there's even an option
to enable a hey Cortana feature
that lets you simply call the questions
at your laptop it's perfect if you lean
back in an office chair and wants to
fire off emails with your voice but I
found I mostly use it to demonstrate
Cortana to friends and family
Cortana also has a helpful overview of
your day mixed in with interests like
weather news and local restaurants
Cortana
also has a powerful local search to find
your documents on your local hard drive
or from the onedrive cloud storage
service we have a new version of Windows
comes a new browser called edge it might
be designed to succeed Internet Explorer
but it sticks to the past in a number of
ways edges taskbar icon is barely
different from Internet Explorer in an
effort to keep it similar for the
millions of diverse Windows users edges
simplified clean and performs well in
most cases but there's a few things
missing and the lack of features you
might expect from a modern browser
snapping tabs into separate windows is
messy downloads start automatically with
no choice of folder and there's no save
target ass Microsoft really started from
scratch with edge and it shows Microsoft
is still included a copy of Internet
Explorer in Windows 10 for this very
reason edge does have some interesting
new features you could draw all over
webpages and send a copy to friends and
Cortana appears to provide you useful
information in clever little ways if you
search for something in the address bar
like weather then it will immediately
show the weather nearby on some
restaurant websites it will even appear
to provide you directions or opening
hours it's not just a neat little trick
but it's actually useful when you don't
have to search for this basic
information mic sauce Xbox app for
Windows 10 might be my favorite new
feature you can stream Xbox one games to
a laptop and just plug in a controller
to play it works surprisingly well with
no lag even over a Wi-Fi network you can
only use it at home on a local network
but it's fun if you want to play xbox
games in another room where you don't
have a TV the Xbox app also has access
to Xbox Live and the ability to create
party chats from your PC to talk to Xbox
one friends a nice little surprise
feature the Xbox app is screen recording
you can use it to create game clips or
even just record regular apps that
aren't games at all that's reusable if
you want to create screen tutorials and
it saves enter buy an expensive four
party app to do it
the mail and calendar apps both support
Google accounts so they're easy to use
without an Outlook account you'll also
notice that these apps no longer run
full screen by default anymore
Mike's others changed out with Windows
10 so you can now window these apps and
move them around freely and that makes
them a lot more usable the most
impressive additions are the new
stripped-down touch based office apps
Word Excel PowerPoint are all available
for free and they're a delight to use
the speedy and simple with just enough
features for basic editing and none of
the bloat of the full desktop office
apps the new and improved Windows Store
has finally combined apps games music
movies and TV but there's still a lack
of quality apps while most of Windows
tends improvements are focused on mouse
and keyboard Microsoft hasn't forgotten
about the good touch work that went into
Windows 8 a new tablet mode in Windows
10 aims to bridge the fullscreen world
of Windows 8 with the traditional way
use of Windows PC it's perfect for
two-in-one convertible laptops and
prompts allow you to switch easily
between using a mouse and keyboard and
flipping the hardware into a tablet mode
so should you upgrade if you can deal
with a few oddities here and there and
you're frustrated with Windows 8 then by
all means up right now but if you depend
on your Windows computer on a daily
basis and it's working fine for you you
should probably hold off until
everything's a little bit more polished
I've run into a variety of issues where
my download folder takes 30 seconds to
load my audio stops working or apps like
mail just randomly break and crash some
of the problems aren't critical but they
can certainly be frustrating I like the
direction Microsoft is taking with
Windows 10 accepted feedback and ideas
from his customers along the way it
feels like the best way to shape windows
into something that people enjoy using
rather than they have to use Windows 10
is a great fix to the problems of
Windows 8 and it's clearly the version
of Windows we'll all be using for many
many years as a Microsoft moves to
regular updates instead of major
versions every few years
it feels like the cycle of good and bad
version of Windows could finally be over
Microsoft might have just pulled that
off Windows 10 is good and it's here to
stay and that's very exciting</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
