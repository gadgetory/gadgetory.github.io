were the homes that were left standing
and people said if I'm gonna build in a
hurricane zone this is what I want our
homes are exceptionally strong because
we use materials that are very high
quality they're often designed for high
winds owns and no high quality material
you can't just go to the store and buy
our Homer's panelized so we're pre
manufacturing sections of it in a
factory and then shipping it out to you
on the job site
around design I've actually have
self-supporting root system so it
doesn't have any interior load-bearing
walls which means that the inside can be
laid out basically any way that you want
last part of the roof
most of the ceiling but I'm still alive
still here kicking I took pictures of
this place in the whole neighborhood the
day before we were all out here all the
neighbors they just had their new roofs
installed from the hailstorm everybody
was cleaning up we were getting ready
for the weekend of fun and then Harvey
sort was like okay well we're gonna
leave because most of those people are
vacation people you know they don't live
here full-time not like a hurricane
Harvey barreling into the Texas
coastline storm surges are predicted to
reach up to 12 V city of Rockport Texas
is right in Harvey's path and he is
getting hit hard I felt like I this is a
nuclear war had happened here and my
neighbor's atom bombed it was it was
heart and gut wrenching to see the
damage that that a lot of people
have suffered through and and their took
their whole life is forever changed by
this climate change is something that is
hard to to not think about when you see
hurricane after hurricane after
hurricane the wildfires that have just
hit California it really makes you think
about if I'm gonna build a home you know
what is it going to be like 20 years
from now 50 years from now a hundred
years from now I'm not just designing
for today but I'm designing for
generations into the future and what's
it gonna take to make sure that we
resist those things I'm in a lot that
was you know half a block from the water
we thought we really need something that
is hurricane resistant and this round
house concept they can't bill as
hurricane proof but when you look
through the gallery pictures there sure
are a lot of pictures as ours is now of
the Delta house standing tall well
everything around it is shattered I
think resilience like passive
survivability is the concept of you know
building a home that can withstand all
kinds of weather extremes is something
that we have been really good at or I
want us to keep improving in that
direction
obviously this round shape makes sense
in a Highland environment and we're able
to get a lot less pressure building up
on that home just because of that design
but how do we go above and beyond that
beyond just the shape how do we engineer
that to be even stronger and so you see
this what we call radial engineering
where it's like spokes on a wheel and
the entire home is like this this wheel
that it works together so the entire
system is set up to resist those high
winds there really is nothing about what
we do that is rocket science
it is a simple concept and we have
really perfected it over the last 50
years in the way that everything fits
together and works together and to me
what's really special about the deltek
is there's this combination of you know
science and sort of you know high-tech
manufacturing but then it blends so well
with you know what I call the old-world
craftsmanship we're building this home
it's out of wood it's not like it's some
new high-tech material but the way that
it performs is above and beyond really
what any other would home to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
