here with the LG optimus 4x which is one
of the many phones that LG has
introduced here this week this is sort
of a rapid and and complete departure
from the optimises that that we've seen
in recent months in recent years it's
completely squared off fuels very high
quality has a nice back with a nice
texture to it it's very thin as you can
tell of course this is a quad-core
device just one of the very first to be
announced so you have three capacitive
buttons along the bottom so you don't
get a soft button roll like you do on
the Galaxy Nexus and some other ICS
devices let's take a quick walk through
the UI here let's see there's no sign of
stutter or slowness as you can tell this
is pretty heavily skinned I venture to
say more heavily skin than TouchWiz
which LG has been in the past so that
doesn't come as a big surprise but it is
pretty pretty significantly changed from
from TouchWiz on or excuse me from LG
skin on Android 2.3 and that's a good
thing and I can show you LG's custom
lock screen as well kind of a cool
transition effect there so that's a
quick look at the optimus 4x and we're
going to look forward to reviewing this
one in the coming weeks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
