One S as the middle child of HTC's new
one family of Android phones but he
wouldn't know it to look at it the 1s is
enough about it to justify being another
company's flagship phone having recently
reviewed Sony's Xperia S I can say that
this handset easily held does it in
terms of industrial design and
ergonomics and it actually ships with
Android 4.0 onboard the 1s is also
thinner the most phones of the market
today
measuring 7.8 millimeters in thickness
and it's actually very difficult to tell
difference between that and the a point
9 millimeter profile of the larger One X
although that's another thin phone and
the real difference you're going to feel
is compared to older and fatter handsets
both the 1s in the One X for
effortlessly to boast pockets and are
enjoy to handle as thanks to the curved
back which is echoed by the glass screen
upfront sloping of the sides where the
One X gains an advantage over the other
one model isn't having an aluminium
unibody shell treated with micro arc
oxidation that's a process of dipping
the metal into a plasma bath and
blasting with 10,000 volts of
electricity turning it into a ceramic
between that and the guerrilla girls
display the one eyes should withstand
most physical threats posed by daily
smartphone use the new treatment also
makes a 1 a surface feel unusual it
isn't rough as such but has a lot of
friction to it the internals of the one
has a right up to date it has a
dual-core Snapdragon s4 processor
gigabyte of RAM and 16 gigabytes of
storage however there's no microSD card
slot or user replaceable battery it also
used a micro SIM card and opening the
compartment to access that is a bit of a
nightmare
a big reason why HTC have been able to
fit the 1s into such a thin body is a
Super AMOLED display up front although
it has two major show comes firstly it's
pencil so you see an Pleasant color
fringing on high contrast edges and
secondly it has qHD resolution which is
stepped behind a pulsating 720p
resolution if you had to pick up fatal
flaws of this phone the pentile matrix
sub pixel arrangement would probably be
it it's one of those quality issues that
you can't unsee you once you've noticed
it everyone who's seen this phone has
asked me about the Beats Audio branding
on the back and what it actually means
basically it's a gimmick Beats Audio
boost the bass and volume on whatever
you listen to but doesn't actually make
it sound any better and if it's not
better why bother to
does a question also have to ask about
sense for HTC has cleaned up the new
version of his androids can dramatically
but I can find no addition to the
interface that actually adds anything to
Ice Cream Sandwich the skins more
tolerable now but HTC won't be the
reason you find the software desirable
it will be the underlying Android 4.0
which gives you access to new apps like
Chrome for Android beta and refresh
Cheever plans and it also makes for fast
performance all around one bit of
software that HD does add value to is a
camera app which now has the video and
still capture buttons on the same screen
and also allows the shoot still photos
while capturing video there's an
automated burst mode as well which lets
you pick the best photo out of a bunch
and the whole thing feels more like
camera suite rather than a basic app
image capture is lightning quick as well
although image quality is part of the f
2.0 lens an 8 megapixel sensor is on
average much as with their thickness the
HTC One S and One X are difficult to
separate in terms of performance both
are incredibly fast and if there's any
advantage for the Tegra 3 inside the One
X is a Tegra zone that's a growing
library of games that come with table
specific graphical upgrades which you
won't find with the dual-core snapdragon
and the 1s there you will start playing
Angry Birds or whatever COCOMs game
command a competitive Sega raz√≥n ends
up offering later on during the year if
was to choose between the 1s and the 1x
adult 1x simply because we superb
display it's a shame that HTC couldn't
match in the 1s which is still fantastic
second choice broadening out your
options beyond HTC the Galaxy Nexus
remains the best Android experience you
can have today the iPhone 4s offers an
even better app ecosystem and superb
camera performance and the Lumia 900 is
the only phone to match the 1s in terms
of screen size and design quality
