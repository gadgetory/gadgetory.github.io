phone and this is an even bigger screen
on that much bigger phone its Galaxy s8
so the Samsung Galaxy s8 comes in two
sizes five point eight inches and the SI
plus which is a 6.2 inch screen what's
new here is that they're super tall
because they got rid of the bezels on
the top and the bottom of the phone and
now the sides are still curved like they
are on like the galaxy s7 edge that's
just the default way that these phones
come now Samsung's not calling it an
infinity display and I don't know the
curve is fine I'm not picking up a lot
of extra little tabs it looks really
sharp and it's got you know HDR color if
you care about that sort of thing what's
interesting is they both have the same
resolution which is 29 60 by 1440 but
you know Samsung makes great screens and
these look great really the thing that
hits you hardest when you look at the
hardware on this phone is that the whole
thing just looks and feels really great
the seams are even harder to find than
they are on the s7 edge the glass just
sort of melts into the sides and they
don't have a camera bump on the back
this honestly it feels like some of the
best phone Hardware I've ever used it's
way better than say the iPhone 7 so
getting rid of those bezels on the top
and the bottom means they had to make
some changes so you'll notice there's no
home button here in the front it's not
on the back either what there is is like
a virtual home button Samsung has added
some haptic feedback it's kind of like
force touch on the iPhone but it's only
right here at the very bottom and so
even if you don't see a software home
button you can still press hard on that
area of the screen and that is going to
take you home if you want to unlock the
phone you actually have three different
ways you can do it now all four you can
do your password or your pattern as
usual but there's a fingerprint sensor
on the back it is located right next to
the camera which is a little bit hard to
reach and not great if you're
left-handed and it also means you're
probably going to end up putting your
finger on the camera sometimes which
could cause some smudges so make sure
you wipe it off or you take a picture
there's also iris scanning which we saw
on the note 7 RI P which is very secure
and then there's now face scanning I
don't think it's quite as secure
as the iris scanning or the fingerprint
sensor but my god is it past like look
at how fast this thing unlocks you blink
and you miss it you don't have to wait
for it to scan your face at all it just
works they're a little bit narrower than
the galaxy s7 and the s7 edge and
they're just a little bit thicker but
not so much that you really notice it
what it means is that they can fit in a
3000 milliamp battery on the s8 at a
3500 won on the SI plus it's not exactly
pushing the limit in terms of battery
capacity but I have to imagine that
Samsung isn't really interested in
pushing the limited battery capacity
right now after what happened with the
note 7 they also do all the stuff that
you normally expect from a Samsung phone
it's got ip68 waterproofing there's four
gigs of ram there's 64 gigs of on-board
storage and yes there's expandable
storage here and yes there is a standard
3.5 millimeter headphone jack
one thing that Samsung didn't change is
the camera on the back it's still 12
megapixel sensor although Samsung says
it has improved the image processing
software we really like these cameras on
the s7 I imagine they're going to be
just as good probably a little bit
better here on the s8
one thing that is new is the
front-facing camera it's now 8
megapixels and it has autofocus which is
pretty cool when you're in the camera
you're going to start to see one of the
big big things that's new in the s8 it's
called Bixby and it's Samsung's
intelligent agent so let me just show
you how it works in the camera to start
when you've got the camera app open you
can hit this button and then it'll go
into Bixby mode and it's going to auto
detect whatever it sees on the screen so
if I pointed out some flowers it's going
to recognize that they're flowers and
show me pictures of more flowers or
maybe let me go buy some flowers or Here
I am pointing it at a watch and although
it wasn't able to figure out exactly
what model of watch it was it actually
like figured out it was a watch and
showed me a bunch of pictures of other
watches or let me go to Amazon to buy a
watch that looks like it which is really
impressive but beyond like a are stuff
in the camera what Bixby is really for
is to sort of make it easier to use
Samsung's own software their goal is to
have anything that you would do by
touching the phone you can do by
speaking to the phone and so with any
compatible app it's of course starting
on samsung
and the way that you triggered is by
holding down a side button which is
actually a really bold move they've got
a whole extra button here and if Bixby
turns out to not be that great they've
basically wasted part of the hardware of
the phone on this thing so we're gonna
have to see but unfortunately we weren't
able to try Bixby yet it is still you
know coming out when the phone comes out
they didn't have it here at the demo
station so pre-orders for the s8 and the
si+ begin on march 30th and it goes on
sale on April 21st in the US it's going
to be available in three colors black
gray and silver and I can't tell you the
pricing yet because that's always up to
the carrier so you're just going to have
to go see what Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T or
t-mobile or Sprint erna charger for much
much much more on everything samsung
