blasts it off today with the launch of a
Russian Proton rocket from Kazakhstan
the vehicle set to robotic spacecraft
racing towards the red planet where
they're expected to arrive in October of
this year Texan Mars is a joint
partnership between the European Space
Agency and the Russian Federal Space
Agency or was cosmos the main goal
figuring out if Mars could ever have
been home to alien life to do that the
ESA and Roscosmos are sending three
spacecraft to Mars on two separate
missions that includes today's launch
and one in 2018 the first spacecraft on
board this morning's rocket was the
trace gas orbiter which will revolve
around Mars and sniff out traces of
methane in the atmosphere much of the
methane in our planet's atmosphere comes
from the breakdown of organic material
so its presence on Mars could be a big
indicator of biological life in the
surface below whether or not methane
exists on Mars has been a hotly debated
topic so the trace gas orbiter could
provide some clues the spacecraft will
enter Mars orbit in October but it'll be
a while before we know what it finds
that's because the probe needs over a
year to slow down to reach the right
speed for orbit a process known as
aerobraking
the orbiter will start looking for
methane in December of 2017 but even if
the spacecraft does find methane doesn't
definitively prove that there is life on
Mars that's why today's launch included
the Schiaparelli Lander this probe will
attempt to land on the surface of the
red planet October it's meant to test
out the technologies needed to land the
Martian Rover that will be launched for
the 2018 ExoMars mission that Rover is
designed to take samples from the
Martian surface and then analyze them
while on the
if the ExoMars mission does uncover
evidence of life it could inspire a
future Mars sample return that involves
sending a probe to collect samples from
the Martian surface and then
transporting them back to earth such a
mission would be a massive undertaking
requiring a lander a rocket that can
take off for Mars and a vehicle that can
safely transport the samples back home
but studying Martian samples in Earth
Labs could tell us way more about what
lurks on our planetary neighbor</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
