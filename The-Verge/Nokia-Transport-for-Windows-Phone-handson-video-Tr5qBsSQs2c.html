check the locations for example I want
to go to the thumb new stadium and there
you have the possibilities that i have 6
37 minutes there's not a particularly
interesting in or out because you don't
have multiple options that you try one
later but you can just click on it now
the one you like in 17 minutes and then
you get all the details right and you
can actually still asleep down so I can
both basically you know go go back here
and have this one and say in the Start
screen so basically what happens you
know in as long as I'm in Barcelona
whenever I walk around like you will
give me an update wherever I am you know
to the basically to the company's
stadium and we'll just keep it in the
right location and the writers and so is
this available worldwide ooh yeah so we
are basically long to you know the
routing in over five mins and I think
how many will have
static schedules / / AP with schedules
and and two we have with right but
that's going to go up so one more than I
have life updates and one more going to
have actual schedule up there it's just
public transport buses Subway's of the
subways you know prams everything and
then again you know you can of course
then say okay how do I get to the next
station so you click on this and it will
actually now to you know calculate the
pedestrian route in here to you know the
train station at possibility convenience
you can see we would walk acting ear
right to the tickets an x value to it
here and then you know if it's okay now
that you see how I move from there and
then how do I get to the stadium on the
other side when when I get out of the
subway as you can see here it's you know
it's quite walk is about them you know
you know a little bit under a mile and
that's basically than the electricity
you guys using any like the compass ap
licensed of that and because I know it's
the integrated Bing Maps one doesn't use
that so you can't lock on the iphone or
you can come to work at which direction
you're facing also we don't do that yet
but I think that's gonna be one of the
beach that we're going to do and all the
other devices of course we use compass
makers romita and other stuff so this is
out now is available now is it launching
it's going to be it's going to be
launched with the device of the do I've
seen here you know basically today that
we made the announcement the film you
see take you to</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
