Michael Jordan left their indelible
marks on history also happens to be the
home of Motorola Mobility this lakeside
town of over two and a half million may
not be known for technology or design as
much as it's known for Pete's and the
Cubs but if Motorola has its say that's
about to change in fact it kind of did
change this week halfway through an
ownership switch from Google to Lenovo
Motorola pulled some of the world's top
technology press yours included to its
new headquarters for the biggest product
event it's held in a long time but this
isn't just about a phone launch it's
about making a statement about two and a
half two years ago we had a complete
reset for our product portfolio and how
we approach product and how we build
products and how we approach consumers
we put ourselves back to the forefront
in the minds of consumers because they
really these products really meant some
needs that people had and the results
have been very good in the first quarter
year over year we grew sixty percent in
the second quarter year-over-year we
grew a hundred and thirty percent we
started out with Moto X and the
proposition was simple and compelling
but Moto X was a part of a much bigger
vision and arc we always knew that the
world would have different types of
screen sizes either in your pocket on
your wrist and other places and other
types of wearable device the second
opportunity we saw that even something
as core and basic as smart phones
weren't being offered to consumers in a
proper way especially in developing
markets
last year's motox set the stage for an
all new design language across
Motorola's entire lineup and this year's
models the GNX alike take it to a new
level these are birds of a feather and
that's important
sure that's is cool but the lower-cost G
is the breadwinner the last generation G
almost single-handedly gave moto
credibility in Brazil in India and
keeping that up means making the cheap
phones look just as good as the
expensive ones we don't want to create a
design language that is kind of too
polarizing we want to create something
that represents what we think is
important to brand which is kind of a
you know personal approachable
comfortable from a physical perspective
there's signature aspects of it you'll
see you know on you know all the Moto
series is the familiar kind of curve on
the top here that we always kind of have
there there's there's functional reasons
for it and there's also visual reasons
for it
the curve is often talked about I mean
it's packed with you know NMC antennas
batteries curved battery stack batteries
originally and the use of the very kind
of thin edge here right the whole idea
is to kind of as we've said is to fill
the hand and create kind of physical
comfort but when you look at it to
create something that is really light
and kind of feels like more of a natural
form rather than something that's been
in a totally manufacturers we initially
come up with 2d renderings of how the
product needs to look based on the
insights we have our vision on where we
want to take the product and what are
the different technology vectors that we
have then we take these 2d renderings
and then we convert those 2d renderings
into actually 3d databases and these 3d
databases are actually made of hearts
that are actually inside the device I
think so much of great product
development is almost like weaving right
it's there's no it's not a silver bullet
thing it's about it's about all the
different pieces that come together and
how you weave them together
that balance which I think you know
differentiates products what maybe to
some of us in industry might seem like a
minor thing because we're so absorbed in
it from the person who's touching and
seeing I mean that's those things mean a
lot you know I mean you talk to somebody
who goes to buy a pair of shoes or a bag
a lot of different reason they're making
taking one bag versus the other isn't
because it's the bag is more functional
it's because the quality of the
materials the workmanship the the brand
itself and what it stands for and I
think that's where this industry is
heading and I and I think that's why
we're pursuing moto 360 the way we're
pursuing it the way we're pursuing hint
that way and the way we also are
pursuing you know Moto X is a system or
instead of a product that need to be
high in style icing on the cake the
object that suggests that this Motorola
has real technology and design shops is
of course the Moto 360 it's not perfect
by any stretch but if nothing else it's
an engineering marvel we've done round
before but the challenge was how to make
a wrong product without having all the
circuitry for example in our that see
see at the bottom of the device we have
a display technology team that went to
war and did an incredible job in
building then after we figured out how
to take hundreds of lives and actual ICS
that go around the display how to make
them disappear what we did was we built
an entirely round stainless steel
structure and and essentially the
challenge was how do you put antennas on
this thing so this thing has a bluetooth
and Wi-Fi antenna the whole structure
itself is antenna and there's a unique
way where the entire structure is
connected if you see there's a
the back housing and on the board where
all the RF connectors are supposed to go
where it's all in Z dimension and so
there's nothing that takes up space I
think people just assume everything can
be done now in many ways it can be it's
a matter of choosing right things to do
and for us right now we really believe
that you know people are expecting these
things to look and behave like many of
the other products that they have in
their their lives whether it's shirts
clothing or her or other objects and
that's why we've made a considered
effort like over the last year or two to
really kind of bring in those very
difficult things to do honestly walk
down the street and hear it turned my
turn in your hint and then look at a
little little turn by turn on your watch
I mean that's the stuff that people I
mean that's when people love doing it
they don't want to actually give their
phone out of their pocket right if they
don't have to reason that our company
and our groups made 360s there's so many
people that were really passionate about
you know how can the smartphone
deconstruct right and kind of many ways
dreaming a lot about this and inventing
around this it'll last you know three or
four years and I think a lot of stuffs
coming together that allows us to do it
and I think a way that that we think is
truly kind of differentiated and the
most compelling way to do it for people
for all the drama Motorola's been
through over the past half decade CEO
changes a split to acquisitions in the
long shadow of the razor
I just couldn't see any of it this week
here's a company that has cool genuinely
interesting products excited people and
an actual plan for setting itself apart
from the Samsungs and half
I don't know if they're going to win
this isn't an easy or cheap market to
plan but even if they don't I get the
sense that they're gonna go down
swinging so our design teams have always
had a real clear point of view and I
personally have had like okay I believe
it should be this it should be this it
should be this but a certain point it's
like what the hell I'm not here to
design for me right I'm here designed
for you so as a designer when we first
started looking at moto acts and the
approach to moto maker there was a
degree of like okay we got a step back
here you know and let some things go and
instead focus on a design that allows us
to curate something that gives people
set it up so that people can make great
choices but allow them to be part of the
process and so we've decided to embrace
it there's a certain cathartic thing
that happens when you kind of like do
that at first you like you know and then
you realize that the person who chose
mint last year even though it maybe was
1.5 percent of the people absolutely
loves a mint you know and so we did
something that allowed that person had
exactly what they wanted and that's more
important than me getting what I want
and so I don't know I think it's just a
it's a mindset change but design is
design in it it's about designing for
somebody else I'm not a painter
my parents were artists I'm not gonna
force my tastes on you know everybody
what we wanting to do is express our
brand through design and the definition
of a product and kind of create
something that we think is really
compelling on its own then allow you to
take it the rest of the way whether it's
the functionality the software or what
we do in design and to me that's that's
a inclusive design process that we think
is important to pursue right now
