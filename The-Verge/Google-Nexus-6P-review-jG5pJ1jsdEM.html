time this year we have two phones but
this one is the big one
it's the Nexus 6p
the 6p is Google's new top-tier Android
phone and it's the first one made by a
Chinese manufacturer Huawei yeah the 6p
is the big one it's bigger than the
Nexus 5x that's also coming out but it's
not as big as say last year's Nexus 6
which pushed the boundaries of how big a
phone can actually be with the 6p Google
dialed it back and compared to the Nexus
6 or hell compared to virtually any
other phone you can buy right now the 6p
is beautiful it's made of aluminium and
glass with just a little plastic here in
there to let the antennas work it's
about the same size as the iPhone 6s
plus and I think the overall quality of
the hardware actually stands up to it
it's gotten corny to talk about phones
as being premium with incredible build
quality or even to refer to them like
well-crafted jewelry but those are the
kinds of things that people say about
the best phones
theyed Samsung Galaxy s6 or the iPhone
and now for the first time ever you
could say the same thing about a Nexus
phone nothing feels cheap and nothing
feels compromised except well yeah there
is a small bulge on the back for the
camera and for some other sensors so
let's talk about that it doesn't look as
bad in person as a dozen pictures and I
actually think it helps me know which
end is up which is weirdly a problem
with a lot of phones nowadays but
otherwise I don't think the Bulge
affects the phone's balance either
physically or aesthetically but the
front is perfectly symmetrical you'll
find two loudspeakers an 8 megapixel
selfie camera and even a hidden little
notification light surrounding the
screen it all makes the phone a little
bit too tall for my tastes though the
screen is a 5.7 inch 2560 by 1440 AMOLED
display that's both bright and crisp it
looks good no matter how low you set the
brightness level which is something that
other AMOLED screens usually get wrong
the screen doesn't feel quite as close
to the surface as it does on an iPhone
or a galaxy s6 so there's still room for
improvement but not that much so this is
the first Nexus phone that can sit next
and most beautiful and well made phones
on the market and not feel a little bit
dowdy
but there's another first for this Nexus
and it's an important one it's one that
no Nexus has ever gotten right before
and honestly until this year has been
kind of a source of embarrassment for
Android users
I'm talking of course about the camera
this year Google turned to Sony and put
a great 12 megapixel sensor on the back
and mostly figured out how to write
software for it it's fast first of all
and you can launch it with a DoubleTap
of the power button here's the bottom
line it takes really good photos in most
lighting conditions
it focuses quickly with a little laser
it takes shots just as fast and it's
connected to Google's excellent photo
management software colors can get
really saturated which I tend to prefer
but might not be your cup of tea you can
do 4k video and also 720p slow-mo at 120
or 240 frames per second and in all of
those cases you're more likely to get
fun good footage than not the Nexus 6p
does really well in anything but very
dim lighting where the quality doesn't
quite live up to Google's claims
I also wish that it had optical image
stabilization even though Google says
it's not necessary in near darkness the
iPhone 6s does do a better job at
salvaging a shot and Samsung's note 5
does a little bit better too but most of
the time you'll find that the Nexus 6p
can actually go toe-to-toe with the best
camera phones in the market like the
note 5 the Sony Xperia z5 or even the
iPhone 6s when you compare them you're
going to end up talking more about
aesthetics than you are about quality if
I have a complaint it's at the camera
software which is still very much
improved this year still has a ways to
go
HDR mode is just too slow mainly but I'm
also not impressed with burst mode the
idea is great
you just take a kajillion shots by
holding down the shutter button the
Nexus is then going to pick the best one
and give you an option of making a
little animated gif of your shots right
there in the spot but the results really
aren't all that great though they are in
a format you can share anywhere really
easily
there's one last first for a Nexus
device to talk about and it's the
fingerprint scanner it's located on the
back and you can use it to turn on the
phone it is crazy fast it's so fast you
probably won't ever miss the lockscreen
when you use it to turn on your phone
we've already reviewed the software on
this phone it's Android 6.0 marshmallow
and it's really good but I just want to
point out that on the Nexus 6p it is
fast crazy fast much much faster than it
is on the Nexus 6 a powerful processor
and a lot of RAM will do that for you
and the Nexus 6p has both now Android
6.0 is premier feature is now on tap
which lets you search Google from any
screen on your phone
no matter what app it is and it saves me
a lot of taps now and then but I wish
that I knew a little bit more about me
so the searches would be a little bit
more effective battery life is good
enough to get you through a day but not
much more we got a little bit over eight
hours in a battery test that refreshes a
webpage every minute and in real-world
use I really only felt nervous if I was
spending a lot of time doing intensive
gaming or shooting 4k video it has a
really big battery too but I still wish
that somebody anybody would finally make
a phone this great that can also last
two or even three days but I'll say that
Android 6.0 s new battery feature called
doze is the real deal it shuts a lot of
stuff down when the phone isn't moving
and I found that I could leave it on my
nightstand overnight and only lose a few
percentage points of battery quick
charge is also great I picked up 20%
battery life in just 15 minutes and it
got fully charged in a little bit over
an hour
it does charge over USB type-c so you're
going to need to buy some new cables
someday that's going to be the standard
and it won't be a problem
but we are not there yet I don't think
I'm going too far out on a limb by
saying the Nexus 6p is the best Android
phone you can get it's big it's
beautiful it has a great camera and it
has really nice software without any of
the junk that other companies layer onto
it to get anything better you'd have to
spend at least 150 bucks more and I
don't think you'd get all that much more
for your extra money it's been five
years since Google started making Nexus
phones and every single one of those
years getting a nexus has meant really
great software and soso hardware I don't
know whether to credit Google or Huawei
for changing that with the Nexus 6p but
I do know this it's great to see a Nexus
phone up there with the best phones on
the market which is where it should be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
