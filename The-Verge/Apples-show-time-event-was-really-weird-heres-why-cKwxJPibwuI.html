“show time” event this week
where it unveiled a credit card,
a news subscription, a TV
app, a game subscription,
and a TV subscription service thing.
And, you know what? This event was weird.
Like, weird for an Apple event,
but also just weird, in general.
I've had a day to think about it,
and I keep coming back to
the same nagging thought
over and over again:
almost none of the stuff
that Apple announced
was made available right away,
which is not how Apple usually
does things. So here's a question:
why did Apple need to
do this event this week?
Okay, so you know the narrative
around Apple as a business.
iPhone sales are peaking, and so
the company needs to come up
with new ways to make money.
Okay, sure, but you shouldn't care
about how much money Apple makes.
You just shouldn't.
I don’t. I only care about one thing:
are the products any good?
The only new service we can actually
make any judgment calls about right now
is Apple News Plus.
It seems good if you like magazines
and so-so if you want news.
It also has some launch bugs.
We're going to look at it much more closely
on theverge.com, so stay tuned for that.
But for the rest of the stuff
that Apple announced,
it's not coming out until later.
May for Apple TV Channels,
summer for the Apple Card,
and fall for Apple Arcade and Apple TV Plus.
Which means, I'm not
really sure what Apple
was doing by announcing all
of it before it was ready.
Maybe they were trying
to get ahead of rumors?
But that doesn't make sense because
the rumors we had already for almost
all of the stuff they've announced
had a bunch of details.
And Apple actually
didn't tell us anything
more than what we had already guessed
based on all of those rumors.
The thing that should have been
the splashiest, most exciting
announcement was Apple TV Plus.
But instead, we got a bunch
of weird light-up reveals
of random celebrities and
then, when they got onstage,
all they did was describe their shows with
these weird wallpaper things.
All connected through Apple!
(clapping)
We didn't get to see, you know,
real previews of the TV
shows that Apple is making.
Worst of all, Apple didn't
even announce pricing
on TV Plus or Arcade.
Pricing! Tell us what it will cost!
Maybe this event was all
about drumming up hype
and trying to use that hype
to pressure more companies
into working with these
new Apple services.
I guess that could make
sense, but
it also seems like this
event isn't really likely
to make Netflix or The New York Times
suddenly want in on this sweet
Apple subscription action.
Okay, so I lied a little bit earlier
when I said that the
only thing I care about
is whether or not the
products are any good.
I also care a lot about how
technology changes culture
and how technology itself is culture.
We've talked about it on
this video series before.
And Apple is merging the
two by putting culture,
like TV shows and news
and games and whatever,
into the technological
products it’s creating,
like the iPhone.
So, while you shouldn't care
about Apple stock price,
unless you're an investor. 
But to be very clear,
I am not an investor.
Anyway, I do think you should care a lot
about how Apple affects our culture.
And, more specifically, I think you
should care about how
Apple thinks about itself.
What Apple says about what Apple is
and what Apple aspires to be
helps us understand what its
products are going to be like,
and how they might affect culture.
Which brings us back
to an earlier question:
if Apple isn't actually releasing products
that we can use right away,
then maybe this event
was about something else?
It was about putting
a stake in the ground.
Maybe this event was designed to redefine
how Apple participates in our culture.
So, that's all really heavy.
Here's something else, something
you might not know about me,
is I used to be a TA at the
University of Minnesota,
and I was a writing tutor before that.
So I have taught a lot
of freshman composition.
And one of the things
that just made me groan,
that made me realize I was
in for a really bad essay
with some really surface-level thinking,
was whenever a student started a paper
by writing out the dictionary
definition of a word,
and thinking that that
counted as some kind
of deep insight into the
topic they were writing about.
You know, like this.
So what is a service?
Well, if you look it up in the dictionary,
you'll see that a service is defined as
the action of helping or
doing work for someone.
Oh God, just, if you're a student,
please just never do this.
Luckily, the thinking in
the keynote got better.
Tim Cook's whole pitch is that
Apple is providing services
because Apple cares more about
your privacy than your bank
or news sites or cable networks
or even game developers.
Apple will give you all of these services,
and then when you use them,
you don't have to worry
about being tracked
by the companies that
provide all of that content.
So, for example, this slide came up
over and over and over again.
All of the stuff on that slide?
They're good things.
There may be even good reasons
to subscribe to stuff through Apple
instead of through whatever
service you're using right now.
But it was, and it still is,
super weird to say that you're
going to provide all of that privacy… later.
When it's released… later.
The privacy angle really
is the main thing here.
And, in truth, I believe Apple
when it says it's not collecting data,
and it's not sharing whatever
data it does collect.
But I also have to admit
that I'm not looking for
more things to lock me into Apple world.
The most popular story that we
saw on our site on Apple day
was the Apple credit card.
And I get it. Credit cards suck.
All of the tracking that they do sucks.
And some disruption there
would be a very good thing.
But is that how you want
to think about Apple?
As a bank or a credit card company?
Or even a next-generation content
subscription service thing?
I don't know.
Tim Cook ended the keynote with this line:
Because at Apple, the
customer is and always will be
at the center of everything that we do.
I want to believe that.
But I couldn't help but
feel like a lot of the stuff
that Apple announced this
week was more about Apple
than it was about Apple's customers.
The company presented a
new vision for itself
and for what it does, but it didn't actually
deliver anything yet but promises.
It was a very flashy, very expensive
presentation of a… business plan?
Apple has always been the
company that delivers. This week,
it was sort of just the
company that promised.
And that was just weird.
Hey, everybody. Thank you
so much for watching.
Let me know what you thought of Apple's
“show time” event down in the comments.
We'll try and hang out and have a chat.
Also, stay subscribed to The Verge.
Were going to have a bunch
more reviews coming.
I'm pretty sure we've got
those new AirPods coming.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
