welcome to top shelf i'm your host david
pierce and this is our weekly show where
we bring you the best brightest craziest
and pixel dentist of the consumer
electronics industry coming up we'll
take a deep look at sony the company is
trying to reclaim its position as a
premium consumer electronics brand
across a number of different categories
but is it working we'll have verbs
managing editor nilay patel and polygon
managing editor Justin McElroy on hand
to argue this week's episode is brought
to you by virgin mobile but before we go
any further let's talk about Mobile
World Congress last week phone makers
and carriers descended upon Barcelona
for the world's largest mobile
conference mwc was in its largest than
you ever this year but it was
surprisingly more subdued there's
actually been a lot of mobile news
recently but most of it came from
outside of Spain HTC and Samsung did
their own thing for their big
announcements and Microsoft and Google
pretty much avoided the conference and
tyrus here's what we did learn while
Nokia didn't announced a tablet like
we'd hoped CEO Stephen Elop told us
quite confidently that it can compete
with Microsoft Surface Nokia did expand
its Lumia lineup with two nice mid-range
devices the 520 and 720 and now after
more than 10 Lumia launches it's really
up to Microsoft to make Windows Phone
more appealing we also got a chance to
see a few of the first Firefox OS
devices which will come to market in the
next few months they're both they're not
very good but these phones are going to
be really inexpensive Mozilla's
targeting the low-end smartphone market
as well as developing countries and
that's something carriers seem to
enthusiastically support all over the
mwc show floor phones are getting bigger
and they're converging in this odd
middle ground between phone and tablet
Chinese companies like huawei and ZTE
are leading the charge and they're using
these phablets to stake their claim on
the global market so yeah it was a
pretty slow conference but we did see
the walking cane at the future which was
a thing and that's awesome but slow show
or not we love Mobile World Congress
because part of the allure is just
Barcelona itself our own dan seifert
took along the wild new sony cyber-shot
rx100 trip around the city to capture
Barcelona in all its glorious detail
check it out and we'll be back with
Nilay Patel with cameras that are always
trade-offs
the best images require bulky DSLRs
while the most compact point shoots are
lacking in both image quality and
control that is until now enter Sony's
rx1 the rx1 is an unassuming camera
that's roughly the same size as Sony's
NEX line of interchangeable lens cameras
it has a full frame image sensor
something that's usually reserved for
those super high-end DSLRs both friend
sensors offer much better image quality
shooting with the rx1 almost feels like
cheating low-light bad light no light
all of those things that are difficult
to manage with most cameras just
disappear when you're shooting with the
rx1 it's also littered with control
dials including three control rings on
the lens it's a system that requires
some setup but once you're set with it
it works really well the rx1 isn't
without its limits though the sheer
compact size of it means it doesn't have
the ability to change lenses and it
doesn't even have a zoom function but
the carl zeiss lens nearly makes up for
those limitations the lens is incredibly
sharp edge to edge even when open to its
maximum aperture and it doesn't have any
vignette e in the corners or problems
with chromatic aberration images are
contrasting it vibrant and the lenses
manual aperture ring clicks along with a
satisfying feel the manual focus ring is
well damped and precise which is good
because autofocus kind of sucks and the
battery life is pretty disappointing as
well and then there's the price the rx1
is nearly three thousand dollars and
you'd be a fool not to buy it with the
electronic viewfinder for another four
hundred and fifty dollars it's
definitely more of a luxury camera the
arcs one isn't perfect it's not for the
faint-hearted or the beginner but if you
do have deep pockets and a love for
photography the rx1 is the one to beat
so Sony's actually been doing really
interesting things in cameras for a
couple of years now and they're doing
innovative and cool things that really
no one else in that space is and
actually think that's the case across a
lot of product lines for sony but here
to disagree violently with me is our
managing editor nilay patel well though
so you're wrong I think okay all right
I'm to talk I'm gotta go no so I think
Sony is in this interesting place where
there they kind of get it now it seems
like with with Hardware especially so
the Xperia tablet Z to me it's like the
best example of this where I had a
meeting with them a few weeks ago where
they showed off the tablet and we're
talking me about it and I asked what the
price was cuz nobody ever leaves with
the price which i think is sort of
hilarious unless it's like eight dollars
and then it like here it is is that it's
eight dollars yeah see you later shut up
um but so I asked and they're like it's
four hundred ninety nine dollars and I
laughed I was like that I think you were
like shut up basically and and he was
like why are you laughing uh and I said
no one other than Apple has ever sold a
tablet for four hundred ninety nine
dollars and pulled it off yeah and he
showed it to me and it was like he was
like it's Finn our screen is gorgeous we
have all this cool technology behind it
we have an IR blaster and I like we can
fill game over everywhere mean ir
blaster yeah there there's five cent
parts in 1973 no but he's right in the
tablet they made the point over and over
he was like whee sony used to be a
company that made premium products for a
premium price and they're like
unabashedly back towards that that's
fine but I think Sony's problem is it's
not that they're doing a new thing for
sony right that they have the same
problem they always have which is they
make tremendous hardware great beautiful
some of the best engineered best design
best-looking hardware in the market and
their software still crap and it's it's
they haven't solved look here's a CLE a
from like 2003 this thing is beautiful
and I reser I wanted one it has a jog
dial and as a high resolution screen in
a 66 megahertz processor it has a memory
at 64 moneyweb memory card that looks
like a stick of gum like only Sony pulls
off this right but it ran palm OS and I
was a failure and when the world moves
on from palm West only had nowhere to go
and it's kind of that case right now
with the tablet see right should have
android they've skinned it it's an okay
skin they've got a bunch of weird apps
that aren't very good right um but
I don't know where they're gonna go with
it i don't know that people are
clamoring for sony software and our
world is completely dominated by
software right but but my thing is i
think i don't know that i totally agree
with that anymore i mean it is but in a
sense that we've i think people are
willing for the first time in a long
time to pay real money for really good
products and we've seen it with you know
the windows laptops are getting more and
more expensive and people are still
buying them and like there just aren't
or any crappy laptops anymore i think i
think people I think Sony makes really
beautiful hardware and i think that the
mark of a good product is hardware plus
software plus like integration with
services I think that's why Apple's
products are successful for example I
think windows products are successful
because the vast majority of them are
cheap and they're getting more expensive
and i don't think that like the
Ultrabook revolution is like taking the
world by storm and i think all the weird
windows 8 stuff is just weird and I
don't think that any of its gonna book
your son√≠s weird Windows 8 what's this
one called this is the vaio duo 11 this
is the vaio duo 11 which is great it's a
weird tablet not a good name it's 16 by
9 which is a bad form factor for tablet
and it does this to turn into a laptop
and this is great this is like a classic
Sony thing that it does only Sony builds
something that does this as beautifully
as this doesn't right and then it does
it and you're like oh this is useless
right I don't want this instead of a
trackpad it's got this weird optimal
thing of the space bar and these buttons
run by my place so it's like great Sony
did a great job executing this idea in
the world of hardware products only Sony
does this in any way that is beautiful
like this one is right but this isn't I
don't think that this is what people are
clamoring for and I think they're
they're putting the overwhelming power
of their Hardware might behind these
kinds of designs but they're not they
still haven't learned how to build
software right so well at SOI agree i
think Sony's not Apple yet right but I
think they're I mean yeah I don't think
anybody's arguing that but i think that
the big first step is we have to have
things that people want to buy sure and
and I really do believe that people want
I mean you're seeing with everything
from tablets to smartphones to laptops
two TVs like people want pretty things
and will pay for pretty things like
Samsung has those tvs with no bezels No
features they just don't have bezels and
they're selling like crazy and they're
insanely expensive so people will pay
for fit and finish in design and good I
think that that put look sony makes I'm
I completely agree with you I think Sony
makes some of the best hardware mark and
it has to be room in the market for more
the damn stuff and I think that now that
like Android is a commodity right
everybody else runs android right and
windows phone is still relegated and
blackberry still relegated to third
player um great so you want an android
phone you want the best one are you
looking to Sony are you looking to
Samsung and I think most people are
still looking to Samsung because they're
everywhere they're out there they're
producing these phones are marketing
these phones and they're still there
nautic thing that the galaxy s3 is like
not expensive anymore it's been
subsidized to nothing right the s4 i
started expensive to go down sis first
for sony to stay way at the top end of
this market they have to offer something
else and they could write they could say
we've got the best image sensor right as
we make really great cameras they could
say we have playstation which they don't
say like they have this idea that
they're gonna be one sony right then
saying it over and over and over yeah
and they're not there so what i think is
really interesting is the tablet z is
like kind of unrelated from the Xperia Z
phone and it why like they're right
there one's just kind of a bigger rare
even their name the same thing right but
one comes out of Sony Electronics one
comes out of sense mobile and I have no
idea why and it's the same for the
computers its name from the tvs that I
think the IR blaster in the tablet it's
really good example right it's why is
that there so it can talk to televisions
right why can't sony tvs in the tablet
talk to each other better than that but
like in in that case wouldn't you rather
i feel like i would rather have
something as opposed to what apple has
which is super tight integration but
only if you buy it's stuff like I I like
this idea that sony says hey you might
own an LG TV and I don't think Sony
likes that idea at all well no they
think they hate that idea but but I'm
not it'sit's they have to be realistic
about it where Apple is just like oh if
you don't own all of our devices sucks
for you good luck but you that's what
that's their goal I mean like right
fundamentally the reason Sony can make
all the great harder in the world but
until they learn for all of their like
warring divisions to talk to each other
and for every sony phone to be a
playstation phone
they're never going to get anywhere
because that's the thing that's the like
the network affected buying all of their
stuff that makes a company successful so
you you actually interviewed Phil
Molineux Sony's I think he's coo yeah
Sony Electronics Tony okay um but so you
interviewed him about some of their new
products and they brought out in this
event all of their products and all
their competitors products and they're
like here's why we're better right in
and was was any part of that story like
we have a better system because we're
Sony and we make all this stuff and
that's great so here's our is really
interesting about that event they had
the tablet there a tablet see which is
beautiful now like it's thinner than the
ipad mini it is really gorgeous hardware
it is and everybody should let in yeah
you know if you're gonna buy an android
tablet maybe you should buy that one
yeah um but the only that was the only
product they didn't have the comparison
so like they had their TV and LG's TV
will they a tape over the LG logo in
case in case you liked it better me but
like we don't wait to know it is and it
but then they had their tablet and they
did not have the ipad right and i
thought that was very very telling why
why didn't dan the ipad i mean like
their whole just because larrison
doesn't hold up right why not though I
mean if they're if they're doing just a
pure hardware comparison in that case
like their thing from the beginning was
like it's thin and it is thinner and
it's lighter and you can hold it in one
hand and like I would think they'd want
to show that especially if you only get
yeah but I think as soon as you click on
that App Store icon I think bad things
happen for android tablets and this is
their problem they don't have ownership
over the core part of what they do which
is they make it the tablet is a computer
right and they don't have ownership over
how good that computer and inherently
will be because the tablet apps on
Android aren't there and that's like
it's just Sony's problem they've run
into a wall because it can't solve their
software problem but like ultimately
what was interesting to me about
interviewing fill that day and seeing
Sony on that day was that they did not
talk about the ps4 which is I think
arguably the most important product that
they have it's the key to this like big
ecosystem network effect where you get
the ps4 and all of the promises that
they've made about it or true then you
will want to buy more sony products
because it is the the center of that
experience we should get into the ps4
but to do so we've brought Justin
McElroy polygons managing editor to talk
to us he has probably more violent
disagreements with both me and Nia life
that's possible so Justin what do you
think is Sony it's only gonna win this
console race this time
it's a little early to make those kinds
of calls we don't even know what uh
Microsoft is is working with if indeed
they release any console at all there's
been no news that would be great if
Microsoft is like now what we're out
this was fun we quit yeah man ps4
mystery but we can't compete with that
listen we got zune we got Bing a lot of
profit centers we are cool we're golden
it's over and we're games for us yeah
but so what did you think about this
this Sony event and they really did kind
of build a ps4 as not only a gaming
platform but like the center of this
whole universe and ecosystem that Sony
is really trying to build I don't know
it doesn't seem like a broad-reaching
strategy for me to try to make it the
set I I mean have we not gotten past
that point I mean are we not past that
white whale of like the the
interconnected set-top box that does
everything and yeah I don't I don't
think I think people want more for lack
of a better term fiddle eNOS that
provides you know I think people are
always gonna have their own devices and
they're not going to want a walled
garden where there's features or they're
missing out on because they're not using
a certain Sony device so um I think it's
gonna be hard for it to be too uh
valuable to have that sort of
integration without excluding people who
are missing out but it's the market for
just a pure game device there I mean
aren't they gonna get crushed by the
ipad in like kids like parents buying
their kids at 329 dollar I've had many
instead of a four-hundred-dollar ps4 I'm
not sure that the metaphor is
necessarily there for a an iPad versus a
gaming console like I I think that um
it's the same metaphorical leap as like
why would you want an ipad when you
already have an iphone i mean it that's
the Gulf we're talking about um i don't
think so i think the leap I think the
metaphor is money what are you gonna
spend your three hundred dollars on and
I think for a lot of parents are gonna
say well i think has games the games for
that thing cost three dollars but the
iphone has games and they're still
selling I think that's crushing the
console market too i think that i think
that's a tidal wave of problems for sony
right i think that people still want to
play a game
with a controller in a box that is that
you put disk into a think that metaphor
is not going away I can absolutely see I
mean like I think the future the in-game
I think for video games is a phone in
your pocket that connects to a
controller that rests on your living
room the phone pushes video to your TV
or your you know your your receiver or
what have you the controller
communicates with the phone in your
pocket like I I think that's the DEP
that's the future as far as I'm
concerned I don't think we get there
this generation I think we've got at
least one more console generation in the
way that we've come to think of it and
for me as someone who puts video games
above other forms of of tech just
because my you know my career at my what
we saw for the ps4 event was super
encouraging from that front I mean to
your point about software they didn't
hit the box very hard it wasn't a
presentation about technical
specifications the person you had doing
the thrust the presentation with mark
Cerny who's like a video game guy I mean
dude made marble madness you know crash
bandicoot he's worked on basically every
major Sony gaming franchise for like you
know 20 years so to me the message that
I got is that there they note that
they're putting that first they're
putting software first at least that was
the message i got from cerny being the
lead architect and the sort of
spokesperson they're pushing their but
so but that sounds like the ps4 will be
this like silo game experience I mean
this is the other part of my argument is
it Sony is and integrating its stuff
together so you know sony has a music
service that like may or may not like
show up on the ps4 right they are gonna
they have a bunch of tablets and
computers so like may or may not work
with the ps4 why wouldn't they want why
would they want to build a siloed
experience for games when they keep
saying they're gonna integrate across
the entire company what's the I mean I
guess I don't see what the value of that
of like what it what it what is the busy
experience that that is not there I
guess is
I don't understand like the ps4 and
really the xbox 360 also for Microsoft
are kind of the gateway drug into these
ecosystems right so in the same way that
like the ipod touch is what gets you
into apple I feel like Sony kind of like
you said they have the music service
they have they'll sell me video stills
like they should be able to move all my
stuff around and let me use all of my
things on my various devices and
Microsoft is being smart with SmartGlass
and stuff like that there try and well
right there they seem to get it I don't
know if they're taking all of the steps
they need to but they seem to get it but
it seems to me that Justin I kind of
think you're right in the sense that
Sony the games were going to be what
sell the ps4 but I think Sony could make
the ps4 what sells its other devices the
ps4 to be what sells Sony right right
and I but and so what well actually what
I'm very cute more fierce ask us Austin
is do you think the games are there to
sell the ps4 I mean I wants that event I
didn't see a bunch of like awesome games
I saw a lot of explosions I saw a lot of
ideas about games that I've seen before
and I can find myself wondering like is
am I gonna buy this because the
explosions are better or am I gonna buy
this because it has new kinds of
interesting games I want to pray so I
guess if I had a problem it was the fact
that like I didn't see a lot of you know
experiences that I wasn't that I'm not
currently getting on my current console
so yeah I mean absolutely if they had a
failing it was like I didn't see that um
that moment that was like I have to own
the system I mean obviously I will have
but but you know what it's also going to
be harder this generation I think maybe
even harder than any other generation
before because in the when you go from
ps2 to ps3 or xbox Xbox 360 you're
really making this leap in the high
definition and like you it is not going
to be that sort of jump like they're not
going to be able to do that graphically
um so it's not going to have the impact
impact there um I'm really hopeful for
e3 I'm hopeful that we're gonna see some
really interesting like gaming
experiences that you can't get anywhere
else because I mean I agree with you the
number of sequels was like really
upsetting I mean there are these big
studios that like
I I would love to see what else they
could do sucker punch for example yeah
rather than like another infamous game
okay I mean I'm sure that'll be that'll
be really good but I'm you know I you
kind of think of a new consoles like the
place where these developers get to
stretch their legs you know and not make
another Killzone game boy you know was
another what was funny about that event
was they kept on saying things like and
we're proud to announce that kill zone
25 will come to the PlayStation I was
like where else is it gonna go like is
hey we're bringing it to the Genesis
what are you why are you so proud of
yourself I forget who said it but
someone said that um Killzone fans are
so our Sony's a analogy for the Canadian
girlfriend no no you guys you good if
she was here she's really gorgeous okay
I think you saw so to show exactly
enough they enough to get people talking
enough of these features that are almost
gonna be accepted in the next generation
like obviously they that we have to have
these features and they're going to look
like innovators when microsoft also has
these features i mean they're gonna look
like oh yeah we've also got a you know
like a safe state or streaming or
whatever and it'll look like it's gonna
get the opportunity to look like they
came up with it so Justin do you think
have we seen enough to be excited are
you excited about what Sony's up to do
you think they're moving in the right
direction or are we still in kind of
wait-and-see mode until you three
absolute at listen if I had if I had
seen um the same sort of arrogance I saw
on display when the ps3 launched I would
you know I would be sizing up for coffin
but I I think that what you saw at this
event was someone who is knows they have
markets here to reclaim that that has
someone out front like mark Cerny that
communicates like hey we care about
games we want your business you know we
want to draw people in Sony right now
looks like it for the video game
perspective looks like a company that
that has it is is ready for a fight and
like I don't know I don't know
or that where that leaves Microsoft and
a fight and if I got a terrible fight
yeah they will have a fight I mean Sonny
look like a company that's saying the
right things that understands the
message that they needed to send to
reconnect with people that hopefully has
learned from the sort of like almost um
you know bullheaded nature the ps3 that
is sort of pushes forward and expects
users to deal with the multiple
weaknesses that that system had five six
seven years ago and continues to have to
this very day alright Justin McElroy
thank you very much we really appreciate
it an exquisite pleasure having me thank
you so much oh that's such a pleasure to
be here the pleasure there was pleasure
all around so it's enough so I tend to
do you take notes for your nose yeah so
I tend to agree kind of with what Justin
just said which is that Sony gets the
right things and this is kind of what I
got from the tablet Z and the whole
conversation I had with them which is
that like they get it they get what they
need to do they get where they need to
go um but i'm i'm curious what you think
like I agree that Android is kind of
their biggest problem like android and
windows are standing in their way
because at some point both of those
things are kind of commodity software
yeah and most people are just gonna be
like well they both runs windows let me
just get the cheap thing that runs
windows yeah so how does how does sony
solve this problem you know anything
it's funny cuz that they've been trying
to solve it in televisions for years and
failing right in televisions are even
more of a commodity then phones or
tablets or laptops right you just buy
when you put your hey walks into it and
Samsung's eating their lunch and I think
that the problem for starting right now
is that Samsung is dominating the phone
landscape aside from apple and they need
to find a way to get back in that game
and I think the Z is a really good
product and that in that line of things
and I think the tablet ease are really
good tablet but I think they need to
find a way to tell people that beyond
hardware beyond just having this in your
hand and being prettier than other
things it will be more useful and more
integrated in your life and that's
always like you know you know how Sony
saves everything saves the world dying
twins
the electronics industry and our hearts
forever how's that IR blasters I think
you're fired I think that's fair you're
fired anyway that's our show thank you
so much for watching we'll be here next
week and every week talking about more
cool stuff thanks for watching tennille
hype sale for being here thanks to dan
seifert and Justin McElroy I'm David
Pierce and catch us next week and every
week
