They look, well, exactly
the same as the old AirPods.
The design, fit, and sound quality,
almost everything is the same as before,
which means that, if you
were waiting for Apple
to improve the fit or the
way that AirPods sound
on the subway, or even just
looking for a new color,
you're probably going to be disappointed.
But you're not here to
learn about the old AirPods,
so let's dive into what's
actually new and different.
(light music)
The new features can be simplified
into four bullet points:
wireless charging, faster
switching between your devices,
better battery life for talk time,
and the ability to call up Siri
without having to tap on the side.
Wireless charging is
probably the biggest upgrade
in terms of your daily use.
You can get the new AirPods
with a wireless charging case
for $199, or you can get the
same wireless charging case
for your existing AirPods for $79
and it will work the exact same way.
If you don't care about wireless charging,
you can buy the new AirPods
with the standard case
for the same $159 price as before.
Now, the wireless charging
uses the Qi standard.
It's the same as the iPhone
and countless Android
phones on the market.
So you can use the same wireless
charging pad as your phone
to charge your AirPods.
Now just put it on the charger
and the little charging light
on the front of the case will turn orange
and you're charging away.
Now one weird thing here is
the charging light will actually turn off
after a few seconds, but the
case will still be charging.
Now charging like this is pretty slow.
Apple tells me that the
case charges at five watts,
which is slower than the iPhone charges at
and can take up to three and a half hours
to fully take up the case wirelessly.
Also, if you're using a stand
style charger for your phone,
that probably won't work for this
because the coils just won't line up.
You really want to be
using a flat pad charger
for the AirPods.
I tested them on the few
pads that we have here
and I had no problem
charging with any of them.
If you're the kind of person
that puts your AirPods case
inside of another case, wireless
charging should still work,
but you probably won't be able to see
that little indicator light.
Finally, if you have a Galaxy S10,
you can use your Android phone
to wirelessly charge your AirPods,
which is never not hilarious.
(jazzy music)
Now Apple says the new AirPods
can switch between your devices
up to two times faster than before.
So if you use an iPhone
and an iPad or a Mac,
you can quickly switch between them.
Maybe it's technically faster,
but it never feels faster to me
because switching devices still requires
going into the settings menu
on the device you wanna switch to
and then selecting the AirPods
and then still waiting a few beats
for them to actually make a connection.
I have to say it.
I love how easy Apple
makes it to pair AirPods
to your iCloud account
and have them set up on
every device that you use.
But I also just wish
they could be connected
to more than one device at a time,
like a lot of other Bluetooth headphones,
like the Bose QC35s or the noise-canceling
Sennheisers I have.
But pro tip for Mac users,
the Tooth Fairy app makes
this a one-click process
and it's totally worth the $3 for it.
The reason that the AirPods
can connect faster now
is thanks to Apple's
new H1 chip inside them,
which also provides up to
three hours of talk time
on a charge, so you can
use them for the entirety
of that never-ending conference call.
The battery life for music
or just audio listening
is still five hours between charges,
but that's still at the top of the range
for what you get with wireless earbuds,
and frankly, I'm pretty happy with it.
Now Apple claims that the new chip
improves voice quality on calls too,
which is nice because I
think that the AirPods
are already the best
headset for taking calls on
and this should make them even better.
But if I'm being honest,
I haven't really noticed
much of a difference in my testing.
That H1 chip is also what
lets you say hey Siri
whenever you want to call up Siri,
and just like you can do on a new iPhone
or the newer Macs, you
don't have to double tap
one of the AirPods to do it anymore.
That's convenient and it
definitely works as advertised.
And it also lets me set
the double-tap action
to another thing like
skip track or play/pause.
But I don't think I'll be talking to Siri
much more than I was before because, well,
Siri is still Siri.
Even with the new chip and
the hands-free ability,
there's still a significant delay
from when I say hey
Siri and get a response
and there's no bell or ding to indicate
that the AirPods have
actually heard my command.
And Siri is still the only way
to adjust the volume on
the AirPods themselves,
which is, frankly, kind of annoying.
Now Apple also says that the H1 chip
will cut down on latency when
you're wearing the AirPods
and playing games, but since
I never experienced any lag
or delay issues with the first gen
while watching video or
playing games on my phone,
I really didn't notice
much of a difference
with the new ones.
(electronic music)
So aside from those things,
the new AirPods are still AirPods,
which means that they're
really great wireless earbuds,
if they fit in your ears.
Now they work for me and,
clearly, a lot of other people
based on how many people
I see wearing them
every single day.
But they don't fit everyone,
and the new iteration
just doesn't do anything to change that.
They also aren't great
in noisy environments
like when you're on a plane
or riding in a subway car
or just on a busy street
because they don't seal
and don't have noise cancellation.
So should you buy them?
Well if you have the first gen AirPods
and those are still working great,
then no, you're not really
gaining anything here.
If you must have wireless charging,
you can buy the case separately
without having to drop
$200 on a full new set.
But if your first gen AirPods
aren't holding a charge anymore
because you've been using
them for almost three years,
then yeah, it's probably time to upgrade
since it's basically
impossible to fix these
or replace the batteries in them.
You'll be getting the
same basic experience
with a couple of new conveniences on top.
And if you don't own AirPods at all,
well, if they do fit in your ears,
then they're still basically
the best truly wireless
headphones on the market,
with great battery life,
solid connectivity,
great ease of use, and
pretty good sound quality
if you're not in a loud environment.
They even work great for Android users
just like the first generation did.
The new wireless charging does come
at an increased price,
but for most people,
the AirPods are still hard to beat.
Hey, thanks for watching.
If you want to know more about
other wireless headphones,
be sure to check out my
colleague Becca's video
on the GalaxyBuds which went up yesterday.
She's got a really great
rundown on how they work
and how they compare to the AirPods.
