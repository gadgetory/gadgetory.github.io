control others since man could first
convey a language or put it in writing
as soon as people had power and one
slimeball that came out of the ocean
developed into a stronger man than his
neighbor somebody had the inclination to
control someone else
you can see a mirror image of society
really watching little children even at
a preschool and you can see factions
already starting at four years old who's
going to be the strongest he's the
fastest who can outwit the other guy and
who can bargain off the most Barbies and
GI Joes to somebody else george bush
senior just didn't stand up and say
there's a thousand points of light a new
world order didn't just start in 91 what
is it steak is more than one small
country it is a big idea a new world
order where diverse nations are drawn
together in common cause to achieve the
universal aspirations of mankind peace
and security freedom and the rule of law
you can sell anything if you think about
it look at the circus and if they can
sell and pitch their goods and hardware
to people and it makes people feel good
even though it's a false sense of
security like we have to do this to
protect you from yourself before you
know it they're raised up on that ivory
tower and it's no longer we're doing
this to protect you from yourself we're
doing this to control you and manipulate
you if we don't do this for your own
good protect you from terrorism give you
national health care because you're too
stupid to pick your own health care and
you sure can't be trusted to build any
highways or control the flow of water
within your state or county or damn it
or have a power plan or anything without
our overbearing guidance so you need to
surrender all these skills and freedoms
to us if you were to analyze them
mentally many would be diagnosis
megalomaniacs and sociopaths everybody
has varying degrees of desires even sick
people how sick they want to be how in
charge they want to be so some people
will naturally be fined of just being in
charge of a few thousand people others
think in the side
nations the best way to control a
population is through resources you
don't gain much ground going
door-to-door and kicking in doors and
doing armed seizures if you can control
the ability for people to prosper and
produce and to eat and to drink then you
control a population by over-regulating
industries with no scientific proof you
have crushed the ability for American
manufacturing to be the lead in the
world and if we're not the lead in the
world and you start closing plants
people aren't working which means
they're not buying food or buying
Christmas presents we should be the
number one exporter of wood products
what do we do we continually year after
year set up and set a new record of
catastrophic wildfires burning up in a
matter of days you cannot recover that I
can't wave a wand to make 200 years 3
interview as a forestry grow for your
children to enjoy so it's that Hegelian
dialectic if you create the catastrophe
then you already have an answer to that
catastrophe ahead of time then you
create a catastrophe so you can come in
and be the hero and save them we cannot
continue on this path without imploding
self-destructing you will always have
predator and prey as we get weaker and
weaker we invite the predator now we can
say it's North Korea or China or
Venezuela an adversarial country that
seeks to have a larger stand in the
world with a military or economically
would be a fool not to pick on a country
with the rich resources that we have and
not make an attempt at a takeover do I
want it to happen absolutely not i'll be
the first person to fight a red wave of
chinese and baiting us i guarantee you
i'll be up front with good friends but
if for an adversary not to take
advantage of our weakening position
strategically or tactically they're not
going to pass
and I don't see how we're going to get
out of the Kirk we're not going to get
through one more generation look at the
ammunition cells that have been going on
what does the USDA Forest Service need
to be stockpiling current combat 556
ammunition of 16 ammunition is there
like some wave of smoking the Bears at a
rabid right now okay somebody's
preparing for something they obviously
aren't doing it to protect us I think
they're afraid of a cataclysmic backlash
I mean you call and push a people so far
before they said enough's enough how do
we mitigate the damage how do we do
something good we do some introspection
if you will I'm not talking some
buddhist thing I just mean that old
phrase are looking in the mirror saying
here's what I believe in and here's what
I'm willing to die for is it going to
happen and we're just going to save the
whole economy and country as we know it
right now or as we know it historically
nope it is in fixable as we know it it's
going to have to implode collapse and
we're going to have to the survivors
that want to prosper and be free again
are going to have to rebuild again</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
