of disagreements recently about patents
Apple CEO samsung has infringed Samsung
denies it there have been motions
dismissals motions to dismiss I'm just
listing court terms I don't really
understand what any of this means legal
jargon but recently there Apple made
some suggestions in a court document to
Samsung about how they could alter the
galaxy tab to make it look less like an
iPad and and Neil I has has has gone to
work with our crack team of legal
experts and designers and put together
how he thinks samsung might get away
from this apple design aesthetic they
feels yeah you know Apple has some of
the best designers the planet they've
got a very aggressive legal team I think
you'll know and you know they also have
a registration the ipad they think the
galaxy tab looks too much like the ipad
and it's kind of true i mean we can just
bring it up here I mean which ones which
right so we made a lot of suggestions to
the court the one running Android is
galaxy tab probably I made a lot of
suggestions a court they're pretty
reasonable and we sat down and try to
think about how you would really
implement this so the first one pretty
basic don't make black use something
other than black in the front so we want
kind of a classy dark red so they say so
so Apple said in this cord dog I just
want to be clear don't have a black
bezel yeah so you're suggesting that
it's like Darkrai the side of a burgundy
I think you really want to step out
right you want to go boy pat like a
Pinot Pinot yeah all right this is I
have really saw you take it further here
yeah well I mean I mean you look at that
you know I think well you know maybe
maybe Johnny I've had a little too much
saying go from a red to a pattern that
will differentiate a little bit they
also said well the bezel you know it's
still kind of looks like an iPad so they
said well make the bezel smaller and I
think we all agree a bezel size are too
big Samsung has really great processor
dual cortex notes in there I've got LTE
radios want to highlight that kind of
stuff so let's shrink the bezel but show
you what's inside galaxy tab
let's really sell it that's great I
think you know you'd still might think
well you know apples proud of their
internals the next suggestion was don't
have horizontal speakers right and you
can see why you've got this all plain
front speakers on the side and we
thought about where do you put the
speakers what do you really enhance the
sound quality of the tablet because what
you're watching a lot of movies so we
went with a triple stereo front
placement center sounds right I'm
straight triple stereo yeah baby is that
how many chit I mean that's left writing
what's the other one you know the middle
one is just it's just some Channel SAN
focus the triple triple stereo triple
scary okay the middle middle ones when
you turn your head hey you turn it
sideways and share it okay I think
reasonably so far reasonable suggestions
yeah but you still think well yeah it's
got an apple vibe to it I think we can
all agree so how do you really disparate
how do you say well you know Apple is
kind of just like you know latte sipping
kind of nerdy guy you want to spice this
thing up we had some texture to front
Apple said don't make the front clatter
you put some spikes on it we make it
really stand out make it really
aggressive did you did you we just
looked at my brace hey I was gonna say
it was read to you guys to get you up
the hospital bracelet put it right on
there is that a handle yeah the hands
yes really I handles great I likes
useful it's not but that Apple said well
it's still too thin right I mean I was
actually a session make it thicker gap
rocks are known for being really thin
and so if you're going to make it
thicker you don't want to just go
halfway you want to really you want to
push it you want to know you've got the
power of android behind you so we went
all the way this as far as we could
and I think that this is a place where
if you had eighty percent vision you
would stop you would say this is fine we
didn't as more this is this is really
good now this is a motorola move I yeah
I mean this is where you stop this is
strong if we're we really want to stand
out in Apple's last suggestion was we we
have a patent on rounded rectangles
right but you don't want to square them
off you don't make them too sharp you
don't want this you want something
organic something natural and so we
thought about it a lot are we spent a
lot of money in on designers and we came
up with this the new Samsung Galaxy Tab
very nice
I mean call me crazy but I still feel
like they're kind of infringing here
yeah no it's all I feel like there it
took a little bit ipad lights yeah I
don't know what you wish yeah which wich
one again is the samsung background
looks familiar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
