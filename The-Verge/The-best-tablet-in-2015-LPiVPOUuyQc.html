year but we haven't seen a lot new from
them so our pick for the best one still
hasn't changed it's the one tablet that
beats all the others are doing tablet
things and at the right size for most
people so the best tablet you can buy is
still Apple's iPad air 2 the iPad has a
bigger better app selection than any
other tablet it's screen is fantastic
and you almost never have to worry about
the battery dying the air tube might be
a year old but it still feels fast apps
and games run perfectly an iOS 9 made
even better at multitasking best of all
we're at a point now where you can get a
really great deal on the air 2 from
stores like Best Buy
or staples plus there's an endless
selection of cases and accessories so
you can make it feel more like yours now
Apple just released the iPad pro it's
the most powerful ipad ever and it's the
best sounding one - there are four
speakers built-in and four artists the
pencil and palm rejection are going to
be a big deal but this thing was just
too damn big for most people if I'm
gonna carry something so huge around I'm
gonna want it to replace my laptop the
iPad pro won't do that but Microsoft
Surface pro 4 comes closest it's also
got a great screen really fun stylus and
it runs Windows 10 so it's more capable
than any I pad you can play Steam games
or stream your Xbox one on it that's
super cool stuff but the surface pro
force problem is that it falls short as
a tablet Apple has hundreds of thousands
of apps all built for the iPad and for
holding in your hand
Microsoft is way behind there and plain
old Windows apps can't really fill the
gap if you need something smaller the
iPad Mini 4 is the right choice it's
more or less a shrunken down air to
almost as powerful beautiful screen and
all-day battery life and the smaller
size makes it easier to carry one hand
in the bus or train but for anyone who
is carrying around a huge smartphone
every day the Mini 4 might not offer
enough to make it worthwhile that's why
I still prefer the air 2 now there are a
ton of Android tablets out there but the
best two are Google's Nexus 9 and
Samsung's Galaxy Tab s2 but Android on a
tablet still pales in comparison to the
iPad
apps don't take advantage of the bigger
screen and performance just isn't as
good Android doesn't even offer
split-screen multitasking by default and
Samsung's own attempt just doesn't work
with enough apps to be really useful
Amazon's got all sorts of tablets too
many to be honest but the best one is
the Fire HDX 8.9 mostly thanks to its
really sharp display Animas ons app
store has most of the obvious apps and
games you'd want but it's still missing
a lot compared to iOS and Android these
tablets are all about entertainment so
you're gonna want Amazon Prime to get
the most out of them cheaper fire
tablets get more of the spotlight on
Amazon's website but you shouldn't buy
any of them their screens are lousy
performance is mediocre and they've got
a cheap glossy design with terrible
button layout there are so many more
tablets than the ones we've mentioned
here tablets for kids tablets that look
like TVs and even tablets that cost less
than a video game like Amazon's $50 fire
sorry but you get what you pay for but
the best tablet in stores today is still
Apple's iPad air 2 it's got the whole
package great design killer screen and
an endless supply of apps now by no
means does the iPad err to reinvent the
tablet it just hits all the right points
better than anything else you can spend
your money right now and know you'll
have an amazing tablet for years to come
