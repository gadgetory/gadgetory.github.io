limited-edition flamethrower in January
and I immediately bought one so I wanted
it because I am full of bad ideas and
love dangerous things but when I went to
pick this up I talked to a bunch of
other people who had ordered
flamethrowers also and most of them just
wanted them as like art objects to hang
in their house so now I own this
flamethrower right and then that's when
it occurred to me I had nowhere to use
it I don't have a backyard and finding a
location for this was a lot harder than
we thought because it turns out a lot of
people are not very excited about fire
we're trying to do this in a safe
fashion I've literally hit just have so
many people that I've called gun ranges
police departments naval bases so we
started reaching out to hackerspaces and
almost all of them got back to me with
very enthusiastic yes so we here at San
Francisco Metal Works to use this thing
we want to use it safely so of course we
have a fire extinguisher right here
there's another one off camera just in
case please don't be a jerk if you own
one of these don't burn anything down
don't put anybody in danger okay so you
may have noticed the propane tank wasn't
screwed into the regulator in order to
make this thing work you've got to do
that propane tanks easy you can just
buying any sort of standard one at your
hardware store and then you screw it in
here and you're ready to rock so to turn
it on there's like this labeled switch
right here turn it in the on direction
then you're gonna pull this here and
that gives you your pilot light and then
you pull the trigger
Veeran you might want to stand back
I'm really excited because we're gonna
be doing my very first cooking show I've
never cooked a steak before so we'll be
doing that and then we're gonna have
s'mores for dessert
one of the things that's difficult about
covering Elon Musk is that it's hard to
tell when he's joking on Twitter I mean
the boring company itself was announced
in a tweet right he was like sick of
traffic and so he was like oh I'm gonna
form a company and we were like is this
man serious yeah the fact of the matter
is the boring company doesn't just make
merch for Elon Musk even though he has
enough fans to justify it I mean the
flamethrower alone twenty thousand of
them are sold right limited edition
that's ten million dollars in revenue
for the boring company and Elon Musk
merch isn't even really what they do
what they actually do is make tunnels
this year I was whenever seeing you see
her I didn't think it was going to be
I'm like mmm really good actually
so that was fun enough but I actually
totally want to make s'mores so we're
gonna do that next
the boring company just won a bid to
connect Chicago O'Hare to downtown
Chicago and LA is looking like it might
fast-track some of the approvals for
them to start digging there - so does
this mean that we should expect more
merchants Elon Musk looks to raise more
money for the boring company I mean
maybe he's talked about these Lego like
bricks that he plans to make out of the
stuff that he digs out of the earth so
that might be coming anyway I expect
we're gonna find out a lot more soon and
while we're waiting I'm just gonna take
this guy hang it up at the office
what kind of boring company merchandise
would you want let us know in the
comments and while you're here you
should definitely check out my actual
job which is the Virg science page on
YouTube I mean product reviews are fun
but really I'm a science editor and I
would love you to see what we do there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
