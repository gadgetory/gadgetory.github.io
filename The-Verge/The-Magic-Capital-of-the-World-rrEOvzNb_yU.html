magic capital of the world
then the town fathers just flipped open
the dictionary and soft : and he said
that's it you know I called the lower
bowel of the state and it's also the
upper digestive tract of magic it's a
town of 1,200 people and it doubles in
size during magic week a lot of people
say it's like Vegas coming to Mayberry
it's just a deal a wonderful thing that
happens when we got here everybody just
shows up here you guys are leave you
compare it to like music festivals this
is like the Woodstock it's so also this
is Christmas to me I would skip
Christmas for this for real okay I'm
Greg Bordner and I'm the president of
Abbot magic company here in : Michigan
my name is Rick Fisher I'm the owner and
president of the fab magic manufacturing
company here in : Michigan my name is
john sturly knee and i own sterling ii
magic manufacturing here and beautiful :
michigan i mean we have one stoplight
may have three magic shops and go figure
my dad came along in 1934 he was the
money behind Percy Abbott so they
started the Abbott magic company
downtown : my dad took over in 1961 and
he'd passed away in 1981 and I've been
running it ever since my folks brought
me up here in 65 my sister and I we did
some fishing it took me over to Abbott's
I was 7 years old got a couple of magic
tricks came home absolutely fell in love
with magic could not get enough of it
the Abbott children were good friends of
mine and so they were the first to jump
on board and say what can we do to help
you open up a new magic company as some
of the other Abbott family wanted to
help him along start the fab magic
company so he has been separate from us
and completely different from us ever
since this is like his tenth or eleventh
year in business one year after they get
together Saturday night I thought hey I
wonder if there's a building available
for sale here in town next week came out
and checked it out buddy or later we
moved in I feel animosity I mean you
know this is my home the owner there but
it seems think that they have no right
to be in town well this is United States
of America anyone can I don't want to
get into that I mean to me it's where I
grew up I mean I played on a football
team with a fighting rabbit on my helmet
oh it's like I know the people in the
cemetery personally they had an open
house when they started in 1934 and they
called it the get together and they've
invited magicians that they had knew in
the area to come and have fun and have
like a party and see their newest shot
but they had a great time they had fun
and really that's the whole basis of
this whole thing even to this day 80
years later it's like a big family
reunion that you want to go to it the
magic is secondary here the people that
come here they were coming 20 30 40 50
60 years and it's all about the the
relationships if people have here it's
the camaraderie that's that's more
important than the magic
it takes place in the middle of
cornfields we're surrounded by lakes I
love to fish I love boating I love water
I love magic and this is what it
combines my mom used to bring me up here
and I was 13 years old it was for the
50th get-together back in 1987 so these
are people that aren't just magicians
they aren't just friends I consider them
family because we've grown up together
the get-together itself hosted by
Abbott's magic is four days it's
Wednesday through Saturday there are
lectures during the day there's a dealer
room where we can buy new magic and then
each evening there's a big show in the
high school there's magicians on that
act for the top cruise-ship entertainers
have Vegas entertainers it's a top notch
show that you see
my first time I was here is 1974 and
then I came back the following year and
I started to be in the competition like
I'm going through town in Michigan you
know should have like you know set your
watches back 200 years I'll go on stage
and people go all we know them it's like
just coming home it's like in your own
living room that's what this is like to
me it's very homey
hey doc come here they want to interview
somebody really important that's actor
SMO Lars he's the local dentist magic is
not illegal but when you stop in the
middle of the road to do your trick then
it becomes illegal so yeah
magic week is always a big influx of
people in tower
you know normally we have a couple horse
and buggies going through during the day
we don't have fights over parking spots
or you know things like that so but it's
never a major problem but for the locals
that is serious they want to get their
mail things like that people stop in the
middle of the road to go talk to
somebody that they haven't seen since
last year and I believe it was in 2003
we had a magician start crossing the
street and actually get hit because he
just got so excited about seeing
somebody he just walked out and luckily
the car wasn't going fast bail you know
everybody has their routine here you get
the same people at the same restaurants
at the same time every morning and then
you have this influx of additional
people that take up their spot at the
restaurant or their spot parking at the
the post office you know we deal with it
it's four days a year and we're okay a
town of 1000 people in the middle of
absolutely nowhere halfway between
Detroit and Chicago has three magic
shops I don't think they have that many
in New York City I'm not sure for a
while there there was some cooperation
we don't see that cooperation now
and that's too bad because we want to
see it's for the betterment of Kohler
there are the new kids on you know I
trespassing if you will but I guess it's
just too big I can't stop it you know in
the magic capital there should be magic
everywhere if you go to a antique
Capitol Laurie and city is known for
antiques
there's more than one antique shop you
know it's not a competition it's let's
try to enhance what we can for the
community for the magic community and
take it from there I got it 29 December
21st 2009 people that know me just
accompany to go here you can hear now I
was winning because you're talking so
much better I was going from profoundly
hard-of-hearing to death between the age
of 17 and 20 so that's when I found
magic at the same time when you lose one
of your sentence like that and it's find
her death people close down you know
they avoid social interaction or they're
feeling comfortable but because I've
been into magic I created it in front of
people to do magic for them so that kind
of kept me out of my show and I didn't
have to hear them
I became center of attention so they
listened to me so if I didn't go deaf a
hobby win here in addition right now
like I say wiggle wiggle wiggle I was a
bully as a kid I used to pick on this
one kid one day he just went off on me
and beat me up and changed my life and
so I thought well what is I gotta figure
out a better way and then one day I went
to school and there was a big circle
around this one kid and I went over and
he was doing a very basic trick that
he'd gotten from the drug store so I
asked him I said hey can you show it to
me and then he showed me how it was done
and it was right then in there I was 11
years old I said well this is what I do
I'm gonna do this for the rest of my
life
guaranteed you want to get out now buddy
no you don't I never got the opportunity
to come here until I was old enough to
get myself here get the money to come
here and I'm not sure if this town
didn't exist if I I might be putting gas
lines in mobile homes hate in my life
right now I did that actually for a
while I think everyone as a kid has a
magic set or gets a magic set and then
we either stick with it for some reason
like we did or we didn't you know
I'm 19 years old I'm a freshman in
college right now I actually started to
do magic when I was in seventh grade as
a way to pick up girls no joke just like
as an icebreaker and it really you know
it didn't work too well the word train
spotter in England is a guy that stands
on the end of the station and when the
trains come through writes down the
numbers on the trains they usually have
it they're a bit mad
and they're what we called train
spotters in England magicians I think a
one step above train spotter you know we
have that strange fascination and that
ability to work on some little tiny card
slide so that's kind of what it is we're
doing something which we really enjoy
and we get a buzz out of doing it
perfectly and that's kind of what the
magic God is all about
Oh Johnny Carson was a magician and he
said he liked being a magician even
though he was very shy it allowed him to
be the center of attention without being
himself it kind of gives them a
confidence that they can they can
express to a group of audience yeah they
probably all had some kind of complex
when they were younger you know what I
mean in in the hobby maybe the outlets
to compensate for it and so you grow
with it and then you through magic you
become a totally different person at the
end you know one two three and four it's
really fun just for you if they change
I think magicians always want to show
people something that they've never seen
before and I love to make people laugh I
love to entertain them and I think when
we get together here there is that
Brotherhood of magicians you know we
live in a world where things are
changing so rapidly and every year when
we come to : there's things that are
still the same
you know magic is bigger than you might
think I have somebody else's heart and
it really is touching to be alive today
I mean God said you must keep this going
it's how I feel you know really I've
been chosen to keep this get-together
going magic is such a universal thing
it's so amazing you can take someone
who's a genius and they're fascinated by
the puzzles of it the magic happening
you can see little kids their mouth
falls open their eyes get big when you
do the easiest smallest of tricks it
brings back a sense of childhood again I
got goose bumps on my arm talking about
it
santa claus used to come and visit me
every year of christmas and dad is like
the most magical thing in the whole
world and i think every magician you try
to capture that you try to this is
something it's just not possible but yet
i'm doing it for you and creating that
wow that was cool if you can create
something and do it in their hands right
in front of them Wow we're gonna have
some fun right now
we were gonna forget about everything
that's going on in life and just be kids
again
when you're smart
when you're smiling the whole world
you when you're laughing when you're
loved
the funny mom
but when you're crying you bring on the
rain most of your slide the RV
Biman I lost when your side
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
