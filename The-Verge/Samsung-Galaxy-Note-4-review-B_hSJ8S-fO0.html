on big phones than Samsung lots of
people have said Samsung was crazy
including me but the note sold millions
but now everyone makes big phones
so here's Samsung's answer to all the
copycats its attempt to level up again
now that big is the new normal this is
the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 the note 4 is
all about restraint actually which is a
strange thing to say about a phone with
a 5.7 inch screen but it's true
it's about doing a few things really
well and worrying a little less about
the rest the first of those things is
the hardware which Samsung completely
overhauled for this device there's a
sharp chamfered metal frame rather than
the rounded plastic or odd faux leather
of past models like the Galaxy alpha
it's a huge improvement it's sharp and
square more like the iPhone 5s than the
rounded iPhone 6 plus which makes it not
quite as comfortable to hold but it
looks and feels great the cheap plastic
era might finally be over the note 4 in
case you forgot what a Galaxy Note is is
huge huge enough to be basically
unusable in one hand a couple of
software tweaks make it a little easier
to wield in one hand like a mode that
just shrinks the whole screen into the
bottom corner or the clever side key
panel that makes finding the home button
easier but no matter what you do this
phone is still gigantic big phone means
big screen though and Samsung delivers
as always here it's a 5.7 inch 2560 by
1440 screen which is about the densest
and richest screen you'll find on any
smartphone on earth oh that displays
like this one have come a long way even
in the last year or so this screen has
accurate and clear colors not like the
overly vivid and saturated note 3 the
screen still pops but this time because
it's so bright and so crisp everything
just looks great there are some oddities
with the viewing angles like when white
turns a bit to pink if you look at it
from the side but the note 4 screen is
generally as good as it could be for all
its hardware improvements though the
note 4's greatest achievement is that it
is massively powerful and totally
customizable but for the most part
doesn't feel overwhelming or confusing
when you pull the S Pen Stylus out of
the bottom right corner you get a few
options for what you can do
take a note draw on a screen shot and so
on and it's more sensitive and better
for those things but you can also use
the Pens to just navigate around the
device to highlight text or manipulate
Samsung's really handy multi window
multi
asking Samsung is ever so slowly
learning how to remove and hide features
how to make something complicated feel
simple a lot of menu options are hidden
now so you can find them if you want but
they won't get in the way for everyone
else some of the less used features are
hidden behind those three dotted menus
and everything just feels much cleaner
but the phone still bloops and makes
weird water sounds all the time and
there are still so many settings that
Samsung needs for tabs to display them
all just still too much going on all the
time
Samsung really is thinking along the
right lines here and it's made real
progress but it has work left to do the
best implementation of all this so far
is in the 16 megapixel camera the app
has been radically simplified so you
only see a couple of buttons at a time
but there's still a lot you can do here
you can for instance tap your finger on
the heartrate monitor and take a selfie
or you can take a wide-angle selfie or
you can yell cheese and it'll take a
selfie or you can take a selfie with the
rear camera but if you just want to
point your phone at your face and take a
picture there's nothing getting in your
way it takes great pictures and shoots
great video up to 4k or in 240 frames
per second slow motion or in fast motion
or in whatever else you can think of the
note always gets samsung's latest and
greatest hardware and it shows here the
note 4 is incredibly fast smooth and
easy to use I had basically zero
performance issues and even with that
fast processor and such an insanely high
res screen the battery is pretty great I
got two days of light use or a day and a
half of heavy use
I could stream music and podcasts tweet
and take pictures and browse the web and
tool around at the s-pen and it would
still last 36 hours and if you're in a
pinch there's the ultra power saving
mode which basically turns off
everything except texting phone calls an
email you basically have a phone from
2002 but it turns 10 percent of battery
into hours and hours of battery life the
note 4 is in almost every way a huge
step in the right direction for Samsung
it's nice looking it's well-built it's
fast and powerful and maybe most
importantly it's a phone almost anyone
will be able to figure out how to use
but this is still to some extent a niche
device the S Pen isn't for everyone
neither is the sheer size of this thing
and neither android nor TouchWiz is
intuitive enough to really challenge the
iphone 6 plus as the big phone that's
the easiest to figure out the note 4 is
the most capable big phone on the planet
but it's not the most usable yet but the
notes always been for power users this
is the best note ever and it's just a
excellent smartphone but it makes me
wonder about the Galaxy s6 or whatever
it will be called if that can be the
everyman device to the note 4's
productivity powerhouse Samsung is going
to end up with a line of metallic
powerful simple smartphones that is
really hard to beat as long as they get
those water sounds figured out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
