proof of what had already suspected
we're all being spied on but long before
Edward Snowden introduced the world to
prism spies like magnum p.i Dick Tracy
and even Veronica Mars were showing us
just how easy it is to keep tabs on
unsuspecting targets and now with all
the new technology at our disposal being
a spy or investigator should be easier
than ever
plus I have this question I want
answered Sam Scheffer my friend and the
verge of social media manager has this
insanely huge collection of sweet Air
Jordans including some no one can find
anywhere how's he getting his hands on
the kicks no one else can seem to find I
assume it has to do with shady deals in
back alleys and probably some illicit
card game I could just ask him but
what's the fun in that
first I need to learn how to do this
stuff how to be David Peter spy
this is Jimmy meses a private
investigator for over 30 years he's
worked for the White House Scotland Yard
and even for boxing promoter Don King
Jimmy is also the owner of P I gear comm
an online store that sells everything
from night vision goggles to nanny cams
and he's also the head of p eye magazine
the biggest trade publication for
investigators around the southeast our
goodness I actually became a private
investigator back in 1979 and technology
really didn't exist that guy so what how
has it changed over the last you know
the few decades you've been doing it
well in the late 70s
video cassette tapes had just been
invented and even then a setup like that
was thousands of dollars and probably
enormous it was you know that the
technology back then was super big and
just evolving now the technology has
come into nano-sized yeah where you know
I can put a video camera anywhere on my
body I could actually be videotaping you
right now you would have mean I'm
assuming that you are from you know 30
or 40 different places just 20 just 20
is good all right so we're gonna need
some tools and Jimmy has plenty of them
most of them are shockingly simple and
not even that expensive so this is the
base of a button camp so I can basically
like replace one of the buttons on my
shirt with right what kind of video does
this look like that's going to record
550 lines of resolution color during the
day automatically switches to black and
white and low-light situation in video
or covert video normally it's two
different pieces the camera and you have
to plug it into a DVR this is a
high-definition recorder and this will
take up to a 32 gigabyte SD card now you
can plug about 10 different cameras into
this device the other device that we
have with video glasses this would run
down to the small of your back nobody
would know that you have it on where is
the camera the camera is actually on the
stem on one side and the microphone is
on the stem on left side blessed big
thing that the difference between the
ones you originally wore and these is
that this is self-contained so the DVR
camera everything is inside those
glasses and again we always recommend
that if you're gonna wear glasses like
that you wear a hat because it just
helps break up the base as compared to
just straight
yeah and there's still a there's a
camera here and a microphone here
actually everything is right over the
center it's on the bridge of your nose
everybody has a keychain for their car
of remote control they can take pictures
they can take video and they can also
record audio and this is like a little
piggy back to the iPhone you put your
iPhone in here and what ends up
happening is there's a camera on the
base now you're videotaping this way as
compared to bring in the phone up where
people know that you're taking video and
this will this also charge my phone's
battery no it's already simple actually
the trick is making it so no one ever
notices and honestly that's mostly still
on me the more I blend in and don't
freak out and seem shady the less Sam or
anyone will think I'm up to something
and start looking a little closer so now
that I've got my gear I'm ready to
investigate
well I have question for you yeah I need
to buy Air Jordans like good ones I need
to buy a friend a present it's got you
and where's
hey need you to have like a jordan's guy
for me i cant hoping you were gonna be
like there's this dude i know the bottom
of the shoe is icy
I'm putting you so deep in this game
right now so like sneaker news like all
the sneaker heads we're going crazy but
all these are hype shoes okay you can
maybe score care of these from nike.com
this second you get them their double
value his BOTS have taken over the shoe
by getting like people have written
scripts well I don't know how to do that
I used to know someone to make a hack
like feet with him I don't know his
email anymore or whatever but if you
have contacts that might be they would
all right thanks dude yeah well okay so
nothing groundbreaking but I know he's
holding something back I want to take
this even farther I want to know where
Sam lives what he does at night we hangs
out with we're talking about the worse I
want to do as much of this as I can
without having to get a license what
what can I do just as a regular person
like how how far down this road can I go
before I run into issues well you're
probably gonna go down a really short
road because the moment you start doing
that you're technically stalking and now
that's a criminal offense so there's a
fine line between what's legal and
what's not legal so I can take a picture
of him but I can't give you something
that your target will do in public is
fair game
but once they start going into private
areas in their home or in a secluded
area or a gated community you're not
allowed in there you get caught in there
you're trespassing let's say I was a
licensed bi how could I track Sam to a
secret sneaker source without even being
there that device will give you 30 hours
of of tracking of motion and then you're
able to monitor that live on your
smartphone or online is there like a PI
app store that nobody knows about that
you guys have all allowed to get abs but
you know I tell you there but I don't
know I'd have to you have to kill me
what you know just had to disappear the
eyes normally may need more than 30
hours of tracking so what they'll do is
they will put the tracker into a
waterproof magnetic case and you just
attach this to the underside of a
vehicle Wow and now that's a hundred
hours of motion unfortunately Sam
doesn't drive a car and I don't have a
PI license but none of that can stop me
from just following him to his favorite
bar and asking him
two questions I need to know his source
TLDR Nike just restocked and today I
swear you had like a hookup
here's my real question
yeah how do we turn this into us getting
rich
I feel like we're like one small step
away from just being a god it's an
awesome
so it turns out being a PI is not a
sexiest Tom Selleck made it out to be
and also way more difficult than I
imagined
just because I have all this gear
doesn't mean I'm suddenly a veteran
investigator that's why in the end I had
to come clean Wow
what is happening right now when was
that filming oh wow wow this is amazing
this is the creepy out that we were able
to do this to you for like a week um yes
and no yes because it's like weird not
knowing that this was happening but it's
not surprising you know when you have no
idea you obviously feel like you're
vulnerable
I did notice her iPhone case was pretty
strange yesterday I did notice that yeah
I was like I didn't know you got a jank
Amazon you know battery pack I know
shots are like so good too and like I
had no idea and also now the the sneaker
hype game is semi exposed but it's also
so impossible to get those shoes so yeah
we still need to start our business yeah
it's gonna have to get rich off shoes
it's perfect so by now you might be
wondering how can I avoid being Sam well
I can't help you there but there are
definitely some ways you can detect
surveillance I would think you would be
more qualified than anybody to like help
people avoid surveillance also is that
part of what you do often we get called
in where people think they're being
watched and they want us to watch them
to see if anybody's watching them but
what can I do myself these are wireless
camera detectors Oh aye and if there was
a camera transmitting in the area we
would see the picture of what's being
transmitted this particular device has
these LEDs right here and I will find
the hidden camera because it will flash
back at me women are buying these like
crazy when they go to a hotel they want
to make sure that they're not being
watched when they go to a dressing room
they want to make sure they're not being
watched so it's kind of an interesting
little tool being API has changed a lot
but with the right gear a toolkit that's
easier to buy and more affordable than
ever a good P I can now always be ready
but it turns out the gear isn't the
point or at least not the only point
Jimmy can blend in be cool and stay
patient in an unmarked
white van I can't do any of those things
well and I can't legally do most of them
at all
I can show you everything that you've
seen here in another month I could use
all this equipment on you and you'd
never see it I believe because you just
your mind is just not set up to think
that you're being watched that way
that's why I got nothing from Sam why I
still don't own sweet Air Jordans but
hey at least I've found a place to get
dollar tacos in New York City I'll call
it even</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
