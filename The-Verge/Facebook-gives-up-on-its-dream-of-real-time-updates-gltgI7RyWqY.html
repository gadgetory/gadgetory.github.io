your real life and your facebook life
would become one in the same well
sometimes dreams don't come true I'm Sam
sheffer and this is 90 seconds on the
verge connecting the app and your
timeline together you're adding all of
the activity and hat and history in the
app to your timeline and you're going to
automatically keep them in sync going
forward so that way anything that you're
do in the app gets added to your time
line that was Mark Zuckerberg in 2011
starting today Facebook is taking a big
step back from automatically posting to
your Facebook page with this new update
auto posted stories from apps like
Spotify and Pinterest will begin showing
up less and less in your newsfeed while
these may just sound like privacy
updates to benefit people looking to
separate the real life from their
Facebook life there's actually much more
to the picture this actually signals the
beginning of the end to Mark Zuckerberg
dream of a world where everything you
play listen to eat or visit get share to
Facebook automatically in real time
Facebook has always been about sharing
what you do in life with your friends
online but the idea of connected apps
reached a climax in early 2011 with the
introduction of open graph and so-called
frictionless sharing which allowed apps
like Nike+ to automatically post where
you went for a run where the Washington
Post's to share stories you've read but
it turns out the world just wasn't ready
for that kind of connectivity in the end
though this is all part of Facebook's
ever evolving history I mean just take a
look at how your profile has changed
over the last decade for more on
facebook check out the verge coming up
we take a look at what the future of
auto posts would have been status
