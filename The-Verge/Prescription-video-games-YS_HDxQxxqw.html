team of scientists has been developing
video games that are supposed to improve
your cognitive function to the point
that they could potentially support
treatment for diseases like ADHD
depression or Alzheimer's in fact they
think these games could be prescribed in
the very near future and create an
entirely new category of digital
medicine is this the next level of video
games
this is neuro scaped
it's a lab at the University of
California San Francisco and it's where
I spent the better part of a day playing
game section someday be prescription
video games led by neuroscientist Adam
Ghazali the team at neuro scape is
entirely focused on developing and
testing games that are designed in some
way to impact brain functions nerves
gifts main focus is on all things
related to attention either selective
attention our ability to sustain it or
to switch our attention between multiple
tasks and these abilities decline as we
get older many different clinical
populations like ADHD and depression
have challenges with them and we don't
really have any strong drugs that
actually work well without side effects
and so the idea was if we can build a
new type of treatment it doesn't rely on
molecules but rather creates an
experienced a very powerful targeted
personal experience that challenges your
brain and optimizes how it functions
Casali has also co-founded a
boston-based company called Achille and
its Achille that is trying to push these
games through the FDA approval process
and in doing so could create an entirely
new category of digital medicine but
let's talk about the games themselves
what was that thing that is you're here
for the screen good thing okay there you
go the first game I tried was called
body brain trainer or BBT the idea is to
use your body to physically select the
digital objects that the game is
pointing you towards so if the game
shows you a pepper you're supposed to
move your hands to a corresponding
pepper on the screen
the hypothesis of BBT is that if we
challenge you cognitively and physically
at the same time your cognitive benefits
will be greater than if you played BBT
on an iPad let's say you got the
interference there you went for the
color exactly so the interference means
what it's called a super fact it means
that you're trying to use one piece of
information but you're using the other
just happen there again ok and how does
that improve over time the goal is that
you learn how to process that
interference more rapidly as a trade the
other game I tried at Naropa was this
labyrinth game which is still in
development it's a virtual City game and
you see stuff in it like a Starbucks or
a chase bank but at each level the city
changes slightly testing your ability to
navigate a new environment the goal with
this game according to Peter waves is to
put demands on the part of your brains
memory system that is destroyed and
Alzheimer type dementia in your mind
you're laying down a grid of what the
town is and it's that process that is
creating connections in the brain that
we want to stimulate keep those cells
healthy I'll be honest I tried to skip a
level in this game and felt pretty
disoriented and not a little bit
nauseous but it is still in beta
Norris cape also has developed a rhythm
game for iPad one that's being used in
the study of older adults to see if
becoming rhythmically superior helps you
in other areas of brain function as well
as a VR application that lets you watch
neurons fire inside a person's brain in
this case is Ali's own brain I'm looking
at your brain upside down that looks
good from there thank you one of narrow
escapes most well-known games is called
neural racer and it's this core
technology that's been licensed to
Achille that company I mentioned earlier
Achille has turned this into a game
called project Evo which the company
hopes will be part of a prescribed
treatment for children with ADHD the
game is currently in phase 3 clinical
trials the work that neural scape is
doing is obviously cutting in
extremely creative in the scientific
world and very innovative and what
Achille does is we find that fantastic
research and we vet it we partner with
the neuroscientists in a very close way
to license and build further what
they've created and bring those products
through great clinical validation to
market as prescribed fda-cleared
products that from a parent to a patient
to a doctor are undeniably medicine so
you might be thinking at this point I've
heard of these brain games before and
you're probably thinking of games like
Lumosity or Brain Age queue or cognitive
which have all claimed to do some
variation of the same thing boost your
cognitive abilities these kinds of brain
training games have actually been pretty
controversial some scientists have
argued that there is no compelling
scientific evidence to date that
training your brain on one type of task
can help it with other tasks in fact a
group of more than 70 scientists and
cognitive psychologists argued this and
an open letter signed back in 2014
other scientists say there's a
substantial and growing body of evidence
that shows certain cognitive training
regimens can significantly improve
cognitive functions the US Federal Trade
Commission has even gotten involved in
2015 the FTC bar at a company called
focus education from making
unsubstantiated claims around its games
for kids and in 2016 the creators of
Lumosity ended up having to pay a two
million dollar fine for deceptive
advertising but those games differ from
what Achille is trying to do they're not
fda-approved for one Achille on the
other hand is taking the research from
neuro scape and other scientists and
attempting to validate their games
gazali says neuro skate games are also
increasingly designed to include both
cognitive challenges and physical
movement which is different from sitting
and staring at a screen this idea of
brain training has been somewhat
controversial and when it comes to the
efficacy of teaching the person one
cognitive task and expecting it to
improve cognitive activities in another
area
do you consider your work to be brain
training we don't really call it that so
much anymore
the term brain training has become
complicated because it's been used by a
lot of companies that have
what I think is like gamified exercises
that often not validate it a lot of what
we do we think of as digital medicine
the challenges with the field really
arise because of two problems in my view
one is that a lot of the games that are
used are not games as we tend to think
of them in the entertainment world type
believe that deep engagement immersion
continuously in these activities and
these experiences is what's required to
really have that impact would be like if
you went to the gym and superficially
worked out for 15 minutes a day it
wouldn't really lead to a change in your
physical health the other challenge is
the scientific validation
it's either often not done or not done
in a well-controlled way the goal is to
have double blinded randomized
placebo-controlled trials just like we
do with medical devices or drugs and
really reach the highest level of
empirical evidence so that regulatory
agencies are satisfied and practitioners
also believe that what they are using is
going to have a big impact
Achille executives agree that it's at
least partly a matter of needing to
gather more evidence in order to show
exactly how the brain is being impacted
the evidence hasn't been clearly shown
yet and that's a huge part of what we're
trying to do here we all believe very
strongly that that is fully true and
it's just a matter of having the data
out there to show it definitively hence
us going through very long very
expensive rigorous clinical trials to do
this right it's very hard to do to
really prove things crystal-clear but
that's our mission that's what we want
to do a chile says that project Evo
could be submitted for FDA approval as
soon as next year but there could still
be a long way to go before it becomes
software as medicine another question is
how the game will be categorized want
this prescription it's not exactly a
medical mobile app as the category
exists right now but it's not your
standards drug or medical device either
but regardless of whether that happens
games like this one and the ones
developed in the neuro scape lab could
be used as biomarkers for future
clinical trials all of which can help us
better understand the human brain if not
unlock its mysteries entirely
you see a brain yep oh no I don't see I
see a health and safety warnings Kristen
Simoes I don't know what that says about
your brain but I don't see a healthy
pretentious about Joseph all now I'm in
your brain I'm flying in now so it's
pretty just pretty nice and manner</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
