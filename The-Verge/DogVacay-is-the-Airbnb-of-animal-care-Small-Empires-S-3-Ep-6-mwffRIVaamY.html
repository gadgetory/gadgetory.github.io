owners with pet sitters through an
online platform the Santa Monica based
startup is using shared economy
principles to change the way we care for
our dogs by offering a new alternative
to kennels but can this new business
make it in the large pet care market
we're a network of over 20,000 dog
sitters who we call hosts across the US
and Canada and they watch dogs in their
own home instead of a kennel dog vacay
ISM the elected was to call themselves
like the air B&amp;amp;B of animal care
essentially this business came out of a
problem that my family and in 2011 we
took an East Coast Swing and left our
two dogs
rocky and Rambo in a kennel here in Los
Angeles we came back to a fourteen
hundred dollar bill more than our entire
vacation and rocky was hiding under my
desk for three days so it began for us
this period of a little bit of
soul-searching and also market searching
to see is there a better alternative and
why doesn't it exist so we started out
as the first dog sitters we put up a
listing on Yelp called Aaron's dog
boarding nothing happened for a couple
months and then I got a phone call out
of the blue and this girl said oh my god
and my friend canceled on me do you have
any spots left for tonight and I said no
yeah let me check the calendar one spot
left you know come on by so we watched
her dog and she wrote a glowing
five-star review and then this business
out of our own home took off so over the
course of eight months we made $35,000
in cash watching over a hundred
different dogs so how do we take this
cozy home dog boarding experience where
we learned a lot and we made money and
had a great time and extend that to
everyone else in the country with a
clear opportunity
the founders faced the task of getting
investors and customers interested but
in the beginning dog faked his unique
business concept proved to be a
challenge to effectively market I talked
to a lot of people and got a lot of like
shrugs you know good luck sounds nice
it's really cute that you watch dogs in
your home sounds like you're really
passionate you know in the business
community the concept itself probably
seemed a little bit outside the normal
wheelhouse of what people were
interested in at the time it's a dog
business and that's not as sexy or cool
probably as a social networking app or
something like that
there's 83 million dogs in the US which
is more than there are kids and the pets
services industry is about 15 billion
dollars and nobody has even one percent
market share some people got it and we
were able to piece together some
investors and we had probably committed
about 600,000 from various angles I mean
just twenty-five fifty thousand dollar
checks and first round capital came in
it was really exciting but the reality
was at that point we launched the
product we have pet sitters we raise a
million dollars and there's no demand
like no one's using it so now the whole
thing pivoted to okay well we solve the
funding problem we sort of solved the
supply problem how do we figure out how
to drive demand you're talking about a
very sacred relationship for people
their relationship with their animals
it's like their family member or loved
ones so how do you get somebody
comfortable with the idea of letting
them give their dog to a stranger
essentially because that's key to making
the whole thing run the single best
thing that we did is we invested in PR
you got to get the information out there
so we did a pretty good job of creating
some early buzz but then what we did is
we started focusing on the stories in
the community using that to sort of push
it out to local consumer press this is
where the things are going to take off
where we had enough people across paid
and direct channels PR what people were
using it and then the word-of-mouth
kicked in and we did service dog vacate
through a friend you really like the
reputation and he encouraged me to check
it out and we did and you know here we
are you know the very familiar
expression that you'll never work a day
in your life if you do something that
you love I definitely love dogs enough
that it feels that way to me
this is the group that actually makes
our business they go above and beyond
and because of that the early
experiences were so good they were all
five-star reviews and that's when the
business really took off
what sets dog vaycay apart is it's
focused on building relationships
between pet owners and pet sitters while
the sharing economy model is becoming
increasingly popular dog beyke looks to
not just build a business but create a
community it's kind of like taking
advantage of the whole movement we've
seen in the last few years with services
like uber and lyft people getting a lot
more comfortable with connecting
with other people out there through
their phone through other devices and
kind of having these transactions where
there kind of got to piggyback on that
success a little bit a lot of my friends
are actually working for uber for lyft
or post mates and all the shared economy
services and I trust them and that's the
face of the new economy that's that's
going on something clicked at when it
was the very very early days of
collaborative consumption I mean very
early days of the sharing economy as
this business was scaling and as I
started to see those things were like
hey there's a simple model here we on
board the hosts we train them we give
them insurance we do the quality control
we do the booking and then it's a
scalable model that's a very personal
relationship people have it they're
animals so how do you put your service
out there and make it feel trustworthy
it's one thing if you're gonna go and
stay at Sammy's house and you like it
but something goes wrong you can handle
it get your animal it's your pet you
know it's a love limb to a lot of people
how do you build the trust with a
consumer in that situation it wasn't
like you just filled out a profile and
we're a dog-sitter we actually
interviewed you we looked at your
reviews on Google and Yelp and we made
sure you were good we are a community
and the community provides a service and
it's very different because now it's not
just about a match and a couple tools
it's about ongoing support and ongoing
relationship building with a growing
community of dog owners and sitters dog
vaycay has proven to be a viable
business but in order to become a major
player in the pet care industry and
compete with big brands like Petco and
Petsmart dog vaycay has to expand its
services well dog Vicky on its own is a
great one trick pony it seems a little
bit small to survive long term we are
arguably the largest quote-unquote
kennel in the world but that still puts
us at a very very small scale they're
looking to expand it to other things I
mean I introduced a de sitter service
this year which is actually very very
smart and to really take advantage of
that whole sector there's things like
grooming and dog walking other things
that they can do to really make this a
more robust business dog vacay is in at
best beginning of the second inning
we've booked millions of nights to date
but that needs to be in a 10
hundreds of million so now that they've
got that one million threshold crossed
it's a you know how do they go beyond
that they say they want to be the
biggest pet brand in the world if you do
a lot more to actually hit that if they
want to beat Petco they have to tackle
Peck the one off Frost
