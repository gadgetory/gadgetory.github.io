today a blackberry world rumor has given
us a sneak peek at blackberry 10 the new
operating system that should be out
later this year now room didn't show us
everything about the OS we did get to
see a few elements so we know for
example that the home screen consists of
four icons that display apps and then at
the very bottom there's a phone search
and camera app we know that when you go
into an app you can swipe up from the
bottom to go back straight to the home
screen and when you're inside any app
you can swipe from the right just a
little bit to see your notifications and
then swipe all the way to the right to
jump directly into the messaging app for
email and other types of messaging
within the messaging app you can of
course tap it a message to go in and
then you swipe to the right to go up a
level and go back to your inbox or back
to your accounts list in a way that's
very similar to the current playbook 2
point 0 OS or frankly it looks quite a
bit like webos three point 0
unfortunately we don't have a very clear
picture of what multitasking looks like
in general with switching between apps
it seems like they might be stacked on
top of each other or you might just need
to go to the home screen but we do know
that RIM intends for everything to quote
flow unquote between different apps and
rim is very clear and saying that every
app is running all the time on the
device and it's not pausing stuff in the
background we also got a glimpse at the
camera app on blackberry 10 and what's
really interesting about that is it's a
it's sort of live all of the time and
when you take a shot you can actually go
into the picture and scroll back and
forward in time to say get rid of a
second where somebody blink to get the
second where they didn't blink we also
spent a lot of time showing off the
keyboard it is a standard multitouch
keyboard but rims built a lot of
technology into it it will detect where
you press for a letter so that it can
adjust to your own typing habits it has
a very accurate auto prediction for
words and in fact it will show word
suggestions above certain letters so
that if you're typing one handed you can
simply swipe up from an individual
letter to throw that word directly into
what you're typing and if you don't like
it you can swipe back to quickly delete
a word other than that we didn't see a
whole lot of different pieces we saw
that there is a you know video calling
we saw a button for that and we also saw
briefly that RIM was able to stream
video wire
mostly from the blackberry 10 developer
alpha device to a television which is
functionality that was already there in
the PlayBook in all it looks like
blackberry 10 is going to be a new kind
of user interface although we haven't
seen all of the pieces yet it's
definitely going to be different from
playbook to point o and it doesn't look
like it's going to be identical to
anything else that's out there right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
