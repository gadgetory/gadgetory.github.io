invested in them and met amazing people
using the internet to change the world
our generation has an opportunity unlike
any other we can create small empires
without anyone's permission back in 2003
online dating was anything but normal
for guys with math degrees decided they
want to build a platform that was not
only going to bring online dating
mainstream but also make it totally free
so here we are the Nexus of Penn Station
Koreatown and Flatiron to meet OkCupid
OkCupid is a dating site it's probably
at this point one of the two or three
biggest in english-speaking world
unprovable because dating sites like to
lie about themselves like daters we
started OkCupid in 2003 I went live and
oh four and match.com bought us in
January of 2011
so it was like definitely a hockey stick
all right it's like a hockey stick on
its side laying on the floor so you guys
have had quite the interesting
trajectory it was it was OkCupid and
dating but before that the spark
yeah the spark the spark was really the
way to get people to know to spark notes
which were you know the free study
guides so the spark was full of like
stupid jokes and tests and all kinds of
garbage that we thought people would
forward to their friends when they got
done with it they would be like well no
no I do and they see that they are about
to fail Hamlet and hello we have Hamlet
here for you to read so it was kind of a
long play that also worked out and we
sold that to Barnes and Noble in 2001
they wanted sparknotes to put in the
stores are we real quick yeah so they
wanted to take sparknotes a website yeah
it was an alternative to CliffsNotes
which was the dead tree books yes and
put it in store stores yes and they've
more or less neglect at the website half
cent that we saw in like 12 years that
it's been we all laughed shortly after
like to delve into so
yeah I wasn't awesomest plan CliffsNotes
was a rather I mean that got me through
God those little yellow books got me
through a ton of my history classes it's
none of my English classes rather in
high school but it seemed like hey the
Internet it's this place full of
knowledge people should be a Laxus
freely right did you just look at this
and say this seems really inefficient
and yeah I mean again like I wasn't I
wasn't the person who thought of the
idea for sure site I don't want to make
sure not the claim credit where that's
not due but yeah the thinking was for
sure like we take something that we see
people charging for and do a better
version for free
um which you know when we are starting
on K Cupid was a similar type of mindset
with a tiny office and just 18
self-proclaimed
dorky dudes running the place OkCupid
has somehow catapulted itself from
obscurity to near dominance in the
online dating world boasting more than 7
million users when you look at the
founding team behind OkCupid a lot of
math nerds yeah I think all four of us
are math majors yeah now how that
clearly had a lot to do with its success
it definitely yes it did yeah when
you're talking about building that
algorithm that actually matches people
in a way that's smarter than your 24 I'm
24 let's get together yeah what what
kind of suffer you think about because
was anyone were there any peers to look
to for inspiration or motivation not
really I mean we kind of just invented
it from scratch by asking sort of you
know plain English questions ourselves
like how do you decide if you like
someone and trying to codify that into a
formula and that was a process
my co-founder Chris Coyne actually did
most of the deep thinking there and then
if I remember correctly it has been a
little while since I've been on OkCupid
uh there's a percent of match percent of
enemy yeah
hi-oh how often do you hear those high
percent enemy stories working out
successfully very rarely okay is
actually working pretty well yeah yeah I
mean it the site definitely works I mean
I'm not gonna sit here and say me if I
figure it out loud but I think that
that's sort of like that would be a bold
statement it would love for you to know
the thing is is that you you know well
some sites do say this kind of thing of
like we will find you the person that
you're gonna get married to or whatever
our take from the beginning was always
like we just want you to get you to the
point where you're having coffee or a
drink with somebody we don't care about
what happens after that is just up to
you there's chemistry there's all those
million other things how drunk you are
whatever Oh as to what is going to go on
with your relationship at that point we
just want to get you to that first date
and so so kind of like um having a sort
of humbler goal helped us be more
effective at reaching that lower bar
everybody has their own version of the
sights so like here's a bluff there we
go
everybody has a full version of the site
with fake user data it all does Abraham
Lincoln with a mohawk oh yeah absolutely
one thing that's awesome about our team
it's different from other sites that are
kind of this big as we have no QA we are
just so we'll do it live
yeah evolution mission code absolutely
and then we'll check our errors see
Susan oh absolutely yeah over here is
kind of our what they almost look like I
don't know what they look like
meaning sauna sham yeah but basically
their individual meeting rooms and phone
call rooms and one of them has a V T C
in them they all have phones they have
very dim lighting but the idea is that
with a mood it's important allow for us
to have a place of a little bit of
privacy a little bit of sound barrier
and then with the bigger ones have kind
of a meeting space and as you'll see now
we play Super Smash Brothers and guitar
in it what are these devices called um
I've never used one in the office but
their phones
so let's say you know you know it's
years in you have mountains mountains of
data and you were then able to look at
that and draw some really interesting
conclusions it's just a very captivating
conclusion yeah on the blog we're we're
do the impetus for that all come from
well it doesn't take long to run any big
website let alone a dating website to
realize that people are pretty crazy and
a lot of wild stuff is going on in your
site on your servers or whatever and and
so that was always there in the back of
our minds and the question was well what
can we do with this stuff like a lot of
it you can't use like the fact that you
know the least black band ever is Belle
and Sebastian or that like women and men
have these different words to describe
themselves well this is like an
actionable or whatever to use a business
word but it's interesting and so we were
like whoa all right what are we gonna do
with this stuff we were free site as a
free site you need I mean a reddit knows
I'm sure better than anybody you need an
ass load of users to make even a small
amount of money so it's 2,000 mid-2009
at this point we need more users and
like we'll try to use this stuff as PR
they were surveyed that the online
dating site OkCupid conducted OkCupid
OkCupid dot-com OkCupid comm Portland
Oregon most promiscuous and we have
Seattle Pittsburgh really Portland and
Seattle took the top spots with
Pittsburgh Pittsburgh a Miami each
edging out San Francisco what's been
your favorite one of those pieces um I
really like I well I like the best
questions to ask on a first date because
it's like actually practical these are
questions that you can just ask casually
that we that indicate deeper things that
you are much more interested in so like
if you want to figure out whether
somebody's gonna sleep with you on the
first date maybe the thing that
correlates most to that that's a casual
question is do you like the taste of
beer so you kind of bring that up see
what they say and then you at least have
some sort of prior on how it's gonna go
and there's and there's there's data
behind sure sure sure yeah yeah and then
we would it differ that is you know we
have two billion or something questions
that have been answered and so you net
you answers to questions sorry so
two billion answers on four thousand
questions so it's very dense I'm out of
answers for questions so you look at the
cross correlations and then we've
figured out tied those back to outcomes
like are you gonna be together for a
long time and all this kind of thing
like real observed outcomes and the
sleeping with one this is probably the
most practical I like that one I like
the ones we've done on like race and how
the races interact but everybody else
doesn't like those and I think cuz
they're - they're - they're too sad it's
interesting because we've never really
been able to take an analytical
approaches because we haven't had this
much serve data that's like dishonest
yeah for sure
yeah no it's amazing because you get to
like watch people act while they think
that no one is watching you know what I
mean so like people are doing this stuff
or whatever on their phone or on their
laptop in their bedroom never even
considering the ramifications that it
can be analyzed later so like if people
act in like a weird racist pattern or in
a weird horny pattern or just do
whatever they're doing it honestly um
not motivated ly like they might have a
lab or on a survey or something so yeah
it's pretty cool do you think math geeks
and specifically statisticians are
having a moment right now some of thats
Nate Silver's yeah for sure keep a trans
blog
I mean Nate's over his his results are
undeniable so you nothing bad to say
about that whatsoever um a lot I feel
like it answer your question is yes I
feel like a lot of is pretty overblown
I've spent a lot of time with a wide
variety of social data at this point
especially you know working on the book
and future blog posts and stuff but like
you know whether there's it's often with
this data there's like a human-shaped
hole in the middle of it all like most
sites like Twitter there it's an amazing
platform for disseminating information
but they don't ask you if you're a man
or a woman when you sign up or your age
or how tall you are or your orientation
or your ethnicity or any of the million
things that we have on everybody so like
you can find out how information flies
back and forth but the deeper questions
of like who is sharing what with Twitter
is a hard place to figure that kind of
thing out so the media story of like
stats and big data on all that stuff I
feel like it's kind of overblown
Madison's Wow all right well I love
Andrea statisticians are gonna be
shaking their fist I do look at a very
strong usually we're here in Sunnyside
Queens meet an actual couple that
actually met on OkCupid because as hard
as the team over there works to get all
the math and all the data and all the
statistics right it all comes down to
chemistry you two met on OkCupid that's
right sure did
oh boy all right so how how did it get
to this I didn't like going to the bars
I didn't like being set up on blind
dates really and I'd even try the
speed-dating and then the one that I
randomly selected was a total scam Wow
so they just charged your card and
totally didn't nobody showed up except
the few other guys were there but the
hosts weren't there so it was just one
of those that was like mmm I need to try
something different a different website
alveen savvy Justin really just came out
of nowhere yeah okay keep it had this
selection process where you could star
who he wanted to get to know better and
we both had rated each other very high
so then OkCupid messages you and says
you have connection he was in hip C
which is not New York City but me not
being from New York
I really didn't know where Pepsi was I
had a quick google it and so who
messaged him first I did okay it was as
I had rated him he's got the right
notification that I gave him like I
think the first message was just an
instant message that said Poughkeepsie
question mark and I said yeah those are
like you know after I googled it I said
what what's this about um and then I
think he responded and was like yes and
then we just chatted and this is how you
know it was an instant connection every
day for three weeks we talked to each
other either by Chad on the phone and
after that three weeks it was like okay
you're not a serial killer let's meet in
person I actually told my mom you know
I'm gonna
this guy I met online and she's like
maybe you have to be careful you know
it's online dating and you really don't
know the person and like mom it's not
the 90s it's not there is a 2000 it's
fine it's safe you know yeah it's New
York City it's not like we're going some
sketch of town or anything you know it
kept stick yeah it's not like we're
going to begin to map out so yeah I told
him to meet us in New York City yeah
safer much safer good
we went out to dinner we'd went for a
long walk it was raining and we share an
umbrella so she very very first maybe
you can love this this is this is like a
rom-com right here's one thing that's
memorable is that not I don't know how
you want to say it but our candle wasn't
lit they gave us the table without a lit
candle so I asked just and I was like
can you get us one from the other table
and he was like really and I was like
please and then he was like okay so we
did it I was like all right he'll he'll
do things for you generally believe now
there are people who because of OkCupid
have found love or found a great
relationship that they wouldn't simply
would not have been able to find oh and
that's a high incontrovertible fact I
mean we set up like forty thousand dates
a day like first dates so tons of I mean
we have this like extreme niche like
menu item like 10 pages deep where you
can tell us if you disable your account
and if you come back to us and you put
in a name of the other person you're
dating like 300 couples a day go through
and tell us bother to go through this
like crazy ass chain saying that they're
in a long-term relationship with someone
from OkCupid so the real number is
probably like 3,000 you know how that 13
of attrition goes right so like um 100
percent yeah I mean there's people in
this office that married the people they
met on OkCupid oh um yes and have kids
from it and some of my friends or
especially like a lot of my
acquaintances have kids with people
they've met with and like it because of
things like Facebook and also just his
life is busy they never met those people
otherwise they might have met someone
else that's also great but we made it
easier and hopefully better every single
stat that we record it's meaningful and
there's a lot at stake emotionally so
you can make somebody feel very good you
can make somebody feel bad the hugely
popular dating website OkCupid is under
fire right now the site allowing
users to pay to filter out potential
dates based on body type nuts yeah I
don't know the start of the process is
when you do that there have been quite a
few naysayers from for quite some time
now who have said you know the Internet
is making us more dislocated than ever
we're having less and less human contact
etc etc d are you guys making a
conscious effort now to actually set
yourself now bring people together
sooner do you think long term sites like
ok keep it are actually gonna make us
more social in the physical sense I mean
for sure I mean I think that is the
paradox that many people have noted that
the internet supposed to connect us but
actually it does connects everybody
because you're sitting there with your
phone or whatever right and like you
know for a site like Facebook it does it
like replaces friend like having a
conversation sometimes or gchat whereas
with OkCupid it like it's it it's meant
to increase the amount of that stuff
that's that's really all we're trying to
do we we don't like it once people sit
and have 20 message threads going on
whatever you know like two-second for
anybody really so like I think that's
part of the reason OkCupid and mass comm
that we were like thriving even though
there's all these other ways to connect
and it's mostly because those ways also
disconnect you a little bit and we're
alternatives to actually get you
together with someone else it seems like
every single website that's out there
startup is for making things easier to
do by yourself everything's supposed to
automate this everything's ecommerce
it's online I don't have to go to a
store I don't have to talk to anybody
everything's automated everything will
be just delivered well this is actually
connecting to people people get to me
because of this hopefully in real in
real life that's our goal
there are plenty of websites that people
use every day not a lot of websites that
actually lead to people getting married
and falling in love after having kids
what what does that feel like I mean
it's awesome I like
uh I think it's a big reason that all of
us come to work every day on time at
least uh you know how maybe do a drag
your ass in at 10:30 otherwise but um
yeah it's it's it's really cool to be
doing something in tech that isn't about
selling Pringles to people who have
tweeted about Pringles or about serving
ads more efficiently or about whatever
any of the million boring-ass startups
that are that are totally great services
that people love or whatever like this
is not that we're not trying to make
money and whatever we make money but you
know there's nothing no harm comes about
Kay Cupid you know it's like people meet
they fall in love they meet whatever
they go on another date it's like all of
that stuff that's generating like the
best thing that you can make all right
there's the stage where you know you
talk about love and being in love and
then I guess at some point there's the
OkCupid profile shut down how how soon
after you guys started dating did you
shut down your profiles and was there
like ceremonies you do it together what
would happen well we discussed it
there's a big discussion yeah um good no
we just talked about it and we're like
you know he's like I'm really happy and
I was like yeah I'm really happy and you
know let's make this official is like
kind of our official thing that's our
anniversary and like um we have really
like nice dinner went to the
waterfront over on Long Island study
this February is very warm very nice
so looking out over Manhattan where you
have a lie and then we were like you
know what you're the one and it's time
to be a big problem what do you think
about the fact that if your site is
successful that is if you can match two
users who want to be together well they
will then not be users of the site
anymore is that a real problem in
downsize let's not remember why is that
not real problem well I mean it's a
thing that keeps us from no matter what
happens okay keep it won't ever be as
big as Facebook I'm not worthy the most
genius when it's an attitude right
no but it's just not possible for that
exact reason so it limits that the
absolute top end but until you get there
um having two people even forget them
leaving the site having someone walk out
the door say how the roommate asked hey
what are you doing where you going I'm
going on a date on this dating site okay
keep it blah blah blah have that
exchange sit on the couch how was your
date go get it in the guy's mind that's
great the best thing that could possibly
happen is two people get married every
fool at their wedding knows that they
met on OkCupid that's 300 people or
whatever there yeah it's like dad is
definitely that's one of those like
non-existent problem I mean it's a thing
but it's it's nice we sincerely would
love it if more people would find love
or whatever they're looking for via
OkCupid
definitely being free and removing the
money equation from from dating it was
amazing it definitely frees you up to be
more moose about it more more human like
you say so
and so we always tried to push it that
way as much as possible keep things
light in the copy keep things open an
interface and also get the platform open
we're like reward shunting people into
marriage wasn't just like JDate for one
specific type of person it was for
everybody for whatever you wanted you
wanted to hook up you wanted to date
kind of casually you wanted to find
someone long-term you wanted to get
married we set it so that you could make
it do any of those things or all of
those things for you and that creates
another again like just like a lower
barrier to getting people to just do
something because they can determine
their goals as we said Justin lived in
Poughkeepsie and I had never been before
so on my first train ride I started to
take a couple of photos on the train
right out and then every time I took the
train I'd ever see him I would take a
couple more photos and these are all
just shot on my iPhone you have set the
bar that's so high for me and for
everyone else watching this so I kind of
hate you for it but this is amazing our
first Christmas together I wanted to
make him something special and so I drew
a picture of the view from his apartment
in Long Island City and then of course
Grand Central where we met I was shocked
this was like one of the best things I'd
ever gotten
I loved it still loved it logical Wow I
were we Wow it is I this is just not
even fair really I it's not fair
I this is that's so awesome and all it
in it started with a little OkCupid
message yeah
tipsy question mark my advances in this
age of social networks and increased
connectivity
we're oftentimes feeling lonelier than
ever what's made OkCupid so successful
in spite of an acquisition is that no
one has lost sight of the mission the
knowledge that if they do their job
right and build the right kind of
software a simple one word message can
turn into a beautiful relationship
it's an OkCupid dot-com poll they said
that Wednesday nights are when most
people get a little go to a visit but
get see and a lot of you want to know
what that means that means you have a
good time in for Kip see
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
