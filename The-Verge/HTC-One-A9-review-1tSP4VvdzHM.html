HTC One a9 the best and most glorious
iPhone clone is ever been there our HTC
logos on the front and back of this
phone and HTC will tell you that it did
aluminum unibody designs before the
iPhone six came along but come on who
are we kidding
the one a9 is essentially an iPhone
running Android it weighs the same as
the iPhone 6s these corners have the
same radius and it's camera and even its
camera flash are shaped the same HTC has
also replaced his signature boom sound
speakers on the front
we do need home button and an integrated
fingerprint reader the button isn't
round like the iPhones so that's
different copy how the iPhone looks is a
common hobby for smartphone makers and
not all that challenging HTC did
something unique with a one a9 however
by copying the hardest parts about the
iPhone integration of all the various
parts into one coherent satisfying and
enjoyable experience the one a9 is fast
ignore what a spec sheet tells you this
phone is as quick and effortless smooth
as any other that I've used this year
I'm especially reminded of Samsung's
Galaxy s6 which before the new Google
Nexus came out was the gold standard for
Android performance also similar to the
s6 is the one a9 size it's only a head
thicker and a bit taller and it's 5 inch
AMOLED display looks almost as good as
the galaxy s6 s Samsung flagship phone
has a quad HD display and the Korean
company's latest high-powered octa-core
processor HTC's new hero phone on the
other hand proves that you can achieve
pretty much the same effect with a
simple tag P screen and less powerful
for still highly efficient components
the one a9 also has the advantage of
shipping with the latest version of
Android marshmallow HTC is done a great
job of optimizing its performance on
this phone with beautifully smooth
animations and responsiveness it's worth
noting that HTC now calls the software
Android 6.0 with sense relegating its
own customizations to a secondary spot
since widgets and themes are still there
but you can get rid of them easily and
just be left with a great performing
Android phone
everything about a one a9 just works the
shape and size of the phone feel close
to perfect and little details like the
rich power button are just right
fingerprint sensor is fast and reliable
make even wonder how I ever live with
that one performance is fluid and the
new solo speaker still sounds good the
camera is also very fast and easy to use
as is usual for HTC the Nova - with one
a9 is that it's also pretty good helped
by the addition of optical image
stabilization it still is in the same
class as the galaxy s6 the LG g4 the
experience at five but it's good enough
to not be a problem it's been a while
since agency could say that about his
flagship smartphones and even though the
company itself won't admit that this is
his best camera I can tell you that it
is the reason we object clones I think
is because they are essentially designed
to receive the one a nice camera looks
like the iPhones but doesn't perform as
well so the user feels duped that's a
valid concern there but a crazy thing is
that the one a9 as a whole in all its
shameless ripoff glory doesn't feel like
that much of a deception its appearance
promises of painless and effortless
smartphone experience and phone delivers
there's really very little to criticize
the one a9 for its battery small but
Android standards but it still lasts a
full day does the trade-off HD makes in
order to make this phone as thin and
light as it is and I think is perfectly
fine for most of the world the one a9 is
worst aspect will be sprites it will
cost as much as flex your phones like
the Nexus 6p and galaxy s6 or say an
iPhone 6 without having a specs or
camera performance to match ultimately
the one a9 will be remembered for its
resemblance to the iPhone more than
anything else which is a shame because
this is one of the best smartphones of
the year from any manufacturer now
because it does any one thing
exceptionally but because it has
everything really well</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
