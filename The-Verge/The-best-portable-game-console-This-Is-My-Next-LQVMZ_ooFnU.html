whether it's on our iPhones our Android
tablets or our thingamajigs but there's
one problem we all like to play
because we go to the App Store you
download something for free and they
click and we click when we click and
then one day we die but why why suffer
why not just play the best things on the
best devices today I'm gonna help you
find so what do I want from a gaming
device it should have a great screen it
should have long lasting battery life it
should control well I can actually feels
like I'm playing the game and it should
have a tremendous catalog of games none
of these do all of those things
precisely but one of them does it best
and that's the PlayStation Vita the Vita
has 3 to 5 hours of battery life 3 years
into my ownership of a Vita I'm still
hitting the high end of that estimate it
has a number of inputs to thumbsticks
multiple face buttons buttons on the top
rear and front touch interfaces it
controls like a console but it also has
console quality video games the
PlayStation Network has a variety of
games to download some of them exclusive
to Vita but also games from Playstation
one two three and now for the Vitas
exclusive catalog is limited to say the
least
Sony hasn't announced any big triple-a
style games in recent memory but the
company has partnered with a number of
indie game studios bringing some of the
best indie games from the PC to the
PlayStation Vita there's also this great
integration with Sony's consoles in fact
the Sony's cross by program if you've
already purchased certain indie games on
one of those home consoles they'll
appear for free on your PlayStation Vita
Remote Play allows you to play games
that are in your home on your console on
your portable device so if you're
sitting on the couch or in bed you can
play Far Cry 4 from 15
now I'm gonna be honest with you I don't
entirely know what the future is for the
PlayStation Vita and I'm not entirely
convinced Sony does either they did
recently update the device to the
PlayStation Vita slim which has not as
nice of a screen but better battery life
and a better charger that said the
PlayStation Vita is the best option
available with its screen battery life
and incredible catalog of games of
course there is somebody right on its
tail the Nintendo 3ds Nintendo clearly
plans to overtake the PlayStation Vita
which is admittedly a silly thing to say
considering it has far better sales like
the PlayStation Vita Nintendo 3ds offers
the improved console light controls it
has a catalog of new and retro games and
it just feels enjoyable to use but most
of the games are going to play star
Mario Donkey Kong and Zelda which is
great if those are the only games you
want to play on top of that Nintendo
keeps fracturing which device you should
be using between the two DS the normal
3ds the 3ds XL and the new 3ds which
isn't even out yet at this point the
best option is to wait if you want to
play games on iOS or Android the best
option is a tablet and of all the
tablets the two best options are the
iPad Mini and the Nexus 9 now they both
have similar let's say Goods and Bad's
goods Bing you can download lots of
great games for very little money and
the bads being most of those games are
utter garbage to find the good games
you're gonna have to dig through a
mountain of and you're still going
to have to do with touch controls which
still aren't quite at the level of
traditional analog stick and face
buttons
sure they have great battery life they
have beautiful screens but the
experience of playing games on tablets
just isn't at the level of playing on
say a Nintendo 3ds for a PlayStation
video and that's why I recommend those
two systems specifically the Vita
because the Vita feels like what the
future of mobile gaming can and should
be I don't know what portable video
games will look like 10 years from now
but my hope is it looks something like
the forward facing PlayStation Vita sure
Sony doesn't quite show the love it
deserves that doesn't mean that we can</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
