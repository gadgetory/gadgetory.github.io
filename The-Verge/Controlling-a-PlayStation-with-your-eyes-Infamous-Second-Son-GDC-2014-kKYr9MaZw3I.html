and I'm about to put my eyes into a
video game
Sony has a demo at GDC 2014 of eye
tracking technology and we're about to
calibrate it right now let's go ahead
about 60 centimeters away from the
screen all I have to do is look at these
two dots and this sensor bar in front of
me knows where my eyes are where I'm
looking at its a gaze tracking system
and as you'll see in a moment we'll jump
right into a game and I'll be able to
look at whatever I want to save all I
have to do is turn my eyes in a
direction and it's going to look at
whatever I'm aiming at right now I'm
just gonna look for the top of the Space
Needle and it's there it stops as soon
as as soon as I get there it knows
that's what I'm looking at and it stops
the camera right there if I want to go
back and look at that power beater of
the wall again eyes look for that box
there it is it stops right there I'm not
touching anything I don't have the
controller in front of me I just look at
something and it goes thing so now I'm
playing an actual part of the game I'm
just running around this environment I
can throw fireballs previously I'd have
to use this right analog stick to
carefully aim where I want to go maybe
even I'd have to stop in my tracks if I
wanted to be able to accurately aim a
fireball now fireballs go wherever I'm
looking now I'm in a combat scenario
I've got some some guards here for your
baby patrolling with submachine guns
normally I'd probably have to stop and
or maybe enter like a bullet time mode
and shoot at them but here I can just
dance around so just looking at these
folks and run towards them and run away
from them to keep tapping just shooting
wherever I want however I look wherever
I think I want to hit something out
comes a fireball works particularly well
when I'm running away from a target too
which is something that's completely
counterintuitive normally but something
that I guess the superhero would
probably be able to do
