we came to III 2013 to find out here
we've got the PlayStation 4 the xbox one
pc it's galore but what are these games
all about of course better graphics play
a role Xbox and PlayStation developers
are competing to build the most photo
realistic virtual cars we've ever seen
and most every ps4 and Xbox one game
looks way better than games built for
the previous generation of consoles
characters and environments are more
richly detailed and where many ps3 and
xbox 360 games didn't even technically
run at 720p full 1080p HD is practically
a given now what could be more glorious
than exploring a giant open-world to
1080p Assassin's Creed Black Flag dead
rising 3 even metal gear solid 5 are
promising huge environments to explore
whether you're sailing a pirate ship
around the Caribbean hiding from hordes
of zombies in a giant city or navigating
Afghanistan by horse those vast worlds
are also more interactive and immersive
than ever before some promised to let
you carve a path through the world
dynamically changing the environment
while others simply put armies of
characters on screen at the same time
those characters might not just be
cannon fodder either they could each
have their own backstory and make you
think twice about shooting them in the
back of the head even as open world
titles do away with the idea of breaking
games in two levels the graphical power
and speed of next-gen machines are
helping to bridge the gap between
cutscenes and gameplay while there's
still work to be done it may no longer
feel like you're watching one game and
playing a different less graphically
impressive one while we're talking about
seamless experiences how about throwing
multiplayer into the mix several studios
are working on titles that allow friends
more bitter rivals to seamlessly join
your ostensibly single-player game while
others are trying to build multiplayer
games that feel like they have a real
merit when you turn off your next
generation console or PC the game won't
necessarily end at least not if you've
got a companion app for your smartphone
or tablet you'll create worlds command
armies that remotely help your friends
or use the device as a virtual reality
GPS so you all get lost in a virtual
worlds we're just beginning to see what
next-gen games are capable of here at e3
2013 looking at the work of developers
who began building
these games with only a hunch about the
possibilities on tap and even then we're
only seeing the initial versions of
these games they created there's still
plenty left to explore</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
