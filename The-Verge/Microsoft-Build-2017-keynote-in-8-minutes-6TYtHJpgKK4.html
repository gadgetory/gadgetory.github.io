of Windows:
the Windows 10 Fall Creator's Update.
Let me introduce you to a new way to transform
your photos and videos: Windows Story Remix.
So here we have a video that Story Remix
has already made for me.
And what's really unique about it is the footage
was captured collaboratively by all the parents
who were at that game.
We've added pen and ink support to Story Remix
and I'm going to show you with this clip.
I'm going to write a fun note right into the
video.
You might have seen inking on photos and videos
before,
but this is new.
I'm going to anchor this note to Gina.
Okay, now check out how the note follows her
as she moves down the field and evades this
defender.
Now on this clip, I want to do something really
special
to make the ending epic.
I'd like to try mixed reality.
Let's put the fireball in the project,
move it over to the soccer ball,
and then I'm going to anchor it to the object.
Let's see how this looks.
We call this Fluent Design.
The Fluent Design system has five elements
that we're playing with and evolving.
And each of these are intended to help
all of us developers build more expressive
and engaging experiences.
In fact, we want to make it so that people
can navigate
all of Windows just using a pen.
Now what I want to do is take you through
this example.
So I'm on a Surface Pro,
and I've got a pen in my hand and you'll see
one of the ways
that Fluent evolves here is I can now scroll
right here by now using the pen.
And if I want to go to a new page, I can just
click a link. There we go.
Today I'm thrilled to announce OneDrive Files
On-Demand.
And there it is.
&quot;Hello&quot; is on the desktop.
Now in this situation, the desktop is stored
in OneDrive Files On-Demand and so syncing
is going to happen
and this enables great cross-device scenarios.
So let me move over here and we'll switch
the screens there
to show how this works across Windows devices.
So on-screen you should see on the left
Sherry's brand-new SurfaceBook.
And she didn't have to do anything and there's
an icon right there for &quot;Hello&quot; on the desktop.
Similarly right next to that you see a Windows
phone.
And here on the Windows phone - thank you
- I can open the OneDrive experience and inside
there is desktop folder
because Sherry's content is syncing across
all her devices
and when I open it up, there is the &quot;hello&quot;
file on her desktop.
So what she experiences is the cloud helping
her get content wherever she wants to go.
But of course OneDrive is available on iOS
and Android as well.
We're announcing today Windows Timeline, the
easiest way to get back to whatever you were
working on.
So let's think of Sherry again at work on
her Surface Studio, she's running some Windows
apps here like always and when she goes down
to the task switcher button, you'll see the
UI has evolved to include Timeline.
At the top as today are her running apps,
but below is a history of all the app activity
and web activity that she's doing.
But all of this data being stored in the Microsoft
graph
allows some pretty interesting and powerful
things to happen.
For one, all that data is there so Sherry
can search.
She just goes up here, clicks the search button,
then she can type whatever term she wants
and will look at all that activity data.
She types kitchen because she wants to pick
up her kitchen remodel project, and when she
does, the PowerPoint deck opens up and goes
exactly back to where she was last using it.
This gets even more interesting when you think
about multiple devices.
So let's imagine Sherry's got her brand-new
SurfaceBook and she hasn't opened the Kitchen
Remodel file on it and she hasn't moved it
to that device, but when she starts using
it, the right things just happen.
As she begins using it, Cortana implemented
as an AI in the cloud, able to look at that
graph data and recognizes that Sherry was
just working on the Kitchen Remodel project
on her desktop PC, so Cortana suggests that
she might pick up where she left off.
She clicks the PowerPoint item, the file is
pulled from the Cloud, she didn't need to
put in on her PC in the first place, and she
picks up exactly where she left off.
I'm excited to announce that iTunes will be
coming to the Windows Store.
First thing I'd share is we're making it much
easier to set up Ubuntu on Windows 10 by bring
Ubuntu to the Windows Store.
So on one click you can easily download and
setup Ubuntu on your Windows 10 device.
SUSE Linux will also be coming to the Windows
Store, so you can download that and have that
shell available for your use to run Linux
apps.
And we are also working with Fedora.
Windows Mix Reality supports the best and
more advanced headsets in the market today.from
the most immersive and most affordable Virtual
Reality experiences to HoloLens, the most
complete, and still only, fully self-contained
holographic computer.
Introducing our newest tool: motion controllers
for Windows Mixed Reality.
These motion controllers were designed to
perfectly complement our Windows Mixed Reality
headset.
No external sensors or cameras to configure.
Giving you the freedom to move from room to
room or, better yet, from house to house.
In fact, these sensors are exactly where you
need them to be.
They're inside the headset, using our industry-defining inside-out tracking technology.
Our system is optimized for where you're looking
at any given time.
If you can see your hands we are tracking
them with high accuracy.
Best of all because the sensors are already
in the headset, I am happy to announce that
this holiday, starting with Acer we will have
the most affordable headset plus motion controller
bundles.
Priced at just $399 for the set.
I am proud to share a transformative project
with you today.
Now this project also happens to be the first
deep collaboration between Microsoft and Cirque
Du Soleil.
Add contortionists.
Wow.
That works very well.
Add Lucy.
So for us now to be able to see that so early
in the process is amazing and totally new.
Usually we have to wait until we finalize
our casting and artists come to Montreal.
But now by looking at it we could even make
changes of some performance or different casting
call.
Starting today I am happy to announce that
you can preorder the Acer and HP Windows Mixed
Reality dev kits at Windows.com/mixedreality.
These are the same headsets that will be available
to consumers
this holiday.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
