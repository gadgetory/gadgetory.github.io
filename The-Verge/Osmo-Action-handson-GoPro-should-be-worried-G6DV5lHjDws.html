I'm just going to fucking do it!
It was freezing, yeah.
DJI has successfully
put cameras in the sky
and pockets of everyone
from professionals to amateurs.
And now they're looking
to enter your… bike frame,
or maybe your car hood,
with the Osmo Action.
(upbeat music)
It's building on the
many small, successful,
super stable cameras DJI is known for,
but in the form of an action camera.
Before we dive in and
swim around some more,
the model I'm using is final hardware,
but it's prerelease software.
So think of this more as an extended hands-on,
rather than a full-fledged review.
So the Osmo Action: it looks
and feels very familiar,
down to the two prongs of its housing.
It weighs about 0.3 pounds.
It's shockproof, dustproof,
and waterproof up to 11 meters.
There's a double locking battery
compartment on the bottom
and a single locking USB-C
and microSD card slot on one side.
A record and power button sits on top,
while a QS button, or
Quick Selection button,
for switching between camera
modes, is on the side.
It feels super rugged and solid.
And it even has a screwable lens cover
and a front-facing screen.
With the cover, you
can easily and securely
put on ND filters,
which is great for filming
on a bright, sunny day,
especially if you're going to be bouncing
in and out of water.
You don't want your ND falling off.
Now, the front-facing screen was
even more helpful than I thought.
And you can switch between
it by double-tapping with
two fingers on the back screen.
With this front-facing screen,
it makes it super easy to
set up a shot of yourself
without having to use an app.
Or while you're riding,
you can quickly look down
and make sure you still
look like the damn champion
that you are, riding a Citi Bike.
It's amazing, and you're going to love it.
Just try not to look down
at yourself too much.
Now, internally, you have
a 12-megapixel camera,
capable of 4K 60 fps video
at 100 Mbps.
Or 240 fps
video at 1080.
The photos are clean in
good lighting conditions
and with the graininess you would expect
out of such a small sensor in lower light.
The warp in 16 x 9 photos
is very alive and well.
But with a 145-degree angle lens,
I really wouldn't expect
anything different.
Now, the shutter button
is extremely responsive,
with no noticeable lag at all.
But where this camera excels
is stabilized video.
Or what DJI is calling “RockSteady.”
It's their attempt at
in-body stabilization,
and it puts the Osmo Action
in direct competition
with the GoPro Hero 7,
which introduced its HyperSmooth feature last fall.
Much like HyperSmooth, RockSteady is just impressive.
You can run, you can
jump, you can skate, and
the footage just comes
out super smooth,
with the teeniest, tiniest crop,
which it does a bit more
than GoPro's HyperSmooth.
But the feature, at large, is incredible,
and I think anyone coming
from anything other than
a GoPro Hero 7 will just be
super happy to have it,
especially without the hassle
of having to have a gimbal.
Now, where I do think the
GoPro has a bit of an edge
is the auto-exposure.
When you look at the footage side by side,
and quickly the light changes,
the GoPro just adjusts to
that higher, brighter light
a teeny bit faster.
I've used a whole bunch of cameras,
and one of my favorite
things to do when I get
a new camera is to check
out its menu system.
It's something that all
users will inevitably face
at one point or another.
And I got to hand it to
DJI: they kind of nailed it.
It's really
intuitive and easy to use.
Swiping in any direction
on the main screen
will lead to camera and video settings,
playback, or the main menu,
which consists of eight
icons to get you started.
Most of them are single
actions, such as the sun icon
leading you to brightness controls.
While others, like the screw,
brings you into a longer,
scrollable menu for the
nitty-gritty controls,
such as voice commands.
The touchscreen is super
responsive, and I was actually
really surprised at how
fast clips played back
on the camera itself.
That was fucking nuts, man.
I would need a
bit more time to know for sure
how the battery life is, but, in my use,
it's been pretty good
and extremely comparable
to the Hero 7.
Yes, the compartment gets
a little bit warm when
you're continuously recording,
but it doesn't get so warm
that I wouldn't mount it to my body.
Woo! Yeah!
One more note
on this prerelease software:
when shooting video, the lag of the screen
is almost dizzying.
And it makes me wonder
if DJI is going to be able to fix this
before this camera hits
store shelves.
Now, software in such a small body
and such high resolution
is a really difficult problem.
So time will tell.
GoPro put action cameras
into the hands of many.
And they were the first to do it,
and they broke all the
ice, made many mistakes,
and lots of versions of one product.
But it allowed newcomers,
like DJI, to come into
the game late and jump
up to that high pedestal
that GoPro worked so hard to build.
Look at the footage of
the Osmo Action versus
the GoPro Hero 7.
You almost can't tell them apart.
I mean, even down to the
mounting systems that
these cameras use, which is a super clever
move by DJI, considering
that GoPro accessories exist
almost everywhere in the world.
And there's one for
anything you could want to
mount this camera to.
So, as a consumer, it might
come down to the price.
And at $349, the Osmo Action
is just a little bit cheaper
than the GoPro Hero 7.
Or it might come down to the brand.
If you already own DJI
products, you're going to feel
really comfortable picking
up an Osmo-branded gadget.
And that slightly cartoonish,
low-key awful sound that DJI
products make? Well, the
Osmo Action has them, too,
and you're going to feel
right at home using it.
I do have a quick question:
I see a lot of people using
GoPros in Times Square
or just on selfie sticks.
What are you guys using
action cameras for?
Are people still mounting
these to surfboards, or
have they just become small
cameras you can take everywhere?
Let me know in the comments,
and we'll see you next time.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
