Pixar Animation Studios you might have
heard of Pixar it's the company behind
Toy Story A Bug's Life wall-e Finding
Nemo monsters incorporated hop and the
company's latest movie monsters
University
I know you're a princess and I'm just a
stableboy
mom would it do grubby paws in my bed
were you kissing my hand ha ha ha no I
want to bun you with all your shedding I
don't shut really I had just started a
Pixar when the first movie came out so I
mean I was a fan of Monsters Inc and
just the idea of telling a college story
and and the idea of telling a story
about a character that doesn't get
exactly what they want was really
appealing to me I think with any Pixar
movie that's the thing that gets us
excited is the thing where we think that
could come off bad where that could be
like the dangerous part the parts like
are we really going to try to do that
because that could be that's where I
think we all get excited like well we
don't have we don't know but I like that
about whenever I hear what the new Pixar
ideas I think I think oh how am I gonna
sell that and that's good because it
hopefully means its original and taking
a risk right Ricky and I both worked on
the first monsters incorporated and if
you ever go back and watch the first one
again you'll notice that the same like
12 background monsters are everywhere we
just like repurposed them and put things
in their hands and stuff so I think you
know we always said that we really use
all the parts of the Buffalo making that
movie and so I think both of us really
want to make sure that we you know
populated the world more densely this
time around normally is a process of
Pixar's we would do as the background
characters later as the story evolved
and was kind of changing we knew that we
need to populate this camp because we
did it so early it would help influence
story so story would come up with gags
based upon some of these design and then
vice versa they would come up with a gag
and hopefully we can cast someone from
this group we need a slug for that okay
let's look at all the slugs I can't be
late on the first day
Pixar isn't structured like a
traditional movie studio instead of
bringing people together on a
project-by-project basis as a group of
talented folks in house across every
single discipline I worked in the
industry for 10 years before I got here
so I worked a lot of different places I
was down in LA and you kind of jump
around a little bit more down in LA here
you just kind of stay I've worked in
places they're out the opposite we have
a term where you know oh yeah well
you're basically just a wrist there and
all you're doing is drawing you're not
thinking which is really limiting you
know you're really you're really
stunting the growth of the film or
whatever you're working on if you're not
allowing an environment where creative
ideas can rise to the top and get the
best product that you can get from the
very beginning John worked really really
hard to form a studio that wasn't higher
up a crew for one film let them all go
restart again and and do that every four
or five years he wanted people to stay
that's you know one of the reasons we do
short films because we have projects
that people can work on in between you
know the time on features and I think he
just he he really really believes that
it's important to keep people here and
keep giving them new opportunities and
new learning experiences the studio's
movies have a distinct look and feel
almost immediately you can tell that
you're watching a Pixar movie that makes
the need for fresh creative voices with
different perspectives even more
important one of those voices is the
director of the blue umbrella the short
film that accompanies monsters
University
I started in 2008 a pizza in the camera
and staging department which basically
does the virtual cinematography of the
phones is an open door policy epic so
about pitching ideas for short films so
anyone can pitch as long as you have
three ideas and I just thought well I
should as well just try it it was based
on a test I had shot just just for fun
on my phone actually of faces in the
city and then I had loaded them up my
computer one weekend and animated them
and that was part of the pitch I showed
just to show what I mean with a city
coming to life you talk to picks our
employees and this isn't a fly-by-night
kind of place people are here for 10
years 15 years 20 years the studio does
a lot to let employees explore different
creative avenues and different
disciplines they may not have the chance
to look at otherwise it's kind of a nice
playground to have people try out new
roles and new positions and even
sometimes in different departments to
kind of be a bit more playful with that
I've been animating since I was a kid
drawing on the cards and I was studying
animation at RISD Toy Story came out my
senior year they came and brought it to
RISD and they were said they were
looking for an intern and I was the
first animation intern you worked on the
monsters Inc as well he said yeah I was
that was the first film I was a lead I
was a directing animator which means I
was kind of a deputy to the sheriff on
that one and then I've supervised two
cars up and now monsters University so
what you have a next one lined up are
you like this stoked for vacation at
this point I am stoked for vacation I
actually I'm in-between I'm gonna try
some
storyboarding and and just approach
animation from another angle and and I
don't know we'll see what what happens
next it is an incredibly supportive
environment so so while it's a little
bit scary we have the confidence that we
have this amazingly talented group of
people around us to help us when we get
in trouble
Pixar's recorded actors in this room for
every film since monsters incorporated
and it's about to get even busier the
company has six films lineup over the
next four years the only question is can
Pixar's approach to filmmaking hold up
under the volume we've developed a
collective style almost because it is so
collaborative here and because the same
people are working on the films for
years and years we are under an umbrella
but it's a very big umbrella it's
exciting as new people come in they
change that a little bit I'm riding on a
couple of things but I'm also helping
out on the upcoming features in the
current staging department so it's a mix
of tons of different things because we
always like everyone works together to
make the features happen and then on the
side you're doing other things as well
there's a desire to say bring something
new here you know what what what do you
want to do it will all get filtered into
you know what I mean into a process that
feels somewhat familiar but that's all
the more reason why you need a variety
of people it's all the more reason why
you need a new outlook well find out
over the next couple of years how
Pixar's aggressive new pace will work
out but inside the studio walls the
focus is the same as it's always been on
creative collaboration and story story
story sometimes we throw the whole movie
out and start over completely it's
really a process of not falling in love
with your work if there is a problem
with the film we're all gonna get
together and fix it and we're not going
to let go until we know we fix it and if
that means pushing a release date or if
that means delaying things on other
shows we'll do it and the most important
thing is we're not really scaling up or
changing the amount of time for the
story which is the one thing I think we
need the time for we're creating more
movies and putting more people on them
but we're back we're back up so that we
still give ourselves the amount of time
for story development that we need right
