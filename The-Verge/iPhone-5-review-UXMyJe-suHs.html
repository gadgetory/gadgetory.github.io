we're taking a look at the iPhone 5
Apple's latest entry into the smartphone
market and perhaps the best iPhone ever
the design of the phone may look
familiar to you it uses essentially the
same body shape and components as the
previous iPhone 4s but the build of the
phone is completely new in fact I spoke
to Phil Schiller at the launch event for
the phone and he told me that while the
design is an iteration of the previous
version its kind of built from the
ground up with new processes and new
materials and you know new funky style
and the phone does look different when
you get up close and personal with it
it's got these edges these mirrored
edges that are really beautiful looking
it's thinner it's a little bit taller
because it's got a bigger screen and and
it is using some new materials there's
glass on it but you've also got this new
aluminum back which feels a lot better
in the hand and that presumably is
harder to break than a piece of glass
the phone is also lighter than the
previous version it's actually a lot
lighter the first time I picked it up I
almost dropped it because I was
expecting more heft it feels smaller
it's thinner but it overall feels
smaller even though it's a little bit
taller the width is exactly the same as
the iPhone 4s and the iPhone 4 so typing
on it won't seem weird or awkward for
most people
Apple has moved the location of the
headphone jack to the bottom of the
phone and it sits next to the new
lightning dock connector which replaces
the 30 pin port that was on every
previous version of the iPhone the main
reason for this is that it takes up less
space it's a much much smaller jack in
fact it's about the size of a micro USB
port but I'm sure that it will rile a
lot of owners of accessories Apple does
make an adaptor that you can stick in
here that will take it from lightning to
30-pin though it does lose some
functionality such as iPod control
inside the box
Apple has bundled their new earbuds they
call ear pods which they say they spent
three years working on generally they do
sound a little bit better than the old
versions they're very base heavy even if
they're not completely pushed deep into
your ear for me they didn't sit in my
ear very well
they basically kind of fell out when I
put them in I have a pair of RHA earbuds
that I paid about 35 bucks for that I
think do a slightly better job in terms
of sound reproduction but as far as a
bundled pair of earbuds the ear pods do
a pretty decent job on the front of the
phone is that new 4-inch display which
is 11 36 by 640 it's a Retina display
and has the same pixel density as the
previous version next to the older phone
it definitely looks a lot better and
even compared to terrific screens like
the HTC One X display it stands out as
possibly the best-looking display on the
market right now it's actually a little
perplexing as to why they made the
screen larger because there's nothing in
iOS 6 that really seems to be taking
advantage of it and in fact as I
mentioned in my review there are some
obvious areas where I feel they could
have utilized the screen for instance
with making the notifications a little
less obtrusive which Apple hasn't done
Apple has tweaked all of its first party
apps to utilize the extra space on the
screen and if you're running an older
app it will display the app in its
original size with black bars on the top
and bottom or sides of it which isn't
really that distracting and certainly on
the black version of the phone you
barely notice but already developers are
working on new versions of their
applications for instance the CNN app
which takes full advantage of this space
inside Apple says the phone has been
completely revamped as well there's a
new a6 chip LTE on Verizon Sprint and
AT&amp;amp;T here in the US and in lots of other
places around the world
larger battery which apple claims gets
better battery life the camera has been
improved a bit as well it's an 8
megapixel camera which is what the 4s
had but Apple claims the optics have
been improved and based on the shots
I've taken with it I have to agree with
them the front-facing camera is now a
1.2 megapixel HD camera that's 720p not
1080 and you can do HD FaceTime calls
with it as well along with the iPhone 5
Apple has introduced the latest version
of its operating system iOS 6 they've
added some sharing options which is
really helpful they've added Twitter and
now Facebook into the Notification
Center they've added options to share
via Twitter and Facebook in a bunch of
different apps Safari for instance which
is very helpful there are some more
sizable additions to iOS 6
the biggest one is probably Maps Apple
has changed the Maps application to
utilize its own services rather than
Google Maps and it's caused something of
an uproar the new maps are excellent for
turn-by-turn directions and the
turn-by-turn worked really well when I
was driving around but for getting
around a big city and for getting
detailed information on points of
interest restaurants or shops it is
severely lacking right now one of the
more troubling aspects of the new
version of maps at least for me is that
it doesn't provide any transit
directions integrated with the maps
itself it requests that you go find an
app that it can plug into and then even
when you get those transit directions
you're taken from maps to that
application to get the directions
they're not integrated into the Maps
application itself Apple did add a
pretty cool new feature called flyover
which is a real-time 3d rendering of
major cities
it doesn't always perfectly represent
what it's rendering in fact there are
some parts of New York that look
basically destroyed by it but it is
impressive when it's working and it's
working most of the time the unfortunate
thing about flyover is that it has
really limited use I mean you're not
looking at an awesome display a flyover
when you're navigating you're trying to
figure out where you're supposed to go
and for day-to-day use I would rather
have Street View on my device than a
really cool render of the tops of
buildings apples also made some pretty
big improvements to Siri even though the
app isn't out of beta it does seem to be
giving better answers and getting those
answers faster than previously I will
say that while using iOS 6 I was
constantly reminded of just how dated
the software feels it's not that it's
bad in fact it's a really excellent
mobile operating system but it just
seems to be more difficult to do the
things that I find myself doing all the
time for instance checking Twitter
constantly or sharing things with people
on different services or taking actions
on notifications which Apple doesn't
really give you an opportunity to do or
changing settings on apps which is often
confusing and convoluted for instance
opening a private browsing tab in Safari
by my count it takes about 6 different
steps to do that the iPhone 5 is
that question the best iphone ever made
and for the mass-market it's the best
smartphone on the market in my opinion
but there is a segment of the market
myself included that would like to see
smartphones and smartphone OS is really
evolved and really try to innovate and
at this point I don't feel like Apple's
really doing that with the iPhone</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
