- Hey everybody, it's
Nilay with The Verge.
I'm here with Apple's new Mac Pro.
We've been waiting for this
machine for a long time.
The previous Mac Pro
came out like in 2013.
It was that round trashcan.
Apple said it had designed
itself into a thermal corner,
pulled it off the market,
and started redesigning this machine
to be inherently modular.
That's what they said.
So, we expected a big tower,
but we got a tower that's kind
of unlike any other machine.
It's all built inside of
a stainless steel frame.
All the components mount to that frame.
This cover is just to manage the thermals.
Inside, you've got an Intel Xeon processor
with up to 28 cores.
There are eight PCIe, four slots.
There's an expansion slot for IO.
That has an headphone jack,
which is very important to me.
It's got two USB A ports
and two Thunderbolt 3 port.
There's an additional
USB-C ports on the top.
There's also incredible graphics.
So this machine that
you're looking at right now
that I'm sitting in front
of is playing 8K video.
That is running on an
additional card called
the Afterburner card that you
can configure into the system.
It's an FPGA that accelerates
video rendering of this kind.
This machine also has Radeon
Pro Vega II graphics, the dual,
so it has four GPUs in it, which is wild.
All that stuff is configurable
when you order it.
There's not a lot of details
on how that's going to work yet.
All we know is that the
base price of this machine,
the one that's been announced is $6,000.
Apple says that compares
favorably to comparable PCs
with the same specs that
come out at around $8,000.
There's also three fans on the front,
a blower on the side to
manage all the heat generated
by that Xeon, by those graphics cards.
Apple says that, under a desk,
it will be as quiet as the iMac Pro.
We'll have to see.
In this environment, it's
extremely hard to tell.
Here's my favorite feature.
You can get it on regular stands
or you can get it on casters.
This one's on casters.
I don't wanna move this one too much,
but you can see, it rolls.
I'm also sitting in front of
Apple's new 6K retina display,
the Pro Display XDR.
XDR stands for Extreme Dynamic Range
instead of just high dynamic range.
It does a thousand nits
of sustained brightness,
up to 1,600 nits of total brightness.
It has a million to one contrast ratio
using what appears to be
a very aggressive local dimming system
and a heat management system with the same
lattice pattern on the
back to manage its heat.
It's really cool, it
looks really beautiful.
It's so hard to show
you on a YouTube video,
but I promise you, it
looks really, really cool.
That display is $5,000.
You can get a matte version for $6,000.
And a stand is optional, it's a $1,000,
but you could probably just get
a cheap VESA stand if you want.
But the cool stand that Apple makes,
it rotates in portrait mode,
it's a thousand extra
dollars for this display.
So one thing that Apple
did not talk about today
was putting Nvidia graphics
cards in this machine.
It's something a lot of people want.
Right now, the only
options we've heard about
are those Radeon Vega II cards.
We're gonna talk to you Nvidia
and see what they have to say
about supporting this machine.
One of the things Apple
is really excited about
is a new module called
the MPX Expansion Module.
In this machine, actually,
the graphic cards
are sitting in an MPX Expansion Module
That is PCI plus Apple's Thunderbolt 3 bus
on a special connector.
Proprietary cards are really interesting.
They let you do really cool things.
The big promise here is
if Apple can continue
to support those cards over time
'cause these machines are expensive
and they're gonna last a long
time, so we'll have to see.
The sexier Mac Pro really
feels like the successor
to the cheese grater tower that
all of us have been wanting for so long.
We will know much more about it
when it comes out in the fall.
Right now, the only
price we have is $6,000
for that base model.
I imagine Apple's gonna sell this
mostly as a configurable system.
That's the whole point.
Whether you're gonna add
that afterburner card,
what graphics cards
you're gonna put in it,
what processor you're gonna put in it,
all of that is gonna
hugely impact the price.
We're gonna find out more in the fall.
So that's everything I
know about the Mac Pro,
but Dieter and I are here at WWDC.
We're gonna find out everything we can.
Stay tuned to The Verge for more.
Bye, okay.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
