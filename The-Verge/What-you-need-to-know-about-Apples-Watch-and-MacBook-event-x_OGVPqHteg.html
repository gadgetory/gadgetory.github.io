Francisco California we just got done
with the Apple spring forward event and
we were expecting most of what we got
but there was a surprise we started out
with HBO now which is coming exclusively
to the Apple TV and I'm really excited
it's 15 bucks a month but I've already
cut my cable and I really want HBO so
I'm gonna buy it that's great
apple also drop the price on the Apple
TV to 69 bucks honestly that's the right
price for the Apple TV so it was a good
move I wish they'd do something more
ambitious with the Apple TV but as
always we're just gonna have to keep
waiting
then the MacBook oh my god the MacBook
is amazing it is just crazy thin it's
13.1 millimeters which whatever but it
weighs 2 pounds and 2 pounds spread over
the 12 inches of the thing especially
when you have it open it just feels like
nothing it's crazy light the keys are a
little bit flatter they don't travel as
far honestly it feels weird at first but
once you get going on it once you use it
for a while I think it's gonna be okay
same thing with the trackpad they've got
a whole new trackpad that it is the same
press no matter where you click on it
and they have a new feature it's called
force click where the harder you press
on it it can do different actions so the
example is if you press harder on it it
can fast-forward through a video more
quickly or more slowly I had a really
hard time with it at first I couldn't
get the thing and just just push down
too hard I don't know everybody else was
fine with it everybody else loved it so
I'll play around the sensitivity
settings a little bit after I practice
with it I got a little bit better at it
so we'll see but bottom line even if you
you know don't use it it's still a great
laptop the other thing you know about
the MacBook is that its own
has the one port the USB type-c port no
SD card no standard USB you'll have to
buy an adapter if you want to use that
stuff but it's a really important port
it's going to like change the way we
plug things into each other it can be
used for power it can be used for USB it
can be used for display and that's what
I want I want a single port for
everything and even if I have to deal
with a little bit of hassle now the
dream is worth that hassle in my opinion
and I really like I don't know I'm
optimistic that all the other
manufacturers are gonna be on board I'm
optimistic that we're gonna see PCs and
other Macs and I don't know phones all
using this port and monitors and that's
great I just want to have the same cable
I don't want to have a million different
cables the screen is beautiful to
retinoic class display and it seems fast
enough will happen actually use it at
length to really see but at $12.99 it's
a little bit expensive but totally worth
it
and I didn't hate the gold one the gold
one looked okay which seemed crazy to me
but it looks great and the dark grey one
looks really great now the last thing
that we saw today was the Apple watch
and we were hoping for like something
new we didn't quite get that we did get
to see some demos of some new apps I
know we saw over and we saw SPG we saw a
garage door opening app so that was all
cool but mostly it was Apple trying to
convince us that the whole thing makes
sense
I used it in the hands-on area and man
I'm telling you you're not going to
understand how to use this thing until
you spend a good 5 10 minutes with it
like you have to hit the digital crown
to go home and again for apps and
there's another button for communication
then you swipe down for notifications
and you swipe up for glances and glances
are different from apps and then there's
force press which is different than just
tapping on it and use that to change
watch faces and also do some other
things I'm not really sure I just kind
of felt lost it a little bit and you
know I'm not really bad at computers and
I you think that I just figured this out
so Apple still has some work to do there
and I would say that if you're thinking
about getting an Apple watch
you really should like play around with
one for as long as you can before you
make your decision because yes of course
once you use it for a while if you own
one you're gonna get it but it takes a
while to get it the hardware is still
beautiful I'm still really happy with it
most people I think are going to want
the Apple watch not the sport Edition it
has a better screen a better sapphire
display and just the metal looks nicer
but it's a lot of money to spend on a
SmartWatch when it's weird to figure out
how to use it and you're not sure if you
need it and that was it
so HBO now super excited the new MacBook
Snoop are excited and Apple watch not so
excited it looks great it feels great
it's not great to figure out how to use
we'll see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
