for getting stuff done
the ideal BlackBerry user doesn't have
time to mess around doesn't have time
for games and definitely doesn't have
time for your nonsense BlackBerry's new
passport is just a smartphone for that
person but for the rest of us it's one
of the strangest phones on shelves today
the $249 passport or $599 unlocked is
what you would get if you took a classic
blackberry and stretched it in all four
corners making it a giant square slab of
a device it weighs nearly 7 ounces
measures over 5 inches tall and over 3
and a half inches wide it's actually the
same size as a standard international
passport it's a solid hefty device it's
got a steel frame and a soft touch
finish and it's wider than almost every
other phone you can buy including
samsung's new Galaxy Note 4 and the new
Apple iPhone 6 plus the password is
awkward in your hands and awkward in
your pockets and I definitely dropped it
once or twice in the few weeks I've been
using it it's awkward dimensions are
thanks to its giant square display as a
4.5 inch high-resolution IPS LCD panel
with 1440 by 1440 pixels and a dense 453
PPI it looks great it's got wide viewing
angles and no visible pixels and you can
really see a lot on this screen it's
great for reading great for navigating
spreadsheets and great for plowing
through email but unsurprisingly it's
not great for watching video or playing
most games because no matter what you do
there are annoying black bars above and
below whatever you're watching but if
you live your life in a spreadsheet the
square screen is perfect for that below
the display is a three row physical
keyboard it's an honest-to-goodness
throwback to what blackberry is best
known for it's similar to the BlackBerry
keyboards of yesterday but it's not
really as good because it's too wide and
it's impossible to type on with one hand
worse the spacebar is strangely jammed
up into the last row of keys instead of
below the letters like every other
keyboard ever it's something I can never
get used to and I'm still way faster and
a good virtual keyboard I'm wondering
why blackberry just didn't extend the
phone another quarter inch and put in a
fourth row considering the passwords
already a massive phone the keyboard
does have some cool tricks it's got a
capacitive touch layers you can swipe on
it to scroll through web pages and email
and you can also use it to move the
cursor around when you're typing but I
found it's just easier to use the
touchscreen for doing things like that
the passport runs BlackBerry OS 10.3
it's been refined and tweaked and looks
a whole lot nicer than it did a couple
of years ago but it's still the same
interface heavily reliant on swipes and
gestures and it's not particularly
intuitive blackberry 10 centers around
widgets app icons and the hub the hub is
a good
it attempts to group all of your
notifications in one place but it's
still not as good a notification
experiences Android or even iOS little
things like marking a bunch of Twitter
notifications as read still take way too
many taps and for some reason insists on
showing all of the appointments in all
of my shared calendars instead of just
the ones I actually want to see it's the
area where BlackBerry has the most
potential but it's still unfulfilled
but the biggest new feature in
blackberry 10.3 is a new virtual
assistant it's like Siri it's like
Google now it's like Cortana but it's
just not as good this virtual assistant
can perform web surges make calendar
appointments set reminders and do more
with just your voice it's intelligent
and it's got good voice parsing
technology but it's often slower than
the options on other platforms to fix
its long-standing problem of no apps
blackberry is now pre loading the Amazon
Appstore on the passport it's a huge
step forward the Amazon store has many
more apps and blackberry store ever did
but it's still missing popular options
like Instagram snapchat and more
installing apps from the Amazon stores
at raw requires multiple screens button
presses and loading bars before the app
is actually usable for the people that
this phone is built forward the Amazon
App Store provides more than enough apps
but if you want to use the latest
messaging app or post photos to
Instagram you should probably look
elsewhere the password is the most
powerful hardware BlackBerry's ever put
in the phone it's fast most of the time
and the browser is really quick and
responsive but if I try to multitask or
do a lot of things at once the system
definitely slows down opening the camera
can take multiple seconds and sometimes
it just doesn't happen at all that's
pretty unacceptable for a high-end
device in 2014 and certainly not one
with as much RAM as the passport the
cameras the best camera BlackBerry has
ever used that's not really saying much
it's a 13 megapixel unit with flash and
autofocus and can shoot 1080p video at
30 or 60 frames per second image quality
is okay it's not great but the bigger
problem is it's just slow and a defaults
of the passports odd square format even
though you can't share any of those
square photos to Instagram you can't
change the passports battery but the
integrated cell is really big and it
lasts for a really long time there
wasn't a single day where the password
didn't last all day for me and many
times I could go two days without
plugging it in two days of getting stuff
done just like blackberry intended but
when everything is added up the
BlackBerry password is a niche
smartphone if there ever was one
BlackBerry's built a phone that's a
shrine to everything the company has
done for the past decade and a half it's
a big productivity powerhouse that's
designed more for work than fun it even
looks like it's wearing a suit but
despite getting a number of things right
the passport fails on some
vs ones like the keyboard that makes no
sense and it's giant awkward to use
dimensions it's a perfect phone for very
select few people and it's clearly the
best that Blackberry can do but for the
rest of us that left BlackBerry's behind
years ago BlackBerry's best isn't good
enough and there's nothing in the
password that's going to bring us back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
