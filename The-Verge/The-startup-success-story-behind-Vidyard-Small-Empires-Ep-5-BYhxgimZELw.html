you may not have heard of before but if
you have is because you know that this
is the tech hub of Canada
it's home to blackberry the University
of Waterloo and scores of startups we're
gonna get to know one in particular
that's doing something pretty unsexy but
whose technology is vital so the way
will consume video online it also
doesn't hurt that this is home to the
largest Oktoberfest outside of Germany
I'm Alexis Ohanian start-up founder and
Y Combinator partner over the last year
I went on a two hundred event book tour
and met people building small empires
all across North America now I'm back
with a new season revisiting some of my
favorite stops from the tour
it's really hard to start a company in a
vacuum that's why so many entrepreneurs
flock to Silicon Valley it's where all
the other people working in startups are
however there are small cities all over
North America where one massively
successful company can cause droves of
like-minded people and companies to
flock there like Waterloo Ontario where
blackberry formerly rims headquarters
are the problem is sometimes that huge
company's business can go south causing
the local economy to suffer there's a
phrase for this boom buzz but the buck
mostly refers to a natural resources
just here so what happens when the boom
was in technology do all the engineers
and entrepreneurs leave do they build
something new in the shadow of a
crumbling Colossus
my name is Michael Witt I'm one of the
cofounders of vidyard and video does
video marketing platform so very high
level what we do is we take people's
video assets we encode them for playback
on all devices we track how every single
person use that content and we give that
data to their sales people and their
marketers so that they can use that
information to make better videos but
also to have relevant conversations with
people that have interacted with their
content on their website now you didn't
start out this way now what was the
original company like original company
was something called redwoods media and
the idea was that we would help
companies make videos and so we'd go in
and and make these videos learn the
business and produce an asset or a
series of assets for a company to put on
their website and what would happen was
they were looking for a technology to
easily host those videos and they also
wanted some lightweight analytics to
figure out how many views they got
because their CMO or the person that
kind of drove the business decisions
said ok if we're spending ten thousand
or twenty thousand dollars on these
videos how do we ultimately tracked ROI
how do we know these videos did anything
to improve performance of our web
destination how did that turn into
vidyard so we were looking for a way to
differentiate ourselves again we were
making videos for clients does not scale
yeah no it doesn't it was a lifestyle
business but it was something you know
to not be working for the man was pretty
cool and that was that was what we got
into it for and then we're looking to
differentiate roads media a little bit
so we said how can we offer video
content with the guarantee so we're
gonna produce a video for your business
and then we're gonna guarantee that a
certain part of the audience will make
it all the way through and and being
able to offer that kind of a contract
was really attractive to client so it
helped us close some deals and then
based on that we obviously had to have a
platform to physically track that and
and ultimately I think both Mike and I
were probably better engineers than we
were creatives in the first place so we
built this this tracking platform to
track the videos we were producing for
clients and quickly the the demand for
that product superseded our
two great videos how would you guarantee
that people would watch all the way to
down the video so we couldn't actually
guarantee that that would happen but it
was more than it if it didn't happen we
would reproduce the the video for them
so I guess it was more like a warranty
and that if it didn't if the first video
we produced didn't didn't meet that goal
then we would produce another another
version our our producers incidentally
guarantee that people watch to the end
of every episode of small empires
yeah I'm sure it'll be true but wait so
you're you're now getting some traction
you're realizing you're software the
platform which will scale is he's
getting some interest yeah when did you
decide to apply to Y Combinator so we
were doing both at the time we applied
to YC we applied to Y Combinator with
the vidyard vision obviously I don't
think the the consultancy was a fit for
their model obviously but we applied
with the videoid vision we we got that
interview we were able to show them that
they the application reviewers didn't
watch our application video and I think
that I kind of surprised them a little
bit yeah um and we got it and so from
there um you know it was from our first
meeting with PG it was stop working on
this other thing and and you know let's
focus on video this is all happening
while you're a university then it's time
to graduate what what was the decision
that wasn't a no-brainer you had co-op
jobs yeah that's a very good question so
we had this thing called project
Christmas and project Christmas was that
we needed to make $50,000 selling videos
I end platform licenses such at the time
were only $20 a month prior to Christmas
2010 and if we hit that goal we would
not go out and pursue opportunities with
other companies you know we had that
revenue goal on Christmas Eve the goal
was by Christmas and we hit it on
Christmas Eve and and you know from
there it was let's go for it
historically the best data you could get
for things like film or television was
pretty awful
it was Nielsen ratings or test
screenings none of which were terribly
helpful but it was the best you can do
now thanks to the internet thanks to the
software we can get real-time analytics
about what parts of our videos you loved
or hated even an episode of small
empires like this we can learn at
exactly what moment you click stop
please don't that means we can try
harder the next time and maybe do less
of the stuff you don't like and more of
the stuff you do so you can continue to
go about watching your videos and we as
video producers can learn how to make
them even better my name is Wes Alcon
I'm the marketing manager here at Athena
software we've developed a web-based
application that's used by social
service agencies throughout the world so
for example groups like United Way may
be using a system like ours vidyard
allows us basically to take somebody
whose neck knows nothing about our
company they click on our video to watch
it they now know who we are we're from
where we're at and where we're going
within two minutes then the next part of
the journey is vidyard delivers them at
our case studies page now they can read
about clients that are similar to
themselves and how they've used our
software and system to really transform
their organization you can go into a bit
of a TT a bit of detail how has vidyard
helped you make a video like that more
effective ah cool so with that type of
video for example normally you'd have a
video on your website sitting there and
people would view it and you know people
have viewed it be it by the views but
what happens next and the dots where
video really steps in and it helps
deliver the next step makes them go to
the next step of the journey that side
of it is what the other side is the data
on the back end of video art allows us
to actually improve those types of
videos so we're able to go and see how
much of the video is being digest in a
walk point and when people start
dropping off we can go back we edit that
video see where they're dropping off and
make the corrections and ultimately get
a higher completion rate through the
video surely this is technology that
other
pure video hosting companies wish they
can either emulate or maybe even acquire
and that would have been a very
different trajectory for the company yep
why have you chosen this one during our
seed round when we were fundraising one
of the big video platforms said hey
wouldn't be cool if all of you guys that
are working on this technology came to
work on our technology and that was a
pretty attractive offer because we're
right out of school we had no money and
this was life-changing money potentially
in front of us but the problem was we
felt like we were on to something
and why comment had validated our idea
and we have customers validating our
idea and we're also pretty young and it
felt like an opportunity and an
experience that would be stupid to miss
out on and we wanted to build a big
company we wanted to change the world to
something I'm so affected and going and
being an engineer on an already existing
product or existing platform you have a
small change and a small impact on that
but it's not the impact you ultimately
want to have not the experience we
ultimately want to have so it's very
experience driven you know another
reason altitude which is kind of
interesting is as we came back to this
region for personal reasons as well
family was here and taking that offer
from this organization would have made
us have to live in Silicon Valley and so
it was kind of a myriad of things that
you know drove us to that decision but
because we had customers that were
willing to spend money on the technology
there's only a handful at the time you
know quick back the napkin math would
indicate that if this is growing and it
is growing and I can't see any reason
why I would stop growing this is not the
right time to sell so the decision was
was kind of made out of you know where
we're at who's using the technology and
what we want to do in our personal lives
and we always kind of put you know the
way we feel about that stuff first and
I'm very happy we made the decision
because I've learned so much we've had
so much fun building this business that
I don't think we would have had if we
had taken that acquisition of her
there comes a time in every early-stage
startups life when they get an
acquisition offer from some large
competitor these usually referred to as
aqua hires because they're essentially a
signing bonus and the employees the
technology all get gobbled up by that
big company you know it is a significant
amount of money plenty of founders do
accept it the fact is though as soon as
they sign those documents they go from
being the boss of their own startup just
being an employee at a large company so
what was it like watching V rise and
then fall of rim or Blackberry oh I
remember so Devin Devin didn't tell the
story but his mom would Devin wanted to
come work with me and wanted to do the
the read was media thing and he
mentioned he was at rim at the time and
his mom didn't want him to go because
rim was such a stable company and you
know that was the ideas you know you
graduate you get a job at Rim all the
smart people go work at Rand slash
blackberry and you'll be set for life
that company is team a look how big it
is letting people work there and Larry
Smith told me when I was starting this
thing and I was struggling with that you
know in my own way with my parents a lot
of university bred startup founders feel
this way they have pressure from the
parents go work for Google he said you
know there is no more stability and
going to work for a blackberry rim then
there isn't going to work for yourself
because a blackberry rim you are
basically a function of someone else's
destiny and when you start your own
thing it is all you and the only person
you can blame for failure is yourself
and if you are not someone who likes
failure you won't fail you will find a
way to ultimately succeed that's what I
told my mom and she was like you're
right this is the time to do this thing
this is cool and that's what I tried to
tell Devin's mom and you know she didn't
like me for a little while
but eventually we got to a point where
there was revenue and there was
stability in our business that it made
sense and and he you know jumped ship
and he did it early and he wanted and he
pushed for it and that's when ultimately
the company started that was the place
to work that was you know there was the
hot thing for a number of years back in
the early 2000s late 90s and and that
made it you know I think as a another
startup coming up at that time it would
have been awful tough to get talent
um but we're fortunate now that that
spotlight is a little bit off them and
we can start looking at the great
companies that are that are forming here
locally and you have incredible talent
coming out of there are our CMO was a
senior guy blackberry was the youngest
VP in their history and and he's joined
us now it's just a super intelligent guy
that you know blackberry went through
and he trip and trained him up and he's
you know it's incredible to have talent
like that that's very hard to find be
local we're here at the University of
Waterloo in front of engineering five
which is not the most creative name for
a building but it is the hub for all
those amazing co-op students we've been
hearing about I'm gonna sit down with
the Dean of engineering to talk to her
about what it is about this place and
about this curriculum that makes it so
special
could you break down for me what the
co-op program is the co-op education or
the cooperative education is a
structured system of combining classroom
learning with practical work experience
so how it is structured is when the
student comes in on the fall term they
will complete four months of school work
and then half of them will go out to
work for another four months and it
alternates school and work school and
work until they graduate and students
can also use that time to start a
startup as long yes so co-op itself the
structure remains the same we have
evolved over time you know the
innovation of co-op is to see what that
students aspire to what are they
interested in doing and we're finding
the increasingly number of students are
interested in starting up the companies
so what we do is we have a Enterprise
co-op with a coop program which started
about six seven years ago and the
students rather than going out to work
for industry they will start their own
companies so they will register with a
Conrad center
and have a mentor to help them make sure
that they're spending time studying the
company and they will check in every two
weeks the mission they making progress
and getting and they get also a lot of
advice and mentor mentoring from venture
capitalists in the area angel investors
and also the professors at the Conrad
Center would you do for your co-op I did
some management consulting I did some
pure engineering software development
type stuff and project management stuff
as well so I was a trim locally which is
obviously a big part of the local
community here and then I spent some
time Toronto and in st. Louis as well -
what was that portion of your work
experience at rim likes you just
graduated yeah you had relationships
from the coop and then you were just
like hey guys I'm back you know nothing
really changed from from co-op to
full-time and I think that's the best
experiences that you can come in being a
very you know ready to go employee like
I'd already worked there for a year in
basically the same job and that's why we
hire coops at vidyard today - is is you
know they're the ultimate goal is to
recruit them after they graduate let's
say there's a student here right now and
she's working on brilliant technology
who owns that intellectual property well
that is the one of the interesting and
important starting points of the water
University of Waterloo and that is
creator-owned intellectual property so
when you have an idea and you create it
you want it the Dean of engineering have
no you don't even get a little bit not
even a little taste you know when you
feel and you know that you own the
intellectual property you have freedom
you have the freedom to speak you have
the freedom to talk about it your
freedom to build it and the freedom to
know that you can walk away with it
gives them the confidence they can walk
out of here and start a cup
and this is great for the nation it's
really good for the country I do think
that there is quite a bit of a talk
about the decline of blackberry
well the founder of blackberry was a
student at electrical engineering here
and what to you Mike Lazaridis and when
you think about the guts he had to start
a company and you know you know when he
was very young and to develop the idea
of a smartphone right and you know that
kind of confidence and guts made a
difference for this for this region
blackberry may have you know contractor
in size a little bit but they have they
are still the largest tech company in
Canada so it grew very quickly it had to
you know you know you had to contract a
bit but it's still the largest and it
has provided the sentiment that we have
the talent and the guts to move in the
area of technology we are the
penological help I believe of Canada um
do you think maybe it even helped I
don't know I motivate founders even more
knowing that this once tightened had
fallen and there was an opportunity oh I
don't doubt it because now there's the
whole velocity scene happening of the
garage with all sorts of companies in
there and it's always handy to have that
one Trailblazer that one Idol I guess to
to starting something up so it might be
that Idol to other founders that
potentially are considering it there's
an example of it going and succeeding
and so everybody thought that about
blackberry I mean there wasn't a day
that went by that the front page of the
record had something about blackberry in
it and so when blackberry started to
flounder people start to get very
worried like is this community going to
be screwed and the important thing to
remember is there were 600,000 people in
this community I think there's actually
no 750 in kitchener-waterloo
and 10,000 of them worked at blackberry
so it wasn't like a huge number of
people but as a huge number of knowledge
workers and BlackBerry casts such a huge
shadow and everything that was happening
technology wise is community for so long
that nobody even knew that startups
existed and blackberry did lay off a ton
of people but they all got displaced and
a ton of those people were commuting in
from Toronto and just found jobs and
Oracle or other businesses that have big
offices there and so I haven't actually
seen the impact of that other than the
fact that we have a number of great
people and really smart people that left
blackberry when that started happening
in search of greener pastures so it
hasn't been a bad thing for any reason
and what do you hope vidyard is doing
years from now it's uh you know it's
hard to imagine but uh you know I think
we're going to build a really great
technology parks and you know I think
that we do it for the team members we do
it for Kitchener Waterloo we do it for
Canada and and we do it for you know
just being really passionate about what
we're building and you'll continue to I
presume poach talent from blackberry and
from the University here oh absolutely
um you know we're this is our
headquarters our home and again there's
so much great talent whether it be
coming out of companies like blackberry
or rather be straight of the school or
or folks we have to import and I think
we're at the scale now where you know we
can attract folks from from the bigger
cities from Silicon Valley from Toronto
and waterloo's got a great brand and
it's a very exciting place so you know
it's uh you know we're gonna grow into
it
we're here in the anechoic chamber the
University of Waterloo there is no noise
here just signal that's what you need
when you want to take a longer-term
perspective on things it's exactly what
the university has done with regard to
intellectual property instead of
obsessing over every idea and the head
of their students they're trying to give
them freedom so they can go off create
amazing things that only benefits the
university long term
likewise when a founder has a decision
to take an early acquisition and she
decides not to she's doubling down on
herself she's taking that longer-term
perspective on what that startup can one
day be it's that same mentality that has
allowed the region of Waterloo to not
look at the decline of blackberry as a
decline of their community instead it
just means a richer more diverse
ecosystem many many more startups now
that if anything have just made it a
stronger place vidyard data and
analytics show that more customers than
ever opting for a mobile experience but
mobile apps can do so much more than
order food or book massages mobile
point-of-sale apps like Vantage allows
small businesses to accept credit and
debit as Pam the system also ties in
with your inventory system so you always
know when you're low on something health
tracking apps allow patients to monitor
their heart rate and send the results
directly to their doctors companies are
even using mobile apps to make it easy
for employees to clock in and
supervisors to manage their reports how
can a mobile app help your business for
