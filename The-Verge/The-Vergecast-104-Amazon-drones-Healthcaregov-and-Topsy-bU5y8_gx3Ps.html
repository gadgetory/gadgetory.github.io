verge cast for the week oh it's the
second week of December 2013
I'm Josh Topolsky I'm Paul Miller I'm
Nilay Patel and we have go ahead popper
been the Ben popper drone editor Ben
Pappas row editor drone expert drone
aficionado yes Ben Benjamin J popper
there's a drone over middle and I'm a
quarter drone my initial m mi was closed
yeah yeah this is the verge Casper where
we discussed things that are at the
verge anything you want to self it's a
self-fulfilling verge cast verge cast
it's right there no we don't have a lot
of time because we got to catch a train
we do catch a train cuz it's the future
because it's the time time to get on the
steam engine yeah in the future all
right
I'm super I'm just talking about the
laser engine laser engine there's
exactly one thing that happened oh why
tell us what happened in the news 60
minutes aired a 14-minute
amazon commercial the only thing and
yeah I mean I I have many many thoughts
but the the main piece of it was at the
end Jeff Bezos
opened a door and Charlie Rose walked in
the room and went oh my god oh my gosh
and they were drones right Amazon Prime
that was the first time Charlie Rose has
felt sober and lived outside of the
group just watch - curtain Z - another
black room with a baddie I mean every
single piece of what we're seeing right
now is a lie Bezos Jeff Bezos announced
on 60 minutes
you can't put a lot in there like you
know box get back okay hold on Jeff
Bezos announced on 60 minutes that he
would in 2015 they were going to begin a
drone and air delivery system using
unmanned aerial vehicles
otherwise known as drones they'll be
dropping products within within 30
minutes yeah - to certain people in
certain times or less five pounds or
less skateboarding this announcement I
noted journalist Charlie Rose asked no
follower right this is like a brilliant
Black Friday promotion for Amazon
because everybody could talk about
Monday was Amazon yep I would say it's
not vaporware and that drones could do
this it's great for and that this is
totally illegal I can't do it safely
right if you like if you dropped a pin
on your Apple thing you know in your
phone being like I'm here there's my GPS
coordinate it could fly into the air fly
to your house and fly it out it could do
that right now
it could do it but it couldn't get out
of the way if the pigeon was there or no
if you had a kid in the driveway or you
know like deuced liked it there as far
as or even necessarily make it there
from fellowes I love the kid a driveway
scenario you're saying the drone would
drop the thing on to the child and kill
it or right it would okay I'm at point a
and I need to go to point B I know Jeff
Bezos says that by 2015 he'll have
cleared all the all values just
this video is right to me it feels
totally right to another guy comes out
he's like yes my drone is here I just
want to say something I know it can be
tough with this crew but you know look
we have cars driving down the road right
now kids playing ball there's all sorts
of obstacles there's things danger they
have to watch for you know we have let's
just add another danger to the well I'm
just saying that you know at some point
in time people were like cars or you're
gonna just kill people immediately as
soon as you get behind the wheel think
you're gonna blow up and you're gonna
run people over that'll be the end of it
and you know what like people are like
humans couldn't go faster than 25 miles
per hour they learn go flying in a plane
they said it couldn't be done it's
dangerous you'll never make it
I mean they're we'd all the time we do
things that seem impossible and weird
and like will never happen but no one's
questioning whether or not drones are
existing or whether they will happen
didn't even necessarily be used in this
way we're not questioning I'm not
question is it that 60 minutes
completely uncritically right went to
Amazon's like facilities our job in in
particular is like it's so far away from
reality it's apparently the only two
years away from yeah I don't think it's
so far away I mean I think it's
interesting that there's like kind of
this arms race now where it's like we're
gonna do driverless cars in 10 years ok
ok we'll do drones in one year and it's
like you announce things and tell people
right off the bat like we can't make
this happen yet but get excited now you
know it's it you want people to think
about your company in innovation and
like you may not be able to actually do
what you say but it gets people thinking
about Amazon and different way right is
it vaporware no is it wait why isn't it
been well it's not vaporware and that I
think a drone like I said could do this
it just couldn't do it safely and the
thing they're not the drug they're not
selling he's not selling drone
technology he's selling Brett the
specific thing that will allow Amazon to
send a drone to your house with a
package drop it off and then return to
the warehouse so it is vaporware at this
moment in that sense and that that he
can't do that even if he had all of the
technology in place and it worked
flawlessly the way Amazon is Bill Raina
I couldn't do right the warehouses are
far away I mean
there's no actual way to execute on that
today not just because of the laws and
the safety no that does likely they
could do it because like we played I
play with drones at South by Southwest
that can fly well he said ten miles okay
let's say you you could send a drone
several miles from one site to another
given to GPS coordinates it could take
off land drop something and come back
right but it obviously right there are
lots of things that couldn't do like
sense and avoid is the big one I can't
get out of the way of a power line or
another airplane the same technology
that the driverless cars are using to
avoid obstacles right this stuff will
definitely be coming online soon I think
the question is was it a publicity stunt
this is the only question we actually
have to answer was it a publicity stunt
I knows this very injury or unrelated to
this iswhat a publicity stunt wasn't a
publicity stunt or is Jeff Bezos serious
about this and will he do everything he
can to make it a reality
in 2015 or beyond so I guess I've got
when I was calling around different
people in the drone world to ask about
get what's your thoughts on Amazon then
somebody else said Ola you know actually
UPS has been testing this and like the
president of FedEx has made clear
multiple times he said you know we want
to do this as soon as it's legal so like
right I think that everybody thinks this
will happen I think if you were to set
depending on your definition of
vaporware it can't happen now so it's
vapor but right it's coming it's
realistic it's plausible it's illegal
right now all right but that video have
been made I don't think is realistic or
plausible like it will never be that the
drone like we've written wrote one and
when we bring the story over who said
the iPhones go fail that's right you're
Steve Ballmer you are no I just I don't
think drones and flying away again is
realistic for any number of reasons not
least of which is that they will just be
leaving packages in your driveway and
flying away well they'll be now you'll
get a notification should be at home
because this thing's coming mm-hmm yeah
that's people who aren't home I need it
in half an hour you're probably not
getting
New York like you're not gonna get a
drone delivered in New York you're gonna
have some sort of pride cheery suburb of
infrastructure about how this but not in
New York because people live in this
13th floor of an apartment building like
how are they getting a drone delivery
come come down onto the crowded street
with every apartment we have like a
rooftop delivery where that drone yeah
what I'm saying is the video I don't
think is realistic because I think but
it's a reality video well it's a it's a
concept of a drone delivering packages I
to me I'm pissed about this because I
didn't I didn't read about the
Australian textbooks company I think
this is awesome because a lot of how we
tried to visualize the future for a long
time was these flying cars and flying
cars just don't seem to work there is
you know something that we we do a lot
of things to reduce congestion and
cities and now you've had these delivery
companies like or you know eBay is doing
it Amazon is doing it where they are
having random people drive packages from
Walmart to your house yes it's very
upsetting and so like there's just more
and more and we're kind of overloading
this infrastructure that is the road and
if you have this new I think unmanned
drones are perfect for using a fairly
unused portion right of our sky which is
below helicopters and airplanes yeah and
higher than I think we just up all the
ground everything between the height of
how high you can jump on the same
wavelength this guy from Facebook posted
about this yesterday the sharing economy
this is like the ultimate you know
utopian Silicon Valley he was like once
Joan do this we'll have the sharing
economy you will own nothing you'd be
like oh I need this pot tonight and this
knife and a drone will bring it to you
and you'll use it this is like okay
here's what you're not gonna take away
from the American people owning things
right now you're not going to take that
away are our whole existing
is built on the consumption and
ownership of fish actually people I just
brought us only thing I have a very
small apartment and there is I really
don't want to have more things I think
as we've learned time and time again
Paul Muller is no team for the for the
Humana for you man
I'm sorry make you uncomfortable with my
my embrace of the future and my
willingness to explore alright
and my total I'm just so happy were
pissed know he's pissed that he did
learn it's a different way to look at a
city and think about how the things get
from point A to point B and there's
something that seems kind of
fundamentally untenable people if we all
rode bikes we wouldn't have to worry
about Jays trucks ingesting our bring an
HDMI cable from Amazon oh my god and
like I live down the street from Best
Buy and and there's Game Stop and
there's Kmart and all of those would
charge me five million dollars for a six
foot HDMI cable why don't you just go to
this store well I guess order one from
Amazon like let's just get one ship like
a rational I don't know if a rational
economy but it would be cool if I could
walk down the street I mean reasonable
price you know you're talking about your
problem is not that you can't go get the
HDMI cable for a reasonable price your
problem is you have you're like
ridiculously impatient like human beings
are horrible now and we think we should
get a dropship to us by a drone in 30
minutes because we need a cheaper HDMI
cable right the second instead of having
to spend money on the more expensive one
that is nearby like but we're not your
request is irrational it's very rough
yes it is okay you're asking for it's
like you're saying like I would not only
do I want to buy the cheapest HDMI cable
available but I want it either within
walking distance or delivered to me by a
drone you're loving a drone
but what ultimately happened what
ultimately happened is that HDMI cable
on Amazon yeah
and that had to take a bandwidth on the
streets and I'd probably almost got here
almost not it no but this is this is
your hdmi cable wasn't the only thing
they were shipping that's why they might
have so they made big trucks to hold
lots of things so they could ship
multiple items they don't have to every
time they're like hey wheat Paul Miller
wanted a drive cable and a guy gets in a
car in the back of the truck there's an
HDMI really driving George New York and
you really want a robot job what is so
far been proposed for how to make this
quicker is a dude in a car or a lady no
it's it's a it's a it's a person in a
car full of other things they have to
deliver it makes a lot of sense it's
like the it's like you know you've got a
bunch of things they're all being
delivered to us the same area you could
put a lot of them in a van and then you
can just go door to door handing
everybody their work right now I know
and it's it actually is a pretty good
system the problem is people like you
want their cheap HDMI cable to be
delivered within 30 minutes or less
that's the problem we're like really I
won't spend the money on this Best Buy
HDMI cable like but I want the cable
right now I didn't grow up buying things
online I still don't like buying things
online and it makes sense if you have
that's your becomes close to people get
those things that are already close to
people and as an Amazon open store they
should open retail stores maybe they
should with big warehouse open eight why
don't they just open that would be their
warehouses as retail stores and major
medicine areas like put a retail level
on top you can take an escalator up so
to get the stuff out is where you really
want to Amazon to do is build urban IKEA
everywhere yes that's what I want I want
the Amazon where no I'm sorry
called Amazon live you guys know about
this now I was on store anyway Amazon is
very near and dear to my heart and if
you let anything about IKEA and my
experience of Ikea in fact I hear easily
in purity of the Amazon experience isn't
incredible Nike is the worst business
that has yeah
hopper animal Scandinavian design 2
million horsemeat IKEA do they really do
horse meat yeah in America problems in
Europe Europe don't even have laws there
look mad cow where'd that come from
Europe I mean you can't trust the
European when it comes to miniature you
cannot want it I love Europeans but the
meat stuff got to be careful ok so
careful if they're meat here's here's
not a conversation you want if you're in
a relationship and you want to know
whether or not it's gonna last huh go to
Ikea with that person obviously we know
IKEA say he'll world deathtrap ok what
I'm saying is if you'll let me finish me
live what I'm just saying is then what
Paul wants what Paul was is instant
gratification I wants what he wants when
he wants it you know what I want I want
a local economy well then you do not
want a cheap HDMI cable you want the
most expensive HDMI cable you've ever
purchased because in a local economy
that could only make a few HDMI cables
they have to make them very slowly how
much would it cost to make an HDMI cable
in like is there a single HDMI cable
manufacturer in America does one exist
wait first of all yes for some reason
you can buy is overrun with from this
big impersonal amazon.com for them to
like tell some other thing that they
send this thing in the mail and it comes
to me and there's so much so many steps
and then I like get it like a few days
later yes when there are at a nightmare
thousands of to my cables within like a
two-block razor go by though
that are just completely unaffordable
this is so you know what you're paying
for convenience that's why they're twice
as much money or three times as much
money because you can get it at that
moment do many times I bought a blu-ray
player at a local electronics store
because I wanted to watch a blu-ray and
did not have the player do you know how
expensive it was compared to the ones I
get so why are you so down on the shares
anywhere the drone brings you the
blu-ray play all the time I know I love
you get Seltzer delivered to your every
tune every two weeks
what's your on I and I pay for it it
dispensed a fresh track is a ripoff of
my Seltzer guy is killing me first rate
is cheaper than going away fresh trick
keeps yes is cheaper than a whole food
and they cover a warehouse in New York
exactly so so Amazon need to build a
warehouse because then I don't want to
have why can't a guy just bring it over
on a bike great jobs like sweet cream
you good jobs usually run an American
flag right now put them on a city bike
send them over with your HDMI cable hey
Roger so yeah I mean like the thing
you're talk about the sharing you got
this conversation you're worried about
human jobs we're talking about Amazon
and drones we talked about Google and
driverless cars and then the news today
right was that Andy Rubin has left
Android to build real and robots right
like the big thing right is like all
these big companies that started
software companies they're web companies
Amazon you're getting into robotics like
this stuff is becoming all this is your
dream becoming cheap enough to prototype
and deal with and maybe accessible to
consumers in a way that like Google is
like let's throw some money listen let's
build a sexbot already I mean this drone
delivery and that guy you know whatever
else they're doing a guy cleans your
floor or something just build the sex
box whatever when you have a huge use in
the market for robots and drones would
be one huge use it promotes the advance
industry or it makes people hate robots
and start some kind of weird called
against robots and then it leads us into
some sort of civil war I hope you're
happy that's always what happens if you
see an iRobot it would be thrilling
banana I've seen iRobot terrible because
that is full of fun philosophical climb
well that's every great great that's
great that's great blow anything up from
a great brain no literally if you took
the thesis over all of the movie with
Will Smith and the thesis over all of
the book I Robot they would they would
battle each other robot scary scary
robots do bad things
yeah but people are ultimately what's
broken sexbot on the oh my god this is
this is an oculus sex pop it I'm sorry
what no one wants this happen no one
wants to put their hand job no I
gathered what it was doing jobs you
don't have to show me that there and
explain that it's a hand job Jon Jon
wanna share I like Paul scandalize like
all the people to be scandalized Paul I
don't I don't want the robots involved
in that but if you want to preserve your
Hornaday always a good thing to have all
these sex robot I think it's a really
the chemical quandary I don't think it
really is I think anything at the end
today if you're banging almost like
having sex with an animal animals have
souls and going to the animal because
when the robots are really sexy yeah
you're not gonna feel that as degraded
so it's just it was just a thing pumping
like a machine oh my god especially
degrading I think if it's like a you
know beautiful man or woman then
suddenly it seems less to great it right
I mean man oh woman Roe both good enough
virtual reality it's like paying more
for sex can I actually say something a
sexbot and what we just saw are two very
different things
that was like a simulator a handjob
simulator with a virtual reality
component draw the pram when I say sex
box it was more of a virtual HJ
situation humanoid I mean a humanoid
robot that does sex to you or that you
do sex to depending on the situation
that might arise manufacturing
he's not waiting tells me any rumors
building no sex box they actually kind
of weird the story and because it just
came out in the New York Times he
granted some access the times he said
this is not part of Google X this is his
own thing he'd be spun out his own
company yeah but it is focused on moon
shots moon shots hashtag moon shots yeah
they've bought seven companies to staff
this thing up and the it's weird because
they talk to Ruben and then according to
several people with specific knowledge
of the project it could be used for
electronics assembly manufacturing and
aid and sort of making things the United
States nothing well you know if you
can't have sex with any of them that
sounds good and also bad it's like hey
we're bringing jobs back to America for
robots robots the universe wake up with
the robots together right you know right
right no there's a lot of the the
co-working robots like that's you have a
person who is working alongside a robot
and you combine human intelligence and
adaptability and flexibility for
situations with robots really good at
doing repetitive things that could
eventually stray any humans wrist so but
here's you know the bigger No
big checks right I mean like this is
they bought seven companies this is not
even in there like crazy projects lab
this is another thing right and the same
with calico that life extension company
like they're giving them all this money
but it's not in like they're they're
allowing people within the company to
just go off on some really crazy crazy
Google Island is gonna be really messed
up it is going to be a manufacturing
themselves well it's weird it's funny
we've had in this conversation effort
over a day this is just of a piece of
like random rich people saying they're
gonna do things that are years and years
away and you have a problem with that no
I don't have problem with it it's just
it's which we matically at hey dream its
Elon Musk in a Hyperloop it's in and
she's like people this is how people
were murdered in now it's just it's just
a weird moment where I think we don't
like real change only comes from like
corporate entities right now and so well
we've regulated the government into just
like a rich dude doing stuff maybe like
Google idea though cuz they were the
first ones to be like it's beta it's
bright it's bus it doesn't really exist
driverless cars or glass but it's come
it's the space program if you look at
the moonshot is like like literally all
this draw this drone stuff is very much
from like university research hackers
do-it-yourself stuff a lot of the
robotic stuff has survived as university
research and hobbyists because it hasn't
been a legitimate right when i started
in school right there's and and now and
then that's in this baxter co-working
robots like now some of this stuff has
mature
far enough in these hobbyists and
university settings that now these
businesses are able to possibly actually
make products out here's what I think
driverless cars a lot of that technology
came from University Research and DARPA
so I think if we fast forward 25 years
this conversation will seem so quaint
and ridiculous like I think we're gonna
have drone delivery systems I think
we're going to have sex BOTS
I think we're going to have co-working
or just working robots I mean I think in
the span of like the next 25 years this
pod this podcast will be you know three
or four robots sitting in to be
replacements me who are having the same
conversation already that's well god I
wish we could do it an effect where we
all ripped our faces off we were
shocking to the viewer or thrilling yeah
I mean wouldn't it be shocking if if
somehow during this broadcast I were to
start to reach under my you know you
were like what is they are you have an
itch there or something
and I just and I just ripped off my skin
and you're like oh my god he's ripping
his skin off this is he's killing him
somebody call an ambulance and then
there was no blood and there was just a
horrendous horrific Terminator face
right and then I removed the Terminator
face and there was a regular Josh base
under there did that freak you out yeah
and give us a couple just try real quick
yeah we should move on by the way I
would like to point out that van was
supposed to stealthily leave and he did
that
great job Ben great job no penny why you
whispering we can hear every word you're
saying just kidding we can voice there's
one that I think is really weird please
share with us a little xbox rant so go
ahead I brought a prop
you brought a prop this is gonna be like
this is my connect the office Kinect oh
hey wait wait we need that why do you
have it
and this right here I'd like
non-standard USB three plug this is
 whoa what's underneath it the
plug it's a you know what it's called
it's called screw you hackers we win
just make it just hack together and
adapt I'm sure it's a USB three years
did you do you get your soldering I
didn't figure that your soldering right
now you get a breadboard out like a
little like history reminder people
specially I think these are called
history lessons well I don't want to
teach I want to remind our history
reminder refresher a refresher people
started hacking the Kinect right when it
came out Microsoft sent like cease and
desist no I did Microsoft yeah they were
horrible and hateful and mean and scary
to these people but they're gonna keep
on hacking it so they kept on hogging it
and then Microsoft like does this
about-face let go like look at all this
cool research and they're like
pretending like they're they're into
these people and like helping them out
and like making these incentives for
them to do stuff none of that really
cool stuff really ever ended up on the
Xbox there's still a lot of these
open-source libraries and frameworks and
an hack together things and people just
pack and mess around I mean amazing
stuff has been done with really cool
stuff then Microsoft came out with
Kinect for Windows and some of their own
software for Windows but you you if
you're a hacker
none of that hacker stuff and really
none of that connect stuff for Windows
can be used with connects that people
buy for their Xbox they're not for
commercial use so if you there's no
actual use case on the Xbox because the
Xbox is very closed platform and there's
no actually use case on Windows because
unless someone actually buy
- Kinect for Windows they can't really
use this as like a commercial thing like
Microsoft it is because I was really
stoked about the Kinect I was like
looking into like well how do you learn
how to program for the Kinect and maybe
I can make a tech demo and that'd be fun
and then I like buy an Xbox one on
impulse and sadness and and like and I
pull it out why don't you just sign up
for the Xbox for Kinect for Windows SDK
and like just buy it it's form because
nobody has Kinect for Windows if you
develop something with Kinect for
Windows it is you're only allowed to
actually officially commercially but
what are you asking for I'm confused I'm
saying that Microsoft you want to be
able to hack on the one still hates
these hackers and is still so pissed at
them and now they've created this bogus
plug and like there's it just really
bugs me the way that they act like a
little confused
are you mad that they made the Kinect
difficult to hook up to like a standard
like PC or whatever or are you mad that
they're not providing tools like that
interface with the Xbox one to allow you
to like do some hacky stuff with I think
I guess probably the former the thing is
that Microsoft's hugely benefited from
and science and interesting cool things
hugely benefited from what are sometimes
benefits like a lot of machine vision
and a lot of machine learning a lot of
robotics was really advanced by the
Kinect sensor it became this like almost
like the de-facto robotics sensor was
huge for robotics and and also this may
be the Microsoft always a bet so when
they open it up you mean no no the
Microsoft never helped really very much
but it was always a benefit that they
gain people are buying them Microsoft
fell into a cool moment and tried to
capitalize in like kind of rebrand it as
their cool moment and try to be a part
of it and then they come up with this
bogus adapter to just stop that ever
happening don't you think what they're
gonna sell it they're gonna sell one for
Windows so don't you think they'll sell
is a standard USB 3 windows nobody by
using Benes was also like for Microsoft
is a bit of a conflict because it's like
I spent money I mean well they don't own
the company that made the connect the
first technology is the new one is
anyone enjoy yourself loves to tell me
you out there so here's the thing so
okay but don't you think that that they
want that kind of revolutionary
experimentation to basically just come
from my because I mean we went we went
to their R&amp;amp;D labs and they're doing all
kinds of crazy experiments with the
Kinect isn't the whole point like they'd
rather not have some other company
capitalize on all their patented cool
technology and make something with it
it's not it's a closed system it's not
meant to be
they clearly never meant it to be
something that's like a pro that I would
like the thing with Kinect well but
they're selling one for Windows they're
selling it you can buy it connects the
windows it's ruining this for developers
it was a new one for the new one Kinect
for Windows and extradition wait connect
to for Windows why not let's connect to
you but it's all that tonight for
windows they're not signed that he's
aimed are they some of the new
generation of yeah it's gonna cost for
it all that's the connect to is that
what it's called and I'm sure this one
is not for commercial purposes so if you
develop it's for fun purposes right if
you you can't develop like because
there's there's things like if I were to
make you make the full argument here I
would tell you that the only people who
need to buy Kinect for Windows or
developers because the only people in
the world of connect are the ones with
Xbox ones yeah and now you when you
develop the thing on Windows at some
point you're gonna be able to port those
apps to the Xbox he's saying he wants
them to not be ported to the AI he's
saying they should be like open and
usable thank you you're gonna slip your
robot with a generic do that you can't
do that you can't port stuff to the Xbox
yet well I still have a nothing mic
right listen I think we I just think
they're a sinister hateful company and
also understand that people have coffee
tables and and I have Kinect on my xbox
it did descent very frustrating I'm
really I will say this to connect it
doesn't work very well I don't need have
you to work yes yes onesearch why you do
twice at least okay Hornet the Kinect
like the biggest problem for me
number one the Xbox one is huge it does
not fit into the cabinet where I put all
of my other components it's so big that
it's too deep to fit in it's just deep
and yes it's huge and the Kinect is also
huge and the way they the cable on it is
situated
you can't even like move the cable to a
position you need to get to it has this
really heavy
yeah like angled plastic piece coming
off the back so I had to put the Kinect
and the Xbox down in a corner of my
living room and so now like the Kinect
basically is in functional unless I want
the Kinect to be front and center in my
living room yeah which I don't right
because it's huge enough even like I
rearranged my living room around the
Connect yeah and got it all set up and
left like that and basically the setup
dialog the way it does like it's like
okay where's the floor or where are you
it's the like that and like okay now
tilt it like this all right now you're
good to go and then you go into the app
and says your room seems to be cluttered
we can't see you so I go back to this
setup as you're right I actually had to
like I had to like enjoy had to tilt it
where they told me not to tilt it like I
had to be smarter than Kinect that
should be really easy
I mean Kinect can't do a lot yeah so I
just love motion gaming I love these
there's so much possibility and
opportunity here and I think and and and
I think Sony gave up and I'm a little
mad at them for that I really three you
know and Microsoft was my last hope and
I think I would mean apple just bought
primeSense oh well that's exciting to me
I think you don't work and I think
Microsoft is sinister in the way that it
is treated developers and sinister I
hate that plug wait what that's just a
plug though I mean like wow you can box
a different but you can buy it with the
regular plug right listen can we you're
old kid is gonna get their parents to
pay $400 this is like a problem this is
such a mic on here at project beyond 1%
problem like I don't know if you buy an
iphone you can get Xcode for free and
you can make iphone apps if you bought
an Xbox Kinect
you could plug that a computer and you
can make for free all the libraries are
open source because cool people made
them
you could have a twelve-year-old making
a connection so what you're saying is
you're mad because Microsoft isn't more
like Apple I mean that's the argument
not because Microsoft is is is
squelching innovation I really think
well they're I think they're interested
in their own innovation I think they
have never delivered their innovation
there's one connect and I I don't
disagree that well it's impulsive I'll
say this the I think the Xbox I want in
exports yeah I think the Xbox one has
some pretty much malicious yeah some
pretty ambitious goals it just hasn't
realized them at its launch no you just
say that and you know if you look at the
numbers right the ps4 is like every
couple days sometimes like we sold a
million we sold two million yeah I did
Mike responses like over 1 billion
zombies in that note I will say that in
Dead Rising 3 where the zombies are
being killed you know I am actually I do
actually use a function of the Kinect
which I never thought which is like
trying to attract zombies by screaming
over here but like weird interact with
it in that way it's actually pretty
fascinating and and despite it being
really buggy the SmartGlass app
component does some really interesting
stuff and I have to say I mean it's very
buggy and they need to work it out
because it doesn't connect properly
connect properly but but they're very
ambitious I feel like the ps4 is far
less ambitious it's like and it kind of
bugs me I think it's very capable and
very important so they played it super
safe but it's just so I mean I think
Microsoft pride bit off more than they
could chew but it's like Sony didn't
bite off and Microsoft Microsoft is just
diluted in thinking that innovation
comes from inside of Microsoft because I
think we have to we again we have to
catch a train what's the next topic all
right Topsy because we love that I unbox
my x 20 degree and I was pissed to a
degree
well no it's oh my god no absolute
bottom Bob so HAP so Apple bought Topsy
well done I mean I just you were into it
I just think I don't that into my only
my only comment on this is uh is I you
know nobody really knows why Apple does
acquire companies all the time Topsy was
a Twitter search and analytics firm
people are like this could
is the TV they're gonna integrate
Twitter stuff with TV and it's like yeah
I don't really know you know that's the
every time something outta like improve
series I actually feel like I honestly
feel like this is maybe part of Apple's
play too at some point
launch a search engine of its own
because at the end of the day when you
look at their biggest competitors you
know Google has a search engine which
people use a ton Bing it may not be the
most popular search engine but it has
given Google some competition and it is
now the thing that you get on a Windows
Phone and on a Windows laptop and on a
Microsoft is responsible for a lot of
searches if you think about how many
searches happen through the iOS browser
through Safari and through Siri like
they're making a lot of searches and
they should probably own a little more
of that process well I think that Apple
as evidenced by as evidenced by the maps
thing and clearly like their desire to
control and and the experience for users
I mean to me it could be the first step
or part not the first step but part of
that process of creating some kind of
search engine and maybe like in our new
world you start to prioritize things
like Twitter search much higher than you
would have a few years ago why well
because Twitter is increasingly an
important part of how people get
information now I agree with that but
what minor point you're like well that
is true the Twitter is a vector it's not
it's never that it's like ninety nine
percent of time I search for something I
land in Wikipedia yeah Google it but it
happens we'll be better off like buying
Wikipedia oh but if you could Twitter's
well yeah like but if you could really
make that information useful somehow
potentially a lot of information you are
looking for like when you're talking to
Syria on your phone is not like big
facts like Howard giraffe's made its
larger rafts made how are giraffes made
Howard giraffes made now Howard rafts
mate is what I got it made right here
boom well I have by the way I got what
must be the weirdest itaú article make
a balloon giraffe ooh what's this guys
can you get it Howard giraffes made can
you over that up
oh it's Wikipedia well you've done a lot
do you know how to draft Paul I'm
curious because I I'm worried that if
you don't know how they're made we have
real women
daddy giraffe loves a mommy that's
correct yeah they adopt really a dumb
wow this is really graphic this really
but but a lot of what you're really
there's a guy see a bro I mean alone I
say the following which is scientific
yeah
when the female releases urine the male
tastier and to see if she's ready to
mate Wow gotta say giraffes and I have a
lot in common
this is like the kind of level of
learning that's happening on this verge
cast is encyclopedic and look at your
apps the same yeah they're all in dead
girls cold showers alter a story to pee
stuff there any urine play there's a lot
of information on Twitter on Twitter
that is more relevant to me in the
moment that I'm talking the Syria but
that's exactly of course that's what
Apple knows too and that's why they
bought it
Topsy that is I'm just trying to find
the family I wonder what family giraffes
are and anybody now I should know the
mammal traffic is there there's got to
be some kind of Jessica yeah there's got
to be something like the kingdom but
we're so we're all just doing giraffe
stuff on the internet right now it's a
well the phylum is more data this is the
worst or Dada or Dada
okay be Chordata it's a corner well yeah
I don't know you don't have that CH is
pronounced do you the family is the use
is there are I play one occasionally
even toad ungulate 50 shades of Dragon a
was the joke that I wanted to bake it
and it rhymes with gray so that's
perfect
moving on giraffe a death there's one
more story gray which we should talk
about it almost sounds like an expanded
gray when you think about it
yes which is how which is that which is
the website health care the health which
is there well the website the website is
going healthcare.gov health care not a
story on which is why which talking
healthcare.gov is back let me ask them
back it's like it's sort of back 80% let
me ask you a question does anybody think
that there is a global conspiracy to
destroy the website of healthcare.gov or
did the global conspiracy come
completely from within our US government
yeah and the conspiracy wasn't really
matter making things yeah it's a global
conspiracy even common I mean it is it
is kind of insane like when you look at
the data if you by the way if you
haven't read this Adrian Jeffries Rhodes
is incredible we have a video to this
incredible report about the failings of
healthcare.gov and sort of what it we
learned from it it's incredible how
exactly like the US government the
process of building healthcare.gov seems
like yeah it's like it's like 32
contractors whatever 55 contractors each
working on some little part and some
sort of insane
Kafka like Nona you're a bureaucratic
hell world where nobody can talk to
anybody and like nobody knows what the
other person is doing and it's like yeah
yeah this is how you make something
really horrible that breaks like have 55
different people from different 55
different companies yeah everybody knew
it was gonna break and watch it anyway I
mean you know so the piece is great and
what's interesting about it is the
argument is really the argument is
insane if you just look at how people
are arguing about it and it's it
highlights fact that we have to repeal
Obamacare because the website broke ya
know that's an insane argument of course
oh boy we're going down but that
argument is they're using the the the
the dysfunction of our government as a
whole to make an argument that has
nothing to do with it right but they're
but they're or ways or does it but the
argument is very that makes sense what's
weird
maybe we should repeal Obamacare
probably the more I think about it if
this is what they do with a website what
are they gonna do with my healthcare
that's straight know it's but it's if
you like Obamacare and healthcare.gov
are very interesting because it's like
this huge massive government policy and
for the first time ever the only way
that it exists for people is the
Internet
it's the it is my you are lousy I think
and like the government doesn't know
what to do about that it doesn't know
how to build that sort of thing right
you know it knows how to ask to build
ships and missiles and but not only that
but there's no it doesn't know how to
build them and that's evidenced by like
you wouldn't have launched that like you
what you would have done if you not have
built them as you would have first off
you would never never started the
project the way they started it but then
you would have tested test a test and it
made sure like anybody does when they
make something that it's going to be the
product you think it's gonna be so
clearly they didn't do that but uh
what's also interesting is that we don't
know how to as a people and as a
government process the failure of a part
of like the government like this right
you know I mean the reaction is like oh
my god like everything is messed up why
would we want these people to be
responsible for health care but it's
like I don't know we've had it I want to
get I give it the benefit of the doubt I
would at least like to see if this if
the website were functioning 100%
correctly what would it be like I'd just
like to know but then it's not even that
like um I think it's organ contracted
with Oracle to build their state
exchange and that like just didn't work
like there's there's elements of this
where you're saying that it's a failed
policy no maybe not the policy I'm
saying that we the government is good at
being like you contractor make a thing
you know in a contractor maybe can make
it or not it's usually a rocket though
but seriously like right how many times
you like how many military projects like
way over budget
like we canceled at the end after
spending all this money and you can't
probably most if the government wants to
be more responsive or effective it can't
treat this that same way we need to be
in some weird way I almost feel like
what we needed to do was contract this
out to a private nothing but not done in
the way that the government did it but
like find like the ideal person to build
it right the single company that could
make something of that size and have
them go build it right it's not what
they should have done just had people
bid bid on the one on the project of
you're going to make the website that
does all this stuff I mean that's kind
of sort of what they did right but yeah
yeah 55 different contractor and they
did it that you should watch a drink
video because it's
amazing but they did it five years
before the ACA was like passed right so
they have these and indefinite I they're
called IDIQ yeah yeah the idea is to
write I know the second was a definite
quantity I know the distance we ran out
but I think it's indefinite delivery
delivery for an indefinite quantity yeah
it's something insane it's like we don't
know we're making it we don't know how
long it's gonna take but you got the
contraband you guys have it you know
data are not incentive like everything
you could complain about the government
doing this they did there are soccer
Birkett fix like structurally the things
people complain about big government
making mistakes we're all here in play
oh you know it's like move slow and
break things it's it's crazy it's only
gonna get worse like Adrienne's point is
like there the government has to build
more websites yeah well have you ever
tried to use their their websites even
like you know it looking like the DMV
the New York New York City DMV site I
mean it's a classic this is a classic
joke right that all of the you know the
government or pseudo city federal
whatever state and federal they're like
at least the healthcare site has a great
great web design no but this way you can
find stuff on here but it's crazy to do
it if you look at the New York DMV site
can you just get it up on there because
I visited one of the better ones there
no but like it scroll down a little bit
just get into the mix here it's like
there's just so much going on in here I
know there has to be a lot but we have
better ways of making websites for a
lots of stuff now yeah and so and so but
the point is that it's always been this
running joke but now it's like it's not
just about I need to renew my license
which is kind of you can go and do it if
you have to and you're gonna do it
anyhow and you sort of expect the DMV to
be a horrible experience because it's
government-run and but you know you you
owe Illinois Illinois has branded their
DMV cyber Drive Illinois
if you want to click log on log on but
uh but now the problem is that that it's
not the problem is that we now actually
need these things to work like
increasingly like with health care I
mean there could be other programs where
there are of course now but in the
future where we need the government to
be ready for technology it's the
essential joke of all of this is that
the the government legally required
people to purchase something and then
made it impossible for the yeah I heard
about the a the prison glitch this is my
favorite I'm gonna ask you if you've
ever how long you've been in prison and
then you can't come any further because
you're just it just assumes that you've
been in prison if you have zero amount
of prison which makes you think about
those first five people that did get
through it all they probably had prison
or they live where they live just put me
through the system just like all of this
went live I was like I quit my job at
the verge and so I needed some health
care so I looked around like all health
care things are all just scary and
terrifying and weird yeah did I like
accidentally like put my phone number in
somewhere and then somebody called me
and they turned out to be like a health
care broker so I guess they make
Commission on sales
oh this sounds and she's just talked me
through some plans it all sounded pretty
sketchy but I just bought a plan than I
did you really through healthcare broker
so what the lesson here is that you can
just call including health insurance
which he needs he needs to stay alive
probably needs to be replaced now I
don't know if it's legal but that
doesn't sound right to me I think it's
still legal people can keep selling
nobody's telling these guys to not sell
health insurance yeah it's just that
there's no other option nobody I don't
like hit a certain minimal I don't know
if I have the minimum required coverage
but who knows you're pregnant
gets that right to a death panel is in
this situation yeah III will say this
you know it is all I know is we've
not tried the socialized health care
plan link it hasn't been tried in
America and I just feel like let's just
roll the dice and see how goes shot
let's go why not I don't want to gamble
with my whatever and it's like why not
there's a bunch of people who don't have
insurance and let's see what happens you
know it's really fun for me is going
home for Thanksgiving yeah your father
is a hardcore right-wing and my family
for the doctors yeah just talking about
how they feel about this they don't like
Obamacare you might so my sister is all
she's cool with it you know she's like
she's got a remain hope yeah cool cool
yeah my dad man he's uh not into it
not in it it's got to be something like
rhymes to escape that conversation like
by the end I was like diving off of
couches at some point though just means
just the way the medical industry is
exploited you got you had legal France
like the real one no dude you know like
a train tracks Lego trains right now our
boss wait what are Lego trains so when I
was a kid I had the Lego monorail
remember this my privilege like we were
scrapping scrapping Christmas for a man
who was born on December 16th I will
tell you that I pulled that scam many
many times that's a good if you remember
the Lego monorail is like we of course
we do it was a hack the engine had like
a physical switch on it and it was a
drive along the track like you could
adjust Legos to hit the switches and
that's how it stopped and started
sadness I know I know but it sounds
great the new ones are straight-up
remote-controlled like they're like mice
running around no there's like a remote
control that's a battle for the rebels
I mean I start right up like fought an
eight-year-old girl to play doesn't
surprise me
yeah she was she did win but not also
that also doesn't surprise story is that
the children are our future are wily
those children are gonna be riding a
Hyperloop and they're gonna be like this
is nothing and why or may not have
health care yeah well
they may or may not but they probably
know you'll be ok I just I'm just saying
like let's just see what happens
give it a couple of years yeah bit like
six months can't get worse you know like
yep you know I feel like medical
professionals are probably bummed
because like all the kinds of weird
loopholes that used to exist are getting
like weirdly change or closed up but
come on there's a bunch of new loopholes
and ways to make more money and ways to
do less fewer surgeries and fewer people
you know whatever I don't do that I
don't know what doctors want yet because
because wrote the robotic surgeons have
been so so good thus far so we're
getting close to having to wrap up I
know this is a short one unfortunately
we do have to catch a train like
literally that's not even yeah that's a
pun that's not a joke I have Michael
Shane staring at me like nodding his
head looking very worried you look very
easy actually not pointing to his watch
now he's making some sort of breast
grabbing the breast motion I don't
understand that don't do that to me
don't do that to anything not in front
of the flag yeah America Americas you
know you can't see that like no one can
see there's a big flag because we just
shoot the flag for a second yeah Michael
go do the thing you can't really see it
because it's in the dark there's Michael
good that's a huge flag in there and
that's the virtue music are there any
other topics we need to cover not really
I feel like something else haven't I
can't remember
you know what I hate about Aaron Sorkin
speaking of The West Wing oh this is
good this is an quickly walk and talk
it's not to walk and talk it's the it's
the this happens a lot in the West Wing
it's a mr. president we need you to sign
this document and then do you know in
1876 what they called screws and it's
like you know what dude ya know it's
like it's like mr. president here's your
new shoes he's like you have you read
the Ulysses because let me tell you that
it's like you know what people just want
you to do you're the president please he
spends like four hours a day telling
stories about history these are your
grandpa you know he needs to sign the
papers and put his shoes on
get to the meeting like stop answering
stop answering questions with questions
about history no wonder we're having all
these problems people are like Obama
what do you think we got to get this
health care thing happened he's like
have I ever told you about the time I
was in Guatemala and it's like no no one
wants to hear it we got to do health
care here another parables man they're
not terrible she's just saying things
you know what I'm talking about you've
heard all the stories
anyhow this guy over here I read that
the death-dealer story yes pretty
oh yeah epic long-form work by the verge
just pretty incredible and I was really
sad it's it's very sad so if you well
not even if you have a chance read this
or I'll be very upset with you Matt
Stroud wrote a piece called the death
dealer it's a long-form piece we put up
today it is about a guy named James
Arthur Ray who is I would say very bad
person
yeah just a very flawed very flawed
damaged person who is damaging other
people and it's it's a it's a
fascinating story it's actually kind of
I think is in some way related to our
scam world story that we did a couple of
years ago in that he's sort of one of
these guys who has who has risen to it
what he had risen to a place I mean he's
like Oprah
Oprah's like into this guy I brought the
secret you know part of he was a part of
the secret cabal but he's not like the
CEO but he was on Oprah and talking
about you know how to empower yourself
and do all the stuff and like you know
it's it's snake oil but it's like in
this case the snake oil they got people
killed and I think it's not sorry this
is yeah and I think and I think in our
age in our age of information overload
and like the kind of your reality
whatever the way you want your reality
to be you can get it on the internet
like I do think these guys are kind of a
are like a red flag like you know in the
belief in information without getting
without really doing your your homework
dump so don't believe James Arthur right
but do read the story about him that's
called the death dealer on the verge
calm a website on the Internet to tell
me
as soon as we work out the buzz there
are 55 contractors gov no but actually
but you know that's the thing like we're
so used to i just think about leftists
are really hard to build the verge is
hard to build but we have like an
incredible we gotta go we have an
incredible product team who build it and
like did it efficiently went in you know
let's cut your own throat then but we're
used to in our world people executing on
things they say they're gonna and making
them and they're like well the thing
exists now that's why that's why it's so
weird to see something fail so
completely you go to websites that don't
work maybe you have a problem for a day
a couple of hours oh they their servers
are being overloaded and they like get
more servers and it's fix or whatever
unless well it took Twitter like three
years
okay Twitter habits but Twitter you know
major service and did get their stuff
together this it did take them several
years but it wasn't like every day you
went Twitter was completely destroyed
mm-hmm anyhow so government get it
together talk to talk to the Vox product
team you want to get some tips I have
inaudible on how to build great websites
there are many of them are in DC short
walk try walking paradise it's true and
that is our verge cast really for this
week thank you guys for watching if you
wanna get in touch with us you can email
us at Virg Cass at the verge comm you
can leave
write something on our forums you can
leave a comment on this post when it
goes up you can find us on Twitter the
verge is at Virg I'm Joshua Topolsky Eli
is reckless
Paulo's future Paul Ben poppers Ben
popper and and you know this is it's
early in the week for us but this will
be it for the week yeah and you know for
what's you know the you know the
situation that's happening right now
with you and your family I think we all
feel you know we're gonna wait we're
gonna watch we're gonna see what happens
we don't know what'll happen we don't
