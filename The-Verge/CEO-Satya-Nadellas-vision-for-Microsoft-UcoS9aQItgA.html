every person in all every organization
on the planet to achieve more we make
things that help you make things and
make things happen
this is what drove us to build the
devices we launched today thank you for
coming and thank you very very much
Microsoft just announced a ton of you
Hardware here at a huge event in New
York City it may be the device event of
the year like I've never seen anything
more high-energy but this is loud it's
crowded it's hard to get my hands on
this stuff so we're actually gonna grab
such an adela go someplace a little bit
quieter nothing cooler than getting a
new car right thanks sir so how do you
think that went to that cuz I thought
just fantastic I mean the innovation and
the momentum on Windows not even from
July is awesome it's already here sorry
sir so we're in the store it's already
ready to go yeah I'm interested this is
stuff is booked why now are you making
something that looks very much like a
laptop I mean for us what we want to do
is create these magical experiences
create new categories I mean this is not
a laptop it's a laptop and a digital
clipboard together and we did this with
surface now you see a lot from our OEMs
it's inspired by surface many of them
also a reselling surface we want to
stimulate demand for the entire
ecosystem I guess that just leads
inevitably to the question I'm pushing
it you have these OEM partners and some
of them make key there's a lot of
computers here and I can just see in the
store that you maybe would never make
but it seems like this is conclusively a
better experience because it's more
integrated because you guys control the
operating system and the biggest suite
of apps and now you're making the best
hardware though the way I think about it
is in order to create new things you've
got to take all kinds of risk yeah you
gotta take big R&amp;amp;D risk might even is
not the day we conceptualize something
like this it is not clear haha but it'll
work
yeah right G got it take R&amp;amp;D risk
and then ultimately got to take even
inventory risk arm so we want to do that
for the PC ecosystem I don't think of
the N and that is going to only help my
OEM partners and you know when we first
started to where we are now I feel that
we think by Microsoft participating in
creating these categories pushing the
envelope we really grow the entire
ecosystem yeah I mean you look around
the store I mean be in fact this is our
the Microsoft Store is a great place to
come see what the entire ecosystem is
capable of of course there's the surface
pro 4
there's the hololens I used up you
should say you should can take the hall
ones out of the glass case here I'm not
that's where our empowerment says God
I'm gonna get into trouble isn't the
most important device the phone I mean
that's really the question here right is
these are great and I think there's no
question that the surface book is just
like a fascinating product in every
level but it's not phone ya know right
and you've got a really mean Mobile's
where I mean it's the next billion users
right how are you going to attack those
billion users I mean we the two phones I
think we pass them there they are these
are the phones that we talked about
today the 950 950 XL and to me again I
want us to do something unique here and
the unique capability comes by the way
because of Windows 10 and the fact that
Windows 10 runs on it yeah makes it very
capable yeah you can't steal it but
makes it possible for you to not only
have a fantastic phone yeah but you can
change its form and function by just
tethering it to a you know a keyboard
and a screen and then it's a PC like
experience I mean think about an
emerging markets everything here I grew
up this is the phone I would want if
this is the only computing device to
your point there are many countries
where it's a mobile only country they
talk about but I don't want to be just
mobile openly yeah I want to be mobile
plus and this is a mobile plus device to
me I mean it'll really help us expand
even what is considered today mobile so
it's a big picture so we've got the
service book the service row for the
band
the phone and you're saying these are
all going to run Windows 10 so what does
that really mean to a consumer beyond
just the data and the settings will
transfer right a lot of your competitors
can do that too what does it really mean
for them also be connected into it I
mean it means a lot of things for us
which is the goal of Windows 10 was to
first conceptualize it as a service and
then with the service comes the things
that you just mentioned which is you
want to be able to move users state
across all of these devices but it's
much broader than that it's one OS that
means it's one developer platform so if
you're an application developer you can
write applications these are the
universal apps that can be modified for
the different screen sizes different
form factors so building one OS that can
then express itself in different forms
and function I think speaks directly to
what I think needs to happen in personal
computing which is have more personal
computers things that you wear things
that you put on your eyes things that
you use on your lab things that you go
interact with big screens I mean we
don't even have half the other devices
like surface hub or the hololens here
but to me that's the vision of
understanding so that's the vision for
Windows 10 but I think it it sounds like
that's what you're also articulating a
vision from Microsoft right and I think
what I saw today was your vision of
Microsoft being clearly articulated by a
lot of people on stage how is the vision
of Microsoft the same or different than
your vision of Windows 10 they are they
the same thing to me everything that we
do in terms of products be in Windows 10
beta office 365 be - or a cloud all
emanates from our mission for the
company so let me ask you a question let
me ask that question in much simpler
terms
why does Microsoft exist to me Microsoft
exists to empower others people in
organizations through digital technology
to achieve more that's it we are the
only company that I think things about
digital technology in the hands of
others to create things and make things
happen
and that's I think the identity that
uniquely what we are all about so do you
think products like this and it really
is this one for me
and you know the history of Windows 10
here it comes into play because Windows
8 was a huge bet on tablets you stripped
away a bunch of the things people like -
at Windows 7 with Windows 10 at least
right you've also made a ton of changes
Windows 10 but you've added back in a
lot of kind of traditional elements of
Windows you've now built a laptop can
you get the consumer market the bigger
market we're sitting in a store here in
Manhattan can you get them to see
Microsoft in that new way even as kind
of your building what is a pretty
traditional Microsoft product
I mean Microsoft is doing a lot of
traditional things and a lot of
untraditional things I mean I'm gonna
look again
I don't narrowly view it I love this
product by the way even this product is
not that traditional by the way it's an
ultimate laptop that is also a digital
import that I can absolutely untether
this thing and use it as a digital
clipboard who'd have thought that that's
a category so to me there is of course
we want to be able to do things that
where our users are but we want to take
them to places where they want to be and
that's the job at Tech and that's what
we want to do do you think that you can
recapture some of it is part of
partially phones right it's partially
you have Xbox it's there's all these
elements of having to be the most
exciting company intact it's like play
in that game and your I think your
articulation of what Microsoft is and
what can be is it's very much about
empowerment but you think you can engage
with a consumer again in the way that
kind of builds that excitement and
because I saw a lot of X I'm on stage
today you can kind of got a standing
ovation for this thing right so it's
there it's in pockets it's on our site
certainly but can you capture at the
broader market I absolutely believe so
because and of course ultimately it is
the product truth it's not the words I
say but it's the experiences we deliver
from the Xbox to Xbox Live now not only
on the console but with the PC what
we're doing with the bag - the hololens
- the surface book - the surface pro 4
to all the other ecosystem partners
innovating around Windows 10 that
entirety in your life a network is what
I think is going to be
age the windows users in a massive way
so you've been the CEO of Microsoft
about a year and a half what's been the
hardest thing that you've had to
struggle to accomplish in that time I
would say one of the things that I have
learned is as a CEO what is your job
right I mean you sort of feel like oh
yeah you know what it is and you get the
intellectual side of it but there is
something that only you see or uniquely
can do which is set that tone that then
can capture the soul of the collective
and its culture now that's why I'd like
to even use that expression that at
least I've come to realize and I'm still
discovering all the aspects of it which
is the job of the CEO is curating the
culture that makes excellence happen
what is going to be your hardest
challenge in the next year the hardest
challenge I think is that cultural
renewal the cultural expression of
excellence one of the things that we
think about starting to you even earlier
is a change in Microsoft where we no
longer talk about the lagging indicators
of success right which is revenue profit
what are the leading indicators of
success customer love there's actually a
way to measure it it's called a you know
you know NPS or Net Promoter Score so
getting people getting an entire
organization to fall in love with these
leading indicators of success and
staying true to them is perhaps the
biggest challenge but it's also what I
know to be the biggest driver of our
success
