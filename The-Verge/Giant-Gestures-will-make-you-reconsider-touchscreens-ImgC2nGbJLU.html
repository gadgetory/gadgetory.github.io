inaugural panorama music festival and
New York City and we're going to be
hosting the lab an incredible
interactive art space running all
weekend long we spoke to Phil and
Charlie from mountain gods to artists
who have work in this year's space their
piece is called gigantic gestures my
name is Phil sir zega I'm a designer
animator and artist I'm Charlie Whitney
and I'm a programmer I got into this by
accident it's a lot on a resume that i
had to teach myself to program we were
roommates for five years so I mean no
way too much bad well it's called giant
gestures and a physical piece is a
gigantic tablet that you use a gigantic
foam finger to touch Worth and the idea
came out of the fact that we're doing
all these tiny little gestures every day
thousands of times ago you don't even
know that you're doing it and they're
pretty meaningless so we wanted people
to you have to do those same gestures
but feel them so like doing a giant
swipe with a finger and so feeling every
one of these swipes and making it sort
of like a little performance for all we
know like swiping and like tapping and
pinching the zoom like that could be
completely obsolete in 5-10 years like a
rotary phone was that ubiquitous like
that movement is completely defunct is
swiping to unlock is that going to be
defunct at some point is that gonna like
fall by the wayside you'll feel it and
maybe you won't think about it until 30
years from now when you're like ah
marine used to swipe to unlock I
wouldn't say it's nostalgic but it's
sort of the Living memoir of these
gestures I think more importantly as a
reinterpretation
I think it's like taking something
that's so small and blowing it up so you
can swing a wiffle ball bat in the park
but if you swing you know a bat in the
World Series it's the same motion but
recontextualized it means a lot more we
basically putting like an infrared bezel
around a large TV which basically shoots
infrared light and gets a exact point of
where you are within this rectangle
translating that into an application
that Charlie's ready to keep track of
all the data that you're getting in from
these touches and then interpreting them
and putting them into basically
recognizing it just as another touch man
I think that music festivals lend
themselves really well to these types of
things just because people are already
like ready to go outside that comfort
zone you go through so much thought like
figuring out how people are really going
to interact with something so taking
something that we're familiar with and
just reinterpreting it allows for just
like immediate understanding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
