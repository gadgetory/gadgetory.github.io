at the beginning of the 72-hour build
off so everything in here with built in
72 hours yeah we actually have two
potentiometers there's one in this thumb
and one on this thumb and there's an
Arduino program that's basically
monitoring those two potentiometers and
determining whether or not there's a pin
based on the threshold and the amount of
time that the thumbs are down so these
are the 124 I bear the pub or yeah and
then basically tell me nobody says that
uh yeah are you really that bad

the spinning that's how goose died now
I'm having a lot of fun here but uh I
don't know maybe I having too much fun
you know America used to build things
he's the go places uh feel like I should
make something myself green LEDs I
really need soldering irons you did I
don't know how to solder I don't hold a
soldering gun I have so much school this
is the Raspberry Pi starter kit which
I've been told to get and I gonna fill
with this stuff but uh it looks really
cool so I'm gonna try to build something
with it and you know we'll see what
we'll see what happens it's gonna be an
adventure and I can fall on my face but
