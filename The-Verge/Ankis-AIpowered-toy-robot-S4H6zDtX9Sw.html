play games iq developed a whack-a-mole
style exercise where you try and beat
Cosmo at tapping one of his cubes when
two of them light up at the same color

with you and improve over time
eventually they'll unlock new games and
other skills cosmos blocks more than
just toys - it uses pattern recognition
to identify the symbols on each side
that helps it orient itself within the
environment bonkie has big plans for
Cosmo down the line using a software
development kit the company hopes
researchers programmers and roboticists
will develop new functions and other
features the company is even making it
as easy as possible to program for Cosmo
by plugging in your phone with the Cosmo
app you'll be able to test out
instructions by sending them straight to
the robot in real time the goal is to
let people of all ages tinker with
Kosmos code Cosmo will cost one hundred
and eighty dollars when it goes on sale
