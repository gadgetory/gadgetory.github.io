Pierce presented in my entirety saddle
up to 90 seconds on the verge brought to
you by virgin mobile the elusive Android
4.1 jelly bean upgrade is now arriving
for galaxy s3 owners across most UK
carriers Samsung is one of the few OEMs
successfully pushing jelly bean updates
Sony today for example is saying its
latest smartphones should get the update
sometime next year it's painfully vague
battle being said galaxy s3 owners in
the US will still have to wait months
for the jelly bean upgrade 4k TV is on
its way but it might not be called 4k
for long the Consumer Electronics
Association has announced 4k will
officially be known as ultra
high-definition since Ultra is clearly
better than plain old full HD sony and
its second mention this show has already
come out and said it will continue to
use 4k ultra HD branding to ensure
clarity and you know what we kind of
agree thus when 8k inevitably arrives we
propose Power Ranger nomenclature full
mega ultra HD and finally today's
biggest understatement controversial
redditor Michael brush aka violin acres
said he made a quote huge mistake in
creating subreddits for everything from
rape jokes to so-called jailbait photos
in an interview with CNN Bruce attempted
to deflect criticism by faulting the
reddit community for incentivize a game
with karma points reddit meanwhile says
it regrets not taking stronger action
sooner don't expect a reddit AMA for
violent acres anytime soon actually well
maybe and that's it for today's top
stories tune in tomorrow for the top 16
