widely emulated with 300 miles of bike
lanes the city is carefully laid-out for
cyclists but the lack of bike data
stands in the way of perfection so the
Oregon Department of Transportation
recently collaborated in Strava a
popular biking app an attempt to make
the city better and safer for cyclists
going through many meetings through the
Oregon Department of Transportation and
sitting at meetings we were having
conversations of well what is the level
of service for bicycles and what is the
level of service for pedestrians we
really just don't have any good data for
that it's very hard to plan for a
multi-modal agency when you lack bike
data so with that problem mining going
the meetings I was joining a ride with
friends and I realized that everyone was
pulling out their cell phones before
right and using an app and there's a
couple different apps there but in
particular an app that's popular in
Portland is called Strava straw this a
software company based in San Francisco
and we develop mobile apps and a website
for cyclists runners endurance athletes
to track their workouts have a social
experience get motivated and hopefully
helps make people enjoy cycling and
running more it's all sudden I thought
to myself well where is that data going
all these people are recording their
rides why can't we use that data from
two points of view we recognized it was
a need here there was an opportunity to
work together with Oregon you tried to
build that Ostrava data set for this
purpose it's really interesting to use
Strava data but I think that I would
push ODOT to
try to actually look at who's biking and
where the demand for bicycling is rather
than where the existing people who are
kind of tapped into the system already
are I mean I think ODOT has a lot of
resources at its disposal but it also if
like the people who work at ODOT are not
necessarily going to be attuned to the
needs of people who live along southeast
Paulo say or who crosses need to cross
it every day or who would ride a bike
except that south street is impossible
it's like a wall bicycles are
increasingly visible in Portland since
2001 overall bike traffic is up 211
percent in recent years over three
hundred miles of bike lanes have been
laid out across the city to encourage
cyclists Hawthorne Bridge one of the
many bike friendly bridges in the city
supports an average of 1.7 million bike
trips a year with buying this data we
are unable to control sample by us
there's a certain amount of users that
use Java they may not be a complete
subset of the population so knowing that
we had to cut to kind of work out those
issues internally and both with my peers
and colleagues to say we recognize that
this sample size may not be perfect but
don't let the perfect be the enemy of
the good
this is a lot of good data
I think there's a bike movement
happening around the country and even
around the world it takes on a bunch of
different forms but it's there is a
rising tide right now for bicycle
transportation to become a real normal
part of daily life in a lot of
communities and one thing that I've been
seeing happen is that Portland is a
model of that and I wish that we would
do it better because I see other people
copying this model and achieving the
same benefits as we have but also making
the same mistakes as we have and one of
the mistakes that we've made in Portland
is we've really left out large parts of
the population unfortunately that's
often correlated to a class in Greece so
let's take that debate like let's hear
the both sides of that debate right now
so the the people who who are on the
side of straw vote data is not
representative are guessing that we have
mostly elite cyclists who tend to go out
for pleasure rides or go out for
training rides not commuters inside
straw but that's a myth first of all so
when we look at the data in Metro
regions about 50% of the activities that
are uploaded to Strava are communes so
Java is being used by commuters there's
another argument because we charge for
our service it's not it's not affordable
by people with less economic means and
not again isn't if our service is free
you can upgrade to premium if you if you
choose to but it's not required to
participate in struggle you can be on
free as long as you like I think that
big data is really something that public
agencies need to embrace and it's an
it's new to all of us because again we
can't control the data set but big data
or app data is the future there's so
many people using apps there's so many
people using phones so we have to
continue to be innovative and think
outside of the box and reach out to all
of these app companies and start forming
these partnerships we both can benefit
from learning from each other and sure
the data if we figure out the right
partnerships and the right agreements to
move forward and build better cities and
better places to travel</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
