checking out the new Skype app for the
PlayStation Vita as you can see it's
been custom tailored to the PlayStation
Vita's unique UI and makes full use of
the 5 inch LED display it has a bit of
an issue in terms of boot times takes
about 10 seconds to fully load up which
is about par for the course when it
comes to Vita apps but it's certainly
slower than the Android and iOS
equivalents when you first boot into the
app you get presented with your contact
lists as a ray of icons you can't really
switch to an ListView which can be kind
of cumbersome for those with a longer
contact list but since mine is greatly
small it's not too bad you do have the
option to scroll through the letters of
your contacts on the on the left on this
little side scroller which could be
pretty handy and resolving that issue
but you know again not quite as
efficient as it probably could be you do
have full access to call history and you
know you can revisit contacts that way
and you can you know make calls to smart
phones and landlines using the keypad of
assuming of course you have a connection
in terms of your profile you can access
you know your status updates you can you
know set up call forwarding and Skype
credits but you can't really sign up if
you don't already have an account so if
you if you want to use this app you have
to go to a PC or Mac to to sign up there
in terms of call quality it's fairly
decent works over 3G and Wi-Fi so you
know you do have that versatility there
so let me go ahead and give Shawn a try
hey Shawn so as you can see Shawn is
presented as an icon on the screen and
it illuminates as he speaks in terms of
options as far as controlling the call
you don't really have a whole lot you
can mute and unmute you can you know
turn on the rear camera or the front
camera or turn it off entirely if you're
doing a video conference and
you know of course just hanging up on
them of course with it it doesn't
support multiple users which is kind of
a disappointing but you know for right
now it's fairly accessible this is Sean
Sean are you on 3G or Wi-Fi right now
yeah so with Wi-Fi you can see there's a
bit of a latency issue so it's not you
know super ideal and then it you know
may not be really evident on the video
but there is a considerable amount of
compression as well you know a lot of
that is of course coming from the
front-facing camera which is you know
not exactly renowned for its quality but
you know is functional which is pretty
good it also works over 3G which is
pretty handy although it's hardly what I
would say stable so you know it
definitely could use a little bit of
work one unfortunate thing is if you
were to hop out of the app like I am
about to so sorry Sean you lose the call
so if you were to pop back in you'll see
that I totally lost Sean which is
unfortunate so you know there are
definitely issues with the app you know
again there's call quality issues
depending on your connection but you
know overall performance is a bit
sluggish due to the nature of the
platform you do get full access to
notifications in the Vita's you know
notification tray which is which is
handy so you can see if you missed a
call it does work even though you're not
in you know in the app itself though
closing it entirely will disconnect you
so if you were to flick away you are you
know completely taken out so again this
is free for download now on the
PlayStation Store you know if you if
you're a Skype user is fairly handy but
you know again it's not the ideal
platform for the service so for more
head over to the verge calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
