going to talk about Facebook and the
fact that lots of you think the company
is listening to your conversations even
when you aren't using the app like the
one time my friend mentioned I'm writing
a musical to me and I saw an ad for it
in my Instagram feed and later that
night Facebook owns Instagram by the way
if you weren't aware I don't even go to
musicals so this was a super weird ad
for me to see which leads me to the
question is Facebook tapping our
microphones listened in on everything we
say to then service ads yes or no does
Facebook use audio
Matea obtained from mobile devices to
enrich personal information about its
users no well I believe that Facebook
isn't listening to our conversations and
has previously screwed up use their
privacy particularly with its Cambridge
analytic a scandal so it's always good
to be skeptical of what the company says
and what it does every expert I talk to
you for this video believes Facebook
isn't listening actual evidence proves
it isn't - but the scary thing is you
produce so much data the Facebook
probably doesn't even need your
microphone to learn everything about you
now let's dive in to answer whether
Facebook is tapping your microphone we
need to answer two main things one is it
even technically feasible for Facebook
to tap billions of people's microphones
and parse all their voice data to then
determine who is speaking and about what
and - why would they want to do this
anyway and would it really be that
lucrative on the technical side yes it
is totally possible for Facebook to
manage this voice data
Nigel Keynes a co-founder and CTO of the
company called
intelligent voice says all that's really
needed to parse voice data is serious
processing power which Facebook likely
has all of the technologies today it
would be a very feasible technical
challenge for a large tech company to
undertake and figuring out what you're
saying is super easy what's been said
and what it means our extremely simple
determining who's talking varies in
difficulty depending on the
circumstances like if you're calling
from your Facebook account it's pretty
easy to figure out who's speaking and
tribute that data to that specific
person the ability to distinguish me as
as a British male of a particular age
just for my voice is very simple and to
distinguish you as an American woman of
a particular age it's pretty simple for
example Facebook could easily tell that
I'm the one talking about Oreos or
whatever else if I'm calling someone
from my Facebook account however a stray
microphone conversation isn't as easy to
attribute and this is what most people
are probably worried about let's say
you're having lunch with a friend and at
least 20 other people are around you
Facebook would probably struggle to
figure out who's talking Canning says
the company would likely need additional
metadata to narrow the field it could
easily determine the age and sex of the
person talking just from their voice so
if it could also figure out geolocation
data which Facebook and Instagram
collect it could then get closer to
figuring out which user is talking if
Facebook's set up a specific geofence it
could even further narrow its options by
identifying everyone else in the area
and then matching voice data up against
its user base with spewing geolocation
data all the time so if I could narrow
it down to say a thousand people in a
particular geofence then if I had your
if you were recording something on your
phone I got access to that and I also
knew the biometric profiles of people
the other thousand people that geofence
I could do a pretty good job of working
out with you but Facebook is a massive
platform with billions of users if
you're in a dense city like New York
with me and millions of other residents
this would likely be a difficult task in
a small town it'd probably be possible
but also require a decent amount of work
just to figure out how to target you
with that if I was trying to match it
against the hundred million or billion
other people on my platform then though
I couldn't so it's it's still a matter
of scale the the ability to do want to
many match on biometrics exists but the
more people you throw into the pot the
less accurate it becomes all right so
let's say Facebook could listen to you
and recognize individuals
does it actually need to if a company
isn't listening in like it says then how
are we all getting such a scary on point
ads is voice data even worth collecting
I actually think that voice data
probably gives up more information about
ourselves than most any other sort of
data because not only have you got the
content so what said you've also got a
very rich seam of emotional content
begins with it as well Facebook has
access to something even better than
voice data everything else that you do I
called Andres Arrieta the tech products
manager and the Electronic Frontier
Foundation to chat about Facebook's
tracking technology they have so much
data on us that they don't need to turn
on the microphone let's run through the
things Facebook likely already knows
about us it knows your location because
of where you say you live but also the
location tracking permissions you give
the company's app it knows your
self-identified demographics what you
look like because of the photos you
upload your family members and friends
and crucially your browsing habits
Facebook uses its add tracking
technology called the Facebook pixel to
follow you around the web and keep tabs
on wherever you end up this pixel which
website owners can build on to their
sites helps advertisers figure out if
their Facebook Ads have been successful
oh and you know those like buttons you
see on every single website those track
you to Facebook has even been able to
identify users sexual preferences based
on the sites they visit that's how the
company accidentally outed gay users to
advertisers years ago this goes much
more further than just feeling a simple
profile and showing you what type of
fear of what motorcycle you want applies
this is about your really really
personal relationships and things that
you might have not shared with it with
others Facebook tracks users IRL
purchase history - they do buy your
credit history we tend to think of
online tracking as something that is
contained online but it's no longer
contained online there they're putting
all these other sources online offline
together to build or complete lives it
uses this data in aggregate to
anonymously verify that its ads actually
drive sales up suffice
to say the company knows a lot about you
you can witness ad trackers in the wild
through plugins like the Electronic
Frontier Foundation's privacy badger
which shows all the third-party trackers
keeping tabs on you it says the verge
has more than 100 trackers which is kind
of not a good look for us but you also
don't pay us for this content so and
that's why I Ariana thinks Facebook
isn't listening to our conversations but
if you require more hard evidence the e
FF even proved that the company wasn't
listening to us in a news segment with
CBS we're monitored traffic from a
user's phone it didn't see any audio
recordings going to Facebook
Andres thinks that maybe people notice
ads more after they've talked about a
specific topic most of the time is
because we sometimes actually don't pay
attention to the ads and it's totally
possible that dad had been playing
before but because it's such a small
brand you never noticed I know that
possible explanation isn't totally
satisfying but in some ways it's scarier
Facebook knows everything about you
without needing your microphone if
you're concerned about ad tracking and
Facebook in particular you could delete
your account which also means deleting
whatsapp and Instagram sorry about it
you could also try and add tracking to
extension like privacy badger which lets
you turn off add trackers Arianna
suggests using different browsers and
diversifying research so that companies
can't bill is a complete profile of you
you could also enable do-not-track in
your browser which asks websites to not
track you they don't have to honor your
request though generally we all have to
come to terms of the fact that ads power
the internet it's reality at this point
and until we start paying for every
service or we drastically rethink ad
technology we're stuck with it maybe
I'll put a love yet in there to just for
love you all right so let's say Facebook
could Noren crushed
