this is the Nvidia shield graphics giant
Nvidia has built a game handheld on top
of the Android operating system it's
like a smart phone smashed into an Xbox
360 controller and it's big and bulky
but surprisingly in videos very first
game system has pretty exceptional build
quality the 5 inch 720p screen is
gorgeous with excellent pixel density
and fantastic viewing angles games and
movies sound great the custom Tunes
speaker system sounds better than many
laptops the chassis itself feels solid
and strong with only the occasional
creak even the strength of the magnet in
the interchangeable vanity plate exudes
quality most importantly though those
joysticks and buttons are truly on par
with an Xbox 360 controller the
joysticks are just taught enough to
resist your thumbs but loose enough to
swing and steer the face buttons have
plenty of throw and enough padding to
stay comfortable even when you're
hammering repeatedly the shoulder
buttons are unfortunately as shallow and
clicky as those on Microsoft's
controller but the triggers have some
real pull the shield really feels
designed for gaming through and through
the question is how you hold the shield
when you're doing anything else there's
the full responsive touchscreen built
into the lid of the device but how are
you supposed to reach it with these
controls the lid opens a full 180
degrees but it's the weakest link in the
hardware assembly and it doesn't feel
durable or grippy enough to hold the
full weight of the handheld while you
can control most of androids basic
functions comfortably with the game
controls and the virtual mouse cursor
can help a lot there it's particularly
difficult to do anything with the
virtual keyboard or touchscreen gestures
you could hold the shield in one hand in
portrait mode like an open book but then
you'd be blocking the system fan you
might need to do that occasionally
though because most Android apps are
still designed with a smartphone in mind
games like temple run - and where's my
Mickey don't do landscape at all
still the shield has way way more
functionality than say a PlayStation
Vita it also helps that Nvidia shield is
an absolute speed demon it's the
showcase device for the company's new
Tegra 4 processor and we were
hard-pressed to note a hint of lag
it speeds through apps and games alike
and even when we stuffed the
multitasking tray full of different
programs we still didn't feel the need
to close any of them the shield's chunky
frame holds some sizable batteries too
we saw 11 hours in a browsing test and
rarely found ourselves running out of
juice it's hard to find enough android
games to take full advantage of the
shield though the dead trigger 2 demo
looks fantastic graphically a cut above
anything we've seen on android before
but look through the larger catalogue of
new mobile titles and you'll find a few
that push the envelope or support the
controller your best bet of supports of
classic PC and console titles like grand
theft auto vice city sonic the hedgehog
and Max Payne all of which work
brilliantly on the system oh and
speaking of classic games what the
Android game catalog lacks though you
can augment with a beefy gaming PC if
you've got a GeForce GTX 660 art or
better and a capable wireless router you
can play a full PC game on your couch or
even in bed by streaming it wirelessly
from your computer 15 games like Tomb
Raider Dishonored Borderlands 2 and
Metro last light or supported right out
of the box and basically any steam game
that supports an Xbox 360 controller can
be played in big picture mode there's a
little bit of lag and you might need to
fine-tune the controls but it's easily
the most awesome feature the shield
offers at $299 a full $50 cheaper than
in videos original asking price the
shield offers a pretty unique compelling
experience if you're both an Android and
a PC gamer and if you believe that
androids gaming ecosystem will get
bigger and more controller friendly from
here on out just be warned that it's not
a complete replacement for a capable
smartphone or tablet device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
