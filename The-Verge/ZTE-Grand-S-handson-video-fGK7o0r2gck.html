we're taking a look at the ZTE grand s
its ZTE s new flagship phone for 2013
and its biggest claim to fame is the
5-inch 1080p screen so just like other
5-inch 1080p phones that are on the
market it's very big very bright it
doesn't feel too huge in your hand but I
mean you can obviously tell that it's a
5-inch screen the colors look really
nice it's very sharp very bright viewing
angles are very nice as well it packs
inside a 1.5 gigahertz quad-core s4 pro
so a very fast chip you can tell just
scrolling around opening closing apps
certainly feels snappy otherwise you've
got an LTE radio inside we've got we've
got two gigabytes of RAM and yeah it's
running Android 4.1 under the hood so
latest Android software although it's
very heavily skinned doesn't really look
much like jelly bean at all in
particular we've got this really weird
back button here so you can position
this wherever you want on the screen it
really is just another back button so
you can go back to the previous it's a
bad example see how we can go back to
the home screen and you can actually
press and drag it out to expand it to a
full set of buttons we have capacitive
buttons along the bottom as well and
yeah the materials it's made out of a
polycarbonate it's a unibody design it
doesn't feel too bad it's matt so it
doesn't attract fingerprints too much
and well it feels a little bit light it
doesn't feel overly cheap we've got a
volume rocker on the right hand side at
the sleep/wake button up top 3.5
millimeter headphone jack 16 gigabytes
of storage inside expandable with
microSD and yeah 13 megapixel camera so
very high resolution shoots 1080p video
as well and yeah there really isn't too
much more to say about it the software
is a little quirky but yeah there was a
decent phone five inches 1080p 2013 here
it is ZTE grandes
