i am in the passenger seat of this car
i'm not driving why not because it's
Audi's self-driving car you'll notice
that there's nobody in the driver's seat
about to go on a wild ride through the
parking garage at the Mandarin Oriental
got some sensors set up around here
these are laser scanners that help the
car figure out where to go and then it
goes on a short path maybe a 100 150
feet out to the front we get out then
the car turns around that part has to be
done by hand with a real driver and then
we drive back in and the car backs into
the spot it's a little scary this is our
robot overlord future in action it's
happening right here in Las Vegas little
terrified let's see how this goes
so it's slow this is not like a Google
car this is not like the car that Lexus
introduced yesterday this is going 5
miles an hour through preset course audi
plans on getting there they want to get
to a full like highway experience in
fact they're only the second automaker
to have permission in the state of
nevada to drive on highways with
self-driving cars but this is not that
this is just to help you park the car
without having to be in it imagine
you're at a mall you're at a some sort
of shopping center bought your
smartphone get a button the car comes
and picks you up that's what this is so
I was pretty awesome not gonna lie for
the time being I'm okay driving the car
myself parking really isn't that big of
a deal but you know if I have to pay
another 100 200 bucks to get this
feature on my next car I might do it out
he's thinking 10 years out for this so
we'll see how that goes all right Audi
let's go back to the convention center</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
