verge here at CES 2016 and right now
we're taking a look at a three thousand
dollar pair of earbuds from sure these
are electrostatic earbuds they're pretty
much the pinnacle of ear buds of music
listening so if you're an audiophile
this is probably your dream there are
two pieces to it you've got the ear buds
and then you've got the amplifier over
here which they plug into and on the
bottom is a cable it's a USB port so you
plug that into your iPhone or Android
device or your PC and you can play your
music off there and the sound is truly
breathtaking I mean you can hear every
note every detail it's a really detailed
soundscape and once you have them in
it's really isolating so you're like
hearing any outdoor noise there are no
interruptions and so if you're buying
this you probably not somebody's gonna
like easily with Spotify or Apple music
I mean you've probably got your own
lossless music library of like high
resolution files and that sort of thing
so short claims this is the first time
it can take this kind of technology
portable so it's got a battery lasts
about 7 to 10 hours so you have to
charge it up take it out with you it's
pretty hefty I mean it's not a light
amplifier so you'll know it's there so
they sound incredible and for a few
thousand dollars they dam a little
better but if you're an audiophile
as high as it gets as good as it gets so
we'll be covering a ton of hi-fi audio
stuff here at CES 2016 for more be sure
