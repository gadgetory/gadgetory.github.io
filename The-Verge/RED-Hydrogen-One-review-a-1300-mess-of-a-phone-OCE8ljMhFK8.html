hi bans the hydrogen one smartphone with
a holographic display it looks like no
other phone on the market it comes from
one of the most esteemed names and
digital cameras and as a screen unlike
any other phone selling today it is
unique it is expensive and it is a
complete mess so I've been pretty
excited for this phone Rhett announced
it more than a year ago and it's been
talking about this holographic display
since then but the phone kept getting
delayed and pushed back and pretty much
no one's been able to see it they've
shown it to a handful of people but no
one's been able to film the screen and
so we've kind of just had to work off of
what people were describing it as and so
I've been here imagining that a hug
Africa screen is gonna kind of float
above the display and have this very
cool you know hologram but that's not
what this is at all Todd what this is
very nauseating my question is why maybe
ah this is kind of hurting my eyes I
can't imagine like using this every day
where my eyes are tearing watching this
there's really no elegant way to say
this the screen is just bad like really
bad but unfortunately it doesn't show up
on video very well so I'm gonna do my
best to describe it to you we also made
this graphic to try and help you know
those lunch boxes or postcards with a
lenticular screen that kind of changes
as you rotate it side to side that's
basically what this is if you've ever
seen a Nintendo 3s it's pretty much the
same thing I actually think that 3s is
better than this most of the time you're
using the phone nothing is quote-unquote
holographic everything is flat 2d just
normal when you're on the main interface
browsing the web using a regular apps or
whatever red has a separate app store
that includes a very small number of
games and movies that work in this
holographic format for whatever reason
red calls it for V
or for view instead of 3d nothing ever
pops out at you when you're seeing a
four view image or game but when you're
in those apps you can see a little bit
of depth into the screen but the depth
you see isn't that convincing I wasn't
even sure I was seeing it half the time
and it works really unevenly most things
are really bad and look kind of like
flat gimmicky cutouts others especially
video where the depth is much more
natural actually have some potential but
the key thing to know is that it just
looks bad when the holographic mode
comes on the screen looks really blurry
like the whole thing is smudged up and
nothing is sharp and clear I think
that's because there's an actual
hardware layer in here that's changing
how many of the pixels you can see I
played a few games this way and I didn't
feel like it added much the experience I
think the 4b may the game's worse - just
look at how poorly the subway surfers
ripoff starring Paddington works it gets
choppy all the time the other big deal
here is the cameras there are dual 12
megapixel sensors on the back and dual
eight megapixel sensors on the front and
both sides can be used for capturing
four V photos and videos before I get
into that I want to say that as regular
2d cameras they're actually pretty good
in a lot of cases now you're not exactly
getting red color science here red says
there's just not the horsepower and
you're not using a red sensor either I
think it's probably the same Samsung or
Sony stuff that everyone else is using
the colors look rich and natural though
there's style without them being
stylized
but it can't match the pixel when it
comes to dynamic range I often feel that
the hydrogen one would blow out
highlights of the pixel could clearly
capture it also struggles in low-light
and the photos often weren't very sharp
the real highlight here is supposed to
be 4d mode where you can capture 3d
photos and videos the photos are pretty
skippable they don't capture a lot of
depth and eventually I started making
everyone pose in these cheesy ways once
I realized that made it look the best
I was surprised though the video is
there's something to it I can actually
see the depth of it it's a much subtler
effect and it's
kind of cool it's still a pain to watch
it's smudgy and the effect tends to flip
her in and out with a lot of our effects
some people said it made them dizzy but
what it works you can kind of understand
what Redd was thinking unfortunately you
can't really share it with anybody even
if you do get really into shooting for B
they won't be able to see it unless they
have another red phone it just looks
like 2d to the rest of the world red
does include an app called hollow pix
which is sort of their own social
network it's supposed to be like
Instagram for red phone owners who shoot
for feed but I haven't ice to be able to
test it every time I try to log into the
app it just crashes when I press the
sign-in button the funny thing is red
isn't even the first company to try this
if you remember back in 2011 HDC
actually did this with the evo 3d it did
the same thing there was a dual camera
on the back for capturing 3d photos and
it had the same kind of screen where you
could tilt it and view it in 3d now in
fairness to red it does look better on
the hydrogen one it's a little bit
clearer and the photos in videos do turn
out better but the tech clearly has not
developed a lot in the time since and it
kind of says a lot that but hasn't
meaningfully improve the experience
since 2011 so now I want to talk about
the rest of the phone because there is a
lot of phone here I actually dropped it
and injured somebody with it but props
through it for at least trying something
different here I don't really like the
design but there's a lot going on it
looks unlike anything else they're a
bunch of textures on the back there are
these grips for your fingers on the side
that don't strictly make it easier to
hold but are interesting I also like
there's a shutter button on the top and
fortunately it's less interesting on the
inside that's because they're supposed
to come out last year so it's running on
a snapdragon 835 whereas the rest of the
students flagship phones all of a
snapdragon 845 there's one other big
feature on this phone that's supposed to
make it unique and that's these
accessory pins on the back it's supposed
to let you connect all kinds of
interesting things the biggest being a
full-on red camera sensor which will be
able to attach real lenses to but that
doesn't exist yet there's nothing you
can add onto the phone today and given
that the phone was already a year
delayed who knows when these accessories
will actually ship
it hasn't even offered any details on
the sensors capabilities let alone its
price and so ultimately all the big
things that read set out to do here all
the ways we wanted to stand out
they just don't hold up and since it's
not particularly great at the basics and
cost an incredible $1,300
it's just impossible to recommend I
really wish it didn't go this way I
think it's great that someone is trying
something different when it comes to
mobile phones and the concept of a red
camera in your pocket that's really
exciting but it's not all we got right
now this tech just isn't ready and you
probably shouldn't pay $1,300 to beta
test it
you
itself we're filming on an Evo 3d right
now because we can actually export 3d
from the red phone if you liked this
video you're sure to LIKE and subscribe
please let me know in the comments what
you actually wanted to see from this
