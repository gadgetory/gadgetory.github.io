is the luma GaN t2 luma GaN is a Danish
company they've been around for about
three years and they made a smart phone
before but this is the first one that's
actually gonna be coming to market it'll
be out this time
it runs Ice Cream Sandwich it has a 1.4
gigahertz Qualcomm processor and a 3.8
inch display but what's really
interesting is what some someone looks
baked into the software so there's this
TV app at the bottom which lets you
actually control every remote you
already own there's two IR ports at the
top of the device and just by pointing a
remote at your phone and telling it what
command you're pressing as you push a
button you can train it to do all sorts
of different things and you can have a
bunch of different remotes that you want
to use as you go you can set all kinds
different stuff and control basically
anything you can think of as long as it
has an IR port there's also Bang and
Olufsen support built-in so most
universal remotes can't handle that
company but they have a partnership
which lets them both use Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen
devices and they've actually improved
the sound from the phone on external
speakers or headphones and should make
everything sound a little bit better but
what's really cool about this phone is
the design it's made of stainless steel
and it's just really sleek Lee built it
has a curved top up here and it just
feels really good in the hand it's it's
not too big and it's again with the 3.8
inch screen but it feels really good to
hold it's got the two IR blasters up
here one to receive signals from your
remote and then to send them out to your
TV it's also got an activity button
which you can program to do all sorts
different things within especially
within the remote app so you can set it
to turn all your devices on when you
press it or off when you long press it
and it's pretty great we saw a
pre-production version of this and so
some things are working a little funky
but they promise everything will be
working fine otherwise it's just a
pretty basic Android phone it's really
beautifully built
it'll be out this summer for about 500
euros it's gonna start in the Nordic
region of Europe but then will spread
out over time and unfortunately the US
is going to be one of the last markets
and that is the luma gan t2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
