the verge the European Union has voted
to create a unified patent system in
2014 it's a big step forward in a debate
that's been going on for decades the new
system would allow a single patent to
cover 25 EU member states and makes
patent protection easier across much of
Europe the new patent system still has
to be ratified by at least 13 states and
that list has to include the UK France
and Germany if all goes according to
plan it will take effect in January of
2014 word has it Apple and Microsoft are
locked in a battle over iOS is 7030
