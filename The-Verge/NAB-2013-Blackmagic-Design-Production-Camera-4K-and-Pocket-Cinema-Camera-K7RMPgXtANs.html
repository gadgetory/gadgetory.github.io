here at nab 2013 we're looking at black
magic screen production camera 4k it is
a 4k camera but they super 35 to size
sensor so there's couple things about it
first of all it's 3995 so it's
essentially 4k at 4k it's got a global
shutter that is a slot here for SSD
recording and also just like the
previous black magic camera interface is
pretty much done entirely via touch back
here on this touch screen this game is
going to be available in July once again
that price is 3995 a Blackmagic Design
also announced this and this is the
Blackmagic pocket Cinema Camera of
course 1080p is going to be available in
july as well it's 995 and what's a
dispute about this is it has a super 16
size sensor and basically it also has a
micro four thirds lens mount this camera
has 13 stops of dynamic range which is
pretty crazy it's actually one more than
the 4k model we just looked at she can
be able to take video with a less of a
risk of you know over your highlights
getting blown out basically be more like
what your eye sees and what you see with
a lot of traditional cameras give you
sense of the size of it here it is next
to an iphone 5 so it's pretty small it
doesn't feel cheap in the hand though it
feels very happy you feel like it has
some real weight there once again this
availabilities going to be in july to
price of 995
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
