there's another huge tournament
happening right now that you should be
watching it doesn't have end zones or a
home plate or even LeBron James but it
does have mythical ancients powerful
wizards fearsome warriors a dude riding
a bat and this guy right now 16 teams
are competing to take home millions of
dollars in an event that could be
watched by millions of people it's
called the International and it looks
like the future of sports
this is the fourth year of the
International and annual dota 2
tournament and it's by far the biggest
year yet it's hosted by valve the
company best known as the creator of the
half-life series this year valve
enlisted dota 2 huge fan base to sweeten
the pot for competitors and they came
through in a huge way valve seated the
tournament with a 1.6 million dollar
prize but players pitched in more than
eight million dollars to bring the total
purse to over 10 million dollars that
makes it not only the largest eSport
tournament in history but also bigger
than some traditional sports tournaments
these players are the best of the best
in dota 2 but that doesn't mean they're
paid like LeBron there's no salary and
losing can literally mean missing out on
your lunch this year's winning team will
take home nearly 5 million dollars if
you're new to dota 2 there's a lot to
learn so much in fact that listening to
the tournament's broadcasts can be
completely overwhelming for newcomers
you're going to hear a lot about laning
creeps
bkb's rat dota and dozens of other
jargony terms it's complicated but
really there are just a few basics you
need to know before watching you could
compare dota 2 do a lot of games and
that's both good and bad it's part chess
part capture-the-flag
part Magic the Gathering and part monty
python and the holy grail dota is short
for Defense of the Ancients and that's
actually the game in a nutshell two
five-man teams that on a big square
gladiatorial arena with a single
objective siege the other teams base and
destroy their ancient before they
destroy yours of course it's not as
simple as hitting a baseball out of the
park
each ancient is protected by a series of
defensive towers that must be toppled
punctually these defenses have four
layers and they're spread out in three
lanes which are just pathways from one
team's base to the other there's one
that goes straight down the middle of
the map diagonally and two that wrap
around each edge unlike pro sports dota
2 is incredibly easy to watch you don't
need television or a special cable
package you just need an internet
connection and this year valve has made
it even easier for newcomers with the
beginners broadcast that breaks down the
game for newbies even valve spectacular
documentary on the game free-to-play is
free to watch online but this year for
the first time major networks are also
getting in on the action the stream will
be available to watch on ESPN 3 the main
event starts today and runs
through Monday July 21st each team will
compete on a stage at the Key Arena in
front of cheering fans you're likely to
see Furious Kombat emotional comebacks
surprising twists and at the end one
team taking home almost 5 million
dollars and a giant shield trophy called
the aegis of Champions if you're
thinking that kind of dough is tempting
you too can someday become a champion
dota 2 is completely free to download
and play and it's available for Mac or
PC</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
