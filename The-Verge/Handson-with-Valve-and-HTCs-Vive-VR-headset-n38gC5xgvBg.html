with the HTC vive which is built with
valve the thing that's actually amazing
about it is how much you can move around
with it and how interactive it is just
in terms of being a VR headset it's a
lot like the oculus rift you put it on
the field of view is roughly the same
but instead of being tracked by an
external camera you have these base
stations that you put in the corner of
your rooms and they essentially shine
lasers across the rooms these lasers
pick up the sensors that are all over
the front of this headset and all over
these controllers so it can give you a
really accurate feel of where you
actually are they contract more than one
headset at once so you can have multiple
people in a room and they can meet up in
VR space you're able to move within what
feels like maybe a few square feet and
that's actually enough for you to walk
around and a lot of really small VR
environments so we've tried demos where
you can walk around the front of a ship
or you can walk around on a little
wooden platform and look at things
there's an amazing demo called tilt
brush where you're able to paint you're
just in a canvas and you'll take these
controllers and use them as paint
brushes the controllers share a lot with
Valve's new steam controller there's a
trackpad on each one of them and you can
use it as a sort of analog stick or you
can touch things with it it's a little
bit weird still they're clearly still
prototypes they look very strange right
now the controllers have wires and the
headset has a lot of wires and you have
to wear a belt to wear the whole thing
but eventually the controllers
themselves are going to be wireless and
the headsets going to just have one
apparently very long wire that you'd
connect to your computer we don't really
know how this would work outside an
extremely controlled environment but
just as a demo it's incredibly exciting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
