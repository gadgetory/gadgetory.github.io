of the next-generation console even
after Nintendo launched the wii u last
fall we were still pretty much all
waiting to see what Microsoft and Sony
would do this year Sony didn't actually
have that much to say when they
announced the PlayStation 4 in March but
this week at an event at its
headquarters here in redmond washington
Microsoft had a much bigger story to
tell they announced new product it's
called the Xbox one coming later this
year there's kind of a lot going on with
engadget terms eight years is basically
an eternity but since its launched in
2005 Microsoft has done an impressive
job keeping the xbox 360 up to date with
new games new apps a completely
overhauled user interface and more the
360 was originally a pure gaming machine
but it became something more it's
microsoft's Trojan horse into your
living room the company's attempt to
create the one set-top box to rule them
all but eight years is still a long time
and Microsoft needed more than just new
software to compete in 2013 not to
mention in 2021 from a hardware
perspective there are three parts to the
one there's the big blocky black console
which looks like a VCR but comes with
massively upgraded specs the one is an
eight core AMD processor eight gigabytes
of RAM that's 16 times as much as the
360 if you're counting plus a 500 gig
hard drive and USB 3.0 drive finally
then there's the new Kinect a smaller
also blocky rectangle that sits above or
below your TV and watches your every
move although now it tracks much more
than your every move it can track your
eyes your facial expression your muscles
your fingers and toes and even your
heart rate it can also do it in the dark
and do it in high definition it collects
a lot more data than the last version
and does it much faster and much more
accurately we were pretty blown away by
it in the short time we have at the new
device Microsoft didn't leave the
controller out of the upgrade cycle
either it has 40 improvements we're told
and a few are obvious it's smaller with
a better integrated battery and its
analog sticks or a little more texture
but the most obvious thing is the new
impulse triggers which is just a fancy
name for making the controls triggers
vibrate when you fire a gun in a game
you'll feel the recoil when you read the
engine you'll jitter along with the car
it's cool from what we've seen but it's
a little much sometimes and it's not
exactly earth-shattering anyway all that
new hardware is used to power and
control a lot of new Xbox software
there's a new UI based on Windows 8 plus
an involved Xbox Live that gives you
more ways to find games and ways to
upload videos of you playing there's a
new snap mode which lets you pin skype
or other apps to the edge of the screen
while you play a game and watch TV oh
and there's skype for Xbox now too but
here's the thing about the xbox one it's
really only partly a gaming machine the
one can connect to all your home theater
devices and even control your cable
through its interface you can say watch
ESPN to switch right to the channel 4
ask what's on HBO to see the guide for
the channel you're looking for we
haven't seen much of the interface or
spent much time with it and frankly
we're worried about the whole hdmi
passthrough setup that really doomed
google TV but hey anything's better than
your cable box last and weirdly kind of
least for now for the games microsoft
showed us a half dozen or so new games
from fifa and madden to quantum break
and call of duty ghosts the graphics
look great but they still look like
video games quantum break a mix of game
and TV show might be the only really
innovative one of the bunch there are
many more games coming at e3 so hoping
to see more then but for now it seems
like gaming hasn't been upgraded quite
as much as the rest of the xbox
experience the Xbox one is coming out
later this year and we're certainly
going to hear more about it as time goes
on like a price for instance but even
now it's clear that Microsoft is making
big changes and betting big on the Xbox
taking over your living room can it
we'll see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
