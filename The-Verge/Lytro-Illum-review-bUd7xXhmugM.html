complicated idea to explain essentially
the idea is that instead of capturing
just one 2d plane of light with one
subject in focus a camera can capture
everything the light and the direction
it's moving you don't think about
focusing ever and you'll never have a
blurry photo again theoretically the
illumise technically light shows second
camera after the odd kaleidoscopic
camera released two years ago but this
is the first real product it's made the
first one made for people to use for
serious work it's also the first light
show that looks like a real camera or at
least a camera crossed with a futuristic
weapon the Illuma is a big heavy black
and blue device I really like its look
actually most of its body is its lens a
huge round cylinder where everything
special about light field photography
takes place it has a few familiar camera
trappings like a hot shoe and a shutter
button plus a handful of customizable
wheels and buttons but most of what you
do with the Illume you do on the 4-inch
display on the back it's angled so you
can see it from above the standard
position for the Illuma is about chest
high held in two hands and it
articulates so you can hold it at almost
any angle
virtually every settings change like
white balance or shooting mode happens
on this screen it's a good touchscreen
and a nice clean simple interface but I
do still like having a few buttons and
dials on the camera more than almost any
camera there are two distinct steps to
using the Illume shooting and processing
you're going to need both let's start
with shooting the Illuma is a one inch
sensor and a high-end qualcomm
snapdragon processor it's big lens
extends from 30 to 250 millimeters and
it shoots at f/2 all the time but gives
you the ability to later focus as high
as f-16 basically there's crazy range in
this camera unlike almost any other on
the planet for regular plane pictures
like we've always shot the Elune isn't
very good it's 40 mega ray sensor
doesn't produce especially sharp images
and it's pretty bad in low-light but
using the Illume to take standard DSLR
pictures is a waste of your money and
light roast technology this cameras
meant for what light roll calls living
pictures which let you and ultimately
anyone play around with perspective and
focus inside a photo it tells a
different story as long as you do it
right doing it right means having at
least two subjects in your photo one
close to the camera one further away it
often means shooting from below where
you'll get a better sense of depth in
to the image there's a lot of staging
required in getting a light-filled photo
just right
you can't quite just aim and click like
you can with a regular digital camera
that's kind of a problem honestly and
it's partly a solvable one the Illume
has what's called a light row button
which maps the refocus of a range of
your shot in blue and orange colors on
the screen it gives you an immediate
sense of what you'll be able to shoot
and how you'll be able to interact with
it later and it does mean getting the
right shot a lot easier and it also
kills the battery the looms autofocus is
essentially useless there's no image
stabilization either which makes
shooting even harder you're better off
just focusing manually which adds an
entirely new level of complexity to this
camera but with the right time and
effort and a lot of trial and error it's
possible to get great photos from the
aluminum and the effect when it works is
amazing the camera can focus on things
literally touching its lens and with so
much zoom and such bright aperture
there's really nothing that's not in
play except you know low light the lose
biggest problem isn't what it's capable
of though or even the challenge it can
be to take great shots that's all part
of the fun the real problem is that this
product is just flat out not stable it
crashes too frequently it freezes to the
point of needing the battery to be
pulled it can be really slow to load
pictures slow to shoot them and just
slow to turn on in the first place this
camera is plenty complicated as it is
and sure it's still a new technology but
it's a $1,500 camera and it needs to get
those things right the same goes for the
processing software which is the other
half of the Illuma Kwai ssin electro
desktop lets you organize your photos
edit them with a set of basic tools and
share them to Lytro site or to anywhere
on the web so people can see and play
with them you can also use it to animate
the photos guiding them through
particular perspective and focus shifts
and then sharing the finished products
as a movie it's fairly simple software
but it's impossibly clunky importing a
lot of files at once cripples even a
crazy powerful gaming laptop the whole
thing crashes all the time and it's all
just slow
each light-filled pictures about fifty
three megabytes takes about 30 seconds
to import and process and can be a huge
hassle to edit if you're willing to put
up with its $1,499 price tag and its
many many headaches by electro Illume
this thing is a glimpse at the future
when photos will truly come alive and
electro might even be the company to
pull it off but pulling it off will mean
making it easier to shoot beautiful
photos photos that are sharp
am clearer in their own right and a user
experience that doesn't make you want to
pull your hair out late field
photography is incredible
I hope it takes over but I wouldn't tell
anyone but the craziest photographers to
really get into it just yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
