and this is the Verizon and Motorola
Droid Maxx - now this phone should look
a little bit familiar it's basically the
same exact thing as the motorola moto x
play that we saw released earlier this
summer in Europe in Latin America and in
Canada and now it's coming stateside
with the Verizon Brandon they're mostly
the same phone there are a couple key
differences first everything that's the
same you got the same five and a half
inch 1080p screen that looks really
great here you have the same Paul comm
Snapdragon 800 processor inside you
still have two gigs of RAM and Verizon
will only be selling these in 16
gigabyte variants although you can
expand the storage up to 128 gigabytes
there's also a five megapixel front
facing camera you also have the same 21
megapixel rear facing camera that we
really liked on the Moto X play it's one
of the best ones motorola has ever had
on its phones and they finally caught up
to the competition when it comes to
smartphone cameras some of the
differences though are that you can tell
this is not running as near of stock and
Android as the Moto X play you have a
little bit of horizon blow air in here
and everything but otherwise it's pretty
much the same thing you're also going to
be able to customize the backs this time
around Verizon is offering a whole bunch
of different colors similar to moto
maker on the Droid turbo - that was just
sounds today and the other Motorola
devices so if you like more color on
your droid Maxx - you're gonna be able
to get that this phone is coming out
really fast that in a release of this
Thursday and Verizon will sell it to you
on a two-year contract for 16 bucks a
month basically runs into about 380
so for a mid-level phone it's a really
good option and it's another phone
that's going to be bringing down the
price of premium phones over the next
couple years if you want to learn more
about the Droid Maxx - or the droid
turbo 2 which was also announced today
