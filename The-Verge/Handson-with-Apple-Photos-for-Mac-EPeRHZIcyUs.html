I'm taking a look at the new Photos app
for Mac essentially replaces iPhoto and
aperture on the desktop it's a
completely redesigned brand new app
designed to match the new Yosemite
aesthetic you've got your control bar
and menu bars are all at the top here
it's much cleaner flatter design that
really showcases your photos much better
than iPhoto did you can see it's a lot
faster with a large photo library
something that iPhoto always kind of
choked on you can zoom in and zoom out
and view your collections and timelines
and things like that you can also do
some cool things like hover over and few
images through kind of a loop feature
here so you can find the exact image
you're looking for the other really big
new feature that come with photos is the
integration with iCloud photos which
lets you access your shared photo
streams you can see photos that have
been liked and favorited and commented
and things like that you could
synchronize all of your photos and
videos from your Mac up to your iCloud
account and then access them on your
iPhone and iPad it actually uses your
iCloud storage that you purchase it
doesn't have an arbitrary time limit or
number limit like my photo stream used
to other parts of the app you've got
albums which are very familiar if you
have iPhoto and you use it now and you
upgrade to the new Photos app all of
your albums will be imported the same
goes for aperture you've got various
types of organization at the top for
different videos slow motion time-lapse
etc and then finally there's also the
project's tab here which has been kind
of revamped apples still offering a lot
of things like photo books and panoramic
prints and things like that so all of
that stuff still remains one of the big
new features available on photos are the
new editing tools the tools look very
similar to what are available on iOS but
they're more powerful on the Mac there's
a new automatic crop mode which will
automatically find the horizon and
rotate the photo and use the rule of
thirds to compose the photo for you
which is pretty cool and then there's
these new intelligent sliders so you can
use one slider to control a bunch of
parameters at once and it preserves the
highlights in your photo and other types
of things and then you can go in and do
some fine-tuning if you want as well but
this is really great for beginners who
are not familiar with these types of
photo tools to just easily quickly fix
their photos there's also a new black
and white feature which lets you use a
slider to control different types of
black and white
processing like different filter
emulations and things like that and then
you can also control the type of film
simulation that it's doing here as well
but it's all is pretty simple and quick
and easy to use really designed for
beginners of photography not for pros at
this point all of your edits also sync
over to the iPhone and the iPad so you
can see this photo here that I edited on
the Mac it's now also edited on my
iPhone and I can go ahead and make
continue to make edits that will sync
back to the Mac so if I reset this
particular photo you can see on the Mac
here it resets to how it was originally
overall photos is a pretty big
improvement over iPhoto in terms of user
experience and features and ease of use
if you've been using iPhoto already
there's really little reason for you to
dislike and not upgrade if you've been
using aperture and you've been like the
more powerful tools there you're
probably going to find photos a little
lacking at this point and professionals
are going to want to use some more
powerful programs Apple is releasing a
seed to developer starting today with a
public beta coming soon and expect the
full release later this spring</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
