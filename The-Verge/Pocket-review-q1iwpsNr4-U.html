version we're checking out pocket today
which is a completely rebranded and
redesigned version of the read it later
app which is launching today on iOS
Android and Kindle Fire if you've used
me too later before you'll know that
it's a little bit clunky and it kind of
looks like it was designed a couple
years ago which it was but it has an
aged very well and it's got both a free
and paid version and if you're using the
free version you know just tends not to
work that well especially compared to
competitors like readability and
Instapaper
the new app though is completely
redesigned and an rebranded as I
mentioned and you know the big thing
here is now the ability to sort by
content and it's not always perfect but
if you if you want you just click in the
top left and you have the ability to
jump between articles video and images
so with video it should be pulling in
YouTube and Vimeo links that you've
saved and it'll pop up a player
unfortunately doesn't always work right
so there's a lot of things here that I
imported from my giant Instapaper queue
that that aren't video and they're
showing up here so if you want to watch
the video just find one that has the
play button here click on it and the the
regular YouTube or Vimeo player plays
and you have the same options that you
have on the regular articles as well
the other big thing you can do is store
by images which is kind of weird because
we just don't it's it's not the same
thing as saving video or text to read
later but you know you can load images
if you'd like to check them out
whenever you want you'll probably be
spending them but you know most of your
time in text view and this has been
completely redesigned and it actually
looks I'd argue a lot better than then
even instapaper the pocket team has done
a really good job here it's very clean
it's very flat and you know once you're
done messing with any of the settings
they just kind of bleed away so a single
tap removes it and you have full text
taking over the entire screen and down
here on the bottom you've got the
ability to jump back the ability to
archive the ability to star and then a
handy pop-up text section and so you can
change the justification you can change
to night mode you can move make the text
bigger you can make it smaller and you
can change between a Sarah
sans-serif' on and then the other nice
thing here is that there are a ton of
sharing options so if you use a reader
letter Pro you'll know that there's a
lot built in there so you have basic
copy Twitter Google Reader
but then clicking more you've got
everything from delicious and Evernote
to you no stumble upon and then it's
also you can share with apps that are
built into iOS or Android so one of the
big problems that I found with with the
pocket reading view is that there's no
pagination and so you you can't set it
up so that you can swipe between
different pages
I talked to pocket and they said that
it's coming in future versions but
unfortunately won't be here to launch so
if you go back to your main ListView you
do have a couple options for dealing
with with big libraries so you are able
to add tags and so in order to do that
you just tap the pencil button in the
top right and then you can select the
stores that you'd like to tag and select
however many you want and then you just
click the tag button in the bottom right
and it lets you create a new tag or add
an old one just going to add a new tag
and save and it's immediately applied to
all of those and so then in order to
access that you can just click you can
pull at the top here your list click
here and select new tag so here's all
the things I just tagged a moment ago
it's pretty fast it works really well if
you if you like to sort by tag or size
or by article length what you also find
up here is the ability to sort by title
or by URL there's no any text search yet
it might be coming in future versions
but for now it's pretty good for you
know quickly finding that article that
you want to find the pocket upgrade is
really a huge improvement in terms of
both design and usability and if you're
a read it later user then it's going to
be a really big improvement for you if
you're already using an app like
Instapaper readability
to save articles especially to only read
text it's probably not worth making the
upgrade you know the nice thing with
pocket though is that it is starting to
expand out beyond just text and so you
can save video and images and so you
know if you really see yourself watching
a lot more video then it's probably
worth considering a switch</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
