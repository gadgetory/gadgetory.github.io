think about it this is 90 seconds on the
verge South African Civil Rights icon
Nelson Mandela has died at the age of 95
Mandela dedicated his life to fighting
an apartheid government he became south
africa's first black president in 1994
over the last 24 hours leaders from
across the world have paid tribute to
Mandela a state funeral scheduled to
take place sunday december 15 in other
news like your Nexus 5 but having issues
with the camera you might want to check
for updates google has released the
android 4.4 point one update that brings
dramatic improvements to the Nexus 5's
camera including faster focusing better
low-light and less shutter lag we've
tested ourselves and came away rather
impressed there's still plenty of work
to be done of course androids director
of engineering Dave Burke promises it
will continue to get better and finally
x-men days of future past may not be
hitting theaters until May that hasn't
stopping director Bryan Singer from
teasing the next entering the series on
Twitter Thursday singer announced the
new superhero film called Xmen
apocalypse will be coming to theaters in
2016 while it hasn't been immediately
confirmed that singer himself will be
helming the picture the fact that the
director was the one to break the news
is a very good sign but I swear Brett
Ratner gets anywhere near this film on
go Phoenix on his ass that's it for
today is top stories but coming up
tomorrow I test out the new verge beacon
tells me whenever Nathan psych rates
around
