we're here with dr. Paul you Jacobs the
chairman and CEO Qualcomm and we're
going talk a little bit about what
they're working on right now and see
what the future hold in the last few
years there's been a real explosion in
mobile and you guys were there obviously
you're there on the comm ground
literally on the ground floor of that
yeah and well not literally but you're
there very early how is that how has
that changed how how you do what you do
I mean has it changed it at all in the
sense that you're now consumer-facing
you're making product Snapdragon has
become a kind of household name when it
comes to mobile devices has that change
the rate of innovation that you feel
like you need to have has a change to
your pace yeah I don't think Simon we
really had been trying to drive the
wireless internet for a really long time
within the very early days of CDMA we
actually put the Internet protocols
inside the phone now people didn't know
it was in there because it looked like
it was one of those Hayes modems the
eight EDT blah blah blah and made all
the noises and stuff right now what's
cool is because smartphones are so
popular now there's other ways that we
can innovate so we used to innovate a
lot about the radio technology we still
do a lot of that because there's so much
data demand but now we're innovating on
the cpu you know the microprocessor
technology the graphics technology Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth connectivity technology
just all these different areas where we
can add like extra functionality into
the device and now we're actually going
up another level so we've been doing
augmented reality for example so kind of
platforms of technology still enabling
other people to build their stuff on top
of our stuff so tell me what view Fauria
is all about what you guys are doing
with it it's a platform for app
developers to build vision-based
augmented reality applications I can
actually take my cell phone now with
this phone yeah point at this phone
recognize the surface of this phone and
I'll be able to superimpose instructions
on top of it that show me how to perform
a simple function and it actually
annotates the buttons I need to push
away in the order I need to push them
wow that is cool kind of like when you
get directions in google maps and you're
doing the kind of step by step instead
of the navigation you're kind of going
but it's for a physical object that's
right yeah so any really cool anytime
you've ever seen one of those user
manuals with a line draw
that's trying to show you how to point
or put something together perfect
opportunity for augmented reality do you
see applications for this for things
like mechanics working on a car engine
absolutely got a camera above it it can
kind of tell you everything that's going
on you know where all the pieces are I
mean I guess a mechanic might know but
obviously every day engine is different
right is that the kind of thing that
this could be adapted for absolutely
could be for repair it could be for do
it yourself at home learning to fix
something it could be for assembly of
something that's complex anytime you
need visual instructions to supplement
and help you in a particular task with
physical objects it's just being put
into play by any companies right now or
is this still in the kind of testing
phase this was developed internally at
Qualcomm but it was developed using our
commercially available platform so any
developer or third party could build
these applications and deploy them
commercially today well very cool okay
thanks so much thank you really
appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
