am wearing the new Samsung gear VR
headset which is actually an accessory
for the new Samsung Galaxy Note 4 it is
Samsung's version of VR headset and it
uses the note 4 that actually sits in
the front of these glasses to power the
lenses behind it and so it creates this
virtual reality environment
Samsung says that they've actually
partnered with oculus and some other VR
developers to create this headset
currently I'm playing a game where I'm
flying a spaceship around and blasting
asteroids and other spaceships it uses
full head tracking fully immersive it's
very similar to the oculus rift
experience except it's completely
untethered and mobile on the right-hand
side here there's a control panel that
is a touch panel and swiping and there's
a back button volume control here and a
focus controller on top but otherwise
you're pretty much interacting with the
display itself there's a few demo
applications that let you view concerts
and play games and there's an adventure
Avengers program built into it as well
so you can pretend to be Tony Stark
which is very cool and actually a lot
more fun than I expected I'm gonna die
Samsung isn't saying exactly when this
will be released or how much it will
cost but we expect it to be available
this fall and until then I'll be in here
