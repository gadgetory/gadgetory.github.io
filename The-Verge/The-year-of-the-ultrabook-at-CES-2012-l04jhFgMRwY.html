and i am here inside the verge CES 2012
trailer but outside here in vegas it has
literally been raining ultrabooks ok not
literally though i did get hit in the
head with one yesterday but there are a
ton of ultrabooks or thin and light
laptops being announced at the show
every computer manufacturer is jumping
into the pool intel's talking about the
future so i wanted to give you guys a
look at some of my favorite ultrabooks
here at the show and then give you a
look at what's to come so let's start
here with the samsung this is the
samsung series 9 and it's kind of
apropos to start with it because last
year at CES samsung announced the series
9 and this is a refresh to it but it
sort of kicked off the entire category
so what they've done here with the new
one is they've coded it in aluminum it's
sort of a unibody or certain they
they're saying a shell of aluminum feels
really nice in hand really sturdy it's
also one of the thinnest to be announced
not even at the show but just to be on
market so it's going toe-to-toe with the
macbook air in terms of thickness feels
really nice obviously and underneath you
sort of get more premium specs than any
of the other ultrabooks so this display
is a 13 inch display with a beautiful
norton pop up but it's really bright
it's a 400 nits display with a 1600 x
900 resolution it's also a matte display
so I sort of love this display if you
cannot tell and its overall underneath
the lid you get here a nice keyboard a
nice touch pad a nice experience I think
it's going to take some time to see how
the touchpad works but the thing is with
the Samsung is that this is more
expensive than any of the other
ultrabooks that are launching this is a
1399 then they're going to be other skus
that go up to 15 99 so you get more
premium specs here and you also get more
of a premium build but you've got to
decide if you want to pay more moving on
to the HP's envy spectre 14 and this is
again another sort of high-end ultrabook
it's going to go for 1399 as well but
what HP's done here is pretty crazy
they're basically using glass all over
the system this is a gorilla glass lid
and then when you open it up you've got
a glass touchpad and palm rest and a
gorilla glass display so it picks up a
ton of
fingerprints this lid is sort of a
fingerprint magnet if you're a murderer
you do not want to leave your
fingerprints on there also a really nice
display here from HP this is a 1600 x
900 resolution display again really high
resolution in comparison to the other
ultrabooks but it's also got a radiance
display which is sort of like an IPS
equivalent for laptops just great
viewing angles really bright so overall
really nice in terms of builds HP's also
put on its Beats Audio so you get this
jog dial here on the Left nice keyboard
the touch pads a little bit stiff so
we'll see how that works out but again
1399 for a bit more of a premium system
it's also a little bit thicker because
of the glass so wanted to then talk
about the dell this is the new dell XPS
13 and dell is actually coming in at the
lower end of the market they are not
pulling in a demo here and blasting out
the specs with a really thin design but
this is pretty thin it is pretty light
and it's going to start at nine hundred
and ninety nine dollars and you know
overall it just feels like a nice system
it just feels kind of solid all around a
nice keyboard a backlit keyboard a nice
big click pad we'll see how that works
though it's been working really well
when I was testing it before and you get
a 13 inch display but it's got a lower
resolution than the others in terms of
specs on all of these they're pretty
much the same you get a core i5
processor basically standard on all of
them 4 gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabyte
solid-state drive and all of the ultra
books are required to have solid state
drives or they're required to boot
really fast and resume from sleep really
fast to make that experience really nice
so that's basically the ultrabooks of
today we wanted to give you a look at
what's coming out later this year so
this is the Lenovo yoga and it looks
basically like a regular laptop you've
got a keyboard you've got a touchpad
you've got a nice palm rest here that's
made out of leather ports on the side
but it's running windows 8 and you can
also flip it around and turn it in to a
tablet so this morphs into a Windows 8
tablet works really nicely actually for
windows 8 being such an early build at
this point so turn it into a tablet I
can also
so flip it around here and turn it into
a tenth of sorts can stand it up on a
desk and something like that so really
interesting form factor from Lenovo
obviously this isn't coming out until
the windows 8 time frame which is
probably not till the fall but again
this is the sort of thing we're
expecting to see more of because Windows
8 is touch friendly I'm going to see a
lot of these convertibles later in the
year so that overall is a good look at
what i think the Ultrabook story here is
at CES 2012 welcome to the year of the
Ultrabook</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
