at CES 2013 obviously I'm here with Matt
Rogers from nest you guys you're not
showing anything new at the show but you
are in many ways the talk of a huge
story at the show which is home
automation basically smart sensors of
all kinds that connect to your iPhone in
your Android device yes so yeah we
introduced four months ago now yeah
since then amazing Christmas lot lots of
getting the word out people are buying
it people buying for their parents and
their grandparents so Christmas was
amazing so this is the first year i
think on record where thermostats were a
popular christmas gift yes well so
that's really should i want to talk
about that you guys made a thermoset
you've got this huge team you were on
the iphone team uh Tony Fadell of the
CEO your co-founder also famously in the
ipod and ipod iphone teens at Apple you
built the thermostat that it is
basically a smartphone right yeah very
looks very much like a smartphone but
what's interesting to me is I once the
Samsung booth it's like Samsung didn't
build a thermostat this year none of the
other big LG didn't build the thermostat
this year I'm getting a lot of PR from
little companies or doing thermostats
but it's funny because there's a trend
of home automation and it's all gone to
light switches and power outlets and all
this other weird stuff and no one's
starting where you started so so we did
service that's because it matters okay
so half of whom energy is controlled by
the you know by the thermostat and it's
a big problem I'm amazed that no yeah no
big companies have taken notice and I
started doing this honey honey was it
yeah yeah the old player mean I cry what
new things are gonna do they're gonna
add Wi-Fi right big deal right it's
still a white plastic box with a
horrible touchscreen I mean it's a
little more of more of the old more the
same right in terms of new players that
you know there's I love all the new
stuff I mean but I would there are new
players for like making thermostats I
think about awake in that space so you
but I'm what I'm saying it's interesting
that you know we do our sea has previews
and we say things like home automation
is going to be a story at this CES and
it's kind of like when we say tablets
are a big market and what we
really mean is the ipad it's almost like
when people say home automation what
they mean is the nest proved a model for
connected pieces of your home that's
right but you have just one you have one
little thing yes your one piece of it
but we do it really well so that's all
right that's our whole culture that's
our strategy let's do it the best we
possibly can sure and the reason why
we've only done one thing is because we
have to do it the best we absolutely can
and be able to focus and do it build the
best thermostat there is I looking at
the kind of connected home I don't think
people want to buy a connected home they
want to build them I great stuff and
they want to buy a great thermostat or
they want to buy a great lighting
product you know if you know if those
all those products existed i think
people might have a smart home but i
don't think you want to buy a box full
of white plastic things you know my kids
see me yeah it doesn't make any sense
well so lets me look the nest was
announced i want to say a year ago but I
feel like you guys announced a nest like
the day we announced the bird things I
just um so I'll even volume very closely
you're here at CS you're seeing this
ecosystem of smart products and you've
got the one are you thinking about
moving into that broader ecosystem I
know Tony always says you don't put this
team together if you're only gonna go
the thermostat but then you're sitting
here being like we gotta build a
thermostat those we have to build the
best nervous that out there and I've
been a lot of time improving the
software adding analytics these energy
reports we send out every month email is
describing how much are using and why
now you're could save more of course
we're looking at some new stuff yeah
we're gonna do you know one or two
things really really well i dinnae
LaBranche on we do we'll add another
thing it's like I think about Apple so
Apple did iPods for five or six years or
dangerous the iphone people like forget
how long these time frames were they
play wait you know I think three years
before they introduced the ipad I mean
these things are they take time you want
to educate your customers about what
this whole experience is about there's a
reason why I know the smart home stuff
is taken off yet it's because that's
what's crap right not even chew on it i
mean i agree with you must describe and
it's the initial outlay that the cost of
the adventure if you will right is
extremely high it's 500 light switches
right how do you solve that kind of
problem when you when you I get why you
started with the first era it's one
thing you can get a tangible benefit
from it right
it's important right so that you can buy
it but you can't you don't buy it a lot
right you buy one like every 10 years I
don't think you're gonna get upgrades
every year I'm so we're not not
expecting it so there's a few enabling
technologies sure so there's
connectivity and it's a lot easier and
cheaper dad connectivity products now so
that's one in a blur one is I take great
algorithms great intelligence and that's
something at me is kind of net secrets
off that we spend a lot of time and what
we hired my professor yo kedar to run
that team because it's so important I
think that's an enabling technology I
don't think you need a smart smart light
bulbs more light switch the smarts can
be somewhere else but right as long as
that product is connected a kid you know
it it could participate in all these
kind of ecosystems so if you have a you
know it so you're saying there's like a
product this is like a Trojan horse so
you're you putting up this draw
processor on the wall and everything
else gonna connect so in that thing
however it means this thing is a
smartphone I mean it has you know 800
megahertz CPU it's you know it is like a
smartphone it's a lot like a kind of
iphone four era right product and
there's a we are able to deliver great
new products and new new algorithms new
software through updates so in the last
15 months like we've delivered 13
software updates to our customers for
free so there are things we haven't even
cooked up yet things we haven't even
thought of that we can then go push out
to people and they have all this new
features now right it's a you know
that's cool well here's my big question
you've got one smart phone in your
pocket yes you've got another smartphone
caliber thing yes on the wall if you
look around you know belkin's got a
bunch of stuff and it's like the
smartphone is the brain for those things
right some of the other home automation
it's more let's put an even bigger bring
on the wall what's other pc do it where
should that live is it still in one
place any place any yes many lives a
little bit of everywhere so there's some
things that you want to have in your
palm of your hand like things like
control and make sense to do in the palm
of your hand like you pick out your
phone you want to change your
temperature you could do that there are
things that you want the home to be all
due on its own so like when you arrive
home you want the home to wake up for
you or when you're going home I mean
you're on your way home you want to wake
up for you there's latent technology
that needs to exist in the home and you
actually want these things to be
distributed like much like there there's
no one central server that runs the
entire internet right
like it should be yeah it doesn't go
down right so that's one of things we
think about is you know as we have more
of these products we want to have them
exist and work well in a disconnected
world right so if your internet goes
down or if your Wi-Fi fails your
thermostat still performs great and all
the intelligence is still there that's
one of the reasons what we did that way
so that actually brings me to kind of
another big trend here at CES which is
and it's disconnected but I think it's
actually directly related which all the
body monitors right the Fitbit if the
nike stuff the pebble smartwatch in a
way is one of these things where it's an
external device to a central processor
but you're sending data back and forth
do you see those as being complementary
to what you're doing because I see I see
a world of people with smartphones in
their hands and they're just buying
sensors all over the place and the nest
is a sensor in many ways that does some
other control the fitbit's a sensor and
I just see basically we're making the
world around us smarter so i can send
data to a smartphone yes well so i think
all these new health applications are
amazing so you think health is kind of
where we were a few years ago I mean
industry in the dark ages you have to go
to a doctor to get you know get your
temperature taken my god no like the
attack you have to go to see someone
interrupting doctors well I'm not but
you know others are I mean why should
you have to go drive somewhere for them
to take her temperature and your blood
pressure why can't the ritual with the
wristwatch you have do that for you and
alert you when there's a problem like
same time analytics we're providing on
the energy side why couldn't somebody do
the same thing or apply similar
technology on the outside enormous
benefits mean it's an industry just drop
there right so do you see it you see
connection between what you're doing and
those things because to me it's just a
bunch of sensors right there's their
sensors there's connectivity there's
intelligence and we're all those things
live they can live all in one place they
can live in different places I they're
all actually it's very similar someone
could make a nest for home health yeah
and we could work together I mean who
knows right well so the work together
stuff right now you guys I mean I know
that I have my family members we have
big home automation systems right
they've controlled for a restaurant and
I'm like I'd love to get a nest but they
that thing doesn't talk to me
so so we we have an integrated yet uh
and there's a reason why is one there's
a lot of privacy people trust us yeah we
have a lot of very private data we know
in their home when they're not we wanna
make sure they're okay the way she was
like you know how hot my house is no
like in terms of private data that's
like way low on the list yes though
photos of my children yeah in my house
is 72 degrees yeah occupancy is the main
thing right so we don't we want to make
sure we're doing the right got my
community that is super top-secret a
away from that don't let this together I
don't want anybody know might take a
jungle yeah it's weird okay so uh me
eventually you know of course there's a
whole industry that we could enable and
it's about focus for us and you eat
right do a few things well so eventually
when it makes sense and there's enough
kind of I'd say momentum behind some of
these things we'll do it right but right
now come home automation as it stands
today it's kind of geeky right yeah it's
actually it's terribly geeky yes
everybody know who has serious from
automation systems in their home has
hacked android phones yeah it's like
they're like combined yeah you shouldn't
need IT guy for your house right that's
that's why we haven't done right right
but all that stuff is here I mean that's
what I'm saying it's there is if you
when we were doing our previews and I
looked at all the previous around the
industry of CES 2013 it's there's gonna
be a bunch of windows 8 stuff you know
that every reason have a new phone yeah
and home automation is I'm a big story
at this ship and in what they were
talking about is companies like nest but
you don't do home automation you
automate and even know I don't think you
automate one thing right you so think of
it as automated so I mean there's some
elements of automation they you know we
learn we learn and we act on your behalf
like we don't really consider it solves
a home on a mission product right mean
there's so much stuff out there there's
a lot of noise and say yes about home
automation and internets of things and
all these kind of things and you just
you just walk around this like creeping
around the show floor like seeing what
people are doing it's always good to see
what's going on part of part of our job
is as technologists is to kind of be
aware what the industry is doing right
and sometimes will do will follow and
sometimes we're no lead and sometimes
where do the exact opposite will do
something totally different right well
let me ask you a totally different is
what is what is totally different if you
had to pick the wildest they need to do
what would that be the well so doing a
thermostat was pretty wild I mean old
has a wrong I bet Samsung does have a
thermos I shouldn't have one I'm sure
they're working on it yeah yeah what's
the wildest thing we could do we saw
some interesting VR stuff the CES like
you see oculus rifts we're gonna whole
thing's amazing it's awesome I look like
a moron that on camera yesterday is like
pong it was actually a nice moment of
peace like in the crazy CES like no
you're literally in a different place
yes it was kind of nice they've got a
lot of give a lot of potential with it
gotta deliver yeah and actually that
brings me there's a trend here of
hardware startups really interesting
hardware startups yes uh and you guys
are hardware startup you mean obviously
you have a lot of experience you and
Tony like did the iphone or team has a
lot of experience team has a lot of
experience um but you made the iphone
like when you go out in the world and
ask for money like make anything i'm
sure they're like take take the money
right the hardware startups here our
kickstarter guys right the pebble watch
the oculus rift there's another one
today that i can't remember if it
announced I mean there's just a lot of
Kickstarter and we're actually thinking
man Kickstarter's like kind of the story
of CES but I know that you're kind of
old-school you think these Ozil back so
so when we do something we want to put
it all we're going all in I mean we hire
the best team you know we spend a lot of
money to build lots of prototypes we
break them they bash them in we do
hundreds of field trials around the
country if we r do something we're gonna
do it really really well I mean there's
a certain culture to kind of perfection
and we are in every freakin detail out
there and we're thinking about the whole
product and that's something that you
need a lot of money to do I mean we
invest in packaging our retail channels
doesn't Kickstarter provide you with
that money I that's what I kind of don't
understand its to do a product right in
my opinion it takes multiple millions of
dollars it's not something like it's a
rare thing you're doing get some
Kickstarter okay so you think the rise
of hardware startups here is I mean
that's a story right why don't want
their hardware startups the way there
are web startups and like I get that
there's probably an order of magnitude
because the web is so easy yeah I mean
there's an enormous complexity involved
it's more than just writing some code
you need mechanical engineers electrical
engineers you
enders and supply chain you
manufacturing embedded software there's
a it takes an army to go do one of these
guys right our initial team to do kind
of the first verse numbers that at the
end of the day was about 70 people those
frames yeah you are to kick-start that
like that that's a lot of money to run
the contine right and you've got kind of
a crazy team you've got people from you
got a lot of people from Logitech you've
got your professor is doing all the new
year old stuff is so so most of our kind
of hardware embedded engineering
organizations are all from Apple most of
our kind of cloud side stuff is Twitter
dash oh really Microsoft you know guys
guys who would have that kind of DNA I
mean we we want to put these kind of two
worlds together right well you know
Apple that it's our story with Apple is
they don't they're not good at the cloud
stuff yet they're still working so
they're learning I mean they've hired a
lot of great guys of last couple years
and there they've that entire
organization has changed dramatically me
Eddie's a solid guy right actually I'm
curious about this what you were on them
just give me the little background of
what you did with your iPhone's so I
started out you know way back in 2004 as
an intern did some early ipod stuff on
nano and then we were doing the first
kind of first iphone prototype the ones
that I mean I've shipped I was one of
the first firmware guys on the ground to
bring it up make the first call out in
China you were in China was like a
non shipping it was a giant board you
know play you know wow two feet long we
could we called home because we've
actually called Tony on this giant
breadboard that's really funny if it
have it had the display and everything
like the touch display or was not yet so
this is yeah he had bare metal like it
takes from that point pi took us 19
months to get to product Wow we have a
first prototype so we asked you here
we're here at CES the first I was
aluminum right how'd you eat it and then
you had the plastic antenna yes so it
has to be plastic it doesn't run through
middle oh but so it's funny cuz then you
they went to the iphone I just asked you
because this is a thing at CS that I
think is hilarious then he went that you
know you iterate iterated even if the
iphone 4 through glass back which was I
think a mistake it was beautiful uh but
you know break scratches right and so
then Apple one away from a now everyone
here at CS is like sony has a phone
that's bad everybody copies up a nexus 4
is a glass back
there is well there's entire industry
that just follows Apple that's what they
do right that's what they do I mean
maybe but do you walk around like seeing
your old mistakes also we used to walk
around CES and see kind of ipod
knockoffs back in a day and you know
it's it's a lot of fun I mean mimicry is
is a great compliment right I mean I
it's just funny cuz like the idea of
Sony putting on a five I mean I will say
I think industries way ahead of Apple in
terms of screen size I think like 5-inch
1080p is like gorgeous you should go to
something soothing look at their phone
yeah and then it's like you turn it over
and you're like why did you make this
mistake but that specs so like apple
doesn't compete on the specs war that's
not what they do it's all about user
experience right it's about building the
absolute best product out there right it
doesn't matter how many make sure this
is a speck of how big your screen is is
on pretty valuable spec people's hands
are all about you know there's there's a
size people's hands excise me serious
hands you need a 5-inch screen play
that's all i'm at about four hey you're
five inch in for my eyes these are
serious eyes I'll hold this mother for a
little bit longer okay uh no let's talk
about some of your favorite stuff so on
the show floor so the Audi boof is
really cool yeah those guys have done
some amazing so I want a self-driving
car I really really want one like if
someone could make one and I can go buy
it I'll do it today yeah I would do it
have you played in one of Google's
self-driving so Google Google Ventures
winning yesterday yeah google ventures
is one of our biggest investors full
marathon our board and actually got a
less board meeting last month he showed
up in it self driving car guys yeah like
I come to your next coordinator show up
the check check out there how do you
steal a self-driving car I don't think
you steal it I think it comes to you and
you know I think just check them out I
mean they had a mushroom over at Google
all right so audio what what else i like
i like this oculus rift that's really
cool honestly I the TVs are pretty cool
like some of these like for isn't that
just yes it is but it's freaking
beautiful okay right and putting the
super super high resolution ultra-thin
it's it's nice I mean I'm sup gadget
geek alright so I ask you this we have a
bet and watch let you go but we have a
bet josh says 4 k's like basically
nothing happened
no content yeah but I say people will
buy them as a regular product within two
to three years what's your take I think
so too so I was an early adopter on
1080p I I bought one of the first 1080p
it seems crazy to say now and okay so
that's everything upon a 1080p TV in
2005 for like 5 grand it was they didn't
make any sense there's no content
another is yeah so there will be content
they will be mainstream the prices will
come down that's how this all works you
know I was talking to uh somebody at
Sony and they're like you know we have a
chicken and egg problem the content do
you think your TV is the chicken out of
the egg and they literally just like
shut down like walked away well this is
like I'm not askin a question this is
the irony so Sony they built TVs they
control the content why couldn't they
pull something off you're literally
saying all the things that I say it why
couldn't they pull this off they are
complete vertically integrated they have
so many different business units why
they just all work together it's funny
cuz you could you know that this is your
this is a prototype for nest you're
gonna build this you're gonna go back no
cloud service and they're gonna work
together I hope so right anything else
to say about this time before you want
we wrap up your freaking great I mean
it's like honestly please picture
products it's one of the best things
I've ever built like a zit tne built the
iphone and we both the iphone we built
the ipod so so this is better than the
iphone i think it's all say it's very
useful it saves people money it saves
energy like it's beautiful i mean we're
really proud of it we put a lot of time
and energy I think for us to quit a job
at apple making the biggest products in
consumer electronics history to make a
thermostat it's gotta be freaking
awesome or are you insane or we realize
there was a distinct second boss we are
a little bit of crazy I like it maybe a
lot Matt I was gonna happen crates in
here soon thanks
