first place you go whenever you need to
find information on anything it's on our
computers it's on our phones sometimes
even in our cars and on our wrists now
Google wants to be in our homes and
apartments and it's new 129 dollar
Google home voice-activated speaker is
exactly how it's doing and it's
impossible to talk about Google home
without also talking about Amazon's echo
and they are very similar both are
voice-activated connected smart speakers
I could play music control a bunch of
smart home devices add things to your
to-do list or shopping list and do a
bunch of web searches all with just your
voice now Google has further ambitions
for home that go beyond what Amazon is
currently doing but let's start with the
device itself the home is shorter and
squatter than the echo and to be honest
it looks a lot like an air-pressure I
don't really think that's a bad thing it
makes it really easy to integrate in a
home and it doesn't stick out like an
obvious piece of gadgetry now it's only
available in white but you can buy
various fabric and metal shells to
customize it to your home decor on top
is a touch panel lets you control volume
play or pause your music and activate
the speakers this new feature now
integrate into this panel our far-field
microphone so it can hear you from
across the room you can activate it with
just your voice by saying ok Google or
hey Google and it can even hear you when
playing music or other audio now as a
smart speaker the home is pretty much
just as good as the echo it gets
surprisingly loud and can fill a room
with sound and in addition to the
built-in sources of Google YouTube music
Pandora and Spotify you can cast audio
to it from your phone or your laptop hey
Google Play might discover weekly
alright playing your Spotify playlist
called discover weekly hey Google skip
this track it's not the kind of speaker
you'd use to drive a house party but for
everyday listening it's perfectly fine
now if you do want more power you can
set the home's audio to a chromecast
Audio that's connected to a larger
speaker you just say hey Google play
this music on chromecast Audio and the
audio will just shift right over you can
also pair multiple home units together
and simultaneously play music through
all of them in addition Google's also
added the ability to send video from the
home to a chromecast
googleplay the rogue one trailer on the
chromecast sure playing rogue one
trailer from YouTube on chromecast this
is still very limited it only works with
YouTube right now
now finally the home can also control
smart home gadgets right now it supports
nest Phillips hue and smart things which
means you can control your thermostat
your lights and other gadgets who adjust
your voice now I've used this a lot and
I found that the home is a little bit
more reliable than the echo for doing
this I usually only have to ask it once
to do its thing but the biggest thing
that sets the home apart is the fact
that it's Google search engine and
algorithms powering it that means you
can ask in many of the same things you
ask Google on the computer and get
similar results hey Google how long
would it take me to walk to San
Francisco on foot the trip to San
Francisco is 40 days in one hour even
better Google home can remember the
context of what you asked it the
President of the United States of
America Barack Obama hey Google when was
he born he was born on August 4th 1961
hey Google who was the president before
him George W Bush according to the
Telegraph 43 George W Bush January 20th
2001 January 20th 2009 Republican
presidents ignore what might work where
was he born he was born in New Haven
Connecticut now the only thing that
really spoils this experience is you
have to say ok Google before each and
every question you ask
but like the video casting features the
homes assistant is more limited than you
might expect for starters it only works
with one Google account at a time and
that makes it really hard to use it as a
family device so if my wife asks Google
home to add something to it to-do list
it gets added to my to-do list and my
devices not hers Google says that it is
working on this and it does plan to add
multiple account support in the future I
also can't use the homes assistant to do
things I'm used to doing on my phone
such as sending messages or making phone
calls hey Google send a message to
dieter I think I'm going to be late
sorry I can't send messages yet Google
really wants its home to be the access
point to its services in your house for
all those times when your hands are full
or you're not looking at a screen right
now it's mostly just a better echo it's
easier to set up it looks a little nicer
and it's a little bit more reliable but
it's easy to see the potential here how
Google can leverage its existing
services and search powers to go way
beyond what Amazon is doing but then the
question remains are you ready to have
an always listening Google bot in your
house integrated huh why am I getting a
call Jesus Christ or I could say hey
Google play some Halloween music for a
spooky night that's really lame we come
up with a better example</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
