first look at Facebook snapchat killer
slingshot slingshot is a lot like
snapchat a camera screen is the first
thing you see when you open the app tap
to take a photo and hold to take a video
you can caption your shots and even draw
on them using various colors and brush
sizes pick a few friends hit Sling and
your photo or video is sent it all seems
very familiar except in slingshot you
can't view shots from friends until you
send them a shot back first only then do
their locked chats become unlocked and
you can view them the mechanic doesn't
make much sense unless you think about
slingshot the way Facebook does not as a
messaging app like snapchat but as an
app for status updates and for sharing
casual photos and videos to lots of
people at the same time in this way each
shot is like a status update but is also
a nudge to get friends to show you what
they're up to flipping through the feat
of shots you've unlocked feels like an
idealized version of Facebook where
every shot is fullscreen and meant just
for you you can tap on one to take a
quick reaction shot or make a text
comment and like snapchat every shot and
reaction is gone forever once you've
swiped it away but like conventional
status updates on Facebook these posts
don't feel urgent like texts or snaps
since you can't view them on demand so
what's the real difference between the
two ephemeral apps sling shot includes
the select all button
something snapchat diehards have been
begging for and sling shot is certainly
noisier
slingshots pay-to-play mechanic might be
too confusing to get your friends to
join it feels weird to get a push
notification for a message and be unable
to read it until you take the time to
share something back and what if I have
nothing to share Facebook doesn't call
slingshot a messaging app but it looks
so much like snapchat that it's easy to
forget how you're supposed to be using
slingshot yet the app shows that
Facebook isn't afraid to experiment with
new ways to let you share and new ways
to incentivize sharing be on Facebook
