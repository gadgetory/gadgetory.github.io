beautiful iOS apps lately like YouTube
Gmail and maps how'd that happen
there's only one way to find out head to
the campus talk to people made the apps
and figure out just how Google upped its
design game
if you pull the Guler on the street
you'd be more often to find that they're
on an Android phones and an iOS phone
just nature if we make Android but there
is there's a lot of iOS users I'm
constantly surprised how many Googlers
you talk to and ask which platform I use
they'd pull out two phones one for me
Thalia a volver well I have a corporate
phone I have a personal phone I have a
tablet I actually I also have a nexus 7
for reading books but as at home in 2011
Larry Page became the CEO of Google and
he issued a mandate redesign all of the
major apps they called it project
Kennedy and the crazy thing is that it
worked Google doesn't have a Johnny I've
who dictates design across all of its
products but they found a way to make
everything that they do on iOS and
Android relatively consistent and also
very pretty on the day that Larry became
CEO he also said hey everyone we're
gonna redesign all of our car products
oh and we need to do it by this summer
there was a previous endeavor to do this
it was called kana it was a bit of a
bottom-up approach and we came up with a
really a series of really interesting
great designs but we it was hard to get
traction because again you kind of have
to mobilize and the entire company to
make it happen
you know historically at Google I think
there were pockets of designers or you
know there are teams that they're like
oh let's bring all of Google together
into one you know beautiful amazing
design right but they were they were
sort of because of the way that Google's
set up again for speed right you know
there's this dependency fact we want to
lower dependencies on products so that
they can move fast it was kind of hard
for any one team to push that Google
wide so really require the vision of
someone like Larry who can rally the
entire company to make it happen
Larry Page didn't take the traditional
route he looked outside Google's
Mountain View campus to New York City
where the company runs an isolated
design studio called Creative Lab it's
known for producing Google's famous
Parisian loves Superbowl ad and an
innovative Arcade Fire music video that
utilized Google Maps lead designers at
Creative Lab worked with Google product
designers to work out a sharp modern
take on applications like search and
Gmail some of these same design ideas
seem to have found their way to Google
now on
under the direction of Matias Duarte
Google traditionally not really well
known for design but it's really
changing Google passionately cares about
design and the entire company is
transforming itself around that idea
Google now is a great example in so many
ways to talk about design and the rise
of design culture in the way that design
works at Google because design is not
just about making things more useful
it's not just about making things more
beautiful it's about really figuring out
what is the right thing to make and how
to make it right when Google now began
it was really this this mandate in this
vision from Larry that that Google could
be better than instant that Google could
be almost psychic and this was you know
very shocking provocative direction and
and and definitely scary and disturbing
but it's a very different way of
thinking about product it's not like oh
we're working on a feature we've got
this idea of we're going to add these
little incremental things it was a
vision and that was awesome and and then
the job of the designers was like okay
how do we get there what can we do with
that vision design is really about kind
of and I like to think of it as
practical imagination imagining
possibilities and making them real so
one of the essential parts of that is to
do it like you just have to do a lot of
it iterate a lot look at everything and
only when you've done it done like every
possible variation that you can think of
then you realize oh there's actually one
thing we didn't try let's try that this
is different explorations about how we'd
actually render the context header we
were trying to decide like should the
context headers you know be photography
should it be tight illustration should
it be this watercolor illustration right
like we tried a lot of different things
we we created context headers again in
this very brushy look and we thought oh
this looks beautiful looks amazing on
the screen but again it's a little bit
off from from from the Google brand we
tried something a little bit more
technical then it's just felt a little
classy right so so this is like just the
kind of level of iteration we go through
like what if we do the Google box with
the holo style entry field right it
doesn't feel googly enough right you
know their challenges associate
with building apps for any platform that
isn't your own here's the issue with iOS
you want your apps to look like Google
apps but feel iOS native
the strategy initially was to get a
presence a gmail presence on iOS so you
know looking at the raw materials that
we had to work with what we started with
was the web version of G of Gmail for
the phone and we took the pieces of it
that needed to be native and we made
those native and built an experience on
the phone I think when you look at the
the app today it's still based on those
the same underpinnings but just a huge
amount of work has gone into making it
fluid making it really responsive and
then on the visual design side so I
think everyone is reacting to recently
really making great strides in evolving
what Google's visual design aesthetic
should be on iOS well you know when a
judge in Google five years ago there was
no such thing as a common design
language for for a platform and I think
we've made a huge progress over the last
few years and especially on iOS you know
when the users noticed that they read
appreciate the recent redesigns and you
know when we launched Gmail 2-0 when we
launched Maps when we launched YouTube
and YouTube 1.1 and YouTube capture we
got a lot of this positive feedback of
users talking about consistency of
visual language and and Google actually
being able to find its own language for
iOS Google succeeded in creating a host
of mobile apps that all adhere to one
cohesive personality at least for now it
seems to be working if you go back to
like kind of the original iconic
homepage why is it this clean white
surface where do we where do we kind of
take what's great about Google design
and try to express it in many more
places and we wanted to have the same
level of simplicity that Google always
had we worked very closely with John
Wiley search team and we got together in
this giant war room and just churned and
mashed and just you know iterated we
would just kind of go through it
endlessly just debate and look and
create mock-ups and talk about them and
go through that process and then as we
launch these changes to Google as we
launched them to Google products we
wanted to keep up that momentum I'm the
lead for Mobile Maps and I talk with the
people who work on desktop maps but I
also go and we have meetings with the
people who are working on various iOS
maps and we'll just have a very casual
get-together but on a regular basis to
talk about
like we have for each other and things
we've tried and really it's about what's
freshest and best of all the things that
we're working on so everybody can
somewhat selfishly like have that in
their product too we don't have like a
single mastermind designer it's all
about teams iterating together and
talking and sharing information making
sure that at some point we're kind of
ending up in the sweet spot where our
design language is very similar it fits
well into the platform but at the same
time it keeps big Google</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
