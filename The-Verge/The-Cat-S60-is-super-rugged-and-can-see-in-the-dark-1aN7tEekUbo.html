dropping drowning and breaking our
phones so that's why so many of us put
big bulky cases on them to protect them
some companies actually try to beat us
to the bunch and build that rugged
ization right into the phone from the
get-go but unlike a lot of those phones
this new one called the cat s60 has all
that rugged ization and a pretty cool
trick up its sleeve
it's got a thermal camera built right in
first let's talk about how seemingly
indestructible it is you can drop this
thing from up to two meters and you can
even submerge it in under five meters of
water for up to an hour you can use this
thing in pretty extreme temperatures too
as cold as negative 13 degrees
Fahrenheit and all the way up to 131
degrees Fahrenheit now the good thing is
you're not sacrificing a ton of
performance for that rugged ization it's
got a 3,800 milliamp hour battery which
lasts longer than a day three gigs of
ram a Snapdragon 617 processor and 32
gigabytes of storage which can be
extended with a microSD card one of the
only drawbacks is that it only comes
with a 4.7 inch 720p screen which
doesn't really handle colors that well
but you're not buying this phone for the
screen if you're going to buy this phone
you're buying it for the rugged ization
and for the thermal camera now the
thermal camera comes from a company
called FLIR which provides thermal
imaging software and hardware to
everything from formula 1 to the
military now the camera which is on the
back of the phone works just like any
other thermal camera it picks up the
infrared light that's outside the
visible spectrum in any scene and lets
you do things like to measure
temperatures or even see in the dark
now it's VGA resolution so it's not the
best but bullet the company that makes
the phone and FLIR come up with a pretty
clever solution on how to make that
better there's also a standard 13
megapixel camera on the back of the
phone and they use the resolution from
that to add detail to any thermal image
that you take what's really cool about
that technology is you can use it in
real time but what's even better is that
every time you capture a photo clear
software is capturing all that rich data
and so you can always go back to it and
do a bunch of different stuff with it
you can slide your finger back and forth
to see the difference between the
thermal image and the regular image or
you can drag markers onto the scene and
measure the temperature of specific
objects now you might be wondering why
would I need this technology my phone in
the first place and if you're asking
that question then this phone probably
isn't for you I was asking a lot over
the last couple days is I was easy
and as fun as it was to take the
temperature of my dog or make sure that
the cold air from my air conditioner
wasn't just going right out my apartment
window I didn't really have much use for
it and that's because this phone is
really for people who need this
technology in the workplace so
everything from farmers to electricians
to people who are doing home remodeling
it lets you see things like leaky pipes
or a bad electrical job or even let's
park ranger spot wild animals who might
be near them in the middle of the night
and that's part of the reason why this
phone is going to be a little on the
expensive side when it goes on sale
later this summer it's gonna cost about
six hundred dollars and it's only gonna
work on a chain TMC mobile here's the
thing though if you're just curious
about playing around with thermal
imaging in general or you don't want to
give up the phone that you already have
we're actually already sells the
technology that's inside this phone in
another product that attaches to
basically all iPhones and androids and
while this phone is impressively rugged
if you're looking for something that
will withstand your daily clumsiness
you're probably better off with
something like the Samsung Galaxy s7
active which is just about as rugged and
has better specs across the board or you
can always just get a case never gets
