the force and the forces with me
actually I'm just wearing an EEG headset
for the force trainer to hologram
experience so EEG headsets are not
anything new you might have seen them
with cat ears or you're levitating a
ball when you concentrate it's a pretty
well proven neat little trick
what's cute here is that it also works
really well with the Star Wars universe
this is a more advanced version of an
earlier EEG system and you take a tablet
you slide it into this and then it
projects like a hologram down into this
little square gear which actually looks
pretty good for being fairly simple and
then what you do is you just go through
a series of pretty short force awakens
roughly themed experiences so you have
bb-8 and you have to concentrate using
beta brainwaves which are like mild and
concentration to levitate vda then you
unfocus to make them drop in another one
you have to fight kylo Ren for
lightsaber by focusing really hard on
the lightsaber one from the original
trilogy where you're lifting the x-wing
out of died of a swamp so it's pretty
clever and neat for something that's
basically a cute little toy and
surprisingly long I managed to go and
complete the challenge from Padawan to
Jedi Knight now there's another level
called Jedi did I master I think and
it's basically just a very well executed
version of a thing I've seen a lot of
different versions it is $119 but it
supposedly goes for between $80 $120
it's available right now and again it is
called the horse trainer to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
