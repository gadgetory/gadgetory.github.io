and it went pretty well there was maybe
just one glitch here there but we
thought we would tell you about the
three biggest announcements to come out
of tonight's event so Sony came into the
night at a disadvantage against
Microsoft which is that it doesn't
really have any big new games coming out
this fall and it tried to counteract
that in a couple of ways the first big
one was nostalgia it went back and
revived some franchises that fans have
been asking for for years the last
guardian a kind of spiritual successor
to shadow of the colossus we saw a long
look at that game play and looked really
really nice and they are also bringing
back final fantasy 7 with something
called Final Fantasy 7 remake that will
bring that game to play station 4 fans
went absolutely crazy when it was
announced so those announcements were
for the true PlayStation nerds out there
sony also went after the shooter fans
with a couple of exclusive announcements
one was with destiny which has an
upcoming expansion pack PlayStation 4
owners are going to get exclusive access
to gear a multiplayer map and a new
strike and Sony continue that
relationship with Activision by getting
an exclusive with the new call of duty
black ops 3 with some early access to
maps sony also got to show a big chunk
of black ops 3 on stage and sony wrapped
up the show with what I came to see new
gameplay footage from uncharted for the
reason I bought my playstation 4 things
got started with a bit of a glitch when
the live demo didn't work whoever was
playing was unable to get nathan drake
to move but after a quick restart he was
well on his way teaming up with his
friend silly to utterly destroy a
village in their Jeep showing total
disregard for the lives of everyone
present it looked like a good if rather
insensitive time so that's it for a
threes big day of presentations if you
want to see everything you need to know
about Sony's big keynote
over to the verse calm for an article we
posted there or if you want to see the
keynote cut down into bite-sized
portions head to youtube.com forward
