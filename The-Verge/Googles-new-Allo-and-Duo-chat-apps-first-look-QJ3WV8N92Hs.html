headquarters in Mountain View California
we are here once again to get an early
look at some of the stuff that they are
now saying at their biggest developer
conference Google i/o we've got three
products to talk about and the first one
is actually kind of the easiest to
understand it's a straightforward text
messaging app and it's called a low it's
tied to your phone number instead of
being tied to your Google account that
means that anybody with an iPhone or an
Android phone can sign up and start
using this to do text messaging without
having to deal with the rest of Google
if they don't want to it's mobile only
though it'll only work on the phone that
you set it up on now as a text messaging
app it's pretty good it's really
straightforward it's fast it lets you
send messages lets you send emoji unless
you send stickers it also does a few
really neat things so for example if
you're typing on a word and you want to
scream the word you can drag your finger
up on the little send icon and the word
will get in big in dand you can send it
or if you want to whisper a word you can
drag it down it'll send a little tiny
word you can send photos of course
they're full bleed on the screen and you
can even draw on them to annotate them
which is kind of neat so all it all
seems like a really straightforward text
messaging app but this one is special
because this one comes from Google and
it does a bunch of crazy Google stuff in
addition to launching this text
messaging app that's got Google
intelligence in it Google is also
basically rebooting the way that it does
intelligent assistants so you've heard
of Siri you've heard of Cortana you've
heard of Alexa Google's actually been
their first they've had Google now and
Google Voice Search since way back and
it does most of the same stuff that
those other intelligent assistants do
they just have been really bad at
branding it because you say okay Google
instead of talking to a name so the bad
news is they're not giving it a name yet
but the good news is is they are putting
it inside of this chat app and into also
a living room device eventually - so
inside of a low when you want to you can
just talk to Google as one of your
contacts and you can ask it questions
and you can have a conversation with it
so that's all pretty standard chat pod
stuff we've seen it before in messenger
and other apps but what's interesting
about alo is that Google can join a
conversation that you're having with
your friend so say your friend sends you
a picture of a graduation photo then you
can tap an automated reply saying
congratulate
patience because google recognized that
it was a graduation photo which is crazy
and also a little bit creepy but Google
promises that they're not storing the
contents of our chat logs on their
servers or just analyzing them and
throwing them away
Google participates in your
conversations with your friends in other
ways so for example in the demo that
they showed us somebody said do you want
to get Italian food and then one of the
suggested replies was search for Italian
food and then in the conversation it
showed a restaurant that you could go to
you could agree on a time and you can
even book it in open table right there
in the chat now the thing about the
Google assistant inside alo is it's not
quite as like crazy wild west as you
might get on messenger or even in Skype
with Microsoft or even Alexa the Amazon
echo they do work with third-party
developers but it's not everybody can
just jump in and make stuff on this just
yet Google says that's coming so if
you're talking text messaging apps you
probably also want to know about the
data security and Google says that it
encrypts on the wire for standard
conversations and it doesn't store your
stuff on their servers but if you want
to get even more secure you can have an
incognito conversation and that encrypts
it on the wire and also end end so that
the only people that can see your
conversations are you and the person
you're talking to but there's one more
thing there's another standalone app
it's called duo and it is probably the
fastest video chat app I've ever seen so
duo like alo is based on your phone
number so you can use it on iOS or you
can use it on Android but on Android
it's actually really clever if you call
somebody you open up the interface you
just tap the face to call very simple
and straightforward but on the receiving
end they actually see a video of you
live while it's ringing so they can
answer the phone and just immediately
jump into the conversation it's a very
bare-bones interface there's not a whole
lot to it but there is a whole lot under
the hood so Google says they've done a
ton of work to reduce the latency on the
video it uses WebRTC if you want to be a
nerd and it also can seamlessly switch
between Wi-Fi and even relatively crappy
cellular networks without dropping the
connection or in a lot of cases without
even stuttering the video so that's a
low that's due oh and that's Google's
new virtual assistant and all three of
those things work really great and they
work really great together but you know
I don't know if
it's enough hangouts Google's other
messaging app has basically become kind
of a punching bag it's a bit of a joke
and it has nowhere near the number of
users that its competitors have
Messenger is almost a billion whatsapp
is at a billion ten cents got tons of
users and so Google's way way behind and
they're going to need to get a lot of
people to really really want to have
Google in their conversations for this
thing to take off so if you want to give
it a try you should also talk to your
friends because otherwise what's the
point of a chat app</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
