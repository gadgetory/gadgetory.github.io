so much has changed since I took the
stage general are feasible it is my
great pleasure to present the all-new
galaxy note 9 the people who pack a ton
into every moment note lets you do more
that's why we made the screen six point
four inches the largest ever on a note
on the back of the device we centered
the fingerprint scanner below the camera
so it's easier to reach when it comes to
color this year we went big and bold we
also added a flash of color to want to
note users favorite features and one
that I use all the time
screen off memos you shouldn't have to
plan your day around your phone's
battery life that's why we created an
all-day battery the largest ever on a
note you can power through your entire
day with just the phone in your pocket
so note 9 starts at a minimum of 128
gigabytes you can also get a 512 gig
first just like its predecessors note 9
also comes with expandable storage and
get this soon with Samsung's upcoming
512 gig microSD card you'll be able to
get as much as one terabyte of memory we
wanted to make sure note users could
maximize performance we gave note 9 a
cutting edge 10 nanometer processor and
it also supports superfast network
speeds up to a staggering 1 point 2
gigabits per second so you can stream
smoother and download faster to get a
truly great gaming experience on a smart
phone you need a device that packs
s-serious much don't take it from me
let's hear from someone who created one
of the most popular games on the market
today we're going to be launching the
fortnight beta an Android this week and
players with Samsung Galaxy devices are
the first to be invited starting right
now
also gamers who play a fortnight on a
note 9 or tab s4 will also get access to
a special skin
Galaxy and when it comes to games we
know that people want to be able to see
and hear every single detail so note
nine comes with a kg Tunes stereo
speakers the loudest ever on a note for
serious gamers speed is everything when
your processor heats up your gameplay
slows down well note nine comes with our
industry-leading water carbon cooling
system and a smart performance adjuster
algorithm really that just means that
everything's gonna run smoothly even the
most intense gaming session so we
started with one of the most powerful
smartphone cameras in the world and now
we're building on that foundation with
note nines brand new intelligent camera
now we all know when it comes to taking
great pictures some things are always
going to be out of our control well now
when Evernote 9s camera detects a flaw
like closed eyes or image blur it'll
automatically notify you so you can take
another shot before the moments gone
note 9s camera also uses scene
recognition to identify different
subjects like flowers food a variety of
landscapes and then based on the scene
it optimizes the color tones no matter
how powerful your camera is one thing it
can't do is take a picture for you what
if you could take a better photo without
all that hassle here let me show you
what I'm talking about let's get in here
all right
one two three
then I took those photos without even
touching the phone I used this the new S
Pen has some pretty cool new functions
that's because now it supports Bluetooth
Low Energy to turn it into the ultimate
remote control so don't smudge the
screen with my greasy pizza hands but
take your selfie game to the next level
or flip through some slides in Microsoft
PowerPoint well working the room
I've been controlling this presentation
with my s-pen right now we're working
with a handful of partners soon we'll
open up the SDK to everyone to charge
yes pen just put it back in your phone
full charge takes less than a minute and
lasts a whole half-hour even better you
don't have to charge it to use all the
other S Pen features you already know
and love Dex is designed for the work
anywhere generation and now it's simpler
and more convenient than ever because
the only thing needs to start Dex is
this is a single HDMI adapter and now
it's my pleasure to introduce another
device to the Samsung ecosystem our
all-new Samsung Smart Watch the Galaxy
watch is here you can choose between two
different sizes any number of straps and
over 60,000 watch faces the Galaxy watch
has a high res AMOLED display with an
integrated touch function it has
military-grade durability and Corning
Gorilla DX plus glass for added strength
and scratch resistant and it's water
resistant which means it's swim ready it
works perfectly with the new note 9 or
you can use it by itself with standalone
LTE connectivity we're working with
carriers around the world so you can
stay connected no matter where you go
we built low-power architecture and next
generation of panel level package
technology into the processor created
specifically for smartwatches you can
use the Galaxy watch for several days on
a single charge
you can even charge it at the same time
as the note 9 with our new wireless
charger duo the Galaxy watch can monitor
your heart rate and establish a personal
baseline
and what its sense is a big change like
presenting it unpacked can offer you a
breathing God to calm you down you can
choose from 39 different exercises and
it even detects six of the most common
exercises automatically the watch keeps
track of your sleep patterns it can tell
you how long you were asleep and how
much quality rest you got with the new
my a watch face the watch things with my
calendar so I can see when I'm free or
busy it's just a glance we are
continuously refining bespeak so now on
note nine it is more conversational or
personal and useful
