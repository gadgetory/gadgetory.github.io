there can be so many
different kinds of phones,
just a lot of weird choices.
But lately, it seems like
there are really only two choices,
at least in terms of screen size.
There's regular and there's extra large,
which is why I was so excited
to try this phone right here,
the Sony Xperia 1.
I mean, just look at this good tall boy.
It's got a 21:9 aspect ratio,
which makes it relatively
narrow and super, well, tall.
I think it's a fascinating phone,
and it's way nicer than
I expected it to be.
But I don't think it can
really justify its $950 price.
Let me tell you why.
Now, a lot of people would
like to have a big-screened phone,
but they're put off by
how big these phones feel.
And that's the reason I like the Xperia 1.
It has a big screen, there
is no doubt about it.
It's 6.5 inches.
But it's quite a bit narrower
than this OnePlus 7 Pro here.
So you get the benefits of
seeing more stuff on your screen,
like on the web or on Twitter,
without the drawback of
feeling like you have
a big honking glass slab
you can barely wrap your fingers around.
This phone is also really good
if you like to do split-screen apps,
which… I don’t know, I guess
people still do that.
I never do.
Anyway, it's nicer to hold,
but that doesn't make
it a one-handed phone
by any stretch of the imagination.
You're still going to need
to use your second hand
to reach the top of the screen.
Sony has a couple of
software tricks that help
with how tall this phone is,
but neither of them are great.
You can double tap the home button
to make a smaller version of the screen.
Or there's this other thing with...
Er, wow. What are you
doing there, Chuckles?
Huh.
Sorry, let's back up.
Or you're supposed to be able to tap
either side of the screen or swipe on it
to do other stuff.
It's called Side Sense,
and it kind of sucks.
I can never get it to
work when I want it to,
and it pops up all of the time
when I don't want it to.
Now the reason that Sony
says it made this phone
at this weird, tall aspect ratio
is for watching movies,
and Sony says that it
has a 4K HDR OLED screen.
It also has, quote, “professional
level color reproduction.”
So it can be in the DCI-P3 color gamut.
It can also be in the BT.2020 color space
if you care about that.
And it has the D65 white point.
There's this whole “Creator Mode” thing.
Basically, Sony is
trying to make this phone
appeal to people who really
care about video quality,
both watching it and recording it.
But Sony, the thing is,
if you're going to do that,
this screen should get way brighter.
It is way more dim compared
to other OLED screens.
Anyway, yeah, I will say
watching a 21:9 movie
on this phone with its Dolby
stuff, without letterboxing
or weird camera cutouts, is great.
But the truth is that most
of the video that I watch
is not 21:9. It’s stuff on YouTube,
and so I still end up
having big black bars
on the left or the right.
Or, if I expand it full screen,
I end up cutting off people's heads.
Now, I do think this phone is pretty good
from a build quality perspective.
It's got Gorilla Glass and IP68.
It's got some bezels,
but they're not too big,
and it's just nice to hold.
But, you know, of course
there's no headphone jack.
But there's no getting around
how it being this tall
makes it really awkward.
It's so tall, it couldn't
fit in my pocket.
I was sitting down,
and it just slid right out of my pocket
and clattered on the concrete,
which is why there are dings
on the edges of the
phone on our review unit,
which is sad.
The buttons are also awkward.
They're all on the right side of the phone
and, I don’t know, the fingerprint sensor
is separate from the power
button for some reason.
And sometimes it gets a little dirty
and you have to wipe it off
before it will actually work.
I do like that there is
a dedicated camera button.
But overall, when I'm
trying to use this phone,
I just end up hitting the wrong button,
like, all of the time.
On the back, there are
three 12-megapixel cameras.
There's a regular, a 2X
telephoto, and a wide.
Sony put some nice optical
image stabilization
on the main lens, and you know what?
Finally, Sony has made
a phone with a camera
that's pretty good.
It's not quite as good as a Pixel 3
or a OnePlus 7 Pro to my eyes,
but it's finally respectable.
I do wish that the
telephoto was more than 2X,
but the wide angle one, it's really fun.
I kind of love it.
But I don't love Sony's camera software.
The wide angle thing makes you pick
between prioritizing image
quality or distortion.
The auto made doesn't do HDR by default,
and there's just a bunch of other settings
that just really look
and feel kind of silly.
Anyway, let's get into the results
of what I actually get
out of these lenses.
I think that Sony
prefers leaving detail in,
even though that also
leaves in a bunch of noise.
It also doesn't do as
aggressive HDR as I would like
unless you have to, you
know, manually turn it on.
But the thing that did surprise me
is that even though there's
no dedicated night mode,
sometimes it actually
really nails it anyway,
even if it's incredibly dark.
Now, you can shoot 4K, and
that's one of the reasons
this phone exists.
And so Sony also
included a Cinema Pro app
that lets you really dial
in all these manual settings
for shooting 4K video.
Unfortunately, the 8-megapixel camera
on the front is junk.
It's really not good.
I don't know, man.
If this phone didn't cost $950,
I'd probably be a little
bit less nit-picky,
but you know what?
It does.
So I am.
In terms of software and performance,
I actually don't have a ton of complaints.
It's a fairly clean version of Android 9
with just a few bells and whistles.
It has a Snapdragon 855 processor
so it's fast, and there's 6GB of RAM,
which is decent, but not stellar.
I am a little bit grumpy that there's
only one storage option:
128GB of storage.
If you're going to want more,
and especially if you're
going to want to shoot 4K,
you're going to need to expand it.
And you can because there's
a microSD card slot.
Battery life is
average-ish for big phones.
I'm getting over four hours of screen time,
and it's lasting through a day,
but there's only a 3,300mAh battery in here,
and I kind of feel like that's not enough.
I would be happier with that
if there was wireless
charging on this phone.
But no, there's not.
It does do fast charging,
but one neat thing Sony does
is it won't fast-charge
when it knows that you’re charging overnight,
which helps with the overall
life span of the battery,
which means it should last longer,
a year or two for now — 
at least in theory.
Now, after all that,
if you're still interested in this phone,
you should also know
that Sony as a company
has kind of been deemphasizing phones
since it hasn't been
really successful with them
in the past few years.
And that kind of makes sense,
and I also think it makes sense
for Sony to try something new
and move into this niche
of making tall boys,
like this guy right here.
Now, of course, you can spend less money
and get a better phone
like the OnePlus 7 Pro,
but what you can't get is any other phone
in this tall aspect ratio,
so I like the idea of this form factor.
I think that it should exist in
the world of Android phones.
So I'm glad that Sony's
trying to make 21:9 happen.
But I don't know that I'd
recommend this particular phone
to anybody.
If you really, really,
really love the tall screen
or you really love what
Sony does with video,
then maybe.
But there's no getting around the fact
that this is an expensive phone.
For $950, I expect more,
and you should, too.
Hey, thank you for watching.
Do you want a tall phone?
Let me know in the comments below.
Also, if you're wondering if
there are other tall phones,
we did review the Xperia 10 last month.
It's kind of the same idea but cheaper
and also, it's really bad
for a whole other set of reasons.
