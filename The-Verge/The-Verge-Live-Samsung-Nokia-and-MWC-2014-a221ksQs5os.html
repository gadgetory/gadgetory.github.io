david pierce your chris sigler i am
chris 6 it's Ziggler's either Zoey
pretend the e isn't there okay done and
we are here this is the verge live it's
mobile world congress it's the first day
and what just happened is Samsung just
announced kind of in typical Samsung
fashion all of the things oh so before
we're a little late getting started here
because we wanted to get dan seifert
who's actually in barcelona watching
samsung unveil all of the things and we
are going to have Dan tell us things
right now so Dan all of the things what
was your favorite thing that Samsung
just announced not like the most
interesting but your favorite actually
the gear fit that thing is really really
cool yeah yes so I mean was it clear
that this was gonna be cool and exciting
and interesting because that seems to be
the overwhelming reaction from everybody
uh I don't so you know the samsung had
announced the gear 2 and the gear 2 neo
a couple days ago with a press release
but it just kind of drops this gear fit
during this announcement and it is Scott
this like curved AMOLED touchscreen
display and it's seriously the first
time that I've seen a device with a
curved display and actually been excited
about it it's like if Sampson's finally
figured out a place to put this curve
display text and ce4 with not urge we're
here in Barcelona Spain it looks huge is
a huge like I saw it on the the guy's
wrist as he was standing there and like
it's smaller than the gear granted but
is it is it huge not really it's not
it's not really much bigger than
nitrogen source you know three quarters
of an inch by two inches longer or
whatever for the actual unit itself it's
actually really like and really
comfortable of a surprise what's the
deal with via the screen orientation
because I feel like in a backwards right
yeah it's a whole lot like this to do
anything we have aimed away from you
right yeah it's like confusing at first
when I first put it on when I when I
actually use the device I think I put it
on upside down and backwards and I took
it off and clipped it
her so so the way that I found it was
most comfortable to wear it was to have
the display so that if I held my arm out
in front of me I could read it ah so I
guess that's I don't know how to really
describe that but you know I could read
it if I'm just holding my arm out in
front AJ the first glance or the first
inclination was to do it the other way
uh so I think this the band kind of like
directs you to do it the other way but
okay I mean it was comfortable either
way it's just a matter of how you want
to read it yeah fair enough so the I
guess we should talk about the gs5
because that's like the thing right it's
this is probably the most significant
important phone that will be announced
this year it's like this in the iphone
or the two that's it gently matters yes
I guess it's important right well I mean
it's so that's the thing right is this
seems to me to be really not that new or
different or exciting but you've held
the thing so tell me tell me what you
think right so in terms of importance
Samsung made a big point to like say
that they sold 200 billion galaxy s
phones over the years so it's like yeah
it's very important it is you know the
world's largest smartphone makers
flagship smartphone for the year but
you're right it doesn't really look that
much different than the galaxy s4
especially if you're looking at it from
the front when I first saw it I was like
oh they're showing us another galaxy s4
uh because it uses the same exact design
language a very similar size you know
it's very similar but the big difference
is on the back they finally gotten rid
of that glossy nasty slimy plastic and
they've replaced it with this soft touch
dimpled finish which is exactly like the
finish on the original Nexus 7 which you
know actually feels pretty good it
doesn't look great in photos I know a
lot of people have been telling me that
like you know they're seeing it in
photos and it's it's not a they think
it's pretty unattractive in person it's
a little bit better looking uh and i
think the black and the white definitely
look better than the other you know it
really doesn't look good in photos as
the cold one because the gold one looks
horrible and just like deeply upsetting
as a phone is it have you seen it as it
as bad as it seems yeah you know the
gold one is in my favorite I'd say of
the for the gold one is definitely the
ugliest even looks like a indeed like I
yeah I don't know it looks like a name I
guess that's clean kinase shimmers more
I guess so it's
it's kind of like an in between gold and
bronze so it's not like champagne but
it's not like pure gold and it's not
like a full bronze it's like that in
between fair enough I mean I so from the
it seemed to me just watching the stream
that Samsung really doesn't want to talk
about things like software or interface
because they're they've you know they're
famous for screwing that stuff up and
they don't want to they just don't seem
to want to talk about it but was that
what's what's new here it seems like
they've scaled some stuff back but so
you know they did scale some things back
they mentioned uh you know they've got a
revamped settings menu that has like
cleaners of flatter icons and it's a
little easier to navigate and the lock
screen is a little bit cleaner and not
as cluttered as you see but you know
really this is a samsung galaxy phone it
looks like a samsung galaxy phone around
the software it feels like a samsung
galaxy phone in the software it doesn't
feel that much different than say the
galaxy s4 software and so you know
there's been a lot of rumors saying that
you know Google's influence samsung to
change its soft and science but I don't
think we're really seeing it here on the
galaxy s5 okay so what's the vibe like
in that room like the Samsung has this
weird history of doing really horrible
besides events yeah and this one was
kind of simple and straightforward and
what was it either people excited as
straight as as as could be this man is
you know they talked about the devices
they talked about their strategy with
them and there was no theatrics and no
other stuff going on it was kind of like
you know the last of last year's galaxy
s4 event was kind of the peak of their
absurdity with events I guess they had
the Broadway actors come out and do
these skits and vignettes and everything
it is really the labor but you know this
year they they kept it straight to the
products they let the product speak for
themselves I think you know it's a more
effective way to present your products
rather than distract with all this other
stuff going on uh you know they had
probably five or six thousand people in
this room Wow rapt attention to this
event so you know it seemed like they
the people were there to see the
products more for than the Samsung show
okay I mean first of all you're I think
you're giving Samsung way too much
credit when you say that that was the
peak of it last year yeah I have this
odd feeling things are gonna get
better and weirder and I really hope so
but there's got to be like an apple
event right like they just got up there
like let's talk about features well talk
about features with the possible
exception of the 15 minutes of orchestra
at the very beginning which I couldn't
tell if I was intentional or not it
seemed as though maybe they were delayed
a bit so they just told the orchestra to
keep on rolling ladies go baby maybe it
was intentional i'm not sure fair enough
so Dan the the gears that's the other
thing that they this seems to be
something Samsung is really interested
in burying too is like they just I don't
know I get this sense from Samsung that
they're kind of trying to hide a lot of
this and they figured out that pickier
fit is really cool so they want to talk
about that and then the rest of it
they're just kind of glossing over cuz
they're like oh we're gonna sell a ton
of them yes the end well it was you know
I think they didn't sell a ton of the
first gear uh uh and and then it was
like you know it received a lot of
criticism we really disliked it for a
number of reasons and so did a lot of
other other reviewers and it seems like
Samsung actually listened to a lot of
the complaints that were with the
original gear and applied them in the
gear or two you can now change the
band's which you couldn't do on the
first one it's thinner it's lighter it's
way more comfortable on your wrist it
doesn't look as obnoxious you know that
they've done some things with the
interface where it's easier to navigate
it's more responsive they have a home
button now which makes a lot more sense
than the gesture based stuff they were
doing before so to hold on hold up so
this is your I'm just looking at this
video now and it still looks really
really humongous like is it like this
this is the old gear and it's the
largest thing that has ever existed is
the old one is the new one actually but
nicer is it because it's like the pebble
steel right is the one that we look to
as sort of the closest thing to a nice
right sized watch is this anywhere near
that so it's still definitely bigger
than the pebble steel it's it's it's
like thinner and lighter than the first
year which isn't you know hard to do I
guess but it does give you a you know
this bigger full color display that the
pebble steel doesn't have the other
thing they did is they say that they now
get two to three days of battery life
which is like a you know two to three
times longer than they did with the
first gear which was one of the biggest
complaints uh you know we'll have to
test that one yes you
if the if they're able to fulfill these
claims have this performance have this
you know battery life that they say they
have and things like that you know the
gear just became a whole lot more
attractive than it was before I mean you
think you think that this is actually
something people are gonna be interested
in now it was like a funny joke the last
time it seemed like was everybody just
kind of looked at it was like well this
is a thing that Samsung made right it
was it was like it was like Samsung saw
the wire bull market it was like we need
to dive into it and we're just gonna do
a thing and throw it out there I think
this one shows reflects a lot of them
listening to consumer feedback on to
what they actually want in a guy in a
SmartWatch and and you know maybe
they'll be able to fulfill that we still
don't know how much it's going to cost
so there's two versions there's a gear 2
and the gear 2 neo and the neo is kind
of stripped-down they took the camera
off it doesn't quite look as high-end
and it's supposed to come out at a lower
price point but you know we don't really
know how much it's going to cost it
comes out at three hundred dollars like
the first gear then it's it's probably
still dead in the water yeah well at
least in the u.s. I suspect what will
end up happening is will see a number of
carriers either bundle them with devices
or do promotions where they say well if
you buy a note 3 or a gs5 we'll throw in
a you know a gear 2 neo for free yeah
they did that briefly with the neo or
excuse me the the note 3 and the
original gear and I think that's why I
ended up seeing so many gears on the
street is because people caught on to
this one weekend promotion where
everyone bought a note 3 and then they
had this thing on the wrist yeah they
know to do with it fan alright so Dan I
think we're gonna have to let you go but
before we do you got to actually spend
some time with this thing so we're gonna
run this video that you shot yesterday
or today or sometime whenever you shot
it years ago with the galaxy s5 so thank
you Dan and you know stay safe in
Barcelona I guess you can eat some ham
for us he's a ham for it oh I will jam
on hi alright check out this hands-on
with the galaxy s5
this is dan seifert with the verge and
we are here in Barcelona Spain checking
out the Samsung Galaxy s5 this is the
company's latest flagship smartphone it
really looks very similar to the s4 it's
got a very similar design language with
rounded corners metal trim along side
the only major difference with the
hardware here is actually on the back
the back features a new soft touch
finish with a dimpled pattern it really
feels a lot nicer than Samsung's older
glossy finishes it feels very similar to
the note 3 without the leather look but
otherwise it feels pretty much just like
the galaxy s4 in your hand hardware wise
it's a little bit different it's got a
5.1 inch display they got a capacitive
button for multitasking here and a new
fingerprint scanning home button on the
front there on the back it's got a 16
megapixel camera an LED flash and a new
heart rate sensor that uses a your
fingertip to measure your heart rate you
can still take the back cover off to
access the battery SIM card slot it's
got a microSD card slot as well 2800
milliamp hour battery the samsung says
gives twenty percent better battery life
than the galaxy s4 inside the galaxy s5
has a quad-core processor it's 2.5
gigahertz 2 gigabytes of ram it's really
fast and responsive from our brief tests
really no lag that we can particularly
see the interface here is definitely
very familiar to Samsung users there are
some slight differences if you swipe
over from the home screen you can access
the my magazine feature which was
available with a swipe up in the note 3
but otherwise it's a pretty standard
home screen the settings menu looks a
little different the tabs are gone for a
more icon based approach and it is
running Android 4.4 point2 but otherwise
it's definitely a samsung phone it's got
all samsung apps and helpers and things
like that the new thing here is s health
has been greatly improved in addition to
the heart rate sensor on the back it's
got a new exercise coach and pedometer
and things like that and it has the
ability to be expanded with third-party
apps that can tap into an SDK that
Samsung will be releasing soon
the heart rate sensor uses the sensor on
the back here and you just place your
finger tip on it and then it will give
you a reading for your heart rate in
about 5 to 10 seconds you can see my
heart right there Samsung is going to be
releasing the galaxy s5 in a variety of
different colored backs there's blue
black gold and white depending on which
market there get released depends on
which color will be available initially
in the United States we're going to see
the black and white models samsung
doesn't have a pricing announced for the
galaxy s5 vote says that we should
expect it to see on shelves in April so
the galaxy s5 5.1 inch 1080p screen it
has a 2.5 gigahertz processor it has the
newest version of Android it has a heart
rate thing a fingerprint sensor it has
all of the things it seems like Samsung
this time instead of doing lots of crazy
software went for lots of crazy hardware
rights that a good move uh well I think
what they really needed to attack most
of all was the I think they need to
present a fresh industrial design which
they failed to do because we've seen I'm
sort of surprised i would i would have
thought after like the HTC one Samsung's
really good at going back to drawing
board and saying okay somebody beat us
how are we gonna do that or there's the
famous story about the ipad right right
oh yeah i thought they went back to the
drawing board after they saw the ipad 2
was like one millimeter thinner than
their tablet yeah cancel it and
re-released it like two months later so
you know we saw basically the same ID on
the gs3 mgs4 now here we are with the
gs5 which frankly and once you knew what
you were looking for looking at the
front so i'm not sure you'd be able to
tell the difference it really does look
like exactly the same and then like and
said the software is basically the same
yeah so i think this is going to be a
really a particularly tough sell for
existing like gs3 and GS for owners i
will say the fingerprint sensor is kind
of cool like invite vgs for I i I'm with
you I'm not up right here but it but the
fingerprint sensor and especially
because they're doing all the things
that it seems like Apple sort of wanted
to do but hasn't really pulled off which
is right mobile pee everywhere yeah and
you know lock folders and all the stuff
where it's like that makes a lot of
sense like there's the
at mode which is for porn right but it's
also it you know it makes sense that's
actually a really great thing to have on
a phone especially for people who it
makes I would think it would make more
sense on a tablet for people who like
share it with friends and stuff right
most people don't use my phone although
you can see how that would also tie into
like knocks which samsung is pushing
really hard for business customers right
right so um yeah I mean that's that is
just one of the bog standard features
this time of year from now virtually
every smartphone that you see on the
market and the end of the market that
the that the galaxy s5 plays in is going
to have a fingerprint sensor it's just
it's where things are going ya know it's
a it's really true I mean I guess the
the one big thing that everybody said
last year was that the gs4 felt terrible
and I guess they didn't go like above
and beyond and solving that but it
sounds like they may have solved that
and so if nothing else I mean I'm gonna
be less angry at it which a lot crucial
hell as as a member of the public who
actually didn't mind the plastic on the
gs4 um I get that a lot uh let me just
say that I'm not stoked at the gs5 I
don't want like a pleather back on my
phone fair enough um I don't I don't see
why not professional so if they had just
carried over if they're going to
preserve basically all the ID I would
have actually preferred they've carried
over the quote unquote slimy back to but
but they didn't so then either way I
think we can both agree the gold version
is not it doesn't look like a winner
right I'm right yeah I mean you're not
you're not wrong you're not wrong I mean
the the idea of a soft touch gold back
does not appeal to me you don't mind
this article to anything it's just not
not quite what I'm going for yeah yeah
who was it it was so Carl Lewis or
Michael Jones someone some really famous
Olympian his last race war gold Nikes
yeah and it were also yes and that's
what the back of this phone reminds me
of that's not a good way not a good way
okay all right fair enough well so in
other news in weirder news I guess and
probably less relevant to most people
I guess nokia did some stuff today no
you did like so deeply I guess
everything Samsung did as unsurprising
as it was nokia was incredibly
surprising nokia trolled the crap out of
its new owner uh yeah very strange right
yeah i mean we kind of saw this coming
for the past couple weeks but still
right weird yeah so and I think we have
tom warren on the line who has been
covering all of this for us for a
decades at this point i think tom hello
hey MA yes so so what was the what was
the reaction like in in the room when
they started talking about all this
stuff today well I guess they started
off with the Asha stuff first of all so
it's kind of like going through the
motions and stuff and and then they
obviously they didn't like he was weird
that like you look olympus onstage but
he didn't actually say oh this is the
knock your ex he was like we've got this
family or phones and you would caught
the Lumia and they just like showed it
up on screen and then they started like
like going through them through the the
features of stuff so it was it was kind
of like people were trying to figure out
what they were actually doing was the
Android and stuff so it took me a while
to say Android but yeah okay so so run
us through real quick what what it is
they announced so it's it's three phones
right essentially yeah there's the Asha
phones which are you know cheap phones
for the developing world and then there
are these three new nokia X phones to
take us through those a little bit yeah
so there's the X the X plus and the XL
and so the ex is basically a 4-inch
phone wvga resolution it's essentially
it's the same sort of hardware as the
Lumia 520 s it's got low storage no it's
got the same amount of RAM stuff but
it's in a different camera but
essentially it's pretty much the same
sort of thing inside and and then the X
plus like puts the memory up and the
storage up slightly then EXO is like
basically the 5 inch version and is DX
and they basically they're all Android
devices but their android devices in the
sense that nokia has created their own
forked version and they will run android
apps but they will come from a nokia
store it might be from google play and
the message that they were kind of
of saying for other day even when they
mention android on stage every time they
mention android it came like seconds
later was like Microsoft services like
lychee every time who's like it feels
like someone apologizing to their dad it
was like dad sound patterns I'm sorry
but so Tom Tom the official the official
story correct me if I'm wrong is that
the X line slots vaguely nebulous Lee in
between ash and Lumia is that right yeah
yeah and and yet and yet the X starts to
yawn euro tops out at 109 which is crazy
trip it is crazy so many tried what is
the Lumia 520 unsubsidized Tom do you
know I fan I don't know what it goes for
in Euros now but I think when it when it
first day we did was actually like 100
110 120 like around that marks it
definitely is definitely released back
back then like a higher price point but
like it's the same spec so I write
interested to know like if they built
the Lumia 520 today how much they would
cost right they are really useful in
unless they're really splitting hairs
now with the price point i mean i think
the official message is that the ex is
designed to kind of like carve this
little niche between the the very low
end and the Lumia lines with the verge I
don't know yeah I mean I think I think
the way that they they kind of explain
it today is that that like they said
this on several occasions it was like we
want people to get on Microsoft services
and stuff and I think it's kind of like
designed to be a feed of the Vice enter
into the Lumia but I think at the moment
it feels like a weird stopgap and I
think personally that it's it's almost a
reaction to the fact that Windows Phone
hasn't pushed down as far to the low end
and business flexible as perhaps nokia
wanted it to be and because they bet
they definitely worked with Microsoft
and they kind of schooled Microsoft
unlike you know we're making these
phones into like mass volume and we need
to do these tweaks to your OS and I
think I think there's a little bit of
frustration that that didn't happen
sooner because they needed devices to
replace the ones that yeah like the
Symbian devices that they were
they were phasing out and then they just
weren't getting like the sort of volume
that they were used to say so I think it
just feels like a weird stuff that so do
you see this is gonna collide do you see
this is something like a like a warning
shot from Nokia being like hey this is
something we could do because the timing
is all wrong right because they're about
to get bought by microsoft and
presumably then Microsoft we will 80
days yeah you're going to you and
presumably you know Satya Nadella will
be able to exercise his authority and
say nope you don't make android phones
anymore so I don't totally see the point
of doing this like why is no key doing
it and why now yeah I mean I guess I
think I think looking at it it looks
like it's just going to be like an astro
replacement which in that sense it makes
sense but at the moment because the
specs are so aligned with like the sort
of devices that you could do move
windows phone it's kind of in that weird
gap and that old area like it makes
sense if they can push the X down to two
lower devices but like when we when we
paid with it today like opening out is
real slow and like navigating around is
not that great so if they've got some
performance issues there already and it
seems that they've been working on it
for like at least a couple of years so
and Nokia's credit they did also show
today a 45 euro touch screen only Asha
device so they do have some wiggle room
there between the bottom of the acts
line and the top of the astral line
right yeah but i think i think this
knock your ex and and this sort of
strategy is perhaps the reason the
microsoft brought nokia because if your
if your microsoft and your main partner
that's shipping ninety percent of your
windows phones is experimenting on the
low end with android and that's gonna
that's going to freak you out a little
bit right because yes this is a test of
the low end but if they hadn't had done
it in the way that they're doing it with
like tying it to these marks or services
which is clearly like obviously they
can't work together right now but it
seems like there's something weird going
on there like the whole whole mention of
android and it Mike's or services like
it seems like they're just trying to
keep that cool there at the moment but i
think if they'd introduce this without
microsoft buying them i think it would
have been slightly different I don't
know that they would have put the major
focus on Microsoft services put it up
and then if they're expendable
experiment in the low end which is all
that Windows Phone is growing in at the
moment then you know that's just asking
to an alarm microsoft and and in it
could have led to eventually an
experiment in the high n dry right so
yeah I think it's I think Mike's has
pretty got winner this some time ago and
I think it's probably one of the main
reasons that that they they decided they
had to go out and knock nokia because i
don't think they really wanted to be a
phone OEM i think that's how they
started off they were they wanted to to
be like android way across several
partners and stuff and they're
struggling to get the partners although
they did announce the new ones of the
weekend but i don't i just feel like
this was kind of one of the things that
push them over the edge so because they
needed to secure windows phone well so
Tom what's your honest take of these
devices you've used them do they suck as
bad as I suspected you or are they
amazing are they somewhere between tell
me tell me what you think and yeah I
mean they're amazing like you say
they're amazingly bad but they know
they're not like that bad but then
they're not like they're not the device
that you're going to go out and load
whether stock version of Android you
want on there I mean the performance on
them is that that is pretty bad like I
tapped on facebook today and I'd
probably count at about six or seven
seconds until it's diet loading like
actually loading online well if you're
choosing between saying X plus and a
Lumia 520 which would be the better
choice well I think this was 20 * the
moment I mean just because yet
reevaluate your life but I mean I think
the risk it also is that that they're
pushing this is way to like get people
into the market ecosystem which
definitely needs to happen because
everyone's got android devices they're
signing into google accounts where
everyone's got an iphone assigning to
iCloud and almost really signed devices
on Microsoft's accounts and stuff so
like to get that ecosystem buying stuff
then they need they kind of need stuff
like this and but I like the way that I
see is not it's not like a line like
Windows Phone this is not all integrated
in so what's to say that
we're not going to just buy this device
and then just not used one drive for
just use the Android apps that they
actually want to use and it just you
know like people just go the complete
opposite way I there's no Google
services there but I mean who knows what
Google like I don't know if Google would
ever release them outside of their the
GMs servicin stuff but I mean who knows
it's just a it's a really weird device
all right tom we gotta let you go and
because Dan is eating all of your ham in
Barcelona uh but thank you so much for
joining us and that's good we will see
you soon excuse me so the other thing
that happened today was that the other
thing there were a lot of things HTC we
did some nothing's they had some phones
yeah but they're real phones are coming
later in March but the other actual
announcements in terms of like good
phones today was Sony and Sony i think
is sort of a little under the radar
compared to samsung here but i think
yeah may actually have just come out
with a better phone yeah well the same
thing I've been last year right we
actually have a z1 right here and I just
just covered in a finger prints and see
this is recovered and figure completely
covered in your prints but it was
definitely one of the sleeper hits of
2013 universally well reviewed and well
liked but just didn't get the traction
of a gs4 or even an HTC one wasn't on
every US carrier so if they can if they
can right those wrongs with the Z 2
which is what they announced today in
2014 they're off to a good start yeah so
Vlad savov spent some time at the phone
and we have a hands-on so let's check
that out hey guys why would a virtue at
Mobile World Congress
14 in Barcelona and Sony just concluded
its press event here and is shown up its
new generation of Xperia devices for
2014 this is the Xperia z2 success to
the z1 and there's also experienced at
two tablet there isn't much knew about
them in terms of industrial design
queries that you very much looks like
the originals at one however the screen
is now five point two inches it keeps
the same footprint but the screen is
larger and the pretty big upgrade with
the display is a new life color LED IPS
screen so the viewing angles are much
much improved and Sony actually claims
that this is the widest color palette of
any mobile devices this applies for both
experienced tablets at you and you
experience it to smartphone it is very
impressive I've also many they said that
it's even it's an even wider color gamut
than apple's ipad and iphone so that's a
quite cool impressive the camera is
still the same 20.7 megapixel sensor as
we've seen as I said one quite a
powerful camera the sony has added 4k
video recording to it it's saying its
borrowing technology from its handycam
range and it's added some more mented we
added six weeks and such things to video
now which you could have had previously
with just photos also there's a new 120
frames a second slow motion video
recording at 720p resolution that's a
very nice and impressive feature the
sony demonstrated to me and
what happened to have it but that's the
experience said too so it's a pretty
decent upgrade that however relative to
deserve one it's really all about the
display it's your quad core Snapdragon
now it's 801 processor but really isn't
that much of big league and it ships
with Android 4.4 in March now moving on
to the Xperia z2 tablet again it's very
impressive in terms of the display it's
full HD 1920 x 1200 I believe but it's
those live color leds and the IPS is
played a very much the difference
between this in the original Z tablet
from Sony and also the thinnest this is
a six point four millimeters of thin
tablet which makes it one of the
thinnest it's certainly the thinnest
that is waterproof Xperia z2 smartphone
is waterproof as well naturally unlike
the Xperia z2 this is glass on the front
but doesn't have girls on the back it's
actually quite a grippy matte surface
you can have it in black or in white if
it was very good to the touch and it's
extremely thin and light this is thinner
than the ipad air even though it's
pretty much the same size a 10.1 inches
and it's a physically it's a very
impressive device it also has juice from
firing stereo speakers it's something so
many calls escort surround sound and it
has new digital noise canceling
technology which works with bundled
headset which comes with both Xperia z2
and experience a 2 tablet other than
that this also ships with Android 4.4 it
also has a Snapdragon 801 processor
you're on difference really between this
and smartphone is that it has an
8-megapixel camera rather than 20
megapixel one and you have a very start
to so many skit on here it's almost
entirely stock Android it's just little
tweaks such as the quick settings
brightness etc that are customized by
Sony it's still very familiar but really
it's all about the new industrial design
which new Xperia z2 tablet and the new
displays we experience there too and
that's our first look at them here at
Mobile World Congress in Barcelona so I
really think the Xperia z2 not well
named but the z3 is going to be cool but
anyway I think it's it might be the best
phone we've seen so far and loud made a
big deal about the display and that's
awesome but I think the most important
or most interesting thing might be the
4k video recording which I can't decide
if it's just a total gimmick or really
cool I think that it's I mean remember
care I just last month and see yes he
loves well he loves oh ok but he also
said that it's what six years out from
from broad consumerization so I think
that in the short term it's a gimmick
feature I mean it sure it's nice to have
and what we're hearing stories of 4k
phones coming next year yeah but Mr
you're gonna want to play your video
back right from my dear to go right I
love seeing Sony in this challenger
position because I feel like they feel
really forced to make just amazing
phones right now they're not in the the
samsung position of oh we can just phone
it in and do an S 4 plus which is
basically what that's five is they've
they came to the table last year with
just an amazing phone of z1 the z2 by
all appearances even better than I just
hope that it's going to be on the
carriers that matter I hope so too so we
actually have blad vlad savov the one
and only so Vlad here's my question to
you is is the Z to the best phone at mwc
so far hola amigos can you hear me ok
hello yes we can am I Olsen Spanish yeah
I mean your Spanish is fantastic i was
your beer that's what I'm your beard is
amazing your eye it's all true okay um
well what can I say that wasn't in the
hands of video ready so now that you've
seen that way now that you've seen the
z2 and the gs5 I think we have a pretty
good sense of like what these two
companies are doing so what how do you
feel about what Sony's up to now that
you've seen a champ too soon these
juniors
oh man so apart from refreshments
overhead announcements please I do
actually feel that way I do you feel
like the experience that you might just
be the best phone of the show which was
quite up because it was announced that a
incredibly early time here in europe and
middle of the night in the United States
just because I mean first of all is
waterproof samsung got a big round of
applause it's gs5 events for being water
resistant but the sony is waterproof and
it actually does have that cringe-worthy
statement that Samsung made modern glam
look do you feel like I said to as a
modern look while still being waterproof
and that combination is incredibly hard
to achieve in my opinion and the same is
true of desert to tablet these devices
in terms of industrial design I just
amazing the real amazing it is that two
tablet in particular really feels like
the closest thing you've ever seen or
felt to just an interactive screen like
you really feel like it's just the
display that you can interact with
there's no sense of Technology because
it's just that then my only reservation
though I have to say this with the z1
cameras and hopefully deserve to is an
improvement in that front is the focus I
saw somebody taking some photos of the
crowd here the Samsung event what is l1
compact and the focus was struggling it
was going back and forth and he just
wasn't focusing correctly and I knew
that person's pain because I revere that
bone and it's the biggest problem that
Saudi really hazard the book it's just a
few perfections away from really
delivering an amazing phone yeah so
actually I'm curious about the tablet
because it seems to me that Sony's
always kind of half-assed its tablet
strategy it's like well we figured out
how to make this thing at five inches
let's just do the same thing at 10
inches is this like do you get the sense
that this is a real thing that Sony
cares about or is it just sort of a
weird add-on for them to make a phone
and they're like well tablets here's one
I think that's unfair i think from
sony's internal perspective they're
being consistent and like i say to make
this thing six point four millimeters in
thickness and still retain a 6,000
milliamp hour battery and stick in this
new life color LED display that sony has
to me is
just in technical and industrial design
terms and engineering terms is hugely
impressive I still don't find a terribly
good use for ten inch android tablet
that's consistently the issue with these
devices yeah but you're gonna buy any
one of them this is z2 tablet z2 tablet
is absolutely the one okay so why why
aren't we talking more about Sony at
this point I mean it seems like Samsung
has so completely dominated this market
is this enough for Sony to get some
actual play and discussion here or are
they too far out of it like what's what
sort of the vibe on sony versus the
world here at barcelona i think there's
a lot of inertia that goes with this if
you think about sony a decade ago it was
riding high on a success in the 90s and
whatever the company did people gave it
credit get attention and time because it
was Sony and frankly that's Samsung's
position at the moment so Samsung is
being more iterative than sony in
between generations but that doesn't in
fact the attention of the company gets
because it's just so huger than I bring
give so many time is I mean Saudis
biggest flaw with it smartphones what is
it it's displays for a long enormous a
long time it's had pretty terrible
displays far be behind the competition
it's corrupted that in a big way right
here at mwc give so many time give it a
few months give it the next generation I
think the hype start building up around
its products again yeah I mean and they
just continue to splash it with water at
every at every possible no my splash it
that's the point this is where Sony can
make push Sampson can take splashes Sony
could take the whole die yeah that's
true i mean you just you just wrote
sony's marketing campaign is what you
just did wait so I I haven't me to ask
you again about the display because
you're getting me all excited and I just
need to know is it really is it perfect
now like is it every bit as good as the
Sony display it needs to be because this
the z1 is really great except for the
display which is really not great but
you're saying maybe in pletely solve
this problem yes the zoo on display is
garbage it is medio qwerty a few points
below midi
is it it's just not acceptable to me the
viewing angles are terrible this new one
is right up there with the best ones I
am NOT ready to get on board with Sony
to say this is the best color palettes
that sit on a mobile device I feel like
the LG g2 aGC's displays have very
strong competitors in the Android
ecosystem and Apple obviously has its
high devices but it is right up there
that's what someone needs to be it needs
to be up there with the ladies yeah okay
so I don't want to think about Samsung
before we let you go because you
reviewed the galaxy gear for us and had
not exactly favorable things to say so
as someone who has been forced to spend
a lot of time with this thing are you
actually are you impressed with what
they're doing is it better or you are
you excited to review the next one or
are you still staying away excited about
what it didn't Mobile World Congress and
in terms of the gear tues I can't say
that I am but I'm looking at the gift
fit right now and all I can say is if
the gif it is everything that it
promises to be there is no gonna be a
gear free because the gif it looks like
where we need to go how so I think thing
well you look at the gear too they put a
home button on it that is a
smartphone-sized hardware you know
they're trying to cram too much they put
in a camera speaker device's microphone
is now bezel I'm sorry couldn't hear
that sorry I keep going I'm just saying
they're trying to cram way too much with
a gear to the essentially again trying
to do this shrunken down smartphone
thing and if anything android has taught
us it's you can't take a smartphone it
just expanded or blow it up to a tablet
size I don't think you can take Android
or similar experience and then shrink it
down even if its ties in that would to
get to the UI is still pretty much the
same to fit on the other hand I mean to
make a pun on the name it seems like a
much better fit for your wrist no and
back and that curve display is pretty
gorgeous ABS like yeah that's exciting
good yeah i agree i think i hope that
that
being just the keyer and they lose the
name otherwise so Vlad the this is this
is the big day right most of the news or
most of the big news at this point is is
over but there's still several days left
of Mobile World Congress so what what
are you looking forward to and Chris you
know as much about this to anybody to
what should we be looking for and paying
attention to over the next several days
glad you for example I think we're going
to take a look at the new yotaphone
which is that deal display phone with a
color LCD on one side and an ePaper
display on the back they upgrading it
now with two touch screens on both sides
I'm going to see how networking is one
of the screen still inc that's correct
yeah oh cool I mean the premise with the
yotaphone is really if you want to have
an article you have low battery life and
you don't have Samsung's amazing ultra
power saving technology haha this is
taking out the poo on your color display
and then you flip it on to the back onto
the in this way and then you switch off
the power consuming this way and just
read on the ink I mean that sounds
amazing what about you Chris what are
you looking forward to this week I think
that that the remainder of this show is
as much about what isn't announced as
what is we have to pretty significant
mobile announcements coming up here that
weren't at Mobile World Congress and
aren't going to be one being of course
HTC's new flagship widely referred to as
the m8 right and we're expecting that at
their march event it seems like you know
of course a HTC and Samsung and all
these other guys kind of play this chess
match that's on going to make sure that
they're getting sufficient spotlight for
their device and I think that HTC
probably could have shown the phone here
opted not to knowing that the gs5 was
going to be shown it's probably a good
move it was probably a good yeah and of
course the the one was really well
reviewed so seeing what they're going to
do with that next-generation device is
important for them especially since
they're kind of on the ropes and then
the other being
the rumors of this google smartwatch
right Eric Schmidt who has that be
happening this week I don't think so
because Eric Schmidt keynoted Mobile
World Congress for a number of years den
this year in favor of Mark Zuckerberg
who did nothing who did not be just like
stood up there silent for an hour and
then left as far as I'm concerned that's
right yeah flesh is packed and left
right um so I think I suspect that if
Google was going to do something with
that here they would have blown it out
they would have at least had someone on
stage for that keynote so uh we'll see
the rumor is March but of course they
have I out coming up in June as well
right though they're just gonna drop it
at South by Southwest there's cuddle up
with watches on and be like hey guys
South by would actually be a pretty good
place for that when you think about am
all right well thank you glad really
appreciate you joining us and that I
guess about does it for for us this is
this is a big day for mobile stuff we
have lots more coming over the next
several days but for now you can follow
us on Twitter we're at verge I'm Pierce
David for which I am deeply deeply sorry
your Z power for reasons I don't totally
understand Zed power as the Canadian
power you're right ready to say I
apologize thanks to dan seifert and Vlad
savov and tom warren for being here
they're all on Twitter but I don't know
what they are on Twitter so you can find
them there will be back on Thursday with
the verge cast will have lots more of
the news the Virgin Mobile shows that
tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow fingers cross
fingers cross assuming so there's this
joke about Barcelona that their whole
internet is held up by two dsl dsl
routers that duct tape to your san jose
and i think that's very real fair enough
so assuming that connectivity holds up
we'll have lots more coming from them
and that does it for us to thank you so
much for watching and we will see you
soon like
