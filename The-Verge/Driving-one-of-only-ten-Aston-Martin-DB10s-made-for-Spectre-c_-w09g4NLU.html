movie the aston martin db10 even if
you're only casually acquainted with the
half-century old spy series you probably
know that bond and Aston are inseparable
oh and I suppose that's completely
inconspicuous sure there have been a few
famous other double-oh-seven cars in the
middle like Roger Moore's Lotus Esprit
submarine or Pierce Brosnan c3 but it's
really aston that started it all you
might even be able to picture it in your
head right now and impossibly dapper
Sean Connery burning through the British
countryside in a silver db5 casually
popping up in the shift knob with the
object button hidden inside that car is
an icon the db10 looks beautiful it
looks the part of a true Bond car but
can it be as legendary as that DB vive
was I came out to LA to drive it and
find out for myself so Matt tell me
about the DB 10 and what makes it so
different for Aston Martin well I mean
it makes the first big difference of
course it was a car created especially
of a bond which is whilst there have
been a stands in Bond movies before you
prep something one where we've created
the car bespoke just for born so there's
one big difference but it as well as you
see in a movie and people hopefully like
it it lays a foundation for the essence
of that you will see in the next
generation of cars that will come the
db10 gracefully departs from the designs
of the cars made before it present-day
models like the vanquish the Vantage and
the db9 but it still looks uniquely
asked in the face of db10 it was
inspired by a shark face the nose is the
farthest pose point in the car which is
quite an unusual design trait perhaps
gives it a slightly more aggressive look
than you would normally see on an Aston
Martin but very bomb the initial
discussions worse was September last
year and we deliver the first car in
April of this year Wow six months and
that was from a sketch to a final car we
build our cars in a very unique way we
hand make all the sports cars
we don't use robotics and we still use
clay modelling as much as the db10 as a
remade db5 for the modern era it's also
entirely a car of its own
just like Daniel Craig is a very
different bond than Connery was
Connery's car was smooth like the man
himself
Craig's ride is sharp and aggressive and
even though the db10 was custom-made for
Spectre there are only ten in existence
is anybody gonna be able to own one of
these ten db10 was built just for thorne
so just the 10 examples one car will go
to auction it goes without saying that a
real-life bond probably wouldn't be
involved in a high-speed chase with this
car it's not that you couldn't do it
there is a real v8 under that crazy hole
filled hood after all ported from the v8
Vantage but in the extremely unlikely
chance you come to own one you're
probably going to want to take care of
it
I know I would at least but James Bond
might feel differently</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
