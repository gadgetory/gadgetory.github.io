movie the Aston Martin db10 even if
you're only casually acquainted with the
half century old spy series you probably
know that bond and Aston are inseparable
and I suppose that's completely
inconspicuous sure there have been a few
famous other double oh seven cars in the
middle like Roger Moore's lotus esprit
submarine or Pierce Brosnan c3 but it's
really Aston that started it all you
might even be able to picture it in your
head right now and impossibly dapper
Sean Connery burning through the British
countryside in a silver db5 casually
popping up in the shift nap with the
object button hidden inside that car is
an icon the db10 looks beautiful it
looks the part of a true bond car but
can it be as legendary as that DB vibe
was I came out to LA to drive it and
find out for myself so Matt tell me
about the db10 and what makes it so
different for Aston Martin well I mean
it makes the first big different circles
it was a car created especially of a
bond which is whilst there have been a
stands in Valle movies before you prep
something one where we've created the
car bespoke just for born so there's one
big difference but it as well as you see
in a movie and people hopefully likely
it it lays a foundation for the essence
of that you will see in the next
generation cars that will come the db10
gracefully departs from the designs of
the cars made before it present-day
models like the vanquished the Vantage
and the db9 but it still looks uniquely
asked in the face of DV 10 it was
inspired by a shark face the nose is the
farthest point in the car which is quite
an unusual design trait perhaps gives it
a slightly more aggressive look than you
would normally see on an Aston Martin
but very bomb the initial discussions
worse was September last year and we
deliver the first car in april of this
year Wow six months and that was from a
sketch to a final car we build our cars
in a very unique way we hand-make all
the sports cars we don't use robotics
and we still use clay modeling as much
as the db10 as a remade db5 for the
modern era it's also entirely a car of
its own
just like Daniel Craig is a very
different bond than Connery was
Connery's car was smooth like the man
himself Craig's ride is sharp and
aggressive and even though the db10 was
custom-made for Spectre there are only
ten in existence is anybody going to be
able to own one of these 10 bb10 was
built just for bones so just the ten
examples one car will go to auction it
goes without saying that a real-life
bond probably wouldn't be involved in a
high-speed chase with this car not that
you couldn't do it there is a real v8
under that crazy hole filled hood after
all ported from the v8 Vantage but in
the extremely unlikely chance you come
to own one you're probably going to want
to take care of it I know I would at
least but James Bond might feel
differently</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
