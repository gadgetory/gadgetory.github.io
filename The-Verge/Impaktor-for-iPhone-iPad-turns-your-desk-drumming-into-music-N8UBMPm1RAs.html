we're looking at impact or for iOS now
we've seen synth apps in the iOS App
Store before this one has a little bit
of a different kind of innovative input
mechanism what it's doing went in a very
quiet space is actually feeding off the
tabs basically hearing the percussion
sounds and converting it to a digital
instrument so are we have this on table
we're trying to make it a quiet issue so
if we do that we you can kinda see it
based on the volume you get different
sounds it's agnostic of the location
however so provided the audio is about
the same the slam gesture I suppose is
about the same when you open up the app
you're basically given a very simple
looking interface obviously the things
very sensitive it's picking up me
talking right now if you can see that so
you've got the wave forward saying this
is what's being picked up and kind of
what it looks like you've got simple
controls for a volume pan we can change
effects right here delay reverb you've
got six presets for different sounds
this is a deep hole you've also got
middle drone which is tabla big conga
River very very baby sound we got to lay
on turn it down a little bit so you've
got the basic interface and if you want
to get a little more detailed you've got
of course the entire synth wall of
pitches and dials you can kind of change
every little nuance of the audio this is
probably more detail than you ever need
but if you're into that sort of thing
you can definitely definitely dig deep
into the detail of the sound other nice
tricks says you have a sequencer which
you can use to kind of record over
preset sounds or kind of make your own
clearly it's going through a very nice
pre-record option
that off but also what you do is you can
make recordings if we start a live
recording here the other nice thing is
you can audio copy really nice let's say
you want to paste this directly into
GarageBand for iPhone or iPad you can
just do that you copy it you go into
GarageBand you paste it now here's the
catch even if you just sensitivities and
you have a lot of sensitivity adjustment
options read normal right now and it
goes very low grabs very little very
high and of course my voice becomes a
variable you quiet room the other caches
to granade headphones without a
microphone because otherwise it's going
to pick up on the shirt level instead of
say the table itself you need headphones
that will still use the iPhone or iPad
so microphone built-in with the right
conditions however it is a very
compelling product if $4.99 it's not the
cheapest of sent apps but it is fun and
again if the environmental conditions
are right it actually could be pretty uh
pretty effective
