there in Bellotti I noticed a stench for
me just my like just uh like I was
living next to a landfill just that that
that stench of burning rubber or
something just as nasty I had started
coughing and had a lot of flame I would
hear you know asking other soldiers oh
it's just Iraqi Kresser is going to take
a couple of weeks to clear out your
system we thought your body has to
decline the ties it take so many weeks
everybody talks about war doing that to
you but the symptom is just progressed
that's when I started picking up is
something wrong something going on in my
body that I keep getting sick
I always want to be soldiers as I was a
kid I was able to fulfill my goals
I was 17 years of age when I enlisted in
there and the army served six years
active duty and joined the reserves back
sent to the State Police Academy I was a
state trooper 14 years I still remember
I was at a small diner with my dad it
just asked me so any word on you going
Iraq I said there's no dad it's been
been fortunate and not even ten minutes
my phone rang like saying I'm I'm in
Iraq and the Sunday before Thanksgiving
November 2007 I landed there
a lot was a pretty nice place
subway Burger King you know glad I made
actually I had to go to the clinic
because I I developed a real bad call
and I didn't have an erisa Tory
infection and the you know the medic
office I saw oh yeah that's hysterical
cried but I'm like copies I've already
been here for a month
almost longer returned around the 30th
of October 2008 not even two weeks I was
already in the emergency room I think
they had already sent him home from his
job at that point like you can't come
back you need to find an answer to
what's wrong with you because we can't
have you here
just breathe take a deep breath okay
okay take a deep breath
what happened they ended up here
Stephie
a lot of good good good champion player
so he every night laying in bed just
constantly sick
I googled soldiers coming back dying
from Iraq I don't know it just kind of
some phrase that would give me a
connection and just found this community
of people that were all sharing their
stories and we're all going through the
same things we were going through so
that was just a sigh of relief because
it was like we're not alone we're not
crazy it's not in our head there
actually is something going on that
there's an explanation to
hey never burns get down here when they
get a good shot
burn pits were used in Iraq and are
still used in Afghanistan to dispose
they are open-air just what it says pits
into which all of the waste that is
developed or that is produced at a
particular brace are put and then those
wastes are burnt so it's everything from
styrofoam to plastic bottles to
munitions to human waste - in some cases
body parts you name it all put in these
open-air burn pits and then set a fire
and in many cases these were burned pits
that burned 24/7 I mean they never went
out and the thick black cloud of toxins
basically hung over the base
and remember how we got into Iraq you
never forget that Donald Rumsfeld said
that you go to war with the army you
have not the army you want I mean so
there was no thought as best I can tell
to how to deal with the waste in a safe
and responsible way so your choice is
really to bury it or burn it
I mean those those are really the only
two choices and the decision was made to
burn our data established a link for
constrictive bronchiolitis following
service in both Iraq and Afghanistan and
I'm concerned that open pit burning is
one of those causes
constrictive bronchiolitis is a disorder
that affects the small Airways of the
lung and spares the rest of the lung
which is why you probably don't see
changes on chest CT scan and chest x-ray
some of the providers have told them
that there's nothing wrong with them
some of them have told them to
deconditioned it's important to this
group of people that they have someone
who listened to them and it's important
to them that their symptoms are
explained the center is it's a nonprofit
organization founded by my family in
memory of my brother who was a Marine
Corps sergeant Thomas Joseph Sullivan
the initial symptoms of his illness
began while he was in Iraq the treatment
he was offered was primarily
psychological and what he was looking
for was physiological treatment
physiological diagnosis for
physiological symptoms after he died the
primary care physician who was
responsible for his care told us his
family in a meeting that he had believed
and to some extent still believed that
Tom had suffered from a psychosomatic
illness we then learned of course that
all of Tom's symptoms are very similar
we're very similar to the symptoms that
people are getting after breathing in
the toxic fumes and chemicals and burn
pits sand and dust the VA has tracked
over 400,000 nearly half a million
servicemembers
from the post 9/11 era wars who have
medically unexplained physical symptoms
I want to know what causes these
illnesses and now it's not just about
Tom it's about hundreds of thousands of
people potentially who are sick
Michelle Pierce is a fighter she battled
stomach cancer in 2008 and then doctors
discovered another tumor in her lung
it's a cough that never goes away it's a
your your sinuses are burning your eyes
are burning all of a sudden you'll get a
fever so it's returning from home in
July I have suffered from a number of
respiratory problems related to the
exposure when we met that whole
community of people that were having the
same symptoms is when we realized that
we had to open that pathway for them to
that's when God put it in our heart to
to invest our time and our energy and
being the voice for other people kind of
finding somewhere where they can go and
just click and say okay there's doctors
these are health care providers that are
that have researched and discovered the
soul medicine we'll just put that
information there and throw this
information in here and put a registry
together
we developed it as as a platform to show
the VA and DOD that there is a need and
so every day there's an entry on the
registry so the VA can't see that then I
don't know what else to say we would
like to see them step up and say okay
let's take the torch from here and and
do what needs to be done because I don't
have the resources to respond to all of
these thousands of people they need help
in both Afghanistan and Iraq open air
burn pits were widely used at Forward
Operating basis disposing of trash and
other debris was a major challenge
commanders had to find a way to dispose
of waste while concentrating on the
important mission at hand the solution
that was chosen however had serious
risks everybody that went to Iraq and
Afghanistan knew that if they walked off
the base they were exposing themselves
to danger they all knew that I mean
sadly that's a fact or fact of life and
war but the fact that they were exposed
to potentially fatal levels of danger on
their own bases is something that we
that we have to address and we have to
we have to rectify to the greatest
extent we can when we first got involved
in the issue the first thing we looked
at was to get them the burn pits banned
that was number one the second thing we
then went after was to begin to
construct a registry of those who had
been exposed to the burn pits this bill
is a step towards finding the answers we
owe them the legislation will establish
and maintain an open burn pit registry
for those individuals who may have been
exposed during their military service
the
and the Department of Defense have have
really been very slow to assert and that
burn pit exposure has long-term health
implications perhaps the only way
they're going to draw that conclusion is
if they've got some some data that's
that's irrefutable we were going to just
sit back and say okay you're the next
Agent Orange and you need to sit 35
years in the back burner in wait and so
let's see how many people die until that
and then and then we'll get you what you
need we weren't going to do that we want
to work with them in delivering the
right type of registry the right
information the truth
at this point in time we've developed a
questionnaire it'll be a point in time
snapshot of what they were exposed to
what they self-report they're exposed to
what their health concerns are what
their current health conditions are we
would like everyone who deployed to
participate in this registry even if
they today don't have any symptoms or
concerns that way we get the broadest
picture of what people's exposures were
the purpose of this registry is to
register people who have been exposed to
burn pits and airborne hazards this
particular registry asks more questions
about residential history non-military
occupational history current
occupational status there's no question
in here as to what burn pit you were
stationed near we really don't want to
just focus on burn pits burn pits are
obviously something you can see and you
it's very possible you have acute health
effects from the smoke and the gases but
the uncertainty is what the long-term
consequences are from the information we
have the probability is that most
symptoms we resolve after deployment I
think that it's important in a
questionnaire like that that it meet a
some type of standard for occupational
medicine
unfortunately there are a lot of delays
and it may be that the action is going
to be more based on the politics than on
the science it's a step in the right
direction
and I'm delighted that we were able to
get the registry but I will say that
they you know the Department of Defense
I envy a I wish were sort of more
receptive to the notion that we've got a
real serious long-term health problem on
our hands here and that is something
that we've got to deal with the clearest
and most obvious question that's omitted
is a question have have you ever been
diagnosed with constrictive
bronchiolitis we have not seen a large
increase in constrictive bronchiolitis
cases most cases of constrictive
bronchiolitis we've seen in other
aspects in other situations such as lung
transplant there's some cases that are
seen with exposure to flavorings like
such as popcorn flavorings and so we're
not certain exactly what it means or
what dr. Miller has seen the only reason
I can think that those questions would
not would be left out intentionally is
that the VA for some reason does not
want to have that information in its
possession for the past 4 and 1/2 years
I was a senior epidemiologist in the
office of public health at the
Department of Veterans Affairs in
December 2012 I resigned my position in
the u.s. civil service because a serious
ethical ethical concerns that I'm here
to testify about today the office of
public health conducts large studies of
the health of American veterans however
if the studies produce results that do
not support the Office of Public Health
unwritten policy they don't release them
this applies to data regarding adverse
health consequences of environmental
exposures such as burn pits in Iraq and
Afghanistan and toxic exposures in the
Gulf War on the rare occasions when
embarrassing study results our release
data are manipulated to make them
unintelligible we were interested in
inhalational hazards like potential
exposure to burn pits and dust and fumes
and you know I was being told don't look
at the data you know we're not going to
explore the data thoroughly and that
sort of thing
these studies cost tens of millions of
dollar it's us taxpayers fund and what
they were doing was against the interest
of the veterans who participated in the
studies and against the interests of US
veterans in general it was just an
untenable position for me because my
supervisors were doing things that were
greatly unethical I think the VA and the
DoD are very used to having control over
the information and they don't they
don't have control over it
Rosie Torres can do her own registry on
the burn pits 360 website using
Vistaprint and whatever she can put
together and she's going to keep doing
it while the VA spends 1.5 million
dollars or more collecting information
that may never be useful to anyone you
know I don't want to speculate but I
will say that it is I mean look at how
long it's taken to fully recognize the
implications of Agent Orange I mean it
was just what summer of 2011 that a
whole family of conditions were added to
the list of presumptive causes you know
the last one of our troops left left
Vietnam in 1975 and they you know so
whatever that is 36 years that that it
took to get that done now one of the
things that I'm determined isn't going
to happen is it's not going to take 36
years for us to properly deal with those
that we have exposed to burn beds in the
beginning the language that was written
was definitely saying that there's not
an association between the exposure and
the illnesses slowly they're
acknowledging a little that that these
people are not going to go away and that
there needs to be a change but
not not happy with the pace that they're
going at the rate they're going with
with acknowledging all that
acceptance is a huge statement you know
Pat to deal with is just accepting the
fact that I'm not the same person who I
was before the exposure you know we're
hanging that flag up the other day and
it makes him proud and and although
we've been through things with DoD and
VA and to me that's just a price of war
every war has its price
it's like I mentioned before that I
would do it all over again which may
sound crazy but it's just something
that's what is something that's in your
heart and your desire to do it it's like
you do it at all cost I absolutely am
patriotic and till the day I die
I mean I ought to have lag so until they
hang my left leg on my coffin
