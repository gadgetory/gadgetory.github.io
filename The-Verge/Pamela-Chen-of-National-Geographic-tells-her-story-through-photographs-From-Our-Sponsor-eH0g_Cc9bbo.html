producer photographer and I work at
National Geographic I'm very close with
my family and we we were very close
growing up my parents are immigrants
this is taken I think I was around nine
months old and I had destroyed
everything in the in the house and I had
picked up my parents camera and I'm
pointing it the wrong way I really had
no idea then that I would end up holding
a camera the right way three decades
later
that's pretty amazing my father is a
professor of mathematics and so when I
went to college I thought I would be a
math major with a photography minor cuz
I was kind of liked it and then one day
I was taking pictures on the quad and I
didn't know anything I knew nothing
about photography this girl and her
boyfriend were dragging each other down
the quad on skateboard and I picked up
the camera and I like took a picture but
my settings were so wrong that the
picture came out really blurry and that
was kind of the first time I realized
that photography was a way that you
could see the world differently than
what you were seeing with your own eyes
and after that I switched my major to
photography my minor to math and
my whole life changed after that for me
it was very surreal because I had not
ever dreamed of being a journalist but
as soon as I started studying and doing
it it became such a natural fit I love
talking to people I love hearing their
stories I love documenting things and I
love collecting these little details
about life and photography was really a
way to do that I loved being an editor
for me even when I was on the field I
was thinking like I can't wait to get
home and look at these all together on
the screen I can't great to see
everything collected and go through it
all and as an editor for National
Geographic I get to do that every story
has ten thousand to sixty thousand
pictures that come in and it's the
senior picture editors role to play in
following through the whole journey of
the photographer by going through every
frame one of my first assignments at
National Geographic was to do this story
on a new discovery of Mayan remains in
Mexico what they realized was that these
remains had had been untouched for 2,000
years when you do a lot of research on a
story seeing it in real life is kind of
a shock and I think that was definitely
true when I went
today's secret cenotes in Mexico you
never start out thinking that your life
is going to be a project that you
document but once you start looking at
it all together after the years go by
and you look and you realize that you
have so many pictures of one person or
so many pictures of one thing that you
were passionate about then you realize
that everything adds up to something
it's all the little details that add up
to something and that's that's something
beautiful about a photograph it gives
you a chance to collect your memories
I'm having a digital record of that is
really important to me pictures to me
our memories and it's just these
fragments that add up to a greater whole
and I think more than anything
collecting those pictures is something
that
my life
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
