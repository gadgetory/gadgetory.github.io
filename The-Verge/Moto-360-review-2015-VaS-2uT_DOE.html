looking like computers strapped to your
wrist the last years moto 360 bucked
that trend with a round face and
customizable design that was much better
looking than anything that came before
it
but Motorola SmartWatch was far from
perfect yet inconsistent performance
disappointing battery life and a profile
that was still too large for many wrists
now Motorola has launched a second
generation Moto 360 it comes in more
colors smaller sizes and has the ability
to work with both Android and the iPhone
as Motorola crack the SmartWatch code
the most significant thing about the new
Moto 360 which starts at $299 and goes
all the way up to four hundred and
twenty nine dollars is that it's no
longer one size fits all experience you
can get it in large or small men's or
women's complete with a variety of metal
finishes and custom straps all told
Motorola says there are 300 different
options to choose from making the Moto
360 one of the most personalized
smartwatches you can buy the smaller
version which is what I've been testing
is a much more comfortable and better
proportioned watch than last year's
model it has a 42 millimeter instead of
46 millimeter face and the more
traditional strap lugs look a lot nicer
than last year's odds strap mounts those
lugs make it much easier to change
straps too and the included straps have
quick-release pins to do just that the
whole package sits much nicer on my
wrist and looks more like a traditional
wrist watch than ever before for the
actual smart parts of the watch motorola
has upgraded the processor battery life
and display making this year's moto 360
perform much better than last year's
performance is much more reliable and
responsive the LCD displays ever so
slightly sharper and battery life is
greatly improved
I've yet to end the day with less than
30 percent battery even with the ambient
mode on that always displays the time I
still have to charge the battery every
night but it's far better than dying
before my day is even over the new moto
360 still runs Android wear which still
feels a bit like a work in progress
it's best used for quickly checking
notifications without having to pull
your phone at your pocket and it can do
a few things like send messages and
perform Google searches by voice but it
often takes more taps in time to get to
where I want to go with Android wear and
I can't for the life of me understand
why
can clear all of my notifications in one
step Motorola's introduced a couple of
new watch faces this time complete with
tappa bewitch 'it's that display
information such as step count weather
or battery life that makes it easy to
quickly see a forecast or upcoming
appointments short cutting around some
of android wares deficiencies motorola
has also greatly improved the fitness
tracking on the Moto 360 but it's still
not up to pace with the Apple watch
speaking of Apple products you can
actually use the Moto 360 with an iPhone
now if you want but it's not something
I'd really recommend functionality on
the iPhone is very limited compared to
Android and the Apple watch provides a
much better experience for iPhone users
it shouldn't come as a surprise that
something called the Android wear works
best on the Android platform overall the
new Moto 360 is much better than the
original it's got better looks better
ergonomics better performance and better
battery life and nearly $300 to start it
costs a bit more than last year's watch
did when it launched that doesn't seem
like a huge difference especially for a
better device but $300 or more still
feels like a bit much to ask given what
Android wear is actually capable of
right now will the new moto 360 convert
the SmartWatch skeptics probably not a
lot of that responsibility rests on the
shoulders of Google and the Android wear
platform but that doesn't change the
fact that it's a good-looking and
well-functioning SmartWatch that brings
us a little bit closer to the wearable
