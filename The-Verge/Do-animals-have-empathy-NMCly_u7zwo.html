in addition to being adorable
these furry critters are extremely
social and loyal they usually mate for
life which is even rare and rodents than
among human beings in addition they
share parenting responsibilities and
engage in social grooming which
effectively means licking one another
clean but now it looks like they also do
this as a way of comforting friends and
family members offering a rare example
of empathy in the animal kingdom at
least according to a new study in
science in an experiment at Emory
University researchers separated
acquainted voles and gave one of the
pair a mild shock once reunited the
other vole licked their hairy pal or
relative sooner and more frequently than
during control experiments without the
shocks being licked by rodent might not
be particularly soothing to you or me
but it seems to be the whole version of
a comforting pat on the back tellingly
this consoling behavior only tended to
occur among animals already familiar
with one another strangers were left to
comfort themselves the underlying
mechanism for the behavior appears to be
oxytocin a hormone also involved in vole
monogamy adjacent laying among rats
which is to say cuddling and social
bonding between humans including the
horizontal cut the scientists found that
when they block the flow of oxytocin in
prairie voles the consoling behavior
stopped as well empathy has previously
only been documented in a handful of
species including elephants dogs
dolphins and humans on a good day even
some of those conclusions remain
controversial and these findings may
approve so as well the paper out of the
young labs looks very interesting and it
looks like it's very well done and I
think it's a a very nice piece of work
that looks at physiological responses to
specific environmental and social
stimuli I personally wouldn't call it
empathy empathy is a human concept and
it is a concept that is defined by the
way we feel internally it's an internal
state we don't know if what we
experience as empathy is the same thing
that the purpose
experiences I'm okay but the researchers
say that their studies suggest that
empathy is more widespread than
previously believed and offers insights
into the mechanisms driving related
behaviors be they party hugs or
comforting legs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
