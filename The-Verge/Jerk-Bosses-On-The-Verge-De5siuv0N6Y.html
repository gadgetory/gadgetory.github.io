jerks have been fired it's got four
stalls out at Apple Steven stop Sue's
out at Microsoft the thing is that you
kind of need a jerk
if you're gonna make something in this
world you need a leader we need somebody
vision somebody's gonna get angry when
they don't get what they want so we're
out here in New York City to ask people
what kind of boss they want to work for
a jerk or pushover since you're either
work for a jerk or a pushover pajama I
think I'd rather work for the jerk yeah
I would rather work
so as you're either work for a jerk or a
pushover push over push over why I'd
rather work for the better because you
can push a murmur yeah why do you think
it better Boston for severance overdrive
because then I have a little bit more
control in the situation I don't have to
deal with the negative residue what is
negative residues where you just have to
confront someone what I mean I have a
number of residue related questions ask
you to go yeah let it go
what you either work for a jerk or a
pushover tough over oh I guess I'd
rather work for a pushover would you
rather work for a drinker I push over it
sir I'd rather work for a jerk jerk yeah
what's the challenge would you rather
work for a jerk right push up push over
the jerk I don't want to be sexist but
if they don't like you they can make
your life miserable that's why our
that'd be sexist well female ever has
probably working for like I can't say
the name I'm not gonna name names or
anything the worst boss I've ever had
Ray Brown say the name Shannon Brown you
are a jerk if you had to characterize
yourself as a boss which one of you push
up yeah push our more than a jerk
your friends laughing at you we're just
doing some interviews about like the
workplace and like hi oh that's so good
yeah I'm sorry I'm pretty yeah me too
can't believe I have to work this hard
this is just like the worst like it's
like Friday afternoon everyone's doing
home it's super cold and I have to be
out here doing my little song and dance
my jerk boss this is great
I wonder if Josh knows I'm here so what
have we learned today we're going to
although it's no fun most people know
they need to work for the truth they
need somebody with vision leadership
somebody's going to get the job done
give the project off the ground but just
as inevitably the jerks get replaced for
somebody younger somebody more handsome
somebody who's frankly more well-liked
so here's to you Steven Sinofsky here's
to you Scott Forstall and here's to you
Josh Topolsky
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
