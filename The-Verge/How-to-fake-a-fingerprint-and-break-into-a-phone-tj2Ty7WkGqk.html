and today we're going to break into some
phones president of e can see a
biometrics company is coming by his
name's Jason shaken and he's gotten
pretty good at cloning fingerprints
I have abnormally smooth fingerprints as
it turns out one of our video guys Phil
has volunteered we logged in his
fingerprint so he's now recognized as a
user of my phone and we're gonna clone
his fingerprint and then use it to break
into my phone so today we did this with
dental molding and play-doh but there
are a lot of other ways to do it
especially if you already have an image
of someone's fingerprint but you don't
have the actual finger you can 3d print
the mold
instead of using dental mold and then
put play-doh in that and breaking it on
in this case you got my finger
I'm consensually giving you my
fingerprint and I'm participating in the
process but in theory you could do this
to someone without their knowing well
more than in theory in 2014 I think the
Chaos Computer Club of Germany any
challenge and it was a guy named
Starbuck who was the first to be with a
lift of fingerprint off of a bottle of
beer create a mold and then successfully
open up an iPhone and then later on he
did something even more dramatic which
was take some latent photographs of
Germany's Ministry of Defense so I was
able to get the print off of her
fingerprints and then create an image
transfer that to a material and then
make a print and in a public forum he
easy sort of challenged that I can enter
your phone she accepted the challenge
and proved that it was true there are a
lot of readings big fingerprint
databases a lot of which are controlled
by the government if you got a visa to
enter the United States they took your
fingerprint the Department of Justice
Department of Homeland Security the
Department of Defense all have enormous
biometric databases that are collecting
fingerprints at a huge scale even local
police departments and sometimes those
databases leak we saw this with the OPM
hack that leaked a huge number of
federal workers fingerprints onto the
open web if you want to use those
fingerprints to break into someone's
phone you can do it that should make us
a little bit nervous about using
fingerprints as the main way to log into
our phone if your
interested in being the only person who
can access your phone you probably want
to stick to the passcode at this point
there are ways around that we can see
wants to make it higher res imagery that
can't be taken from latent prints can't
be taken from a lot of these databases
and maybe but for the time being if
you've got an image of someone's
fingerprint you can get into their phone
it's like you as a favor
Shiki yeah good uh I can solicit talk
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
