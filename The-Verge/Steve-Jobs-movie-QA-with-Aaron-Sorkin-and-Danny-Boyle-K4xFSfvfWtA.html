much for coming and seeing the film with
us thank you to Aaron and Danny for
being with us this is obviously Aaron
Sorkin and Danny Boyle I mean I have to
tell me I don't shoot for The Verge you
can clap for that if you said so I think
it's it's we all just saw the movie it's
obvious it's very powerful movie it's
very emotional movie I have some
questions here I'm really interested in
the idea of Steve Jobs as a myth so I
don't know how much you guys know about
our site but I was just saying the verge
is all about culture it's not really
about technology technology is the
engine of the culture and what we really
want to do is talk about the people who
helped shape the culture through the
through the devices so here's my first
question and it's it's really for both
of you but I suspect one of it you will
have a more distinct answer you just
made a movie about Steve Jobs that never
once the words Pixar iPhone or cancer
are said out loud and I just wanted time
that's a big bold choice those are three
major plot points in his life and I
think the iPhone in our entire world so
talk about that choice sure I all those
things that you said the things that the
the big things that weren't mentioned
all would come under the umbrella of
this that before I knew what I wanted to
do I knew what I didn't want to do and
that was write a biopic cradle-to-grave
story where we land on the character's
greatest hits along the way and you just
mentioned something surely if you were
doing that movie absolutely that there
would have been Pixar and he would have
been diagnosed and there would have been
the iPhone iPhone the iPod and the
antitrust suit a lot of fight with Bill
Gates a lot of things but I didn't want
to do that that biopic structure is
familiar to audiences and that's not a
good thing I didn't think I'd be able to
shake it it's I just didn't think that
I'd do it well I was trying to see it I
and it it wasn't feeling good to me I'm
most comfortable as a playwright I I
kind of faked my way through movies and
and television shows I've been lucky I
feel lucky I haven't been caught but as
a playwright I like claustrophobic
spaces I like compressed periods of time
preferably with a ticking clock and I
also love being behind the scenes and in
this case we're bombing literally behind
the scenes in some spectacular theaters
in San Francisco Cupertino
so I landed on the structure that you
saw a movie that was made entirely of
three scenes all of them in real time
real time as you know is when 40 minutes
for you in the audience the same as 40
minutes for a character on the screen
all of them taking place backstage in
the moments leading up to a product
launch and I felt after a year year and
a half roughly of spending time talking
to the people closest to Steve including
all of the people who you saw
represented by characters in the movie
with the exception of course of Steve
who passed away already
and a few dozen others that I had
identified a handful of very interesting
conflicts in Steve's life that a human
conflicts with people that I felt we're
dramatic that I could tell a story and
and would illustrate some interesting
things about Steve and kind of
demonstrates some hypotheses that that I
had and that meant that he wasn't going
to die at the end it we we weren't a as
far as Pixar goes I sort of always had
it in the back of my mind it it should
at least be mentioned but every time I
always had it on an index card on a
board somewhere but it never happened
naturally it always felt like if I it
was name-dropping frankly like you know
the guy had to get in because some of
that any promises the iPod he waves his
hand at Scully and it's yes there's
there was a in both cases there was a
reason for it
wha with the iPod with Lisa was you know
I'm gonna put music in your pocket was I
love you
Lisa this is this is how I say it with
Scully it was you know Scully had at the
beginning of the seam accuses him of
killing the Newton for spite
and it was Steve at the end of or almost
at the end of an act in which he'd been
getting his brains beaten in in every
scene saying to this guy you know not
everything I do is because I'm a jerk
and here's the difference between me and
you not saying it in a mean way but
touchpad technology is next not the
stylist okay that's why I killed a
Newman
not because I'm a jerk so there was a
reason for those things I believe me if
I had discovered as you know an
interesting conflict say what John
Lasseter I there would have been a
reason to have Pixar in the movie but
the answer to your question is it's not
a biopic it's it's something else it's
no more a biopic than all the
President's Men is a biopic about Bob
Woodward and Carl Bernstein
it just happens to tell that story in
their life and there's nothing and all
the President's Men that then suggests
that these guys were going to go on to
to do what they did I think it's kind of
funny that Apple just put out an iPad
with the stylus like wow yeah
unfortunate timing for us but or for
them depending on how you look at it
so Danny how did how do you deal with
that with the notion that there's an
element of this movie we presupposes
some knowledge of jobs right it
presupposes the fact that you know
product launches are a big moment now in
our culture and he was the one who led
that it presupposes that you know he's
dead how did you deal with the weight of
kind of the reality and what people know
versus the story you were trying to tell
I think what I loved about the structure
the idea of going behind the three
product launches was exactly that it of
it kind of like sidestep the myth it's a
way of very deftly going all that stuff
you know you know and there was stuff
out there that people you can't resist
but no I know I'm not very very techy
but I knew the stuff about in that you
know and I knew I'd seen the launches
you know because they they made the
national news even in Britain you know
they'd be there and you'd see him so
people are carrying that kind of luggage
and it's a great way a little sidestep
of it because it goes it's one of this
six industries he revolutionized product
launches and we don't see them because
actually it's the 40 minutes he walks on
on stage and you stop and I think that's
a lovely way of encouraging that it's an
abstract the way we did you know the
scheme of it to deal with him isn't it's
not like a biopic it's actually it's
more like an abstract and actually the
that was one of the reasons that we we
didn't want him we didn't want him
slavish ly to look like him to begin
with because we wanted to send that the
the signal very early on to you as you
as you set your brain for it to watch it
that it's clearly not you know a
photographic impersonation full of
mannerisms that he he had and that it is
slightly fictive in that sense although
it's based on lots of facts and and then
Erin's cleared out other facts that were
that don't concern is at the moment so
how did you particular with Michael
Fassbender who looks nothing like Steve
joy I mean like the first act he's like
sexy Steve Jobs but he's like ripped
like Steve Jobs was never raped how did
you kind of manage the tension between
you don't look anything like him but we
want you to talk like him but we also
want you to talk like Aaron Sorkin would
write Steve Jobs how do you kind of
navigate that line it's kind of you know
an actor gets a part and they start to
explore
or because what they find interesting
about it internally that's one of the
wonderful things about actors you can
set them to actually explore it from the
public side of it ie
set about trying to look like him have
prosthetic surgery knock out your front
teeth you know the weird stuff you hear
about you can ask them to do that or you
say don't do that find it internally and
that's what he set off to do and you can
see him in that for it for me it's
really interesting the first act
obviously jobs is fighting the IBM
edifice he's the rebel he wants to smash
it down but in a way Michael was also
grappling with this monster part that
Aaron's written and he's kind of you can
feel his finger it's like punkish kind
of crash away at everything that's
trying to hold him back and then by the
time you get to the third part you can
feel you could feel him as an actor he
kind of got it and he begins to look
like him in a weird way I mean I know
it's been easy because he is the age
then you know he's about the right age
that Michael is but he kind of it was
more the rhythm of it he was suddenly in
it and Ollie and Jeff Daniels who would
always not knows Aaron's work there's a
lot of experience merizan said that's
what it's like you've got a wrestler it
talks of it like an animal you've gotta
get it down control it get on top of it
and then off you go and you can go
anywhere with it then and it looks very
intimidating at first a so much dialogue
but actually it's a liberation when you
when you find yourself on when you got
it it's you can sort of do you hope you
can go anywhere with it so that's
interesting to me because you're talking
about writing you're talking about a
character that's created and that's the
point
III I think another way to answer your
question is you you play the character
in the script don't don't worry about
the real Steve Jobs the real Joanna how
often the real woz and I play the
character in the script so but this is
for example you and Tim Cook have been
speaking around each other for a few
days now you've got mean who did you
talk to you write you talked to Lisa you
talked to was Johnny I yeah I said I
took I talk to everybody you see in the
movie Lisa was
very important to talk to she did not
want to talk to Walter Isaacson when
Walter was writing the book because her
father was still alive and that's
understandable but she was ready to talk
to me so I spent a lot of time with her
everyone you see in the movie John
Sculley also was in in news parlance a
get after John Sculley left Apple he
really barely spoke to anyone and went
down to Florida and lived a very quiet
life this that episode was and still is
just very painful for him is a dramatic
moment that he hadn't quite recovered
from until a few years ago he's in the
70s now he remarried a wonderful woman
named Diane and Diane has kind of made
it her mission to correct the record and
and get John out there in the world
don't get up off the mat and correct the
record because as he says in in the
second act
the story of how and why you left Apple
which is quickly becoming mythologized
is not true so speaking to John Sculley
was important but beyond that yes
Johnny I've Lee Clow just many of the
engineers coders designers at Apple as
well as some people further down the
ladder a great conversation with a woman
whose job it was at one of the launches
iiiiii if I could go back and get my
notes I can tell you which one but I
can't remember now one of the launches
happened to coincide with the five-year
anniversary of another product and so
Steve wanted a slide of a birthday cake
with candles on it up for this launch to
remind the audience that it's the
five-year anniversary of this other
product and this woman's job was to find
the
cake and first went to the the greatest
pastry chefs in all the land uh uh who
each would make her a cake and she would
bring it in for Steve and no no no no no
finally the cake he settled on she went
to a grocery store and like went to the
cake on it like the Entenmann's aisle
and that's the one uh he liked and so
that's where I got they you know the
shark thing from in the sack and I so I
spoke to a lot of people and that was
obviously Walters book was was sort of
the rock on which the church was built
but uh I had read everything else but it
was the first person research it was
talking to these people that really you
know made the engine turn over so this
is but this kind of goes back to this
attention I'm talking about between the
myth and reality like Walters book for
example has been criticized a lot for
some inaccuracies um and you're talking
about setting the record straight with
John Sculley and there's nobody knows
his story so that story is now here but
then there are other parts like the fact
that next was a 14-year project that did
actually have an OS that wasn't designed
to be sold to Apple how do you kind of
reconcile that III reconcile it this way
I know what happen argument with you
about the truth of of next but I Steve
you know Steve here's what we can agree
on I'm sure
Steve's returned to Apple was a result
of Apple buying next buying next because
they had to because next had an OS that
they needed Mille steps in between and
Steve as he was able to do often in his
life was able to look down the road and
see what was going to happen because
Apple wasn't innovating at the time
there was after Scullion before Steve
the CEO was a gil amelio
and Gil Amelio Steve knew that Gil
Amelio was gonna have to answer to Wall
Street and Wall Street was going to want
hard proof that there is going to be a
change
that Gil Amelio was gonna have to say
but look at her new OS that that we've
got it's it's like two great chess
players who never really play until
checkmate they play until 14 moves
before checkmate when one of them is
able to look at the board and say you're
gonna win I that was Steve was the
winner in that game but your question
was how do i reconcile that with facts
yeah right
I reconcile it this way and I know that
the language I'm gonna use sounds like
I'm skating around a problem but I
really believe this there is a
difference between journalism and what I
do and what Danny does and that doesn't
give you a license to lie but the
difference between journalism and what
we do is the same as the difference
between a photograph and a painting and
what we're doing is a painting i those
facts that you're talking about are not
as important in this story as the fact
that Steve was able to climb his way
back to Apple that that car that that
next was the car that drove him there
that you can't really call it a failure
it got him back to Apple that was the
more important truth and the most
important truth in the movie are the
conflicts the the points of friction
that he had with these people and is
what the people in these people in his
life and what they do to illustrate to
bring into relief the man as far as the
man versus the myth that was kind of the
beginning for me that that it's I I was
offered the job of adapting Walters book
just a couple of weeks after Steve died
and when I had witnessed and even though
I've owned all these products everything
I've ever written I've written
Mack I've got an iPhone in my pocket I
still like my iPod I haven't put my
music on my phone because I like the way
the wheel clicks and yeah I agree
I was still astonished at the way that
Steve Jobs was eulogized when he died I
had no idea that the world had this kind
of emotional connection to him when what
they really had was an emotional
connection to his products the way we
didn't really have an emotional
connection to John Lennon we had an
emotional connection to his songs right
and I thought I boy I missed something
that everyone else got and I want to
catch up uh and I want to write about
this I think so I gotta ask Danny
there's another movie that Aaron's
written that is in this lineage right
it's the social network and I look at
the social network and obviously David
Fincher directed it it's dark it's I
actually heard you say in Monday
everyone that movie is always sitting
down and this movie is bright it's
moving its energetic how did you go
about sort of acting in this lineage and
making this sort of painting versus no I
think always free yeah well and the guy
the kind of kingmaker if you like is
Scott Rudin the producer and who
produced a social-networking rang up and
said you know finches dropped out and
would you want to read it I said yeah
I'll read it and because I love social
network and I think Finch is a wonderful
director and also directs for the
enormous it's a compressed energy he has
it's a kind of like mine's more a kind
of open energy but he compresses it in
it and but and I'd loved I read this and
was blown away and it feels like it was
the same I think it's the same film I
never have a problem admitting that
because it is it's basically what these
people who have made such an imprint on
our world have literally made the dent
in the universe
what were they you know what did they
amount to as people as you know they're
one of us because you can all there in
the stratosphere and
of success they're out of sight you know
and that was another reason why it's
good I think that he avoids the later
later products it's because he's just
still within reach really but once that
IMAX launch because it needs achieve so
much of the vision and then and suddenly
the products are super sexy and cool and
you will take them to bed with you I
mean you can't with the iMac because
it's a bit bulky but it's soon that you
as you will all will tonight as we all
will tonight we take one to bed with us
and some of them some of us leave them
leave them on monitoring what we're
doing in bed in the night I mean you
know it's like you know so it's like um
so III III III I jumped at it because it
had a kind of the other thing about it
is different from social network is that
it has he somehow caught this
restlessness of the guy's mind and
that's the movement you get in it
whereas sorting like what's all sitting
down as they kind of strategize and then
when occasionally they get up and
there's a crisis you know when they
actually get out of their seats whereas
this one nobody was in a/c and if they
were in a seat there was a very
particular reason because it's and it's
the restlessness of his mind it's
literally a it's a wonderful clue for a
director you know so I gotta ask we're
out of time so last question here who's
getting the next one is a goober is it
snapchat how do you how do you how do
you carry on this well you know I'll say
Danny keeps first of all I want to say
one thing Danny every time he talks
about what he just talked about in his
typically self-effacing way a more
humble man you're not going to meet
always makes it sound like he was our
second choice Danny Boyle is nope Danny
Boyle is nobody's second choice okay you
know we went to Fincher because we just
done a movie together of course we did
uh Danny's gonna do a sequel to
Trainspotting he's not gonna ask me to
write it
and I think it would be a variant would
be introduced I but but Danny keeps
saying that he believes that this movie
is the second in a trilogy a attack
trilogy while I keep saying that it's
simply a coincidence that that those
that I wrote about detect I could you
write a sequel to this movie I if I were
able to find more conflict out there and
I felt like the audience was able to sit
through another three acts of talking
and especially if I had a chance to work
with Danny in this cast again you better
alright well thank you so much for being
here we're gonna do 30 minutes on the
newsroom outside I asked everybody what
I should ask you know I quote stuck with
a newsroom that's fine but thank you
guys so much for being here thank you
guys for coming and there's drinks
thanks a lot appreciate</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
