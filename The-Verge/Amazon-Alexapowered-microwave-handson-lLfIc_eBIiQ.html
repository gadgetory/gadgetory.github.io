I'm here in Amazon's offices where they
just announced a bunch of new Ecco and
Alexa powered with things and one of the
most interesting things that they've
announced is the new amazonbasics
microwave now this is a basic microwave
it's a 59.99 700 watt 0.7 cubic foot
basic microwave basically the most
standard microwave you can look at but
what they've done is they've added a new
feature to be able to control it with
Alexa so you can see there's a button
right here that says ask Alexa so the
microwave itself is paired to this echo
plus over here so I could do something
like put a potato in there which I've
got push the button and say one potato
and it's automatically you controlled
the microwave to the automatic mode for
the potato you can do this with popcorn
you can do this with defrosting you can
do this with a whole bunch of different
things that you might use a microwave
for you can also stop it with your voice
stop the microwave and there you go now
the other thing that you can do is you
can use your voice directly with the
echo plus without having to touch your
microwave at all so I could say Alexa
microwave one potato and it does the
exact same thing there so we'll stop
that now the way that Amazon was able to
do this is with the new Amazon Connect
module which adds Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
and some of the other things that are
necessary to make it possible for
appliances to talk to Alexa and talk to
the cloud and become smart now Amazon's
using this as a kind of a demo of this
the product and the Amazon connect
feature but you could still buy it it's
60 bucks you can order it today and it
will ship sometime in November but what
the real model here is for when other
appliance makers can easily integrate
Alexa services right into their things
so if it's a washing machine or an oven
or microwave oven or something else like
that it makes it very easy for them to
do that it's pretty interesting it's
pretty wild and it's pretty cool
Alexa what's the weather response</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
