looking at the iPhone 5s it's funny we
just use the 5c and this one just feels
so much better and more premium so in a
lot of ways it's not a huge change from
the iPhone 5 it's about the same size
wave thickness it just feels more or
less about the same there are a couple
of big hardware differences them the
most noticeable one is the home button
it's round
obviously but it's also it's a little
more shallow and it has that fingerprint
reader in it so you can unlock your
phone and pay for things with just your
fingerprint which is pretty great
there's also a new flash on the camera
that flashes both cool and warm so you
get a better white balance on your
photos and otherwise it's really a
relatively similar thing there's some
internal changes there's a new a7
processor a new sensor and lens for the
camera but a lot of what we're getting
here is software obviously it comes in
iOS 7 there's also new colors there's
silver and gold and Space Gray we like
the gold a lot more than we thought
right which is pretty nice so but
otherwise this is roughly the same as
the iPhone 5 just new colors new
software iOS 7 works really great it
seems to be running really smoothly on
here and it looks really nice with the
colors actually super colorful and it
all works pretty well together so that's
the iPhone 5s it's coming out to more
than 200 carriers around the world on
September 20th it's the new flagship
phone and it really just feels like the
iPhone 5 part 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
