this is 90 seconds on the verge while
many seem to be outraged over reports
the NSA may be spying on virtually
everything virtual you do president
obama has responded with the political
equivalent of hakuna matata today the
president stressed the government was
not listening in on phone calls without
a warrant and that the prism data
collection program was not targeted at
us residents see nothing to worry about
of course in this modern hyper-connected
world going offline simply isn't an
option and that's doubly true to the
next xbox in the midst of everything
else last night Microsoft cleared up a
number of questions over the xbox one's
finer points the game console will need
to connect to the internet every 24
hours and even offline games won't work
if you can't be establish a connection
live TV blu rays and dvds will work
without issue however okay it's a bit
complicated but on the bright side
microsoft also says it won't be
recording or uploading any conversations
you have with or near its neck finally
the last poll Val has boarded SS i radio
All Things D reports that apple has
signed a deal with Sony for its planned
streaming music service it seems apple
now has all three of the major record
labels on board this Monday Apple will
be keynoting its annual developer
conference we'll probably see a revamp
iOS we may see i radio who knows well
prism knows they always do that's it for
today's top stories but coming up
tomorrow find out how you can use a top
secret electronic surveillance program
to find the love of your life</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
