kind of a meme on the internet there are
there are animated gifs of you or gifs
depending on who you talk to
there you become like a guy who appears
completely out of context how does that
make you feel
initially it was really weird and creepy
because my image
would just be the fodder for artists to
distort at their leisure mm-hmm the
Internet yes and so and so initially I
was I was I was creeped out by it and
then I said well this in total is a
celebration so I should not object
celebration of the sexiest
astrophysicist
oh you know they do that with with other
people's images and so what it meant was
that my image became more than just me
it became something to play with it'll
live on live on and so I'm okay with it
that's a little weird and creepy but I'm
okay with it
it's it's very likely that that even in
the moments just before the Sun burns
out someone will load up a page of
comments on the internet and there will
be a guy there they don't know who the
guy is probably because you're out of
context along completely and you'll be
you'll be reacting to something there's
one wit excitedly
there's just there's a there's a cutout
figure with me in underwear and you put
a different vest of mine on top of it
yeah
how's Macbeth so it's like you know the
paper dolls
so can I can you just give me that you
are I need to go to that right boxer
shorts and you just put on the clothing
you dress me in paper dolls I love the
sounds of that
so you're but you're cool with it now
you're now on are creeped out by being
too mean what what's weird is the one
where if I don't if you know doing
there's one where I'm doing this and the
caption is okay could you get that again
that was like a real that was like the
animated gif coming to life that's why
just one more time it mean please yes so
that's a day of it so yeah it's
completely out greedy because that was a
that was like a Fame from an interview
where I am praising Isaac Newton listen
right so I'm listing all the great
things he did he discovered law of
gravity universal law of gravity and
laws of optics and and and laws of
motion and and he had some trouble with
his gravity so he invented calculus to
figure out that problem and then he did
all of that by the time he turned 26 so
so I was saying he's my man he's my man
I think the smartest guy that ever lived
and so I said so then i gestured i said
the guy is good you know this like you
can't argue with isaac newton and that
becomes you got a badass over here I
don't I I gotta say I gotta say
something what you were just saying
fascinating informative gripping but all
I could think while you were saying it
was every frame of this is going to be
turned into a new he</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
