and I'm here in Seattle at Amazon's
offices where they've just announced a
ton of new products for the holiday
season there's so many products they're
all on the verge calm I don't know if I
can remember them all but one of the
biggest new products is a new update to
the echo show now this is Amazon's
scream product that kind of is like if
you had an echo and had a screen at the
same time and all the different things
that you could do with that
now they release an echo show about a
little over a year ago now and so this
is their second version and some of the
things that they've added to this are
pretty important the first and most
obvious thing is it's got a way bigger
screen this is now a 10 inch HD display
as opposed to the 7 inch screen before
it also has a new refined design it's
kind of still got that little wedge
shape going on but on the back here you
can see it's got this nice fabric finish
as opposed to the plastic that was
before it's really quite nice looking it
comes in both white or black and then
what they've really done as well is
really upgraded the audio quality out of
this you've got to side firing speakers
in the back and then a passive radiator
for bass so when you're listening to
music or watching TV or watching a video
on this you can get a lot better quality
of sound then you could with the
original echo show now you can also
still do the same types of things with
like video chat you can drop in and call
other echo shows or echo products or
echo or Amazon Alexa apps on mobile
devices and things like that and they've
updated a ton of the user interactions
and software on this including things
like adding a browser so now if I say
Alexa open silk
and if my voice doesn't crack Alexa open
silk so just like the fire TV
it's got Amazon silk browser as well as
the Firefox browser available and then
you can browse things like YouTube so
you can watch youtube videos on your
echo show which has been kind of a
difficult thing to do in the past you
can also of course browse to any other
website you want you just type in
address to the website that you want and
hit go and you're good to go
so that's really nice thing to add it's
one of the things I'm missing from the
echo show is ability to watch youtube
videos of course you can also watch all
of the Amazons fire or excuse me Amazon
Prime video content on here as well as
things like from Hulu and other
over-the-top video services it also
integrates with a bunch of other new
products that Amazon announced like a
PVR that pulls in OTA signals from the
air and allows you to record them and
then you can watch them on your echo
show now that's the echo show this is
gonna be two hundred and twenty nine
dollars it's the same price as the prior
model believe it's available for order
real soon is gonna be shipping next
month but that's only one of the many
things that you've got here so we've
added a lot of other stuff to look at
too so in addition to the new echo show
there's also a neat echo dot and it
looks like this and you can see that
compared to the old echo dot which is
Amazon's most popular echo device you
see the new echo dot it's quite a bit
larger it's got a little bit more
rounded of a design it's got a fabric
finish it's really nice-looking but the
big difference here is sound quality
Amazon says that it's got a much larger
speaker inside and it's got a more
powerful output and you can really hear
the difference if you ask you simple
things like Alexa what's the weather
currently in Seattle it's 57 degrees
Farenheit with cloudy skies you can
expect more of the same today with a
high of 63 degrees in the look so even
like voice responses like that sounds so
much better on this echo dot than the
prior one and of course if you're
listening to music it sounds even better
than that so I can do something like
Alexa play Drake
shuffling songs by Drake on Amazon music
so it sounds a lot better that's obvious
Alexis stop but the other thing is that
you're not losing anything from this
echo dot to the if you're upgrading from
the old one you still have the ability
to output to even larger speakers with a
3.5 millimeter headphone jack you can
still Bluetooth pair this to a bigger
speaker if you want and it's got four
microphones instead of the seven that
the old model had which might make a
difference in how well it's able to hear
you from across the room but we've seen
a bunch of products that like the Google
home that only have two microphones
they're able to hear you pretty well so
that's probably too much of a not too
much of a concern and then of course now
if you really want to go nuts with your
sound you can pair two of these in a
stereo setup and you can have twice as
much sound and with left and right
channels and you can add the new echo
subwoofer to them so you can have an
actual 2.1 surround sound or a 2.1 sound
system with just a couple of echo dots
now just like the echo show this is
gonna be available for pre-order today
maybe shipping next month its $49.99 so
it's the same price as before this is
looking pretty cool so then the third
new echo product that Amazon is coming
out with is a new echo plus now this is
an update to the echo plus that was
released last year the most obvious
thing different with it it's got a new
design it's squatter it's more rounded
it kind of looks like the standard echo
now it's got this nice fabric cover but
importantly it also has much improved
sound it's got a larger more powerful
speaker in there so it provides better
volume and bass out of the unit itself
just like the other echo dot and the
other echo devices you can pair two of
these together in stereo now and you can
add the echo so now because this is an
echo plus it still has the smart home
integration into it so it ships with a
light bulb that you can instantly set up
just with your voice which is really
easy and cool and then it also has a
temperature sensor inside of it so you
can read the temperature of an exact
room Alexa what's the temperature in
here inside it's sixty seven point six
and you can also set Alexa routines
based on the temperature so if it gets
too cold you can kick on a space heater
or if it's too hot turn on an air
conditioner something like that now the
new echo plus is gonna be available for
one 49.99 s available to order today to
shipping next month just like all the
rest of the
and it looks like a pretty decent
upgrade to the existing echo plus but
you've heard me talk a lot about the
echo sub and with these other products
and here it is this is the echo sub you
compare this with any echo device
whether it's a dot or an echo plus we're
gonna go show and you can add better
lower frequencies response it's pretty
big device obviously something to keep
on the floor it sells for one $29.99 you
can order it starting today
be shipping next month but that's not
the only home audio products that Amazon
is out there's actually a bunch more
especially if you have existing home
stereo equipment and speakers and here
we've got the echo link amp the echo
link and the echo input then the echo
link amp is ideal if you have non
powered passive speakers you can plug
them into the back here and then it has
a 60 watt Class D amplifier inside of it
so you can integrate those speakers with
your whole home audio smart system the
echo link is pretty simple it just is
basically the same thing without the
amplifier this sells for $2.99 this
sells for $1.99 and then the echo input
which is basically like very similar to
the chromecast Audio from Google you
plug it directly into your sound system
this does have microphones on it so you
can add voice control directly to that
it's kind of like using us a little bit
similar idea to have a lot of people use
the echo dot now but in a smaller
package and that's available for $34.99
did we get it so that was a ton of stuff
but it's really only the tip of the
iceberg of what Amazon has announced
today there's a ton of other new
products and services coming out all
tied to Alexa and all tied to the Ecco
brand be sure to check out the site the
verge comm for all the more information
on that and we're gonna have more videos
for you so stay tuned on youtube.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
