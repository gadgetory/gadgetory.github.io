Lee car and they say that laughter is
the best medicine but this kolding
getting any better I've been reading The
Drudge Report all week long this is 90
seconds on the verge the script for the
Fifth Estate the new film about
WikiLeaks has been leaked by WikiLeaks
itself WikiLeaks posted the full script
online as well as its own review of the
film calling an irresponsible bias and
misleading WikiLeaks says the film quote
invents or shapes the facts to fit its
narrative goals and if you found
WikiLeaks review as a Fifth Estate rough
just wait until you read their review of
lee daniels the butler and grand theft
auto 5 you can steal a lot of virtual
money but none of that compares to the
real money the game is made the latest
entry in the iconic video game series
made eight hundred million dollars on
its first day alone GTA 5 could go on to
the fastest game to hit the billion
dollar mark a record currently held by
call of duty black ops 2 which reached
it in only 15 days and to think they
made all that money without shrinking
any drug dealers and finally I sure hope
you like monsters University because
it's gonna be a long time before you see
another Pixar film Pixar has announced
it's delaying the release of its next
feature the good dinosaur to November
2015 over a year later than originally
planned the studio is also delaying
finding Dory is finding nemo sequel by a
year to june 2016 your next taste in
Pixar will be inside out which is due
jun 2015 and that's it for today's top
stories coming up tomorrow sir elton
