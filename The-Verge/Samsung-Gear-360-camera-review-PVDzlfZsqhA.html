images and videos a lot in the last
couple decades first there is a shift
from film to digital then there is
things like 3d and 4k and now virtual
reality's here so companies are starting
to take the tech that makes that
possible and put it into cameras like
this gear 360 from Samsung stuff that
you and I can use now lets us capture
360 degree videos and photos this is
actually a 360 degree video right now
you can click and drag around your video
player or take your phone and move it
around or even put your phone in a VR
headset like a gear VR or a Google
cardboard and view it that way
now Samsung's camera is not the first
one on the market that does this but
it's definitely one of the easiest and
it's probably one of the best at least
for now so what makes it so good it's
dead simple to use we've ever used
something like a GoPro or anything like
it it's as easy if not easier than that
it has just three buttons a power button
a menu button and a record button and
that's basically all you need to know it
captures pretty good quality video to
the time when most of the other
competitors on the market are still only
shooting 1080p this capture is just
about 4k which looks pretty good on
browsers and decent in headsets it uses
two lenses one on each side and they're
tied to 15 megapixel sensors so you can
capture a 30 megapixel still or 38 40 by
1920 video now that's not 4k in the same
way that we think about it with regular
video because here those pixels are
spread around this whole sphere as
opposed to just confined to a little box
but that's a good thing for now because
it cuts down on file size and makes it
easier to share the stuff that you shoot
with the gear 360 and it is really easy
to share footage that you shoot with
this camera because Samsung built
Facebook and YouTube integration right
into the app that it comes with so all
you have to do is take the file from
your camera put it on your phone and
post it you don't have to mess with any
advanced editing programs or anything
like that if you don't want to but it
does bring us to one of the first big
problems with this cam
and it's that if you shoot anything
longer than two or three minutes you can
take a long time sometimes 1020 minutes
to transfer that file from the camera to
your phone and then on top of that you
have to wait for the phone to stitch the
two images together that the camera is
actually capturing which brings us to
the next problem which is that stitching
can sometimes be pretty imperfect you
can probably see it now it's sort of
splitting me in half now if you can get
around this if you keep the camera kind
of farther away from your subjects but
you really want to have this camera in
the middle of whatever you're shooting
which brings us to another problem with
this camera and it's that it's splash
proof and it's dust proof it's not
rugged in any sort of way and Samsung
right now doesn't sell any cases to
protect it I mean I have this thing for
maybe two weeks to play around with and
I already ding the lens pretty bad here
and that was just because it got knocked
over on the ground at a dog park it's
something that they have to work on and
probably will in future generations but
you really have to treat this thing with
kid gloves and it doesn't make it easy
to shoot really compelling stuff with
this camera there are a couple other
issues of this camera too like it's not
really that good in low-light the tripod
that Samsung ships with it is really
kind of a joke and you really need a
newer Samsung smartphone just to use it
in the first place but this is a first
generation product so I'm hoping that
Samsung will iron out a lot of these
issues by the next version or the one
after that and they better there's a lot
of competition coming into this space
from big companies like GoPro and Nikon
what that means for the version of the
gear 360 that you can buy right now is
it's really more of Samsung's way of
helping us answer the question of what
even is a good 360 degree video in the
first place so if you want to start
playing around with 360 degree video and
answering these questions for yourself
this is probably the best camera you can
buy to do that it's just not going to be
that way for long thank you guys so much
for watching if you liked the video give
us a thumbs up and head down to the
comments and tell us what else we should
shoot and 360 degrees and if you're not
