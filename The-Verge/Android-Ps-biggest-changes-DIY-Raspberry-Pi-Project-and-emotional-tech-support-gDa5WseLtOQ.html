live a gadget show I'm your lab patel
I'm the editor of The Verge it's Paul
Miller we're here again it's happening
to you one more time I'm is here you
actually have a huge show today we've
got a bunch of crazy Android phones from
China all the flagships including me mix
- what you can't buy here straight and
check that out we've got a great ass
circuit breaker about the future of
Google real interesting the last segment
of the show I'm super excited about or
bring her back emotional tech support
yeah so we're we probably can't help you
with your tech problems but Ashley's
gonna be here and you can call us for
that number up it's one eight four four
four emotion and we'll just be there
with you commiserate with you I think
mostly yeah so start calling that's the
last segment of the show we're gonna get
to it for a little bit but call one
eight four four four motion will do it
emotional export but we're gonna start
with hime and Android P you've got it
loaded this is what a first gen pixel is
the first gen pixel we have the first
early Developer Preview which launched
last week it's loaded on here it's a
very early preview if you're not a
developer and you don't have like a
spare device installed on don't don't
install this on your main phone one well
there's nothing cool enough on here
that's worth the hassle and - it's
really unstable I just like that there's
a notch on this phone right now so yeah
that is one of the big things you can do
is is simulate a knotch no longer no
longer do you have to use an Android
device or like a piece of black tape yes
so at MWC which was couple weeks ago we
saw a whole bunch of new phones
I think Vlad wrote Oracle for us bad
iPhone nachos are happening - good
Android phones because the software so
far it's not ready for notches so there
was nothing Apple with the notch the
hoard remain defied the hardware
manufacturers are having Apple but
Android is just like a mess because of
these Android P is going to make Android
ready for the notch so you can actually
see if you if you add the notch or take
it away it'll actually change how big
this this bar is on top Android will be
able to dynamically adjust itself for
not
Chiz there's some other UI stuff the
clock is moved over to the top left from
the top right where it used to be
it handles notifications differently
instead of getting this nice you know
string of icons going across it'll only
display for right but yeah notches will
work better so the whole point of this
is not that Android well automatically
because you can see it's just a
sophomore
yeah this is this is a source for
developers we're gonna build for Android
P mm-hmm so they can simulate a notch to
see how their apps are gonna exactly
okay because right now the only things
that run the Android preview are pixels
and pixels don't have notches and if you
want to test Android P on a hardware
device with a notch you need to do this
it's horrible yeah the other new thing
is you can change the look of that not
yeah you can see it's red phones have
all kinds of
a s--t on you know I want to get ten
minutes of solid sim not simulation Bob
simulation because we do a live show
this is why this is a live show right
yeah you can actually not only choose in
developer oh yeah this isn't developer
options this right now dad is just
trying to guess what the P is gonna
stand for my money is on unpossible
personally absolutely look at this look
at these actual different yeah options
you guys you know this is like your
essential phone
there's mirror display cutout Paul
display cutout wide display cut up
that's what they're calling yes like
you're building an app gonna look like
an essential phone yeah just like ruin
your own phone a little bit yeah yes you
want to make sure that you're avoiding
putting you know any crucial UI stuff up
there yeah we have a peppermint guess
here peppermints not bad yeah there are
a lot more options with P than with it
Oh like when we were doing the Oh
guessing or just scraping the bottom of
the barrel it's like Google's either
paying Oreo or or nothin peas for
possibilities so we also have some hints
of what might be some new UI so if you
look closely the dock the dock actually
looks a little different there's some
rounded corners over here the color is a
little different to make it send out
more
the notification menu is very different
that's very Apple it's very Apple so is
this this you want to see is these very
Apple rounded notification Wow and then
you can kind of tap on them exactly and
this is very similar that's why look I'm
all in favor of that like that pull down
the quick reply is a great idea on the
iPhone yeah is this is this the pixel
version of Android that we're looking at
or like the stock Android because the
sixel version is has diverged from what
I think of a stock into it so we don't
we also don't know because the only
devices that people review can run on
our pixels so it could just be that this
where the pixel one looks like it could
be that none of this is coming to any
other versions it could just be that
this is early stuff in Google hasn't
decided it could be that there's a
massive white rounded bubble overhaul of
you know Android P and Google isn't
ready to show that off yet yeah and
there's a bunch of security stuff on so
the biggest thing on the security side
is that Google's revoking the ability of
apps that are no longer maps that are
idle so have access to the Mike in
camera which is basically if you're
someone who believes that Facebook is
secretly listening to you and spying on
all your conversations go back and forth
of it lately ah yes so this should
hopefully squish that rumor once and for
all and then you buy a Google mini and
that's right all right so that's and
repeat super-early of android pee yeah
you can like hime said you can get it
right now and put it on a pixel if you
have one but you shouldn't don't you on
the primary there's a long list of
changes there like API changes so they
have something that a developer can call
from Google's software to enhance their
apps yes they're absolute when they
launch P there's a bunch of you know
yeah for all the phones that will run
Android P when it launches oh yeah real
P theme show P theme chef tomorrow is pi
day tomorrow is routine so in honor of
that we have a Raspberry Pi so and I
will say this to the audience they won't
tell me what's about to happen
I was made to leave the room during
rehearsal I was not shown the rundown I
don't know what time is about to do and
I'm very excited so we have here I can't
talk enough so we're like we won't we I
basically want people to understand what
is so cool about the Raspberry Pi and I
think it can be a little intimidating
for people because they see exposed
circuitry and like well that's not for
me but it's a $35 Linux computer that
you can do cool hardware projects so
we're like what's a cool hardware
project we sit right next to Ashley
Carmen who has a wonderful podcast
called why'd you push that button so we
made a why'd you push that button button
okay what is it does it entice you to
push the button well yeah well you're
about to see all right all right
basically if everything goes according
to plan you will push this button and
you will hear the word
why everything sounds good according to
play do you learn a lot about the
Raspberry Pi in the probably it will
light on fire and kill us all
yes that's it so let's just walk through
what we have here first of all Raspberry
Pi Linux computer everything's just kind
of running off this tiny micro SD card
it's the whole operating system so when
you buy a pie it's like $35 or like you
get a kit for a little bit more so you
can get a case and stuff and it will
come typically with an SD card that has
Linux pre-installed so you all you do is
you literally plug it into USB power
boots on ice and keyboard plug in HDMI
plug in mouse and keyboard you have a
completely working Wow so this is the
generation shoe but for the purpose of
what we're doing yeah that's one beauty
of this is that for the purposes it can
handle really low low power tasks really
well so if you're just looking for like
a computer to live in a hardware project
it's great for that yeah so like some of
the DIY circuit breaker stuff that we've
done like when we bought the smart
mirror or the photobooth those are all
living off a Raspberry Pi because it's a
great cheap way to get it's a computer
yeah that can run you know advance code
without necessarily needing to you know
spend hundreds of dollars on building a
small Windows computer and if you want a
really simple computer there's the PI
zero this is what I built my wearable
computer out of PI zero is a slower
processor like smaller and
or plugs but it's a very similar concept
but what makes the pie different than
your average computer is these pins
which I will be honest with you I've
found very intimidating and never really
did anything with until I'm taught me
about those can you explain these pins
these are the GPIO pins so these are
input and output pins that you can use
to easily hook up different hardware
devices to a PI and combined with the
fact that the PI runs open-source
software makes it very easy to quickly
add new hardware PI and new hardware
accessories and configure software to do
stuff with them so like when we built
our own DIY Amazon echo we plugged in a
mic and light relay that was able to
just add you know super good beamforming
microphones to the PI and the light ring
for the you know Alexa part so today
we're actually gonna plug in this giant
red button so there's two parts of this
button so these two pins on the side are
for the LED that'll make it light up and
then the these are for input outputs so
we're gonna hook up this over here to
this is gonna go to power if you're
doing this at home you'll note that we
just have a bunch of exposed wires here
sure you don't do that you've crossed
two of the Y if you're doing this at
home you should get proper clips they
make them that live so that when we do
kill herself so we're plugging in 2
actually we're plugging in this one's
going to power and then this other this
blue wire is going to grounds to
complete the circuit at one simple way
to think of it as the pike is wired up
so that you can like tell the PI hey
complete this circuit between these two
bands okay or the PI could be like hey
tell me if this circuit is completed
between these two pins I am just making
a face alright should have turned on it
didn't so I'm actually going to duck
under here and consult my hand
we could show this we don't have to be
secretive okay so this is this is the
pin this is the diagram so this shows
what all the pins do there's obviously a
lot of things here what are you looking
for right now I'm just making sure that
this is hooked up so this should be
hooked up to power and it's not because
it's souped up the ground move
everything over administering rehearsal
to and I promised I was not gonna make
that mistake why there's like the bomb
there's a lot of fun tiny computers and
you know what you're doing there I write
all right so you can see yeah this is so
we found this pie in Paul's desk it is a
little broken that sounds like something
if you nudge the power cable it
immediately reboots most raspberry PI's
don't do that but ours ours is special
like this is like maximum pressure
situation all right so now we're gonna
show is for it's basically Mission
Impossible II up high right now again
that we just get just the amount of
explosion talk it's just sort of lightly
weaving its way through this segment one
thing I like and our button is wired up
okay so Paul what happens on the pilot
so if you can see everything you just
reboot it i reboot it again but now it's
going to touch it
all right so Paul although Steve did you
have to write code if you look over here
you can see the PI is booting Linux yeah
it boots pretty fast that's another
thing you know right so memory so here's
the important thing about the PI why the
PI is so special it is so popular that
everything that you want to do or almost
everything you want to do has already
been written for you yeah so we
basically copy and paste it all some
code and we have to work right now so
let's pull up the other nice thing is if
you ever used python python is so so
difficult to install on a machine and it
comes pre-installed on both pi Python 2
and 3 come pre-installed so here's our
I'll explain push the button okay all I
do know okay GPIO right those are these
pins then we we wired the button into
right and then this is a sound mixer
that we just imported pygame so that we
set up the pan we're gonna use pin for
mm-hm
and then there's some weird stuff with
power that I don't understand so I just
copied and pasted it then we take all
our sound files out of a folder and then
we wrote this little function or it just
randomly chooses the sound files and
plays it and then we have this thing
called add event detect so we detect if
this this pin is falling and then we
just run a loop and then every time we
detect this event we play the scent
mm-hmm so we see it calls back to the
plate function so it's called to find a
function and then wended detects the
buns been pressed to place it I there we
go hi I'm Luis and the chat says that
that's the worst cable joint I've ever
seen he has not seen so my other cable
joints we have a
special present for you now we're gonna
upgrade the button yeah I mean now what
happens well we're not gonna plug in a
flash drive and we're gonna copy a file
off is great so let's just change the
code a little bit now it's just gonna
search the desktop for any okay no you
didn't do this for me people get a vibe
for it I think it can be really scary
but there's a ton of resources online
fine has done a bunch of projects I've
done some project we have tutorials on
the site it's a fun it's a fun life you
can make a airhorn button or a Y button
yeah I mean I will say that we talked so
much about finished products in the show
and absent services actually getting in
and making your own really helps you
understand what's going on yeah and this
stuff is cheap and fun and we do seven
every week lately called a circuit
breaker where you ask us a question I'm
Ashley and Jake answer that question so
let's take it away
Jake last week we had a really great
question come in while we were doing the
phonecall segment but we didn't have
time to get to it it's a really big
question with a lot to unpack so we're
gonna do it now the question comes from
Jackson and it's basically about
Google's giant Android ecosystem and the
question is with Google moving toward
more closed systems like Android go and
Chromebooks that run Android apps do we
think that Google will eventually phase
out Android
in favor of something that works better
or is Android just too big now if you
put back in Pandora's box there's a
really interesting question and the
place to start is what exactly it means
that Google is partly clipped what what
is happening neither I thought you're in
Austin I'm back this is important we're
talking about something replacing
Android you have to start with Samsung
all things Android start with Samsung
Samsung is not following the system
they're supposed to update Android they
never release updates Google releases a
new version of a dessert and then gets
put on the processor and then the phone
maker they don't do it so Google created
this thing follow the thread it created
treble and treble is designed to put all
of Samsung in this little box right here
so let it think whatever Google wants
update it they can but really if you're
talking about Android updates don't look
at the big updates don't look at this
follow a thread back to here Google Play
Google Play is where all the really
important stuff happens in Android
that's where Chrome gets updated it's
for apps get updated individually it all
just happens on its own and so really
you shouldn't be worried about do you
have Android piece you should be worried
you have Google Play apps version 72 or
whatever but meanwhile they know this is
happening but they also know that in
order to make this work they have to
have more phones to support it so they
have released Android Go which is the
latest version of Android 1 everyone
still exists but anyway it goes another
way the other manufacturers like Nokia
can make Android phone so that's really
big in India but it's not so big in
China because China doesn't use Google
Play and so there's other things that
are going on here to paint touches
remember this follow thread there's also
Chrome OS what's Chrome OS it runs
Google Chrome but it also runs Android
apps through the Google Play Store so
this is going on but we follow thread
and there's something else happening
what is this this is fuchsia fuchsia is
a next-generation operating system that
Google is developing nobody knows what
it is nobody knows what it does but as
Paul reminds me all the time fuchsia
runs on a microkernel and as you know
when kernels get hot they pop like
popcorn and if you put caramel on
popcorn it's basically a dessert which
means that Google could use treble to
make Android pee
call it popcorn and then if you just
follow what's happening here Google will
have Android it will have Chrome OS
it'll have fuchsia and all three of them
will Duke it out and if you want to know
if Android is eventually gonna get
replaced you just have to watch this
fight simple that answer your question
Jake did you make this oh no I just have
this around all the time I just had my
board I was working on it and I heard
the question so I came on well thanks
thanks everybody that was a circuit
breaker if you have questions for us
leave them in the chat and then one of
our employees will attack you thanks
Peter all right Dan speaking of China
yes I love this so much and I'm so big
can I tell you a very honest story whole
thing last night dieter and I were
walking to the bar and you just did that
for real that was just what we talked
about all right speaking of China yeah
I've got a bunch of Chinese Android
phones here from user vendors there's
some drama happening with this Huawei
one in particular this is the me mix -
you can't get it here so what's in front
of me are three high-end premium phones
that are made by companies in China two
of these you can buy in the US this is
the 1 + 5 t and the Huawei make 10 Pro
and then this is the Xiaomi me mix -
which you can't buy in the US but you
can get in a couple other markets across
the world now Jimmy says that they are
coming to the US by the end of 2019 but
they basically said they've been coming
to the US for the past five years so who
knows what they'll happen but that's
where it stands today and what's
interesting about these is you kind of
get like three different looks at how
Chinese manufacturers are approaching
software in terms of hardware they're
all super high-end they're all like
top-of-the-line processors
high-resolution screens nice well-built
designs and everything and I think they
all look like six gigs of RAM or
something and they're all running
Android 8.0 underneath all of this the 1
+ 5 T is going to be the most familiar
to those of us in the US that might have
been using a pixel or a Nexus phone that
looks really familiar it's kind of like
what we call stock Android for lack of a
better word in what way is it not stock
there are some customizations they've
got like a separate launcher thing here
there I don't know if it's enabled right
now but the off screen has a different
display mode they've got some software
in there for their camera and things
that aren't like Google specific but if
you're looking for like the look and
feel of what you get in a pixel you're
pretty close to it with the well this is
500 bucks yeah there you go and you went
and visited you were you went to China
you guys I did yeah so their base
intrusion
oneplus is actually owned by a larger
company called PB k that also owns Oppo
and vivo a couple other brands that are
primarily in Asia but this is what they
do and they focus on one phone a year
this is the five T is their latest phone
actually very good device we reviewed it
a few months ago and really liked it
it's very popular among enthusiasts a
couple of issues with the company in
terms of like security and privacy and
in terms of like hardware yeah it's
pretty solid and then this is the huawei
mate 10 Pro this is kind of like the
conversation piece around you can buy it
in the US you have to order it unlock
you can get from like Amazon Best Buy
and Huawei directly but there's no
carrier that sells it which is kind of
like a big deal yeah why do they
desaturate their buttons I think this is
just a theme that those buttons have
that kind of color there there's a
couple of different themes so you're
getting a look at the software here and
it's a little bit of a mess it's kind of
like a now I can't find the themes it's
kind of like a mixture of iOS and
Android with like all of the bad parts
each one it's it's kind of kind of gross
in my opinion but you can definitely see
where they're pit there there yeah a lot
of this and so like by default right now
this is configured to have an app
launcher tray but like by default
there's no app tray it's just like iOS
with all your apps on the home screen
but you can change like the color of the
icons and things like that I think
that's just the theme on this particular
one to answer your question Paul but
this does have like you know full Google
software and Play Store and everything
like that
a TT was originally going to eat
carrying this but that deal fell apart
at the last minute
thanks to right so this is the
conversation like we were at CES this
year we were expecting Huawei to put out
this phone on a major US carrier yeah
and then it went away and while we CEO
got on stage and base like you yelled at
everybody like a very emotional raw
moment he said the rest of the world
trusts us one day you will baby the
phone icon is desaturated because Scott
old AT&amp;amp;T from carrying this phone yeah
while we put it out here unlocks anyway
but now the government is also telling
consumers not to buy it yeah there's a
the heads of FBI and the CIA and other
agencies that basically said consumers
shouldn't buy huawei products and really
like I don't think they're really
concerned about this phone in particular
they're concerned about Huawei's bigger
business which is network infrastructure
and so they don't want the phone to be a
gateway for Huawei to sell its network
infrastructure to ATT for when 5g
networks roll out Huawei has a ton of 5g
technologies planned its provides a lot
of network infrastructure across the
world outside of the US and the US
government does not want that to come
into the u.s. for fear of providing
backdoors to the Chinese government
because they allege that Huawei has a
lot of ties to the Chinese government
based on really I mean this phone is
kind of like the casualty of it all but
there's a bigger piece behind that in
that about the network infrastructure
that the government is going after tell
me about these so this is a like a
branded dual camera system and so unlike
say what we see on the iPhone 10 or
galaxy s 9 plus these are not a wide
angle and a telephoto lens it's actually
a color camera and a black-and-white
camera and so it will take the data from
both captures combine them together to
allegedly provide more detail and
sharper image quality these qualities
very good out of this it's not quite as
good as what you get from a pixel or
Samsung can you just take straight back
on my photos you can't is that actually
like the cameras are just a branding
yeah it's a brand evil I mean like it
will they'll say that like like it helps
develop it jazz
but you know like Oh makes all of its
cameras in Germany this is not made in
Germany so I think that's you found one
of their customizations which is like a
unique lock screen that gives you
shortcuts No so let's let's hit the lock
screen and then if you drag up from the
bottom you get shortcuts for your
calculator or flashlight so this is like
stuck with the whole update problem
right how often is this get updated so
this is running android 8.0 right now
Wally doesn't really do a great job of
updating to the newer versions and right
they'll launch their device on a certain
version and then maybe it'll get updated
probably not
at least that's been our experience or
the ones available so what is this very
beautiful so this is by far one of the
most beautiful things I've ever seen
yeah this is a really interesting device
and some me mix to the original me mix
from wallet Xiaomi was one of the first
so did this like all edge to edge design
this one is the second version of it so
they kind of like changed a little bit
they've tone it down a little bit but
it's it's made out of ceramic this is
actually not glass it's ceramic which is
pretty wild and this is kind of like a
look at a software that U is very
popular in in Asian markets whereas it
is basically nothing like the Android
that we're used to from Google and
basically looks like iOS this is about
like as close to yeah iOS is you're
gonna as you're gonna get if you even
look at like the the multitasking window
is like very iOS like and so you can
tell very tell where their their
inspiration is this version does run the
Play Store it's like I think they sell
this in India with the Play Store in
Singapore outside of China China does
not have a place to but you can't buy
this in the USA so here's the problem
with this phone this is I mean it's just
a beautiful house this is Cameron
the front camera if you can see this is
down here yeah it's no not you see so we
just made the worst trade-off ever is
that this is LCD right I believe it's an
LCD it might be an amyloid but I believe
this model isn't LCD so you've got your
driver component saying yeah but when
you you can see the Sun Paul cam you can
flip this around this is not not so it's
not super flat your thumb is about to
get it's just gonna happen so what
you're supposed to do this is true
you're supposed to
yeah problem-solve I don't know what
you're complaining about like that's the
literally the one thing so like that's
it that's a discussion of like you know
dealing with the notch right like they
could have put it up here and there's
Reuben rumors of the next version of
this phone where they put to a corner
not that we've seen some images out of
China base that we don't know if that's
gonna happen or not like the camera is
up here in the corner and it's like a
little cutout
by the way this is pretty cool yeah
thanks buddy all right so this one is I
was here popular people white a lot yeah
someone actually in the chat right here
Marinko brought up on obviously the
government is blocking Huawei from doing
this yesterday the government Donald
Trump himself put out an executive order
preventing Broadcom which is Auto
Chinese companies Singaporean company
but forensic Broadcom from buying
Qualcomm which the US company Broadcom
is in I respond to this by the way by
Reed domicile Ling to us and becoming a
US company see if the saga continues
there's like oh there's a lot going on
here in terms of particularly Asian
company yeah coming to the US so with
the one coming does not in this
conversation right here is ZTE which is
one of the larger companies oh not quite
as big as Huawei but getting up to that
scale and they provide infrastructure
and things like that and ZTE has had the
same type of like government complaints
against it but that hasn't stopped it
from building a business in the US which
is very interesting to me ZTE sells a
lot of mid-range low-end phones that are
branded by t-mobile branded by et
they're all sold by the carriers they
don't really have a high it many
high-end offerings but Huawei hasn't
been able to get any of that which has
been kind of fascinating to me yeah I
mean I think that I just think people
care about those my range phones right
those are the classic carrier branding
deal where you go and you get some OEMs
make you a phone yep I don't think
there's a lot of cover interest here a
big high-end splashy we're gonna market
this phone yep I think that's
that's a little bit different I still
don't understand it I don't understand
it I mean I'm trying to understand it
what don't you understand I don't know
what specifically wall again point of
CTE has all the same ties to the Chinese
government that Huawei has what specific
evils has Huawei done that we're
specifically averting I feel like so it
might be a little a little naive to like
ask the government for proof but like
they haven't really come for it's it's
it's all the agencies have said they
allege these things they suspect these
things but there's been no proof
provided to the public I don't I mean
like personally for me I'm not taking
the what the government says is the
whether I would use the Huawei phone or
not I'm like looking at it from a very
consumer perspective of I wouldn't use
this phone because of software's
miserable what you should buy a phone
because the software is bad why does not
have the Play Store this is like a very
long and complicated yeah go ahead
well so basically Google doesn't exist
in China because all the companies that
do exist in China have agreed to give
the Chinese government access to their
data and Google doesn't that has not
agreed to that so Google doesn't exist
in China their Facebook lays doors yeah
there's a number of American companies
that don't exist in China
so therefore Google's Play Store does
not exist in China either so what's
interesting about that is you know
company does exist in China is Apple and
Apple just agreed to move its iCloud
data centers in China for Chinese
customers to control of a Chinese
company so Apple now contracts out
iCloud from a Chinese company to service
Chinese users so moving to China because
you there are a lot of governmental
restrictions on what you can do and a
lot of speakers just like we're done
so it's interesting the Chinese
governor's playing the same game yeah
with American Japanese by requiring
access today yeah the American
government's not firing back but I don't
does that turn on whether you should buy
a huawei phone like the the CEOs
argument CS and you should go watch this
video we wrote a long article about it
and it's on the verge calm his argument
is like we're doing this in Africa we're
doing business in Europe we're doing
business in at least all of these other
countries trust us and were able to work
with them
I do think it's interesting that we have
so much more hardware whether or not
it's designed in China is built in China
yep and a lot of the engineering
progress is happening in China
yeah this is this total separation when
it comes to software I blame you blamed
free idea for governments don't spy on
your citizens and don't censor them
beautiful man John in a chat is asking
is this Huawei's kiran processor yes so
this is using the wall way I believe
it's secure 970 processor and then they
like to market this coprocessor that's
with it for doing AI processing but they
all kind of like have these kind of
coprocessors these two are running
Qualcomm Snapdragon 830 5s this one is
just real beautiful I'm so taking this
alright last question would you actually
get one of these if you live in the
states over a pixel or an s nyan air I
think there's a really compelling
argument for the 1 + 5 t in that it's
only 500 bucks a pixel to excel which is
roughly the same size screen and
everything is running 850 I believe last
I checked s9 + is in that neighborhood
as well so you do save a ton of money by
going with the 1 plus the thing that
you're going to give up is support and
local like if you drop and break the
screen on this one plus is basic shinjin
there's no there's no local place to go
to get that might be a concern and then
like I mentioned earlier Bourne plus has
had some issues they late last year they
had a security breach on their website
where a bunch of I believe 40,000
customers credit card info was stolen so
they had to like shut that down and
switch to PayPal's they they're like are
not without issue
which makes maybe gives you a reason to
think twice but I think the main reason
someone would go with a1 + over a pixel
or over any other phone is going to be
its cost what's the reason that's a good
question you know the the I believe the
company's line is that they want to
provide the best experience they can and
they're trying to figure out the US
market and how to how to enter it and
everything it could be you know there's
been speculation for years that it's
patent and IP issues given how similar
it looks to maybe Apple products was the
original zombie-like originally made a
splash by just completely yeah yeah so
they diverge obviously you know they've
got their own idea now and like they're
doing their own thing but the software
is still very similar packaging is very
similar there's a lot of like
similarities and how they present the
company that you know maybe Apple might
have issues with I honestly think they
don't have a great strategy for breaking
into the US and because the u.s. is a
very tough market if you are going to
make any money and be any successful at
all you really have to work with
carriers which means that you have to go
through the carrier certification
processes and everything which are very
difficult very hard to do verification
processes that's that's doesn't go
through that and so like you can't get a
oneplus phone that runs over icing
because there's no 1+1 that'll go
through pass Verizon security
certification services so tough out
there thank you Dan mmm thank you you
did a thing again yes this is the the
second episode
explain yourself with your friend Paul
Miller okay after this we're gonna take
your calls for emotional tech support
Ashley's gonna join us yeah so call one
eight four four four emotion if you want
to just bare your soul to us what was
happening in tech but first let's watch
whatever Paul did mmm-hmm do you have a
car I do not you have a car no do you
have a car not really do you have a car
yes
how many cars one car deal a flying car
I do not have five her
keep keep dreaming do you have a car I
do do you have a flying car you know do
you wish you find her of course gently
applied cars though I do not have any
fine
keep dreaming buddy and looking so smug
right about cars all the time you're
gonna have to explain yourself this
sounds way more threatening than I
intend to Andrew Hawkins wrote two
stories this week last week the PAL five
liberty claims to be the first
commercially available flying car this
is very exciting
I think uneducated about cars that I am
but here's another article people are
still trying to make cars that morph
into helicopters well this sounds like
we're like just super over it and bored
of flying cars which is it Andy Andy
hello oh it's Paul hey it's me Paul hey
Paul nice to see you how's it going it's
going great
I'm gonna have you do something that I
call explain yourself alright did you go
to a car show last week I didn't our
colleague Vlad survived wit and Geneva
so you can say everything you know about
these are just this is just hearsay yes
sir
there's flying cars at the car show
yes so that's true it is true yes there
were a couple of so-called flying cars
at the Geneva Motor Show
okay so flying cars are real it depends
on what you consider to be a flying car
are they commercially viable it also
depends on what you consider to be
commercially viable there's a lot of
different slots of speculation around it
but there are a lot of people that are
pursuing flying cars as a commercial
product all right so this is where we
get to explain yourself time I feel like
one of the articles made it sound like
flying cars are boring and we're over
them and the other one was like here's a
flying car that you could buy I'm not
bored of it I'm not over it explain
yourself okay so I think the one that is
available to buy is called the POW v
Liberty and it's actually kind of a
crossover between a helicopter or maybe
a gyrocopter
and a small smart style vehicle and the
company that makes it it's based in in
the Netherlands and they say that they
you could start buying them by the end
of the year so
if you were so inclined as to risk your
life and want to get behind the wheel of
one of these things and hit you have a
pilot's license as well as a driver's
license you're welcome to do that how
much I think it's probably in the
six-figure range I was hearing somewhere
around $300,000 okay and then the other
articles like flying cars bored of this
so that's probably some of my my
skepticism leaching into the to the
coverage and it's because I've been
covering this issue for over a year now
and there are a lot of companies that
are spending a lot of money and claiming
that flying cars are going to be a real
product I have some serious doubts I
wonder whether or not this is gonna be
anything outside of like very rich
people buying these things and using
them and there's lots of people like
uber thinks it's gonna be actually like
a flying taxi service available in
cities they're sitting in up in Dallas
and in LA and Dubai so we'll have to see
I mean it's just like the technologies
aren't really there yet as far as making
them all-electric and able to fly so
there's a lot of pieces that still need
to fall into place if you had to guess
what which flying car will paul miller a
member of the firmly entrance in the
middle class which one will I get into
and will take me somewhere if all if
everything goes according to plan and
this technology actually comes to
fruition and there's actually flying
taxis available in cities I would say
you're most likely to be in an uber
flying taxi more so than anywhere else
because these seem to have the vision
and the money to actually scale the
product and make it available in cities
thank you Andrew you your answers are
very good thank you Paul I'm happy to do
it
well that was explain yourself with your
friend Paul Miller I think we really got
to the bottom of this one flying cars
soon already here first
we're back really costing our hey so you
guys actually started emotional tech
support ages ago it's back in the if
anybody remembers Facebook live deep in
the archives on our face
a couple of years ago look back at short
hair back then yeah alright tell me
people that expect the number the number
should be up on the screen really
underwent hair transformations I really
what have you did better Bolton
emotional tech support is is is you call
us with your problems that can be about
technology but we're not going to fix
your technology problem but we yeah
we're not tech support so we can't we
will say maybe try turning it off yeah
but that's about as far as we're gonna
go so let me let me offer you this one
take some calls yeah so like a baby yes
it's great baby needs a room in my house
find space for her so I had to totally
like throw out my office that's the
baby's room now so I got rid of all the
furniture all the shells and I've just
been throwing away gadgets like
recycling them and like throwing away
wires and Becky says that every time I
like throw one away like I take a wire
and like put it in the bag mmm I make
soft moaning sounds mmm because they're
all like little adventures like they're
all whatever when I I remember what I
plug that into that one thing on
firewire 400 was like a really important
piece of my life how far back do these
gadgets go I'm a threeway scuzzy cable
like that old yeah that's a scanner no
that's for a hard drive
cuz there's like that part of you that
really feels like what if I need this
cable again and then I'll be a hero like
every day oh is that what you were
saving them for though that's not why
you were saving in cables I just think
like the the the moments for you to be a
hero in your life were very limited if
you can have a drawer of heroism
they're not just signifiers of good
times gone by I mean it's all I can look
at them it's like I mean I just had
three drawers full of cables and gadgets
all right I brought a bunch of a bunch
of them are on the set now if anybody
wants my canon powershot s 100 right
please let me know it's sitting right
over here all right we have our first
call ken has an iPhone future
expectations question this is going to
be emotional Ken what's up man all right
so iPhone 10 G's and screams not as
terrible price is horrible
iPhone 10 plus expected what are we
going to see that will validate an
increased price the things that same
shabby screen and overall just kind of
boring
I mean iOS is great it's reliable as
fast and what's worse for the hardware
that should set all that's good it's
boring laser in on the emotion here
boredom
frustration would you say that you are
frustrated I am frustrated I am
underwhelmed and I'm overcharged so
here's what I think you should do I
think you should find another gadget it
isn't like where the market isn't quite
as developed and fall into that I think
that phone market we've had a solid
decade of like super intense phone
market crazy competition mm-hmm and now
by the way I disagree with you that the
screen is shabby the notch is annoying
screen is beautiful except for them not
but but we've had a decade of like phone
hyper enthusiasm and now you're wait you
you want that to be like so you're
saying Kim should find a different
industry that has that rapid iteration
for focus on yeah so he can enjoy
progress again yeah what your own could
be fun
they're like back a small drink it isn't
gonna win you know and like be really
into that I've gotten into modular
synthesis a little bit been following
that
what were you saying you feel I'm in the
exact same place as Ken where I need to
replace my phone and I'm looking at the
iPhone 10 and it still runs the same iOS
I have on my success so the software
isn't a big differentiator for me I see
the notch I see the victory and then I'm
like that price tag is insane and I'm
going through the same thing or my uh
what do I do
I like it but not that much you feel
like for $1000 that should change my
life exactly what are your other let's
see we can find one for you what's the
thing that grabs you and I know you're
gonna say smart homes fan but there's
I'm telling you once you install like
the door lock and then you're like great
yeah upgrade cycle what are your dreams
I have the Matic pro which is more than
I need
angelee the new DVD I groans are they're
good they're great boy kids not a Crow's
good I got the what's the other pixel to
excel over there I got the s8 plus all
over the point I have the iPhone 7 I'm
all over the place because I'm looking
for that you know what happened what won
the note 7 came out and there was
finally a breath of fresh air and then
it had that issue and then the air from
an explosion whooshing products now it
sounds like you're into photography
right you've got a flying camera you've
got some handheld cameras why not let go
all the video and photo wait why not go
all the way down like being like the
Canon version versus Nikon split or like
Sony's coming to disrupt them all well
you want to you want some like deep
emotions get on a camera message board
but go on like an icon fans calm and guy
Canon for life there is a great theory
that I heard that Sony is holding itself
back that it's so far beyond Canon and
Nikon that it's just trickling out
features and if they ever try to compete
with sony Sony will slam down a large
set of features I'm also wondering if
instead of boredom you should try to
have gratitude because you're bored but
at least the phones are good enough now
where you're not like this is a really
actually I should be happy that it works
Technologies I don't have to upgrade
yeah I mean I think it is boring but
we're at that stage where it's like well
it works and it's good alright thank you
so much can talk to you guys later I'm
gonna wait I don't know chuckle grab the
LGD 30 and play with the long cycle
alright Krishna and the chat is asking
about Apple versus Android which is
basically the same question but I think
the emotional tenor of that question is
different right here what do you have we
have a follow up in the chat here or did
say someone suggest Ashley oh yeah John
suggested that you need to go I feel
like there's a lot I mean I think that
toilet I think a lot of us who are tied
to the iPhone are tied into iMessage and
there's so many emotions tied up with my
message because all your friends are
there the group texts are way better on
iMessage that green bubble yeah I will
say I've been thinking about Android a
lot because I feel like Android matches
more of my core principles not Google as
a company but Android as software that's
relatively open source relatively
customizable hackable so I've been
really thinking about switching to that
the blue blue text messages and my
family group chat specifically is worth
its most important was holding me to iOS
but my brother just switched to a dumb
phone he's going like Luddite and so
he's already broken the family group
text so now I'm not the bad guy I can
switch to Android Go Green text and so
what are you guys doing about so there's
just no more group text your brother
yeah that's how I feel about every time
I see data on this cool Android phones
yeah well you've got to move the whole
family to Google you know like you can
run like Linux on your Android phone
like you could do so many interesting
different weird things with Android
phone all right then by the way the
number is 1 8 4 4 4 emotion just call us
with your emotional problems regular if
somebody else in the line I suspect that
we do great and by the way is back back
they're screening away so let's see what
Paul you also probably have some
emotions all right Creighton says we
have one coming my his name apparently
as mr. standby I can throw a real quick
story yeah my roommate has discovered
that he can just yell things at Alexa
and set alarms for me yeah
so it was like Alexa wake me up at 5:00
a.m.
Alexa wake me up before you he said like
ten alarms we have so on on the line I
mean told this is an iPad question frame
on so on which yeah okay so it's been a
couple months since iOS 11 came out and
I want to buy an iPad now it made that
week to leave Mac OS behind I'm a
student so I don't really need a whole
lot and I don't know if I want to wait
until WWDC to see if there's gonna be a
new I've had this year with like case ID
or an emoji or if I should just buy the
current iPad pro I mean you've had a
couple saw there's rumors out there but
a new ones coming in March let me ask
yes why why did you decide to leave Mac
OS behind I just don't like hanging
around my 15-inch MacBook Pro I have the
touch part version and I feel like I
don't man emotion is enough computing
power to justify carrying four pounds of
stuff in my backpack
have you tried lazy have you tried
full-time iPad life
I have I have my mom arrest my dad okay
no I have some general recommendations
is it MacRumors does the buying guide
yeah there's a if you just google it
there's a buying guide that you can
search for and it's like it covers all
Apple products and tells you win they
typically get refreshed and and so it
will kind of tell you like this is a
good time to buy or this is a bad time
to buy my general tech advice has always
been always wait wait until you need
something and I will say this chat is
going crazy with Windows computer
recommendations you want to leave Mac OS
behind tell me about that feeling you're
like I just don't need this I don't want
it
is your is your simplify no I will use
Mac OS s home I just don't need it like
for a portable type of device like when
I'm at home and I'm locked in so you
want to spend yeah what's the biggest
around there it's so much money to jump
from $650 for the 64 gigabyte iPad pro
up to the 256 gigabyte yeah that's a Oh
hundred and fifty dollar jump for like
an SD card worth of storage yeah piss me
off
okay I got like an open box discount at
Best Buy
so done okay yeah I feel I feel sick to
my stomach I spent that much on a tablet
computer though right like when you can
buy an Android tablet for like one or
two hundred dollars but it enrich your
life I hope so and I wouldn't
you find in the iPad life is is
simplicity and and streamlined thought
process and no back string single
tasking notes and dongles hundreds of
thousands of dongles figured out man I I
cannot for the life I think I my emotion
when I think about iPads is just
confusion have you ever tried to work
[Laughter]
combo is like the strongest that's the
move we have lots of like tablet full on
tablet people here all right we have one
more question
Austin there's a question about
Bluetooth and Android mmm and I feel
like all Bluetooth questions I defer to
Ashley Carmen so Austin I'm a proud
Android user I love my pixel to I also
loved my j-bird excuse until they died
about two days ago and there's still not
a good replacement for them you know
Apple they have their positives are
great yeah I mean I
they don't fit in my ear so I don't
bother but pixel buds they just they
didn't live up and I don't want to spend
a hundred and sixty dollars on something
that doesn't live up I'm waiting for a
good option and I want to know when that
is it makes me sad
why did your Jaybirds die they just died
they're gone yeah I've had them for I've
had them for three years now so maybe
we're just there time do you feel like
no no now my existence is pain because I
spent $25 on a replacement and those
hurt and you're not my where's open the
USBC headphone dongle life because the
pixel to dongle is just gross well I
mean that's fine
when I'm just sitting at my desk but if
I'm you know out running I don't want to
be tethered to Accord it's gonna fall
out of my ears right and you want in
your like to be able to crane my neck
around in every direction the next
speaker why can't you buy replacement
ones I'm confused why you can't just buy
new ones I mean I could but for the $50
that I would
replacing a pair of X two's I might as
well try to find that good option that
has 5.0 and a quick pairing feature
similar to the pixel buds and even
better connectivity but it doesn't seem
to exist yet Qualcomm announced a new
chip
so we're basically at CES so we're still
waiting for manufacturers to ship stuff
with that new chip the spec for audio /
5.0 isn't even out yet yeah I I feel
like what I did is I got some beats yeah
and I hate using with the iOS obviously
but I got basically a relatively cheap
pair like 90 hour beats one yeah
and they and I just don't listen to
music sorry beats the W one yes correct
yeah just like basically this is a time
where music is not for me this is a time
where only spoken word music music from
phones again basically is have courage
is a great idea that everyone supports
and this problem never happens laughter
is the best medicine right now you can
listen to the verge cast a she's got a
great show called why'd you push that
button we're making spoken word chord
but I will say about YouTube it's three
years for a gadget that's a lot
especially a gadget that you work as
hard and it sounded like it worked well
for you and that you're having trouble
replacing so just make sure you take a
little bit of time and like you know
like think about the loss and the end of
that time or buy something cheap and
wait for something good to come out
which is always good
find a store with a good return policy
all right we got one last question thank
you so much Austin I appreciate that one
[Laughter]
David has feelings about Google a
messaging strategy hey buddy
are you doing well how are you guys all
right tell us tell us your emotions so
my question for you guys is how much
longer should I stick with Google Voice
I've been using it for four or five
years now and
mostly that's because I work from home
it's really convenient to answer phone
calls on the computer as well as some
text messages but hey bad hangouts
experience is just getting worse and
worse and worse it's really terrible and
windows now and it is not a fun app to
use on on Android Google's been talking
about messaging and their ideas for for
years and years but we we're not seeing
it come to fruition should I use should
I stick with it should I finally give up
and change my number what do you guys
think man that's tough that's like that
is maybe the hardest most emotionally
because changing your phone number is a
lot mm that's a lot but Google Voice is
like abandoned where at this point as
near as I can tell so I like I don't
know what do you use do you use the
voice features of Google Voice do you
have it like I don't use that I have it
coming through to my personal phone but
I mostly use it for kind of answering
phone calls on the on the computer or
talking or sending text messages on the
computer it's nice to kind of have two
numbers sometimes but you know at the
end of it invoices
The Voice app has started to see some
updates but Google keeps talking about
how they're gonna you know figure out
voice and messaging and and all of that
but it just doesn't seem like they
they're going anywhere with us you're
not careful deters is gonna wheel in
another conspiracy board this is all he
thinks hears I'm gonna I'm gonna make a
suggestion you're on an Android phone
iPhone here's my recommendation it's
gonna be wild you know I don't like it
the traps gonna hate it throw everything
away fully into the iMessage ecosystem
you said you do is the reason I can't
switch away from iOS because I can
texture my computer because the voice
motion they're not great but they work
other people have it the apps are
everywhere at least on Apple's ecosystem
that lock-in is strong
well you are feeling is the pain of
having a neglectful jailer I think I
have three google home devices right
throughout our house and I think I want
to I want to live in Google and
ecosystem they just sometimes make it
make it harder than up and it should be
maybe people are urging the brick I
don't think that there is another
ecosystem that lets you do voice plus
messaging the way that Google Voice stay
in the way I would recommend is to look
around for like a beautiful prison that
really wants you there this is the
question in addition to you how the hell
do headphones work now but the question
of like the next moment and technology
is is there going to be a messaging
service in the United States because
outside United States you have whatsapp
inline telegram but in the United States
will there be another cohesive messaging
service that can rival what Apple's
doing with my message right the answer
as near as I can tell is know I feel
like facebook Messenger Instagram DMS
yeah I almost feel like there is an
emerging usage pattern that is basically
like find people where they spend their
time like if someone's a snap user like
message am on snapchat if they used
Instagram Oh mr. monster they are a
green bubble on Facebook message on
Facebook because that means they're
active they like to message you an
iMessage sorry another choice for you
Damon is to refuse to be in any one
prison right and just go to everyone
else's prison well I appreciate David's
loyalty so David I think you should feel
proud of how loyal you are you really
didn't give up when you when you could
have given up
they're not rewarding that loyalty but I
thanks guys thanks David I appreciate it
man
we have we had a wrap-up we have one
more here I'm just gonna put this out
there you know for the Android Apple
let's talk about Microsoft Microsoft
enrolling stuff to enter it after the
death of Windows Phones I mean I'm sorry
that Windows Phone is dead but you gotta
move on man you just got a lot go I'm
still sad about it the I you know you
know what there is a point of hope you
know Peter was talking about fuchsia and
his crazy conspiracy theory board it's a
more modular operating system and that
was what really inspired me about
Windows Phone is this idea that
developers can make small pieces that
can be assembled by the operating system
into a you are they can be kind of
seamless instead of this bouncing in and
out of apps for the rest of our lives
see oh wait this one will just come back
