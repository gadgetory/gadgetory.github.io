he's going to talk to us a little bit
about his experience here as a small
presenter so the sky is from Ann Arbor
Michigan he graduated from the
University of Wisconsin he's got a
degree in math he was working for
Chrysler for a while when Daimler bought
the company you know instead of the
global economy coming to the rescue of
Chrysler I saw it as a loss squeeze on
our suppliers cost squeeze on the
engineers as poss squeeze on everybody
within the corporation and what was a
fun job became a screw turning job you
know I just felt like I was no longer
part of the solution for Detroit and the
economy in America as a whole and I was
part of the problem so he hit on the
idea of this Z moat is what it's called
it's just an extension cord with a
Bluetooth module in it so he's got a
prototype here you want to go in here
and he's trying to get people interested
in picking it up retailers mostly here's
our iPhone app so we have two lights
that are off over here so when I
function the app on the iPhone the
lights go on he basically decided he was
gonna come here in December his sister
makes these mood lights for lowes and
she said well you need marketing for
this this product you need to get the
word out he didn't really know how to do
that she said well there's this big
consumer electronic show in january and
he kind of just decided he was going to
go didn't really know anything about it
got here was totally overwhelmed it's an
overwhelming show you know I you know I
got to my little booth you know ten by
ten booth after walking by some 100 by
100 boots and I've got you know the
people behind me they spend a million a
half dollars and so I walked by all this
fantastic technology and people
showcasing their products and I get here
to this nice little 10 by 10 that I
found
after 10 minutes is walking up and down
the aisle and I say okay well so here I
am here they are hopefully someone will
stop by on the way so it was a little
overwhelming and intimidating you know I
got my list of things to do better next
time finding a place to park
anticipating the length of time I'm
going to be standing all day walking
here and figuring out where I'm going to
get something to drink finding out that
I only have one outlet to work with so I
got to get a power strip to put
everything in ok well I better go get
one of those so I'm smelling this smell
and i'm pretty sure wasn't coming from
me trying to get the cards and we got
this card reader to scan a badge some
people don't want their badges scan oh
no I don't do that so I walked out in
the hallway I went downstairs and it
just got worse the further you went into
the hotel building I lost my credit card
the headache nice little shoe repair
issue they were working i can't tell you
how many times people said ok can i
staple this together and i would have to
say whoo no you can't i don't have one
of those ran out of little info sheets
for the product so i had to get somebody
to be here at the booth well I ran over
to officemax to download my file from
the internet and have them print out a
hundred copies so i can drive back you
know more people asking for staplers
that i don't have a ship the nice
60-pound two-piece water fountain here
had to fill it up that's probably the
only one in the whole event here with a
trash can in the bathroom filling up
with water coming back out here dumping
it in spilling it all over the place
despite all the best intentions of
having everything ready and getting here
two hours early those little things pop
up at the last minute and we're not
spending a million and a half on your
boots I guess that's what you're going
to find we're all pretty much trying to
do the same thing it's just some people
have more money than others to do that
with and hopefully next year I'll be one
of those people with a little more do
you want to take a quick break I think
this guy wants oh sure sorry that's
right
I just came by and you were here your
sister yeah filming for yesterday and
had an absolutely fantastic time talk
she'll be here I'll see if she wants to
go my cousin I found the onion the what
is apparently the Mexican food
restaurant for the whole area and it's
walking distance oh yeah i mean if not
during the show i'm sure she'd be have
any hook up with the afternoon show
would absolutely love that i got a part
of you it's not only mr. alright i'll be
able to do yeah i'll let her know that
you're specifically looking for part of
the struggle is getting people to notice
us and have a reaction frankly but when
they do stop i explain what the product
is and give them a demonstration it's
been a 99 out of a hundred wow that's a
neat product you know i haven't seen
that before perhaps craftsman good they
got a crash through does it use
bluetooth and there's a work with any
phone is it on a Wi-Fi network or is it
direct one-on-one see all the above I
didn't see a blue sea daddy you can put
your garage right see if your garage
doors up yeah alright so i guess it was
probably the middle of the day that I
get back from one of my runs to get
something we ran out of that I didn't
think we needed and this company stopped
by and I don't know if you can see this
but it's a little gaming controller and
I looked at it and I said okay that's
interesting i looked at the name and it
says z motes needless to say ze emote is
pretty similar to z modes so he asked me
well how do you say the name of your
company and I well I said Z motes he
said well that's funny that's how we say
the name of our company I said well why
would you spell a company ze emotes all
right Zemo was there it was available we
did our trademark search we did our web
search we got the website did an
internet search Zemo nobody uses emotes
so of all the trademarks and patents and
things that i've been working on the
last year Zemo seemed like the safest of
anything that i was working on so to
have this president of Zemo located out
of Illinois
come in and show me his product and a
copy of a letter that his lawyer wrote
to me that he sent via email saying hey
cease and desist that was yeah that was
pretty interesting I guess I block that
out of my memory because i forgot that i
have a lamp TV a fan plugged into it as
long as it adds up to 1,200 watts you
turn it on and off so it's a one device
at a time things it's like an extension
cord with the switch well it could
Detroit and you know even if celani
where I'm located it's usually on the
top 10 lists of many lists and a lot of
times majority of those times it's not a
good list to be on whether its
unemployment crime jobs and so when I
put down Ypsilanti you know under what
city are you from here at the CES you
know I did that in hopes of being able
to have a product that I can go back and
say you know what it's going to add
value to our economy because it's a new
products it would be new jobs it would
be new opportunities to you know take a
warehouse that's sitting empty right now
and start putting people in it and
product in it so you know we talked
about I guess the alternate measure of
success you know if I had that happen
and I didn't come to another CES show
but you know we started selling our
product and I started hiring people and
I started saying you know here's how I'm
adding value to a local economy and I'm
not just opening a restaurant on one
corner and closing another restaurant
and I'm not just opening a casino to
siphon money off of people I'm trying to
add value to an economy did you get that
on film we're all right we're all right
there was okay it's the last day okay so
what happened was I walked by this shelf
and apparently touched it enough to to
make this shelf collapse
I'll get that don't worry about no I got
it all right I knocked it down low yeah
get some more people that stop by yep
it's a lot I don't know how that
happened Frank oh that was awesome I got
to change the name of the company I lost
my credit card you know what's gonna
happen now so hopefully my flight will
make it tonight and I'll get home
without any problem you know hopefully
there will be a next time but that's
yeah it's been a definitely been a
learning experience the first time here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
