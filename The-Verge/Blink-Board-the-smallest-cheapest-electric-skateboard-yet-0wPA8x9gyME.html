Verge and this is the actin blink board
now it's different about this board from
other Electric skateboards is obviously
the size this thing is much smaller lot
closer to the size of a traditional
skateboard normally we see longboard
style Electric skateboards but this
thing is much more maneuverable and much
lighter it only weighs 9 pounds which
means it's really easy to carry around
the specs are pretty similar to a lot of
other electric long boards that were
used to sink top speed of about 15 miles
an hour 6 mile range and it'll take a
little over an hour for you to recharge
the whole thing once it runs out of
battery 215 miles an hour might not
equal some of the other Electric
skateboards that are out there but on a
board this small with wheels this wide
it is plenty of speed I've just been
riding around here in Midtown and even
there even on the slow mode it feels
fast enough but on the faster motor you
get up near that 50 miles an hour it is
plenty of speed on something this small
now the other great thing about the
blink board that I haven't even
mentioned yet is the price it only costs
$4.99 which is half maybe even a third
of what other Electric skateboards cost
right now and that's a huge deal it
makes this thing almost seem pretty
affordable if you do want to order it
you can go to their website right now
they're already shipping them out to
customers you might have to wait a
little bit but they are in production
it's exciting to see a lot of different
electric skateboard companies these days
but it's a breath of fresh air to see
something that actually looks a lot
different and it has a lot of
personality you got lights that lined
the board a ton of color on the inside
of the deck these bright green wheels so
this thing stands out from the crowd in
a lot of ways the price the weight and
just the look of the thing so hopefully
this is a sign of the future of electric
skateboards to come for more electric
rider bowls and everything else make
sure you go to the gorge calm and head
to youtube.com slash the virgin cliff
