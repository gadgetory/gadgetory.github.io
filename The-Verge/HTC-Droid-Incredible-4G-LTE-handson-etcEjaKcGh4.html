and we're here with the HTC incredible
4g LTE at ctia it's verizon's newest HTC
phone the incredible is kind of a mix of
the One X and the one asked it has a
super LCD panel like the One X but it's
960 x 540 which is just like the 1s the
display looks fantastic we loved it on
the one acts and looks really great here
too a lot of the rest of styling is
total verizon though it's the same as
the incredible and it looks a lot like
the resound it's got the the red and
black stylings and it's a nice bone it's
a little thicker than like the 1s which
we've also got here but it's still a
nice phone it's a little smaller the 4
inch displays is definitely a matter of
preference but I like it for one
otherwise it's you know it's android 4.0
its sense four-point-oh and most of
software is just the same except it's on
verizon now and again it's you know
smaller than the 1s or the gigantic 1x
but it's still at four inch display it's
pretty low so that's the HTC droid
incredible 4G LTE we're not sure when
it's going to be out or how much it's
going to cost but we're pretty excited
because it's a brand-new really high-end
HTC smartphone now on all four carriers
and pretty much everybody wins with that
