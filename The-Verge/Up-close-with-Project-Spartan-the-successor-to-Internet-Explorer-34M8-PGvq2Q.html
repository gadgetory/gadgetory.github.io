today we're taking the first look at
project Spartan which is Microsoft's
replacement for Internet Explorer in
Windows 10 it just released a first
preview of it and there are three major
features that you can check out already
the first of those is a reading view and
that basically strips away everything
that's going on in an article and gives
you a plain text no images no videos no
ads just really neat way to read through
something you've probably seen stuff but
like this before with pocket or
Instapaper it's in other web browsers it
was even in earlier versions of Internet
Explorer but it's neat and clean here
and really easy to tap into the other
features that you can already demo in
project Spartan are the beginnings of
Cortana and right now pratama it can
basically just use a dictionary if you
right click you can ask Cortana to
define words and it'll pop up right
beside it eventually queer times can do
a lot more the count like calendar
information flight information is going
to show up there you'll be able to live
up locations and you'll get rich
information back from bing that's mostly
not there right now but this is a star
that is going to look like for the most
part and the final feature and this is
one that Microsoft been showing off
quite a lot about is web note which is
where you can tap this little drawing
icon in the corner and then you can
start annotating web pages so right here
I'm circling project Spartan because
circles are the main thing you can do
that you can highlight parts that you
think is important and the main thing is
once you're done you can then go out and
share it to OneNote or fire it off on
Twitter or something so that's what
we've got from products part in so far
it's a little bit buggy a little early
and things are probably going to change
over the next few months is Microsoft
prepares it for Windows 10 but this is
the start of Microsoft's new web browser
and it's really important that this is
going to be a new browser project
Spartan isn't going through the final
name
expected to be renamed something
probably with Microsoft in front of it
and that's really the key here Internet
Explorer has had a bad name since
basically the mid 2000s and that's kept
a lot of people away from it once
Microsoft replaces it in windows 10
there's a hope that it'll be able to get
people back on board again and it's
hoping these flashing new features will
just help that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
