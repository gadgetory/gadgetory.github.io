here at CES 2016 I am about to have a
chat with my good buddy Robert Kinsel so
what are the what are the demographics
look like for you how many people are
consuming YouTube on mobile versus
desktop and how has that shifted over
the last couple of years I mean for us
in the last four years we've gone from
you know less than 5% of our consumption
being on mobile you know you know
getting close to 60% so it's been a
tremendous shift in terms of how much
people are using their phones and
tablets to access video and it's not
really limited to any demographic
anymore it's it's pretty much evenly
split I was at a party the other day and
somebody was showing me 360-degree video
and it was a really great experience
even without a VR headset on it was a
guy surfing you know I said hey check
out this video and then we started
scrolling through and we're inside the
way we're looking you know behind the
wave so do you feel like 360-degree
video is kind of the gateway drug
that'll get people you know ready for VR
into VR or maybe a better way to think
about it is out there shooting with the
kind of cameras that make sense Ruby R
yeah it's definitely the first step and
that's you know why we've adopted it
early on and now it's expanding from you
know 360 to 3d and VR and eventually
live VR and you know so you can
naturally see this progression but yeah
definitely 360 is the way to get started
and it's fun another service that this
year really blew me away was Spotify you
know they have this playlist that they
give me every week and it's been an
incredible discovery experience and
actually now I started to do that with
you know YouTube music getting like a
playlist of videos I guess like one of
the things that really struck me which
is funny is that like MTV kind of like
went away it didn't they stopped playing
music videos maybe like five or ten
years ago they became like a reality
television station and I put YouTube
music on my chromecast on the TV and it
was then it was like oh this is like MTV
again like there's a bunch of music
videos in a row that I like this is such
a great experience why does anybody do
that
well you know I think what you're seeing
is technology just an unlimited show
space enabling you know not really new
business models their existing business
models that were there before but for
one reason or another they moved away
you know for MTV it was the limited
shelf space where they had to decide now
we're gonna put on reality shows are we
gonna put on music videos and they went
in favor of real reality shows for us we
don't have to make that choice right
I remember watching MTV and just getting
a stream of videos but in this case it's
personalized for me which is a bit more
exciting right and you can do that at
scale you don't have to decide what
we're gonna play these 10 videos because
they're the most popular we won't play
the artists that we think is kind of
decent now you know everybody just gets
their own personalized and you know and
you do music app we offer you both we
offer the personalized streams that
you're talking about but we also have a
trending tab where you can see what's
hot on right YouTube right now and right
if you want to do that and then you can
explore that so I know you're not gonna
give me any big news break here by
telling me how many people have signed
up for YouTube red but it's been in the
market for how long now 6 weeks 6 weeks
so just give me your thoughts you know
stuff that you can share high level you
know what are you seeing what does the
user behavior what's interesting or
surprising so there are two things that
happen with YouTube red one is you know
we launched it launched the a free
version of YouTube then a few weeks
later we launched YouTube music which is
a critical component of YouTube red and
that you know in unlocking all the great
features like background listening
offline and etc and so what we've been
really watching is what is the adoption
of YouTube music and what is the
consumption in that app and how that
compares to the consumption within the
main app and we're incredibly excited
about people embracing it and spending a
lot of time engaging with music and in
the YouTube Music app because it when
they do you know that they're ascribing
value and they're deriving value from
the features that they're getting there
in the content that they're getting and
then that translates into YouTube bread
success right so far we've been very
very encouraged with what we're saying
so my auto editor asked me to bring this
question up we were thinking about
driverless cars and the experience of
that you know
I have to drive my family places a lot
two and a half hours in the road with
two kids crying in the back it's a kind
of miserable experience especially me
behind the wheel if we were in a
driverless car for two and a half hours
we'd probably want something to do and
you thought it all about what it would
be like to try and provide entertainment
for something like that is that too far
down the road I don't know I have one
suggestion for you it's called YouTube
red and you can offline content right so
you take your tablets put your kids on
the tablets and you can offline write
whatever content whatever playlists you
want them you can have them engage for
two-and-a-half hours okay that is one of
the great values of YouTube brands I'll
leave it on that shameless plug right
there
so that was Robert kids'll chief
business officer at YouTube we're here
at CES 2016 be sure to subscribe to the
YouTube channel and come back for more
great videos all right thank you so much
