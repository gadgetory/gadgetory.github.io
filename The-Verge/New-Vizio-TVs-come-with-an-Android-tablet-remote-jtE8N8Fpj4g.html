a new video P series which is the
company's latest Smart TV it's actually
kind of a radical different idea for
Smart TVs if you look at it you might
notice it looks exactly like what a
chromecast looks like when it's plugged
into your TV
that's because videos pulled out all of
the software all of the UI all of the
apps on TV itself all of that is now
happening on this which is the Vizio
Smart Remote it's a six inch Android
tablet that's running a new app called
Smart cast it's interesting about this
is if you really think about it it's
just a little Android tablet you don't
need to control the TV with it you can
walk away and just watch stuff on it all
by yourself it's totally self-contained
but then when you're in your house
control all your TVs with cast it's got
a little light sensor there there's no
cameras or anything it's a remote but it
looks really nice as an eight-course
Qualcomm processor inside mini USB
charging obviously sleep/wake button
headphone jack so a cool thing is it's
wireless charging and when you stick it
back on the wireless charger with a
smart cast app open it will
automatically pull up the main control
app so you can just grab it
and you're good to go what Vizio hasn't
done however which is really interesting
is they haven't like super themed
Android or super skin to Android so this
is basically stock Android L Vizio says
marshmallows come in this thing soon and
they've actually been so polite to
Android that it doesn't do the control
thing when you set up a wireless charger
but without the app of it so you can see
all the basics are here you can see I'm
controlling the volume on the TV just
using the cast app here and then I can
do Google cast stuff so and go out and
close this app entirely there's so many
familiar Android apps here I can just
open one like YouTube I've got this
Jimmy Fallon video going hit play here
it's going to play on the device but
really I want to watch them TV so I just
hit the cast button this is really
familiar and now it's going to start
playing directly on the television here
and then the volume buttons on the
tablet actually mapped directly to TV so
I can just turn the volume up and down
using the hardware I'm out here Vizio is
also bundling in a box an actual
physical note that's very familiar it's
super cut down sleek beautiful volume
buttons wheres over IR what's
interesting is Ashley's channel buttons
which they're going to map to other apps
support channel switching so there's no
tutor in the TV you can't like get
linear TV on it these channel buttons
are here for apps and then it's
fascinating hit play pause actually will
control the chromecast stream and hit
pause right here but the big trick
inside of the Smart cast app vizio is
showing you all of the stuff that you
might otherwise see in a Smart TV
so all of the UI that you normally see
in this one city is now in your hand
it's going to show you all the content
that's available on your services make
it easier to discover and find share
your suggestions so we can just hit
movies here it knows a like Mad Max you
hit this you hit watch now you'll show
you the services you can get it from we
can just hit play in Mad Max and show
playing on TV over Vudu so this is kind
of the most integrated implementation
we've ever seen of cast discovery and
hardware this remote in TV all the stuff
goes on sale March 27</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
