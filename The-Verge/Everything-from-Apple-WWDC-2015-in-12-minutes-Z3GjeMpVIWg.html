have something pretty incredible to say
yeah just hope he doesn't get booed
either way we're getting three watches
out of it
welcome to WWDC 2015 I'd like to bring
out my friend and colleague Craig
federighi
to take you through OS 10 and iOS and so
the new name for OS 10 is OS 10 El
Capitan for I just do that little shake
we all normally do there it is it comes
right out to greet you it's really handy
but I can also express myself in my own
words and spotlight searches now so I
can do things like slides from Brian you
see I find those there but how about
slides from Brian about El Capitan I
might say something like documents I
worked on last June now we've done
something totally new to El Capitan
and it's the ability to work really
easily on two windows side by side so
I'm just going to click and hold here on
the green button and you see it that
prompting me to pick a side I'll just
drop it in and you notice I get an
expose of all my other windows let me
pick the new news app just like that but
I can also do this to take a window full
screen so let's take photos just drop it
in right here
I took it fullscreen and now check this
out I'm going to take messages drop it
on photos and create a split view this
year we're bringing metal to the Mac of
course this is great news for games but
also for the tools that we use to make
those games we need something a bit
better than this broom
nice that looks like an enemies broke it
into our board all right now El Capitan
is available to all of you developers
today we'll be doing a public beta once
again in July and we'll be rolling out
to everyone with a free upgrade this
fall so we're now looking forward to iOS
9 and so now you can say things like
remind me about this when I get home and
that reminder refers right back the link
to specifically what you were looking at
when you took that reminder
so say you like to run in the morning
and when you do you'd like to listen to
music well now your phone can learn that
about you and when you plug in your
headphones can offer up now playing
automatically right on the lockscreen
your iPhone can now take invitations
that you receive in your email and
without you even touching them
automatically put them on your calendar
so now when a user performs a search we
can find content behind the apps they
have installed on the device and pull
those up and results and when they tap
their deep linked directly into the
application show my karaoke photos of
Eddie oh that is the master at work we
don't mine your email your photos or
your contacts in the cloud to learn
things about you we honestly just don't
want to know I hope you've all tried
Apple pay with our super easy secure and
private way to pay first you'll be able
to add your store credit and debit cards
we will also add loyalty and rewards
cards also with a great lineup of
merchants with the expansion of Apple
pay in the new types of cards we've
decided it's time to rename passbook to
wallet but we know for a lot of our iOS
users they're fun they're mostly focused
on public transit and so now we've
created a great map just for them buses
and trains subway stations and so forth
and so we carefully surveyed all of the
entrances and exits so that we could
give you walking directions based on the
time to travel from where you actually
are
to be rolling maps out transit starting
with these cities across the world and
with these and 300 more in China news is
beautiful content from the world's
greatest sources personalized for you
it's a beautiful seed and what's really
cool about this is they're a powerful
machine learning algorithms that analyze
the contents of the articles to figure
out which stories belong in which
article next let's turn to iPad and so
now when you want to move the cursor or
make a selection you can now just put
two fingers down on the keyboard and it
becomes a trackpad instantly of course
you can use the shortcut bar to cut drag
to a new plate place and paste editing
more quickly than ever before and
without your fingers ever leaving the
home row but now I want to turn to the
big one and that's multitasking and what
I'm going to do first is double tap on
the home button and you'll see our new
task switcher so now with just a single
finger swipe from the side I can slide
it right in with what we call slide over
now from the top I can pull down and
bring in other applications so let's
bring in calendar so I can just tap here
on the divider and now I'm in split view
they're both completely active in fact
for the first time ever multi app
multi-touch I can move them both at the
same time notes is actually pinned to
the side now so I want to show you what
happens when I switch apps I'm just
going to move over here to photos and
you notice now I have photos with notes
on the side this is really great if I'm
taking notes while working across a
bunch of different experiences and of
course those four finger gestures
continue to work great so I can just
swipe my way right back into Safari like
that and let's say I want to now work on
notes or notes full screen I can just
pull right across like that and I'm in
full screen notes and I want to watch
once you watch what happens when I tap
watch the video now I have
picture-in-picture
I can of course resize the PIP if I want
like this I can even move it off the
side sometimes I just want to listen for
a while while I work slide over is
available for the iPad air air to Mini 2
and Mini 3 as is picture-in-picture
and our most powerful split view is
available on a most powerful iPad the
iPad air 2 in iOS 9 we give you a single
switched inner what we call low-power
mode and it pulls levers that you didn't
even know existed and is able to extend
battery life for an additional three
hours and we've been able to reduce the
amount of free space you need to get to
iOS 9 from the four point six gigs that
it took to get iOS 8 down to just one
point three so I think everyone's going
to be getting dials now finally let's
talk about Swift today we're announcing
that Swift will be open source
we're doing a developer beta you guessed
it today and for the first time for a
major iOS release of public beta so sign
up now at beta Apple comm and you can
get the beta when it comes out in July
and of course we'll be rolling it out as
a free upgrade in the fall
iOS 9 will support all of the devices
that were supported by iOS 8 we're not
dropping any this year because we want
everyone to get iOS 9 so we're moving
really fast on watch OS and I'm super
excited to talk with you about the
enhancements that are coming in watch OS
as well as the powerful new abilities
for app development
now with watch OS 2 we're really excited
to enable app developers to make your
own complications what would be a great
experience for the watch when it's on
your nightstand and charging well we've
come up with a new user interface for
this and watch OS 2 called nightstand
mode also an email you can already read
an email on your watch with watch OS 2
you'll be able to reply to email with
watch OS 2 we're enabling your favorite
fitness apps to run natively on the
watch so you can use them wherever you
are and your workouts with these apps
will contribute directly to your all-day
activity well with native apps you'll be
able to actually move that logic to the
watch so both the UI and the logic are
they're all run locally that sounds
great
so you can see as I was recording it it
got the audio levels of my voice and now
it's sent that to Becky and I'm really
happy to say that this stuff is all
available to you today to start building
these native apps and then it'll be
available in the fall to everyone and
will work across all the watches of
course and it will be free we do have
one more thing
today we're announcing Apple music the
next chapter in music I'm here because
in 2003 the record industry was a ball
of confusion we had Napster we had
LimeWire we had BitTorrent is giant
invader from the north technology

least an apple and I'm going to
introduce you to Apple music it's all

about to turn off the reps and the next

can you imagine being an up-and-coming
artist and being able to share your
music on the biggest music platform in
the world that people already have Apple

fans closer to the artists they love and
we call it connect now it's a place
where artists are free to upload their
music their videos their photos all
directly to a fan when you upload your
music to Apple music anything can happen
and instead of having to post your stuff
on all these different and sometimes
confusing places it all lives in one
very simple very easy place and that is
connect

next album let's see what they have to
say I'm really excited to it by name 40
