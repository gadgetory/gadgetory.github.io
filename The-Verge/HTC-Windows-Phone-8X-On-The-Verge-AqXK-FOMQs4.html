some HTC phones here that are awfully
cool looking in fact I'm gonna bring
them out check these out I think I have
to say I'm getting excited sexually
about about what people are doing with
starting to do with phones I mean for a
long time none of you guys can see these
then I made a vow I can see them too
right they're made of polycarbonate I'll
pound I'm gonna pass them down check
that's not there you go I won't take I
want to the ground gonna just give you
that color instead I mean because you
want the other one so these are not out
yet but these are new windows phone
devices and they're awesome looking am I
crazy no they look great miss this to me
is like a tease ski gear yeah which is
is that cool that's cool right yeah uh
okay too but they're really nicely made
plastic yeah Oh much fun I just want to
say like and this is not too big a base
you see or whatever but I mean I do wish
these had android instead of Windows
Phone but I just think there's an HTC
guy in here right now actually crying uh
I just think we need to get a little
crazier with that phone Disney I think
Mike like probably pushing these are
colors right colors you know Nokia's
doing it as well I mean Apple can't be
the only guys who are doing in cool
phone design like it needs to end all
right i can go i can launch into a big
rant about this but i think if you're if
you're competing with apple and by the
way you are if you're making smartphones
mmm you need to bring your A game I ran
it about this in the podcast let's not
you need to bring your a-game this be
Selah I'm seeing some D stuff out there
hop just stop that what was that LG
really they made a square LG LG someone
who will not be sponsoring any future
author EL it happens we can't editor
actually the other two you want it you
want to say about these my new phone
ring give me a river the thing that then
is they look best together right that's
true you gotta buy us like the phone
that i want is like this look like alone
yeah like having one like they just
lonely without each other you want a
striped phone it's like it's like the
beatles recording technique where you
have like two voices seeing over
yourself and it harmonies what you're
describing oh it's not harmony is it's
it's you know john lennon would do it
cuz is with Paul with Paul McCartney
know how Harvey which was owned
voiceover so no he would double his
doubling which one is reasonably okay
I'm not gonna
details here I'm not getting into the
details at all anyhow I'm just happy to
see my point is the iphone 5 is really
beautiful but these are really beautiful
too in a different way I think I'm
thrilled I feel like you look at the
galaxy s3 or for whatever it is and like
it's like oh that's good it has a larger
screen right that's empirically great
phone but this is just like oh my gosh I
need that right now yeah I mean I have
no use for love to see what Windows
Phone 8 is like yeah I'm not buying
these right now yeah but i would
consider buying them and that's the
important thing well you know the rumor
is that HTC is making the next Nexus
device would you wait is that the rumor
that's the rumor this make this the
Nexus just put android on I or whatever
I'm not you're gonna get you a nerd rant
and we'll be here all night as Iran</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
