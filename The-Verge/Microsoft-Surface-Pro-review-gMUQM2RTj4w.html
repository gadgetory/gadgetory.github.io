this is the Microsoft Surface pro this
is basically the real deal kind of no
compromises surface instead of running
Windows RT a low powered operating
system the surface pro is a full-fledged
Windows 8 machine with all of the bells
and whistles you'd expect from a
high-end laptop it's also $900 for the
cheapest model so it's competing with
some of the best devices out there but
in theory can do so there bunch of
changes from the surface RT which we
reviewed back in October but most of
those are under the hood and I'll get to
those in a minute first there are some
really key Hardware differences here to
the general surface look and feel hasn't
really changed this is still a well made
good-looking tablet it's made of
Microsoft's vapor mg material which
feels a little bit like aluminum and
it's really clean and simple and it
comes in black and is really just a
sleek device but this is bigger than the
surface RT it's a lot bigger it's
thirteen point five millimeters thick
whereas the surface RT is less than 10
and that makes a big difference as does
the extra half pound of weight on the
surface pro it's not terribly
uncomfortable in both hands if you're
using it on your lap but you absolutely
can't use this device in one hand and
it's really not very comfortable to
stand and hold part of the reason the
surface pro is so much thicker is the
ventilation strip running around all
four edges of the device which is what's
used to cool the more powerful Intel
processor that adds a little bit of a
gap around all the edges so it's not
quite as unibody feeling as the surface
RT but it still looks fine one thing you
gain in exchange for the extra heft is a
gorgeous ten point six inch 1080p
display it looks amazing it's one of the
best screens I've ever seen it has
basically perfect color reproduction
ridiculous viewing angles and it's
incredibly responsive the pro has ten
points of multi-touch and they actually
work great the surface RT for some
reason only had five points of
multi-touch and I found myself using
more than five fingers a lot more often
than I thought the surface pro also
comes with a pen a capacitive stylus
that actually works really well on the
device it's made by Wacom and is just a
nice addition to a device like this it's
not something you use all the time but
it's great for drawing or taking notes
or scribbling on a screenshot the pen
attaches to the side of the surface so
you really won't lose it but it falls
off every single time you put the device
in your bag so a few things have changed
but the basic idea of the surface hasn't
and that's really my biggest problem
with this device the kickstand only
opens at one angle which means you have
to sit just right to use it properly and
it's absolutely impossible to use
propped up on
that it just falls off every single time
it still connects to the touch cover and
type cover which are okay I've really
grown to like the type cover but I still
think the touch cover is as much a
gimmick as anything else they hold
firmly to the magnet though and work
just as you'd expect if you've used a
surface RT I have some real issues with
the entire surface concept but I will
say this if you want a surface this is
the one to get and it's not even close
the surface RT had some real performance
issues and it couldn't run all the apps
we wanted anyway but the surface pro has
no such problem it absolutely flies
whether you're switching between a dozen
apps or just swiping around the
interface it's basically flawless eye
it's really the best proof I've seen yet
that Windows 8 is a fully finished
operating system this isn't a gaming PC
of course it's more like an ultrabook in
that way but it works fantastically well
in everyday use as I mentioned this is
full fledged Windows 8 so you get access
to the whole Microsoft Store as well as
to all your legacy Windows apps
unfortunately though the surface pro
doesn't come with a working copy of
office pre-installed like the surface RT
that you'll have to buy separately the
surface pro does all of these things
pretty silently - without many problems
if I hold it up to my ear I can hear the
whirring of the fans coming out of the
vent but otherwise it's quiet enough it
does get a little warm but not so much
as to be a problem like a lot of
ultrabooks we've seen the surface pro
runs in Intel Core i5 processor with 4
gigs of RAM and 64 or 128 gigs of
storage you should definitely get the
bigger model by the way because the base
installation of Windows right out of the
box takes up 41 gigabytes of space all
the internals do make the surface pro
bigger and heavier but the really
significant trade-off is the battery
life the surface Pro's battery lasted
just shy of 4 hours on our battery tests
which is considerably below average for
a laptop for a device that pretends to
be something like a tablet it's terrible
but all that said here's the thing about
the surface pro it's the best surface by
a long shot but I'm less and less
convinced that you want a surface in the
first place if you want a device that
you can move relatively easily from desk
to desk this is a good one it's fast and
powerful and still lighter and more
portable than most laptops out there and
make no mistake this is a laptop but
it's absolutely useless as a literal
laptop as a device do you use on your
lap it's fine when you use it as a
tablet but I spend a lot of time sitting
on my couch feet up on the coffee table
working on my macbook air and that's
just completely impossible on the
surface Pro I like the surface pro and
I'm impressed that Microsoft built such
a powerful machine in such a handsome
simple body but if you're in the market
for a tablet this isn't that at all and
if you're in the market for a laptop
you're $900 is probably better spent
elsewhere at least until Microsoft
figures out how to make the surface
usable away from your desk</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
