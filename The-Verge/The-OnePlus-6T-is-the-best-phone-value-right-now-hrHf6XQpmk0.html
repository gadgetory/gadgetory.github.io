like this
the oneplus six but with a couple of
significant changes you'll be able to
buy it starting on November 1st for 549
dollars and up now before I get to some
of the other changes that are on the 16
there's a big one that a lot of you have
been waiting for the 1 plus 60 is the
first one plus phone that can be used on
Verizon this is huge you can finally use
a 1 plus phone on the biggest carrier in
the u.s. complete with LTE and multi
service in addition the 1 plus 60 will
be sold directly by t-mobile in the US
making it the first one plus phone to be
sold by any carrier here you'll be able
to find in every t-mobile store and use
t-mobile's device payment plans combined
with your phone bill to purchase it this
is a big deal for oneplus which has only
sold its phones online in the US and
it'll continue to do so so if you want
to order it online you can and if you're
in the UK oneplus will be selling the 60
on every major carrier plus on Amazon
and at John Lewis stores okay so let's
talk about the phone itself there aren't
a ton of changes from the 6 that was
just released in May of this year but
there are a handful of new things that
are pretty significant let's start with
the display it's still an edge-to-edge
OLED screen but now it's even larger at
6.4 inches the bottom chin is one
millimeter smaller and the notch at the
top is way smaller than before it's got
this little teardrop kind of shape if
you hate notches this is probably the
only one that you'll be able to tolerate
but even more significant is that under
this screen is a fingerprint scanner for
unlocking the phone
oneplus has removed the traditional
fingerprint scanner that was on the back
of the 6 and completely embedded it
inside the 16 screen that makes the 60
the first phone in the u.s. to offer
this kind of feature now you can use it
to unlock the phone log into apps that
support fingerprint logins like your
bank account app or something like that
or authenticate locked data and apps
oneplus says that it works through
screen protectors and through small
scratches on the screen and it's just as
secure as the traditional-style scanners
now the company claims that this scanner
is the fastest in screen scanner in any
phone but I don't really have a bunch of
other phones with this feature to
compare it to
but I can tell you that it's not as fast
as the traditional fingerprint reader
that you're probably used to there's a
little pause or beat each time you use
it because the light has to illuminate
before it scans your finger and then the
phone unlocks I don't think this is a
huge problem it's still fast and it
still works reliably most of the time
but it is noticeable now if you do want
a faster more convenient but way less
secure way to unlock your phone the 60
has the same face unlocking system that
uses the front camera and is wicked fast
inside the 60 has the same set of specs
as before it's a Snapdragon a 45
processor 6 or 8 gigs of ram up to 256
gigs of storage what's different is you
can't buy a 64 gig model anymore the
base model of the 60 starts at 128 and
one plus has also bumped out the battery
capacity up to 3,700 milliamp hours
which it says provides 20% more battery
life than the 6 I haven't been using the
16 long enough to test this but it's a
significantly larger battery pushing the
same processor in same screen resolution
so it's safe to assume that it will
probably last longer than before that
bigger battery does change a couple of
things with the body of the phone it's a
little thicker and a little heavier than
before and the back has more of a curve
than 6
I actually find it to be nicer to hold
in the 6 though it fits my hand better
and it just feels more substantial but
this is still a big phone and if you
find big phones to be hard to use you're
gonna have a hard time with this one the
other big thing that oneplus changed is
that it removed the headphone jack goes
on the 6 now it's just as annoying here
as it is on the pixel or the iPhone or
any other phone without a headphone jack
but oneplus is including a little
adapter in the box you can use your 3.5
millimeter headphone with it you might
also miss the notification LED at the
top which has been removed in the
pursuit of this tiny little teardrop
notch and oneplus still isn't offering
wireless charging which is a bummer when
practically every other phone has it now
and it still doesn't have proper
water-resistant certification but it
does have one plus it's extremely fast
wired charging provided you use the
included charging braking cable that
come in the box
the 60 s camera hardware is exactly the
same as before it's got a 16 megapixel
main camera with a 20 megapixel 2nd
sensor for portrait effects plus a 16
megapixel front camera but oneplus has
added a bunch of software tweaks and a
couple of new features including a
better portrait mode but
low-light shots and a new nightscape
mode for nighttime landscapes and
cityscapes and if you have a one plus
six all of those new camera features
will be coming in a software update so
look out for that the 60 is launching
with one plus is oxygen OS on top of
Android 9pi it does have a couple of new
features is going to improve gesture
control system and some better memory
management tweaks so there you go that's
the new one plus sixty just like the
three T and the five TB for it it takes
the phone that one plus launched a few
months ago tweaks it refines it and
makes it a better overall device it's a
really good phone and it still has a
really aggressive price especially
compared to the new phones from Apple
and Google and this time around
Verizon users get to join the fun hey
