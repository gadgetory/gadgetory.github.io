over a year ago at Google i/o we
announced Android had 1 billion 30-day
active devices we now have 1.4 billion
today I'm super excited to announce not
one but two amazing new Nexus phones the
Nexus 5x and the Nexus 6p the Nexus 6p
has an incredibly vibrant 5.7 inch wqhd
AMOLED display the phone is available in
three colors frost white aluminium and
graphite it's crafted from Aeronautical
grade anodized aluminium the brand new
USB type-c port brings fast charging now
the Nexus 6p has the best camera
we've ever put into a Nexus device a
twelve point three megapixel Sony
imaging sensor with enormous 1.55 micron
pixels we've also incorporated a
high-resolution eight megapixel front
facing camera with HDR plus the 6p comes
with Nexus imprint an incredibly fast
and accurate fingerprint sensor on the
back of the phone to complement the way
you naturally hold it
fingerprint unlocking is super
convenient when combined with Android
pay so when you're in a store simply
touch the back ear phones unlock tap the
payment terminal to complete your
purchase the Nexus 6p runs the latest
Android 6.0 software codename
marshmallow now the Nexus 5x offers
top-of-the-line performance in a compact
affordable package it has a beautiful
5.2 inch display and the Nexus 5x has
some of the same great hardware features
you'll find in the Nexus 6p the phone
itself is available in carbon black
quartz white and ice blue also you this
year is slow motion video
I'd like to talk to you about the new
Android sensor hub this is a dedicated
low-power processor that connects
directly to the phone sensors and runs
Google's unique sensor algorithms so
it's smart enough to track your run or
your biking I wanted to show you a few
more examples of polish and crack
one chef that can be found throughout
marshmallow with extended quick access
to Google Voice Search and actions so we
just swipe from the left corner and then
you can simply say what you want
we've also added on device intelligent
prediction engine to learn your pattern
of app launches over time we've reduced
the number of preloaded apps on the
phone to make the Edit box experience
cleaner and simpler now on tap brings
the power of Google search to whatever
you're doing on the phone you simply tap
and hold the home button to get quick
information and actions with that
leaving the app you're currently in
another cool feature in Android is Voice
Actions we've extended this feature to
enable app developers to build
conversational voice experiences
directly into their own app both the
Nexus 5x and 6p support always-on ok
Google detection that works even when
the screen is off we made androids
smarter about how it manages power with
the new doze mode
we've also optimized the system to
prioritize the apps use more frequently
over those that you don't Android 6.0
marshmallow will begin rolling out to
existing Nexus devices starting next

Nexus player starting today the Nexus 5x
