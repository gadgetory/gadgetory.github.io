you've been on YouTube much in the past
few months you've probably seen this
phone before or maybe you read some
suspicious user reviews but despite
always best efforts nobody in the US has
been able to buy this phone until just
this month when it went on sale unlocked
in a handful of places like Amazon or
Best Buy now there's a whole backstory
about while we trying to break into the
US market with this particular phone and
how it's been completely unable to get
any carrier support despite coming
awfully close now that might be due to
some factors that are outside of Wally's
control such as a distrust of the
company by the US government but it got
me wondering is the main 10 profile
anyone should buy even if Huawei had
been able to get it on AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon
or any other US carrier would anyone
have bought it anyways in terms of
hardware the 799 dollar may 10 Pro has
almost everything you'd expect from a
flagship phone in late 2017 or early
2018 it has a metal and glass body with
great build quality and tight tolerances
it's water-resistant it has a tall
aspect ratio screen minimal bezels it
has stereo speakers and of course a dual
rear camera system inside of the phone
is while weighs own top-of-the-line
processor six gigabytes of RAM and 128
gigabytes of storage there's a huge 4000
milliamp hour battery that can keep it
going all day and then some it even has
an IR blaster so you can use it to
control your TV or other electronics and
like many other high-end phones it
doesn't have a headphone jack but while
we does provide both these earPod
knockoff headphones and a USB c2 3.5
millimeter adapter in the box it also
doesn't have wireless charging despite
the fact that it has a glass back but
those are fairly minor complaints if
there's a hardware feature you want the
me 10 pro probably has it and for the
most part the hardware works really well
maintain pros as fast as any recent
Android flagship the hardware is nice to
hold and like I said before it has
terrific battery life it doesn't have
any obvious annoyance it's like a poorly
placed fingerprint sensor or extra
button for voice assistant you'll never
use or a notch that covers up part of
the top of the screen
the 6-inch display is a lower-resolution
many of its peers at only 1080p but I
haven't really had an issue with that
it's OLED so as deep blacks and vibrant
colors and as excellent viewing angles
and it gets bright enough outdoors for
sunny days I really like to meet 10 Pro
speakers which automatically switch from
mono to stereo when you turn the phone
from portrait to landscape and while I
wouldn't say that the like of branded
rear cameras as good as say like a pixel
2 or an iPhone 10 it's certainly a
capable shooter with fast focus and
performance good detail and pleasing if
maybe a little bit saturated colors the
app has a ton of features and options
including manual controls various
portrait and fake blurring modes and
automatic scene functions that attempt
to optimize the camera for whatever your
subject happens to be my favorite mode
is a monochrome option which only uses
data from one of the main 10 prosense
errs produce some of the nicest
black-and-white images you can get from
a smartphone but as good as this
hardware is Huawei software never lives
up to the hardware's potential now the
may 10 Pro does run Android 8.0 Oreo but
it has Huawei's emui interface on top of
it and this is about as far from a clean
version of android as you can get the
best way I can describe it is it's a
poorly made knockoff of iOS Huawei has
customized almost everything about
Android and often it's not in a good way
for example you can't expand
notifications in the lockscreen like you
can do with every other Android phone so
deleting an email or marking it to do
complete can't be done without unlocking
the phone the settings menu and the
share sheet have been lifted right out
of iOS and most of the apps for sharing
are hidden by default for some
inexplicable reason sure you can change
some of those things by downloading a
different launch or messaging app or
whatever but you can't change things
like the quick settings menu that
doesn't match the rest of the
notification shade or that awful share
sheet on top of that there's frustrating
bugs even when I did download another
launcher and attempted to use that the
make 10 would frequently reset the
default to Huawei zone launcher this
just isn't the kind of software
experience I expect on an $800 phone
especially when there are already so
many better options available it's bad
enough for me to say that nobody should
buy the may 10 Pro especially not at
this price you can get all of the
hardware performance with none of the
software headaches from any number of
other Android phones available unlocked
or through carriers then I think about
what would have happened had Huawei been
able to launch this phone with AT&amp;amp;T and
how worse everything would have been
with a carrier's bloatware loaded on top
of it it just makes me feel like this
wouldn't have made much of a difference
for huawei it's hard to see anyone
buying this phone as it is right now
carrier support or not I think that
Huawei has done a lot right with the
main 10 pros hardware and if it wasn't
so expensive I could perhaps excuse some
of its software issues but this is a
premium priced phone and you should get
a premium experience with it which
unfortunately the mate 10 Pro doesn't
provide how it's been completely unable
to get any carrier support despite
coming awfully close trying to do work
