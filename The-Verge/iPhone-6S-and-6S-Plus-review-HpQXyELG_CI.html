review a new iPhone and because it's an
S year for the iPhone we're gonna have
to look a little bit deeper for changes
but that's okay it turns out that these
new phones are all about going deeper
this is the iPhone 6s and this is the
iPhone 6s plus surprise they look just
like the iPhone 6 in the iPhone 6 plus
let's just get this out there I think if
you're buying an iPhone you should buy
the bigger 6s plus it's clear that
phones with bigger screens are going to
dominate the market then you get a
slightly better camera and battery life
to boot so it's actually really hard to
review the iPhone 6s and the 6s plus
it's the iPhone Apple sales are
skyrocketing all these people are on me
in Times Square
are taking pictures with their iPhones
the question isn't about specs of course
the specs are getting better the
question is about how the decision
apples made with this phone will trickle
into all of the millions of iPhones
they'll sell in the future the biggest
new feature of the iPhone 6s is 3d touch
which lets you actually push into the
screen to activate additional features
there's also a new 12 megapixel camera
that can shoot 4k videos and something
Apple calls live photos which are kind
of like a combination of a photo a gift
and a video because the iPhone 6s and 6s
plus looked just like the six and six
plus I think it's fair to say that
they're not the world's most beautiful
phones the weird antenna lines in the
back and the slippery shape pretty much
just demand that you put them in a case
but the body is made of a new higher
strength aluminum and the screen has
been upgraded with a stronger glass
cover so if you have an iPhone 6 you'll
definitely notice the 6s and 6s plus are
a little bit thicker and heavier than
the previous models it's not much it's
just a few millimeters and a few grams
but it's definitely noticeable I
actually prefer the slightly heavier 6s
to the 6 it feels a little bit less like
it's going to fly out of my hands all
the time the exercising weight comes
from the 3d touch components which are
network of 96 sensors under the screen
that measure the distance between the
glass and the backlight when you push
down on the screen that distance changes
and the phone can respond so on the home
screen pushing an icon gives you a list
of quick actions you can take in certain
apps and when you're browsing in Safari
you can push lightly to get a preview of
a link and push it a little bit harder
to pop it open into a window it's kind
of like a little right-click for your
phone you don't really need it but once
you get used to it it's incredible
useful that dynamic what Apple calls
peak and pop is really the key to 3d
touch it's not just like a button it's a
way for the phone to sense an entire
range of pressures all over the screen
when you press down an icon on the home
screen you see the background blur out
in response to how hard you're pressing
it's not useful but it's really cool and
it enhances the sense that iOS is all
about layers of information something
Apple introduced the iPhone when Johnny
I've dramatically redesigned iOS 7 3d
touch feels like a big step along a path
that's been taking shape ever since but
here's the thing 3d touch won't really
be all that useful until all your
third-party apps are using it right now
it only really works in Apple's apps so
it's actually kind of easy to forget
about it especially since Apple's
built-in iPhone apps like mail and
calendar kind of the weakest parts of
the iPhone and that means 3d touch won't
make a lot of sense for the next minute
there's not a lot of rules for how app
developers use it we're going to need a
whole language for all these new kinds
of pokes and presses it's going to take
a while
the upside is that 3d touch already
feels much more natural than forced
touch on the Apple watch which kind of
does wildly different things in
different apps and demos from apps like
Instagram and others are pretty
encouraging and a potential for pressure
sensitive gaming is off the charts 3d
touch might make games the iPhone
something much more exciting than just
furiously swiping on the screen if you
have a big new feature of the iPhone 6s
is the upgraded cameras the most
important change might actually be to
the front camera it's now 5 megapixels
up from a tiny 1.2 that means it takes
dramatically better photos and videos
just a thing for selfies snapchats and
FaceTime and the entire screen lights up
as a flash which means low-light shots
with the fun camera are much improved as
well on the back apples boosted the
resolution of the rear camera to 12
megapixels up from 8 and added the
ability to shoot 4k video the iPhone is
always taking the best in most natural
photos of any phone so this is a pretty
mild update the actual photos from the
iPhone 6s aren't dramatically better
than the photos from the iPhone 6
they're better but not so much intensely
better that you'll notice a difference
if you're just sharing them on Facebook
you'll need to really blow them up to
see the improvement both cameras can
take Apple's new live photos which are a
little strange when you press the
shutter button you'll see a little live
indicator pop up letting you know that
the phone is recording a few frames
before and after your
shot later in your camera roll you can
3d touch the photo to playback a short
audio and video clip of what you
captured it's neat but you've got to
remember to keep your camera pointed at
your subject after you've shot a photo I
have a lot of live photos of me putting
the camera down you can share live
photos with anyone using iOS 9 watch OS
2 or OS 10 I'll copy ton Apple also says
it'll put out an API to let live photos
work in third-party apps and on the web
but I'm not really holding my breath for
them and take off if you want to record
short videos apps like vine and
Instagram already worked great they work
everywhere including Android phones and
live photos take up double the space of
regular photos so having every single
photo you take include a short video
seems like overkill it's a cool feature
that you should turn on when you want
but probably turn off by default 4k
video in the iPhone 6s looks great Apple
is very proud of the fact that the a9
processor can do all of the
stabilization and image processing magic
while shooting 4k and then even edit two
streams of 4k video in iMovie
that's legitimately impressive but 4k
video isn't actually on by default you
have to go into settings and turn it on
that's because it takes up a huge amount
of space to record in 4k and there's not
a lot of places to watch that footage
you need a 4k TV or a really high
resolution monitor think of it as a pro
feature it's great to have it'll be nice
in the future but you're not going to
really use it day to day that's kind of
the entire vibe with the iPhone 6s and
it's built for a much more powerful
future it has a ridiculously fast
processor it finally includes 2 gigs of
RAM so apps and web browsing are
smoother than ever the fingerprint
sensor on the front is faster and I got
about the same battery life as an iPhone
6 around a full day with normal use a
little bit longer with iOS 9s low-power
mode which turns down the brightness and
under clocks the processor that's fine
but I'm really hoping the next
generation of phones lasts even longer
3d touch is clearly a new kind of
interface pattern and the cameras are so
good it's hard to even find ways to
fully view what they can capture it's a
series of tiny meaningful improvements
the already great iPhone 6 and if you're
using an iPhone 5s or anything older
it's going to blow your mind the iPhone
6s is the best iPhone ever and probably
the best phone ever the future is great
but here's the thing until a couple
weeks ago the iPhone 6 was the best
phone ever made
and it's still pretty damn good in fact
I can't say that it's worth upgrading to
the 6s from the six it'll definitely be
worth it when every app supports 3d
touch but by then you'll be buying an
iPhone 7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
