artificial intelligence all the time.
Maybe you own a smart speaker
or you've seen a self-driving car
or you've used Google Photos to search
for images of your cat.
Now, there's also a good chance
you've played a video game that happens
to have some AI in it, like God of War
or Red Dead Redemption 2.
What may surprise you is that those
two types of AI are not the same thing.
The AI in digital systems
and autonomous vehicles
is self-learning and really fast,
but it’s also really unpredictable.
Yet these two worlds are fast colliding,
and once game developers
have the right tools
and the freedom to make
games that really push
the limits of AI, the results are going
to be the stuff of science fiction.
(electronic music)
Over the years, AI has become really good
at playing certain games.
Try beating your computer at chess
on the hardest difficulty.
It's pretty much impossible.
Or even if you're a pro StarCraft player,
DeepMind software can now crush you.
I'm here, in the shadows.
But the AI inside of a video game,
that's basically been building off
the same core set of
principles for decades.
Take, for instance, a
classic game like Pac-Man.
At different points, the ghosts evaluate
where you are in the map and
where you might be going,
and then they either chase
you, or they run away from you.
It's not exactly groundbreaking AI,
but it is video game AI nonetheless.
And what's remarkable is that the AI
you encounter in games today hasn't
really changed that much over the years.
Two of the core components
of commercial game AI
are pathfinding and finite state machines.
Julian Togelius is a
professor of computer science
at NYU who spent years
studying the intersection
of gaming and artificial intelligence.
He walked us through the basic toolkit
that underpins a ton of video game AI.
Pathfinding is how to get from
point A to point B in a simple way,
and it’s used in all games all the time.
Finite state machine is
a construct where an NPC
can be in different states
and move between them.
Real AI in commercial games
is more complex than that,
but those are some of
the founding principles.
So using these basics, developers
have created ever-more realistic
game worlds and characters,
but that software is
not exactly intelligent.
That's because game developers have yet
to really utilize key
advancements in the field
of artificial intelligence
research, namely deep learning.
Through the deep learning revolution,
researchers at universities
and tech companies
have made astounding
progress at giving a machine
the means to improve itself over time.
But there's a reason game developers
aren't using that type
of AI to develop games.
Typically, when you design a game,
you want to know what the
player will experience.
And for that, if you go
in to evolve any AI there,
you want the AI to be predictable.
Now, if you just went and
tossed in a neural network
that was constantly adapting and learning
from all the feedback it got from you,
there's a very good chance something
unexpected might happen,
and it could break the game.
And that's a problem for a designer.
Imagine if every single character
in Red Dead Redemption
remembered all of your crimes,
and you couldn't even play anymore
because everyone just
took you down on sight.
I'll put your brains all over you.
The way designers think today
when they're designing games,
they want predictability.
And therefore, they want the relatively
anemic AI we have in games today.
What's more useful for game makers
is taking those traditional approaches,
and trying them at unprecedented scales.
If you play Red Dead Redemption 2,
you've probably seen this clip.
A player firing a warning shot,
which shoots a bird right out of the sky.
What makes it so interesting is that
it isn't a planned part of the
game. It’s completely random.
What?
The individual systems
here, the way that bullets
move through the sky, and where birds
are programmed to fly around,
those are not wildly different
than the pathfinding Pac-Man ghosts.
The difference in a game
like Red Dead Redemption
is that all of its many, many systems
can overlap and run into one another.
The individual pieces aren't intelligent,
but when they come
together, they trick you
into thinking they are.
Haven't you brought
enough misery upon us?
Another game that's great at this
is The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
It's a cohesive world where a
few simple programming rules
around weather, gravity, and even heat
create endlessly surprising moments.
You can use a makeshift
torch to bake an apple
while it's still on a
tree, or drop a bunch
of these weird balloon things on a boat,
and it'll soar into the sky.
Now, is this really AI?
Well, that kind of depends on who you ask.
Some argue it's just automation
or emergent gameplay
because these systems
aren't intelligent, per se.
While others say game AI is less about
trying to pass off a machine as a human,
and more about creating a
sense of wonder and mystery
that makes the game feel real.
So what would honest to goodness
AI-powered video games actually look like?
Well, in the Spike Jonze movie Her,
creator David O'Reilly
conceived of a video game
in which a foul-mouthed character
could react dynamically to
you and your personality.
It could even taunt and bully
you into continuing to play.
Come on, follow me. (beep)
Games like this may seem far
off, but we're getting there.
That's because cutting-edge AI research
is finally bleeding over
into game development.
Today, researchers are
using the kind of AI
that can actually learn
to design entire games,
using a technique known
as procedural generation.
It was popularized most recently
by the indie game No Man's Sky,
but now, AI researchers are using
the same technique to create software
that can design a game
entirely from scratch.
So you can say that not
only do I want to generate
a landscape, but I want
to generate a landscape
where I know there will be choke points,
where we can hide my troops behind,
or I know there will be
places to have a castle on,
and with no deep valleys
you can fall into.
Building off that, game developers
could create games that
don't just generate levels
all on their own, but also
learn what you like as a player.
In the longer-term
future, we're going to see
game directors that
learn to adapt the game
as you are playing it, and
learn to become game masters
that play the player as
the player plays the game.
There are even ways that AI right now
can be used to create the art for games.
Take a look at Nvidia's research
generating game graphics
using deep learning.
What you're seeing is not real,
an AI used a game engine
and some video footage
to teach itself how to generate
an imaginary city block.
One that you could see in a game.
The same technique can even create
all new, never-before-seen faces,
ones that look indistinguishable
from real human beings.
Of course, that doesn't stop with faces.
You could do mountains,
dogs, space ships, whatever.
But the Holy Grail of AI in games
would be a true self-learning character
that is complex and relatable, and it has
a realistic persona
that could build you up.
Do you know how to get out of here?
Or tear you down.
(bleeping)
We're probably not going
to have game characters
that sophisticated for a long time.
In the short term, big game companies
will likely use AI for testing games
and boring stuff like analytics.
But AI is really tricky, and it requires
a ton of tinkering and
training. That's time and money
that game developers don't always have.
So Julian doesn't see the usual suspects
jumping on actual AI
powered games anytime soon.
We need to take the AI capability,
and think about how can we
design a game around that?
And I don't think that's going to happen
from the big AI companies. It’s too risky.
Instead, it might take smaller,
scrappier gaming companies
to lean into AI's quirks
and make something
unexpected and strange
that feels entirely new.
So if something unexpected
or weird happened to you
while you were playing
Red Dead Redemption 2,
or even the new Zelda, describe
it in the comments below.
And if you have one, leave us a link, too.
