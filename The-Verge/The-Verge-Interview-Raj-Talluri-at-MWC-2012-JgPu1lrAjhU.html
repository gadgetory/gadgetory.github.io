Raj salary vice president of product
management for Snapdragon improper and
we're here at mwc in Barcelona and this
is really the first time that you
showing off your new chip the Snapdragon
s4 so start with the basics what is the
Snapdragon we're just composer oh you
know Snapdragon is our platform for
smartphones yeah and it has many many
different components in it you know one
is the leading edge apps processor which
is the CPU the GPU in the video of the
camera and all that and then it also has
our modem technology which is a 2g 3G
and 4G LTE and also it has Wi-Fi
bluetooth FM GPS so it's all of this
combined into one chipset and one you
actually look at it in terms of a
physical yet thing is just one chip
right so basically all of this
technology is in one ship but we also
have a power management and RF which are
like smaller chips on the side but the
majority of all the digital is in one
shall we put it all inside one died
through the RF stuffy you're like a year
away from sticking that into the chip as
well right you just want to pondo
everything again yeah you know we make
those decisions based on the technology
node in our after a different kind of
technology from digital
so you know at any given point of time
you're always making those trade-offs
which goes inside which was outside sure
but most of the digital stuff where all
the heavy lifting is done we put it all
inside one chip and the big change view
is here is that TLT contempt ship is
inside the chipset it's integrating what
everything else I mean that obviously
should bring in some power management
power efficiency confidence right yeah I
mean so so if you look at the LG phones
on the market today basically they have
an app's posture and they have an LTE
modem on the outside and they have two
different memory systems two different
power management's so that's the
multiple chips to make an LT you found
and that's one of the reasons why you
know the man utilizes LTE phones isn't
that what we've done is s4 is for the
first time we've taken the LTE modem and
put it inside a Snapdragon and then we
also did that and we did it in 20 and
nano meter which is a leading edge
process technology so that combination
of a 28 nanometer you know with an algae
modern web site really improves the
power so that we believe that you know
s4 missed you know phones when they come
out and LG they'll have great
performance and extremely low power
which is what we read it is further so
in terms of how much percentages perhaps
more better life in my squeeze our
energy firm with this rock
I don't have precise numbers for you
you'll be much better than I and the
reason I'm saying that is because most
people who go from one for the other
don't keep everything else the same like
they change the display the change the
camera and all that but clearly you know
you know you'll get all day battery life
and you know they perform that's a big
playing Oh they've ever life I would
know TV format that's what we're
shooting it and I still you read come to
dinner I'm speaking of shooting at
things yeah I do you feel like you've
kind of been eating at videos lunch
recently because table 3 devices have
been announced today everyone is excited
about quad core and then they come to
the United States to get LTE and all of
a sudden they have a Qualcomm chip
inside and I seems to be an issue there
because nvidia doesn't have a strategy
or you know
I guess a hardware proposition where LTE
and Coco device are on that so you have
an advantage in that space right yeah
well there's a couple of fun there's a
few different advantages we have you
know our competition you know one of
them is the fact that we are the only
LTE integrated you know product of the
market today that clearly is all the
power advantages and also the die size
advantage cost advantage and all that
that comes with integration but the
other big advantage we have is we are
one of the very few people who make our
own processes so we don't license cpu
core from from arm directly we actually
a licensee of their instruction set and
we build the processor from scratch and
when we do that we get a lot of
advantages like for example you've seen
some of the benchmarks from announced
attack and whatnot there you see that
our dual core processor actually
performs much better than you know down
the court course and and the reason for
that is we when we build the processor
from scratch you have much higher demons
from megahertz and the performances a
lot more optimized for mobile we have
much better power numbers so even with
two cores and we're running at one and
have figures they have much higher
performance than you know the ions when
they have all of them and that advantage
together with the fact that we've
integrated LTE and the fact that we have
a very high performance GPU which we
also built from scratch those are some
of the you know key advantage is s4 and
I know there is another one which has
not been written about a lot but it is a
big advantage is that we integrated the
Wi-Fi bluetooth FM gps also inside yes
need we don't need a separate Wi-Fi
chips outside you just need the you know
the analog part of it all the digital is
inside so it reduces the number of chips
inside the phone see we just say that
helps in making thinner and smaller
phones in here at dinner smaller phones
you know work a more power efficient
less expensive because you're not paying
for multiple packages of multiple ships
it's a lot of advantages recognition so
what you're saying is you taking full
credit for the HTC One S the really thin
one it's all your phone well you know it
she's did a good job in over the whole
ID and everything but you know we help
with the right kind of components in
there so the component count has come
down a lot so we are pretty happy with
the results speaking about the CPU
because CPU is part of the whole
Snapdragon proposition and the quake CPU
is the thing that's at the core of a
Snapdragon s4 and the Geo poles are
coming out involvement can you tell us
about the prey I understand it has some
of it arm a 15 in it but it's still your
specific design well the best way to
look at crate is you know you know arm
you know has an instruction set called
v7 which basically defines the
instructions said that you're supposed
to follow so all the software runs on it
you know and and a 9 and a 15 are both
v7 instruction set compatible so great
is too and scorpion the one we did
before is too so the same software will
run on create and a 15 and
so really there's no difference in terms
of software but right is a lot more
optimized for mobile because we you know
we designed this process from scratch
what we're able to do is we're able to
run this processor much higher clock
speed but get much lower power that's
actually one of the big advantages the
other way to look at it is if you said
hey we want it if you want to run it at
I don't take a certain amount of power
for some application you actually if you
limit the power you get much higher
clock speed or if you said I want to fix
the talk speed and get this kind of
performance your power will be much
lower that's the big advantage of crate
what's this you know just licensing you
know I pour from from our because we
optimize it for power you know it is
really a much higher performance and a
15 is kind of the same class as great
but plates here and now and I say this
next year FFA will ship next year and we
want to be shipping crates this year so
we have a significant advantage in
timing so let me ask you on the only
topic of power efficiency a colleague of
mine is really psyched about Nvidia's
5th Corps the companion core yep which
runs a low-power it saves battery life
how do you compete with that I do you
feel confident that you in the S fold
Snapdragon s4 chips included with your
quad core ones yeah if you company you
can compete with that power efficiency
from video yeah a very good question see
what happens is when you take something
like an a nine and
some of our other competition has done
and you want it much harder to get the
performance of 1.5 gigahertz or whatnot
you're pushing the processor both in
voltage and you're pushing the processor
and you get to the frequency so you're
burning a lot more power so what the you
know people do that have to do is they
have to put this other core to make it
run in lower clock speed and take less
power the way we design Craig is that
the same core that we have actually is
very power efficient even when you run
it at low Fox feet or high clock speed
so we don't need that you know other
core if you will to run at lower clock
speed to take less power the courage
themselves can scale all the way from
very low power mode and very high power
mode based on how you want it that's the
uniqueness about the great design and we
don't need the need for this other core
in fact our quad core which we are
showing here which has all four crates
running and wanted to have giggles even
in that case we don't need another core
because each of the traits can be
throttled down all the way and throttle
up all the way high you know when you
need the performance and the other
interesting thing we did when we design
trades is we are able to control all the
four trains and even the two cranes
independent what that means is the way
we designed our memory system and the
caches when you need a lot of
performance we can run the one crate
very high and we could turn the other
plate off or we can start cranking or
turning on the other plate but one
indigestion of clock speed to do what's
needed to be done
most of our competition has to run you
know pretty much all of those are all
courses and speed so they need this
other one to you know to you know do the
pot rattling we don't need that you know
because of the way of the crane is
designed and that's why we are in a very
comfortable with our design so your
design is like a morgue elegans and
invidious it's more elegant and it's
more optimized for mobile it's more
that's exactly what we focus on
optimizing it for mobile and provided
life so let's just to wrap up let's talk
about the future the Snapdragon s4 the
juco version we've seen know quite a few
phones and nails hear them but we see
the shipping soon I haven't heard much
about the single core s4 and can you
tell us about the road map for the
foreclosure yeah so talk about the quad
code the quad code was from the s4 we
announced it last year but we are very
pleased else actually sampling and we
just got silicon back just a few weeks
ago but with all the you know really
solid what the engineering teams have
done pretty silicon you know just a
couple of weeks from the time we got it
they're able to show it you know you
know booth today the tablet so it's here
we got all four gates working that's the
next generation graphics core in it so
hopefully in the next few months you
will see a lot more from us on that you
know on that new quad core version of s4
we have different versions of s4 going
down to you know lower and lower into
the tears and and you will see them
coming out you know what you are
dressing on the fifty-dollar $100
smartphones in
so all of them are on track and coming
out when though I mean in time this is a
little time we have announced a few
products we haven't announced all of
them but definitely this year UCL of
volatile I mean at this point most of
all products are in the you know hands
of our customers so they are making
phones and as you saw they announced a
few phones at this this show as the year
goes through you'll see a lot more
products come up it will be lots of us
when you and your next graphics chip is
the adrenal 300 series right that's
Adrian or 320 either one that's in the
quad code the 80 64 and and then of
course we will have it in of course
making offers in time you know if you
just follow up on that attraction okay
so when might be the earliest time we
see a quad-core esco phone come outside
we are hoping by under this year by the
end of this area</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
