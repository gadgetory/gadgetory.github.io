virgins gadget show I'm gonna tell on
the enter to the verge Paul Miller's
here hello you might notice we're not on
our set right now for circuit breaker
live we're actually downstairs on the
street in a Tesla Model 3 that Tesla was
foolish enough to give us for the day
we're gonna make a whole long youtube
video with this car they'll go up later
this week our friend marques is gonna be
in it which is really cool but this car
is basically a gadget and we have a
gadget show we're doing the show inside
again we're gonna gadget so just real
basics it's a you know an Eevee it's
good 310 miles range this is a long
range long range version tesla says the
car starts at $35,000 this is a $60,000
car it's basically every option auto
pilot the red paint is $1,000 if you
don't pay the thousand dollars you can
only get black it's a fancy wheels this
cars total respect up but the main thing
about it I just wanted everybody on
circuit breaker live to see is this
screen well good thing I brought the
Pope Paul's got that Paul cam going this
is the only interface for the car right
you've obviously got a brake pedal on an
accelerator and a steering wheel mm-hmm
but there are no vents there's no
ignition key there's no nothing almost
everything in this car there's no
instrument cluster everything in this
car happens on the screen I feel like
the first question is how do you know
how fast you're going right okay so you
can see here the car is in park I'm at
all right it's not on now what you're
what's supposed to happen is the car is
paired to your phone as you approach the
car it'll turn on you'll get in and
those drive away okay I don't have that
set up yet because it's just it's a it's
a review unit basically you have a
little key hotel key and there's a spot
right here there's one on the outside a
car - I just put it here oh yeah now the
car is on Drive it's an arcing pull out
and if I just give it a little
you can see the speedometers right there
you can see these are the front sensors
there's obviously rear sensors as well
push that button to go back in park
that's it like that those are basically
invisible controls or is the gearshift
lever here there's a turn signals here
there's you know joysticks for the
screen here there's obviously pretty
good horn I would say but Paul I want
you to try to use this screen because
it's nuts so a thing that you often do
in a car huh is you change where the
vents are pointing the air at your face
oh sure give that a shot there's just a
shelf so get it try it use the screen
okay okay all right so I turn this way
and this is wind in our face so it's all
here look at this if you're looking at
this on the screen here you can see
there's no events there's just a shelf
this area is a vent that blows up and
that's a vent that blows out and when
you move this around this is basically
the location of the air that's pointing
when you move it around the jet that's
pointing up and the jet that's pointing
out they like interfere with each other
and it points a single jet of air at
your face which is crazytown
good like most cars are just like you
just point the fins of the vent vessels
like what if you want one giant thing
and like you can explain it that way
this is so cool it's so much more
complicated in a normal car but it's
like in the best way it's so gadgety
other stuff if you look this is the
radio interface it's all these a Tesla
there's an LTE connection up here it's
that maybe someone's a huge Smash Mouth
balls play with it earlier so you can
obviously search if I hold down this
button I can say play Kanye West
and does voice search it'll just like
light up a Kanye song over here which is
pretty cool there you go well that
worked pretty well there's our first
copyright strike for the day
and then this is pretty cool so this
whole center console there's nothing
here but if you open this up maybe you
can see it
these are phone chargers for get my my
cases interfering here that's a phone
charger if my case was on there would
work better and you can see it's got
little USB ports so you can swap them
out for USB C or lightning however you
want to so I think that's pretty cool
there are no power outlets somebody
asked me on Twitter about power outlets
in the bar view as a place for a dashcam
I have not yet seen a traditional my
first console lid gently okay so we're
being real nice to the car and then I
have one other question from Twitter
here I just want to pull it up our
friend Shawn Hollister says how are the
volume controls okay there everything's
on screen so there's a volume control
here and then there's a volume control
here and if I hit this it's play pause
and then and then lastly this is just
basic Tesla stuff you can navigate it's
got Google Maps on here and pull that
down so that's nice and then I want to
point this out just because it's circle
regular live it's real silly there's
Easter eggs in the car right now so we
can bring up the sketch pad right now
we've got a whole rest of the show Jake
and Ashley are gonna do the news but
literally we have to get out of the car
and run upstairs so take it away Jake
and Ashley we'll see you in one second
apples home that was very into this
without any visuals actually I'm sure
though slowly
apples home pod came out last week and
turns out this thing is basically so
hard to get into that if you need to
repair it you're basically buying
another one so Apple released repair
pricing out of warranty that is $279
that is 80% of the cost of a brand new
home pod so you're not really repairing
it so much as you are like giving them
some parts and getting a slight discount
on a new one what do you think some
would do to this home pod okay get it is
the thing like you would have to like
knock this from a very high shelf and
apparently this thing like do you see I
fix its teardown yeah I just saw it open
they took a saw and like cut it in two
which like suggests it will be hard to
break but also explains why it is so
expensive to repair that they're like
slightly good news is if you're worried
Apple's warranty is only $29 don't last
for two years but uh you're gonna drop
it yes two years don't use this as a
portable speaker goodbye essential we've
been tracking their progress since what
am I was exciting way back when they
launched and it turns out that they sold
less than 90,000 phones during their
first six months as a companies I think
the exact number from IDC was 88,000 so
that's not great it's kind of
disheartening for anyone who cares about
a central carries about having different
Android phones available to them there
you know flagship quality and on top of
that essentials been going through a
bunch of issues where the camera wasn't
really working well in the first launch
they continuously are adding update to
the camera
Android Oreo still isn't running on
essential and they're like oh we can't
actually put 8.0 on we have to now put
8.1 because of stability issues so all
around just watching essential news
trying so hard and it's like it tried so
many cool ambitious things you
definitely like made a statement when it
launched but I mean it's just so clear
that it is like immensely hard to launch
a like flagship priced phone even if
you're Andy bourbon yeah like it's not
especially generation one there's just
like not a lot of reason to trust it and
buy in until you've liked seeing the
other out
you know and like clearly it wasn't
perfect so yeah very difficult perpetual
lesson Amazon is actually doing a reset
sort of of it's discounted phone program
be going for two years and basically
just like the Kindle you would get a
discount if you let them put some ads on
your lock screen except now they are
getting rid of the ads it's gonna the
phones are gonna cost more now they'll
cost twenty dollars more but if you
already own one you get to keep it for
you know whatever you can't charge you
more there's still gonna be some ads on
the phone there's gonna be like a lock
screen there's gonna be a widget on the
home screen and there are Amazon's
pre-installed apps but the lock screen
itself is not gonna have ads on it which
means you can you know set your own
wallpaper for the first time which is
really nice I think it's sort of weird
that like this was like that was a
defining feature of this program that
like there's a lock screen ad and now
it's not but I guess it's still good
like yelling ads but my god I would hate
to have ads on my phone like right but
you look at the loss of your phone so
many times a day it's valuable real say
it's like a magazines cover yeah you
know that's expensive for advertisers so
this I can imagine maybe made good money
maybe but apparently $20 a user seems to
be like that's while they're charging
more now so maybe wasn't that big cool
and last week we talked about the s9m
sons rumored new phone we talked about
the dual cameras how they're going to be
vertical kind of like the iPhone 10 this
week or earlier this week we talked we
saw another rumor about the s9 having a
headphone jack which would be a reversal
from the s8 and just a totally different
idea than basically all the current
flagships on the market now you could
see the headphone jack right here this
is actually the Dex pad
so when s8 came out samsung also
launched a product called the decks
which basically lets you use your phone
like a computer and this is the version
2 of it it should still work with the s8
supposedly rumors but this one lets you
lay the phone flat
so maybe you can use it as a touchpad or
something like we saw razor had
something sort of similar where slotted
into the actual laptop but it was the
idea of the keypad to Dan Seifert
reviewed the the last version of Dex and
like it seemed it was actually pretty
good yeah i sat next thing while he says
that look that's cool like bring their
phones from home sure sure and also I'm
just completely all about the headphone
jack coming back every time I go to plug
in headphones into my pixel I just like
try a little bit inside its eye I
purposefully forget that it doesn't have
a headphone jack and then just yeah and
then your heart is broken over and over
again yeah it's worth noting that also
it has a big speed button still okay so
you're getting one thing back but you're
keeping Vic speed one day it will allow
it to be reassigned for you Jake
sorry I just slap my microphone eyeball
and finally this week we have some
incredible dongle news we have a
four-way lightning dongle to lightning
out to lightning in all at 90-degree
angles this is what's crazy contraption
okay let me also just say this product
is called anode normal name but it's
from a company called I love handles I
have no idea if this thing is certified
in any way it only cost $20 you can't
get even in white plastic involving
Apple for $20 so there's the ideas
you're supposed to plug all of your
devices into this you just mix and match
and do whatever you know this is great I
don't have any real understanding so you
have to have at least one like power
cord going into it but theoretically
like certain like an iPad could be
plugged in and then charge a pencil out
the other corner right so like maybe you
don't have to our power cord come in I
the possibilities are either endless or
zero because it doesn't work I'm not
sure we have to get this it I'm really
excited for this Wow $20.00 it makes the
pencil charging look nothing you can
also infinitely string these together I
don't know if that's true or not right
please don't
hazard okay so this might be our last
week of
maybe all these is ending news will
continue having Jake and I just won't
guide you sure you don't lose but next
week we're gonna try this new thing
where Jake and I are gonna do ask
circuit breaker so if you ask some
questions in the comments or in the chat
right now next week Jake and I will try
to answer them so give me a super
open-ended here yeah a circuit breaker
choose your favorite oh and wonderful
timing by you what up Richard how was
the Tesla it was amazing I've been in
the YouTube chat this whole time has
some great comments ok great it's great
the Tesla it was incredible getting up
here was incredible it was super fun uh
we're gonna make a whole video with that
car like later literally later today
marques Brownlee is on his way to the
studio right now we're gonna hang with
him in the car Ashley's gonna hang with
me in the car so look for that on
YouTube later this week by the way thank
you Jake naturally for vamping hey you
have brought us it's just an incredible
bundle of wire so I can see his Pikachu
so so last time on the show we had
regular wireless chargers yeah
wireless chargers have mutated since
then and now they're weird and now they
have hubs yeah
Wireless charges are out wireless
charging hubs are in I'm into it
so kind of a bunch of those here I guess
we'll start with this is kind of your
your standard most normal vanilla one
this is the Nomad wireless charging hub
yeah that's wireless charger on top on
the bottom there's little hub down here
have a couple USB ports you have a USB
CD USB C port can I just sit here this
thing looks a damn mess yeah like this
is a product where it on car
headquarters they're like you know Steve
yes this is nomad which just won a
honkers competitor you can see where
they were going with like the cord
management and like but then you have
everything kind of wrapping around yeah
so there's power in power in so there's
there's a okay Farrell blogs regular
Bauer plug USB C port three regular USB
ports and
the ideas that you can charge up to five
devices wireless on top second here
something put in yeah I think so
confirmed confirmed okay okay actually
has these little lights down here so you
can actually figure out what's plugged
in where's one cause this one costs
eighty dollars so expensive relative to
wireless charging and hubs but like if
you combine that you together good hubs
like $34 good wireless chargers 30 40
dollars I would prefer this if they
didn't try to manage the courts like
trying to hide the cords makes it look
messier than it is well then I have for
you this officially licensed I think
this is officially licensed gamestop is
selling it is the techno fun pika -
Pikachu induction charger like this this
is the first press photo I ever saw
yeah where do you think the plugs are on
the side plugs are on the side so again
you have barrel plug you have three
regular USB ports for for charging your
non wireless charging things take your
phone put it on top take your phone it
is a little precarious it isn't it it
doesn't it's not I feel I feel less good
about putting putting my you know $1000
phone on top of here than I do want to
say this yeah and I will of course point
out the truth Pokemon future of the
cheeks on the future actually light up
so you know it's charging are there
gonna be other Pokemon that lend their
abilities to your phone so this cost $60
it's the power in on the side yeah power
in is on the side is horrible
they got halfway through designing this
in game where do you want to put the
power in deal I I don't know
okay $60 $60 next up we have these sign
of volts this is not a wireless charger
sure isn't this is a USB battery pack
it's one of the big ones this is
actually a weird thing is a prototype
then the company sent us they were doing
a thing on IndieGoGo the IndieGoGo page
is gone the company does not seem to
exist on the internet except for
Facebook page I'm still trying to figure
out so you have the last one so this
might be the only one in existence but
what it is it is a modular wireless
charging bank so you can take these sign
of all modules and you can just clip
them on so you got so that's just a plug
that's just a giant plug but it's really
you can clip along both ends you clip on
both ends this is ridiculous and I got
it you got to do the clips this whole
this whole idea is horrible
wait wait wait now if you could call I
don't understand this and I don't know
why people try to back this alright so
this was all just a prelude this is a
prelude though to you saying there's
actually a good USB so there is a good
yours water charter hub this is the
hyper drive USB C hub wireless charger
it's made by a company called hyper
which started on Kickstarter back when
the first USBC MacBooks came out they
make these like aluminum docks
um looming USB C hubs that kind of like
seamlessly clip onto the sagar MacBook
this is their next thing which is to
combine that with the wireless charger
this is a prototype they're currently
running a Kickstarter campaign or just
finished this actually no longers what
the product looks like they've
redesigned it they've gotten rid of this
integrated cables so that you don't have
to be as restricted by it basically this
is a full USB C hub your spce USBC USB
see yours sorry USBs USB see which can
also do power pass-through okay
Ethernet HDMI SD and micro SD so
basically every port that is currently
missing from your USB see a lifetime and
you like flip it up and do one of these
guys and you can flip it up it can
charge flat oh you know it's funny is
there computers
my computer doesn't have ports on that
side so I'm gonna put on that side
that's why they've gotten rid of the
integrated cable come on and you just
plug that in okay can I be honest with
you mm-hmm
and it's in charge and we'll charge it
works it'll charge it it works I've been
using it all week it charges you get all
the ports like this is the this is the
desk thing for you let me be honest with
you this product is a repudiation of
everything USB C is meant to stand for
yes right because what you are really
supposed to have is USB see accessories
and peripherals not another nasty hub so
you can actually connect the the only
USB C port on this is one so you can
pass their charging right that like when
you come to work in the morning you just
plug this into your laptop can I just
like a USB C Ethernet yeah I want like
actual USB C devices and then like I
just like not just an ever-expanding
array of dongles I feel like this is the
this is what USB see promised you you
sit down at your desk and plug one thing
in it charges your laptop it powers your
USB C display you can finally look at
pictures off your story we set my desk
Vox media just over there is right next
to our IT department which is super fun
right because I get to see all the
comings and goings or this company's VP
of Engineering rolls up to them the
other day and said I just need some
dongles because my computer doesn't have
enough it was the saddest thing I've
ever seen
so so your dream version of this my
juice is one with 8 USB seaports my yeah
the idea of USB C is that it will
replace USB a and what is happening
right now is everything is still USB a
and we're just kidding we're just living
dongle dongle City but if we're living
in dongle city uncle cities this is a
great place to live it is it isn't but
this is the mayor of living there this
is this is
this is the dongle that you want yeah
sure yeah it's the best real estate in
dongle town yeah that's cool those are I
want those to be on here
where they belong this is like go
backwards in time approach though cuz we
need to embrace USBC like it is a better
spec when it's done right which is
another barrel of worms that is a
completely different rant when it's done
right it's good like you problem with
this there is actually one problem other
than that it's a Kickstarter project and
you can't actually buy it yet is that it
was on Kickstarter for a $99 early bird
and its final price is going to be a
hundred and sixty dollars which is a lot
how much it cost for the USB a port in a
laptop 15 cents what are we doing to
ourselves just just ease us through the
transition it's all inside I'm very
sorry that your situation is so
complicated are those USB C headphones
come along I'm not great yep there it is
okay thank you for joining us I have
some exciting news Lauren good is coming
back with a new well role show vs. is
coming back with Lauren good I've seen
some of the early season and super funny
we have a quick trailer for that and
then we're going back Chris Walsh is
going to show us what's going on in
wireless earbuds hi I'm Lauren so am i
and we're finally back with a new season
of vs. you might know this video series
is the one in which the right Lauren's
as in the one who's usually correct
tries to talk sense into this Lauren
about gadgets one of the amazing things
about the Internet of Things is that
normal stuff is becoming Wi-Fi connected
like this Brita pitcher so if you want
to do something else like charge your
phone or stick an SD card in there at
the same time you need to use a bunch of
adapters
I love adapters this is a Roomba and
this it's clear to me at least which one
of these is the better phone you mean
the one that doesn't cost a thousand
dollars and is still a fantastic phone
so you compare it with bluetooth
headphones and have your books read
aloud to you for fuck's sake just gonna
tablet then are you guys fighting over
your Brita pictures again look it's easy
to get overwhelmed by all the gadget
decisions you're supposed to be making
these days so our goal is to lay it all
out there for you and tell you which are
the best products that you should buy
and use or when it's better not to buy a
new product at all which is probably at
least 80% of the time yes she's always
as much of a downer I'm a realist anyway
go check out the new season of vs. you
can find it right here on YouTube and of
course on the verge com
we're back sorry - Lauren's at once we
everyone needed a break think about
Chris mulch is here hey Chris how's it
going it's going you have brought us a
selection of charging cases are very
interesting wireless earbuds and they
also contain your buds okay so what is
you reviewed a bunch of these lately ear
pods right here everyone knows what
those are what's the rest of stuff
well the air pods are worth talking
about first because I mean they work so
well it's been 14 months since they came
out and you're probably wondering if
anyone else has beaten them or put out
something better and the answer is no
they've gotten close there's there's a
big market right now there's some of
these that cost $300 and cost 150
there's Samsung Bo's a bunch of brands
are taking part in this game but when it
comes to like ease of use sound
quality's okay it's good enough for most
people and the battery life the air pods
are still on their own pedestal oh the
case size is may vary a lot so the Bose
is my favorite case I think just kind of
the most like a futuristic gadget it's
got lights on both both side lights are
what you want to see you want super
here's I actually like this Samsung one
better that's real nice look at this
yeah what I'm gonna just point out
though is all these are huge yeah
compared to air pods
yeah because most out of battery inside
is gonna charge the ear pods two more
times so do the air pods though and like
they have 24 hours of extra battery life
in the case it's just like they got
those Bose ones here's an ear pod
everybody knows what this looks like
yeah here is this monstrosity well is
this just Apple as the w1 chip in wn8
this is for the phone calls and like
better a voice with Siri and things like
that
and whereas these manufacturers focus on
being somewhat subtle I mean Bose isn't
great because these actually stick
pretty far out of your ear when they're
in but they sound better than the air
pipes like all stop sound qualities and
those are the Samsung ones the base is
excellent on the bose they cost around
two hundred dollars right now this is a
Motorola was just like look at the
comparative size while these so I'm
gonna say something in YouTube you're
gonna be mad at me and that's fine and
you can tell me that you're mad at me
but be polite or I'm already mad at you
say
everyone sound horrible they're like I
don't I just did the whole home pod
review and there's all the Apple people
their pods in the street no it's like
how can you choose love how can you
choose fucking back I buying this
limited speaker because it sounds great
but then in my everyday life I like a
tin can is rattling in my ear I just
like I don't understand it
so connection quality aside do any of
these really be Apple on sound quality
the Bose do are the bass is way better
than the air pods they're open design so
you can hear things around me which I
don't like if you're a runner you're
gonna be a fan of that but the air pod
is like I don't know how people use
these on this subway or like news any
kind of noisy environment I don't know
how you hear music you probably turn it
up this is the bone safe levels yeah
these are the Bose these are the sound
sport free all right so we got John
Chapman in chat saying people should
have straight-up copy ear pods I don't
think that is currently possible right
Apple developed its own chip they've got
their own software in the iPhone it's
like the W one the W one isn't a whole
bunch of like Beats headphones as well
can anybody else compete with that I
mean I think Apple realize that you
can't just do Bluetooth you need
something on top of Buddha tooth it's
like w1 handles pairing and handles
battery life there's why these have such
a better better life than everything but
I don't like apples one size fits most
approach I mean that's why I can't use
the air pods because they don't fit my
ear I bought them twice first one they
came out I was like these are pretty
cool and I brought them back and then
I've tried two more of these I've been
disappointed so I went back like two
months ago and maybe I miss remembered
how they fit but now they stop this
whole charging case situation is great
though yeah I'll give you a gadget
person like that Samsung chargers real
nice these are their new sony is it CDs
came out last year yet they just these
are the old Sony settings a case I mean
that case is just real nice police
charging clips are nasty yeah this is
got like a 70s kind of vibe to it maybe
but one is like newer nicer ones this is
just pure hilarity this is like a pill
dispenser if your grandparents it's like
you know it's not not the most not the
liquor the Jaybirds
like all of this I'm into all of these
charging case I think pocketable is like
butch you want like these in the B you
know these are the most expensive pair
that we have three hundred dollars for
these and the sound quality is great
emits Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen so they've got
really good so they all have the same
bluetooth dropout problems they drop out
here and they're like a split second but
that
it's up over 10 or 15 times during the
course of your day that's gonna be very
annoying sometimes they're fine like you
can be at work here at the office that
are great at the gym they're awesome
you're like walking down the street they
just so if you're not an airport or so
you got an Android phone you can use
their pods with Android phone they work
pretty well yeah but they're not they
don't do all the things that w1 does but
you can use them but if you don't think
the way they sound you got an Android
phone or you stole an Apple stuff which
one you get I would either go for the
braggy - these are 150 these are the
this is coming that kind of kicked off
this whole truly wireless earbuds trend
on Kickstarter they risk a three million
dollars yeah yeah in this case actually
isn't a battery piece so these have one
charge and once that's gone you've got
to plug them in but a six hour battery
life which is one hour better than the
air pods so at least they've got that so
you can listen to them for longer the
Bose are good I mean one one big issue
with these is there's often a delay when
you watch a video the audio is like two
seconds behind so it's like you're
watching a dubbed version of whatever
you're watching on these people Netflix
and yes there's one that's how these
workers there's one master earbud and
there's one slave and so your music goes
to one earbud back to they don't want
back to the phone and most of these
don't tell the phone to like sync the
video with the audio so you wind up with
a super annoying delay some of these are
problems that the slow march of
technological progress right solve for
us right there are something that's
coming this year
Qualcomm mess so they've got a ship
coming that's gonna help this Scituate
help out the situation a bit once these
earbuds
once these earbuds start to use so tooth
five that's gonna make a big difference
as well because well when your phone has
that and the earbuds have that that
should make for a much much better
connection but right now these are all
Bluetooth four points something and all
these proprietary yeah and they fought
and they drop out and yeah I'm just
saying earlier we saw the Samsung Galaxy
S nine weeks
Jack no confusion there lay headphones
you want everybody let me
okay like turn down the stereo or put
some headphones on you plug that like
big quarter inch Jack and put the head
down turn down the stereo or boot up
your weird little ear computer that's
gonna be great sorry I'm not I'm really
I like technology but I will so there's
something to be said for actual buttons
on your earbuds oh yeah both said like
actual volume buttons are track controls
yeah absolutely
so whereas on the air pods you do a
bunch of Siri a bunch of voice controls
a lot of these have actual buttons the
braggy have buttons that you actually
push into your ear which guess which
ones are those comfortable those are you
mentioned that that hurt yeah you've got
to shove them in here because you push
the buttons in it's pretty uncomfortable
so producers and I are pointing out that
I like regular bluetooth headphones a
cans and they have regular jacks I can
watch movies on the plane so they're for
the gym or pretty commute and things
like that but if you watch video most of
these are gonna be ruled out the B&amp;amp;O
actually do do video pretty well so
that's a good recreation but there are
three hundred dollars so you're talking
serious money and for that much money
they really shouldn't have any you were
saying there's like Lucy five a new chip
from Qualcomm have you seen any access
demoed not yet I mean it's all on the
way so you just got a hold out hope that
it's gonna be better this someone's
gonna be without her pods for months
later they're still failing the
Bluetooth 5 standard for audio isn't
super finalized right and once that's
finalized then we'll show this whole
situation should get smoother but it's
taking time I mean these have been out
we've seen these for a couple years now
and none of them have managed to top
Apple I see I'm now seeing air pods
everywhere I've never seen any of these
they still look dumb they're never gonna
look good they pulled it off they don't
look great
well thank you for that frustrating sign
up for Apple music iCloud - something do
something with that you have a great
time to build those walls man okay Paul
mmm you did something oh yeah
sometimes I feel like the news just goes
of kinda over my head like what what's
the bigger picture
so I came up with in this segment that
I'm calling explain yourself
so check it out iPhone battery
replacement weights are shortening
analyst says like Jacob castor ICU Jake
what do you think about this story
iPhone battery replacements weights are
shortening analyst says you know and it
hasn't shortened for me are you still
waiting I'm still waiting hey Jake can
you hold the by in a chat yeah we'd love
to you I'm calling explain yourself
okay what do I do in this segment it's
getting easier like before if you went
to an Apple store I'm like hey I want to
get a new battery for $29 then would
have been like come back in two months
but now they might go okay you know in
two weeks you have a battery so it's not
great yet but it's getting better
you still want you might get better I
think it depends on which model of
iPhone you have and probably also which
store you're in but overall this is like
not great for Apple and I think it is
good for customers which is like
probably the coolest thing about all
this yeah I mean I think if you have an
iPhone that you like aren't quite ready
to give up but like the battery is sort
of giving out at the end of the day like
for $29 you should totally go and
replace it the wait times are getting
shorter and shorter as they get more
batteries in stock definitely put it on
your to-do list last question is Apple
an evil company that was slowing
people's phones down on purpose to make
them upgrade
I'm a I'm a truther so yes we heard of
here first
Jake paid by Apple to not say anything
the real truth I'm not bound by any you
know payments
explain yourself with your friend Paul
Miller good job everybody I feel like
the title of your segment is the
question I now which that's dressed up
for circuit breakers yeah yeah I just
really wanted to flex for the show what
what is happening to your face
so the Toy Fair is this weekend
oh yeah and I've covered it for the past
few years and companies are now getting
a little smart and introducing their
toys before the toy fair so this is one
I wrote about this week it is Hiro
vision which is an AR toy from Hasbro
and Marvel so you get to be Iron Man
then play a game for several years now
I've wanted to be Iron Man I think a lot
of people have yeah yeah wait okay so
this is basically a VR headset exactly
and you're strapped your phone into it
and instead of VR is AR but yeah it's
kind of like snapchat where you see the
world around you but like things will
pop up what is this situation so this is
called the gauntlet yes I just call it
the thing on your hand and so you this
basically is how you unlock the game
yeah
so you'll notice these stickers and
you'll see them here too the game is
able to recognize these stickers so when
you load up the game you're gonna hold
out your hand to kill enemies but when
you first load up the game this is how
it unlocks is by seeing these stickers
and remembering them yeah okay we see
this in action yeah totally so okay
because this is an AR game I'm gonna
load up two phones one where you'll
actually see it how it should look in a
good view and then the other we can
actually put it in here and play okay
this is if you want to see the
or while I'm loading stuff on this isn't
a middle of game that I was playing yeah
kill some kills all the bad guys for me
I've never done this before it's a good
thing it sees your head that's cool then
I can like ooh a camera guide you've
done four is really yelling at me
protect the portal generator I knew this
game really does work best if you're oh
yeah that's your shield okay so you're
supposed to look around and then see the
enemy top okay target it hold of your
hand we're not starting cities like
pretty accessible yeah so this actually
has nothing to do with like a arcade
project tangoing nothing like that just
this you can run so long as your phone
has iOS 6 and higher or Android 5 and
higher and it really can fit like on the
bottom of the box here they set it up so
that people can just see like you could
have a huge phablet far away so that
people when they buy this
maybe not sure if their phone works they
can read about it and also just make
sure they're gonna actually fits yeah so
I'm sending this up this is all set up
for me already so I'm gonna you guys can
play with it ok yes they say this is for
kids
aidan up you know me like you're gonna
have a kid singing would you get your
kid a phone this is my senpai question
like one is the right one is the right
my child will be raised in the woods
away from aw damn it okay
this is like involved yeah sometimes I
get it on the first go and then other
times I don't get in there strike a
breaker this is like the bluetooth
pairing of toys okay got it
okay so now you're in there so you can
make adjustments I can actually take my
glasses off because this is a whole
when I don't having long hair also not
ideal okay so now you can see the world
math because the cameras on ya
and I can see my hand through here but
does your hand look like Iron Man okay
so because I look down at that marker
now I see a defense base there okay so
that you can change the game by changing
up where you put the marker so higher up
maybe you'll have a different experience
than if you put one on the ground or
something okay so we've got an image one
oh yeah it's a simulation that would
actually sit yeah and now it's beeping
again as I turn to your right you're
shooting yeah so now I'm just shooting
there's enemies like populating around
me but this does remind me like on the
circuit breaker show at CES this year we
played with yeah so let's loosen wait
there we go so I like you were just
saying honestly I'm the circuit breaker
show at CES Lauren good brought on
another AR device that was a gun
remember and that was really cool too so
we're seeing some of these more
practical applications like free regular
toys and games I think is really cool oh
yeah this is just like magic ID and made
itself work for me I'm just gonna do it
okay where's now you get two things in
there today so you were saying nailed it
Wow yeah just turn that way I got the
feeling that perhaps either thee
Symphony is anticipated so we did see a
bunch of stuff
that's right yeah and then here where's
my tent can you see it now yeah good
okay so yeah you're still around
there's Paul
[Laughter]
and there's that okay I get it
did you read chat does not does that
make out the check I mean I totally get
how this would be fun if your kid yeah
and so there's only ten levels they say
that should be like several hours of
gameplay the way though so the device
this whole setup cost fifty dollars I
think the way they're going to man
should make a little bit more money off
of it is they have these little stones
we have one here it comes to the game
itself stones yes yes infinity so it's
watching all these movies like what
together yes you can buy those outside
of this pack and you'll get extra power
so changes up I buy the game yeah I
think I might be dead in this game you
might be dead
[Laughter]
this is wild it's you know we've seen
every high-end demo we have a whole VR
room for a while the newest stuff and
this is actually the most like I
understand why this product exists and
what I'm supposed to do with it and
waited oculus doesn't you know I mean
like I sort of understand what's
happening here
right why don't they use a RK and tango
they probably just want to make it
inclusive for more people mister
something else though you look really
cool yeah looks really great how much I
just want a regular Ironman mode
yeah well you know you should do an MS
you should give up your weapons
manufacturing I was just in cost 50 bags
you're almost there problem okay cuz
headsets are cheap yeah you don't really
that marvelous does that work with you
need this thing does it work with other
headsets um well it's all design it has
this like proprietary clasp and stuff
no no but if you just have a regular
hats I can use good I mean yeah you can
put your phone in anything yeah mm-hmm
all right Marvin would you have the map
again the poor moral people are on the
controller she's like freaking out right
now
look don't hack their products they're
very conscious to bring here anyway hey
that is the show people our people are
just in the chat we have time for
questions I'm just like looking through
them questions yeah we had a ton of
Tesla questions on Twitter I look at
those right here
people asked how does a build well he
compared to my Jeep about the Tesla
here's what I tell you Jeep did not cost
$60,000 but I've sat in $60,000 cars
before actually you reviewed a BMW even
in like a Rolls Royce those like really
high-end cars the model 3 for $60,000 is
not does not feel like an expensive car
right it's just a very it's a nice sort
of mid-sized car but like it feels like
it's base prices 35,000 oh but it also
has a computer in the middle it also has
a computer in the middle of that is true
I can't wait to see that the trunk
people are Adam says how much can you
fit in the trunk the trunk is huge and
there's a front in there and there's a
trunk there's like like it's large
enough for like a baby like a carry-on
bag okay or like a like a very small
gymnast yeah Chris Brown says the main
screen LED or OLED it's obviously an LED
like it's a LCD screen it's not like a
17 inch OLED panel which itself would
cost like 60 okay yeah it's just nice if
you don't pay for an answer no pilot
auto parts really expensive my car it's
not a $5,000 option but it has some
features that add sensors that's some
sense have you gone to try auto pilot in
the city yet or no no I haven't tried in
the city we're gonna drive it I'm gonna
leave here and like run downstairs and
play with the car this is a good
questions and you unlock cars to the key
in your wallet oh yeah we'll find out oh
I'll go try it right now and leave it
the answer that one in the comments in
this video but you said the ideal thing
is it just works but the ideas just rush
to their phone and then here's will take
this last one totally ask how does the
base model compare to the upgraded model
besides speed and range I
Andy Hawkins our transportation reporter
and he pointed out that you can not Det
the base model right now hmm so there's
the base model too to navigate the
complex web of like eating credits and
taxes and they're basically only selling
the upgraded model with a higher price
so our model is like people have ordered
it but it's not gonna come for quite
some time yet mmm but they needed to
have a SKU whole point is to get get you
in at 35 K can the Tesla be Hotwire it
says John Shipman in the chat we're
gonna find out I'm worried about
hot-wiring a car this full of that many
with you iron batteries but maybe
that'll be a great video those worth a
shot when the hot wiring is there while
I was charging the car there's not what
I was charging in a car if there is if
you saw in the very near this video and
will show it again in the next video we
make it has custom like cables mm-hmm
it's got USB jacks and there are custom
cables that wire up into the console it
was set up with two like my side but you
could run a USB see here yeah and then
this one somebody asked is there a place
to mount and power a dashcam I didn't
see one I'll look like cigarette I
didn't see a cigarette lighter I don't
think you want you to smoke in its car
the future smoking will be illegal yeah
also driving your own car yeah but like
I said we are literally we're gonna end
this stream right now I'm gonna run
downstairs ashes and come with me we're
gonna make a whole video with that Tesla
Marquez actually just walked in the door
to help us make that video so that's me
really fun look for it in a couple of
days we got a like shooting edit a video
that was circa mecca live for today
thank you guys for joining me I think we
did a good job we did fine
explain yourself in the chat I love
reading your comments in the chat and
responding to them it helps us drive
this whole show we'll be back again next
