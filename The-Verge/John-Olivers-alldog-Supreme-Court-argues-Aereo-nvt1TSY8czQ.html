ruled a tario a service that lets you
stream broadcast television over the
Internet
violated copyright law broadcasters like
ABC NBC CBS and Fox all argue the area
acted like a cable company only without
paying for the content Aereo's defense
was at its first and foremost a
technology company that rents out tiny
dime size antennas that pick up public
over-the-air channels each antenna is
unique to the user but instead of
physically having it in your home all
the rabbit ears instead are stored
together in a large warehouse now the
Supreme Court has never allowed video
cameras in the courtroom but thinks the
last week tonight with John Oliver we
actually have footage of the proceedings
the following is actual audio recordings
of the Supreme Court's Aereo case here's
areas lawyers making their case when
they sign up their system is completely
empty
there's no content being provided
there's equipment that's being provided
so the notion that they have in the
reply brief over and over that were
somehow a content provider would mean
that everybody who provides an antenna
or a DVR is somehow a content provider
now the government says they give the
subscriber a menu and says that you have
these choices and they're providing you
these choices and those choices are
content it's no different Justice
Ginsburg that if I'm at home and I have
an antenna rabbit ears on my TV and I
know what channels are different from
from a user's perspective it's exactly
the same as if I'm watching cable right
you just have a different content
selection and then you pick off that
menu right but the menu Justice Kagan
and Justice Ginsburg is simply what is
technologically available there are
broadcast signals that are available in
a local area and they are limited
because that's what the broadcaster's
make available and simply providing a
user guide that says you can tune to
this channel or you can tune to that
channel if you want to pick up one
program or another can't be the
difference between a content provider
and merely facilitating the use of your
equipment for nearly one hour lawyers
and judges try to find the perfect non
technological metaphor to describe just
how aerial works which ultimately led to
this I think it's the basic decision but
differ
between a car dealer and a valet parking
service if you looked at it from 30,000
feet you might think hey both of these
things provide cars to the public but if
you looked at it more closely to
understand well if I show up at the car
dealership without a car I'm going to be
able to get a car if I show up at the
valet parking service and I don't own a
car it's not going to end well for me
what and so from I didn't mean to
interrupt your well I was just get it so
I think in there is a very real way in
which you would say you know the end of
the day the car dealer is providing cars
to the public valet parking service is
not it's provided by a senator right I
don't want to stretch you to but why
isn't it like a public garage in your
own garage I mean you know if you can
park your car in your own garage or you
can park it in a public garage you can
go to RadioShack and buy an antenna and
a DVR or you can rent those facilities
somewhere else from aerial they've got
an Intendant they'll let you use it when
you need it
mr. chief justice that's not an
implausible way to look at this problem
is all of these metaphors are inherently
flawed if anything it's a clear sign
that the judges and indeed the law
itself hasn't caught up with the current
state of Technology there's even an
extended argument over the definition of
copy which sounds silly but is important
legal nuance
there's no reason it's a user specific
copy is it varying ten thousand copies
it'd be much easier for you to just have
to make one copy and everybody could get
a copies you don't need every viewer to
have his own copy but that is the that
is the key distinction between video on
demand and the kinds of equipment and
technology that area provides you can't
watch my copy
I can't download you're saying your copy
is different from my copy correct what
that's a reason we call them copies
because they're the same
all I'm trying to get it and I'm not
saying it's outcome-determinative or
necessarily bad I'm just saying your
technological model is based solely on
circumventing legal prohibitions that
you don't want to comply with you could
also say that Arielle is actually
complying with the law as is written
today I'll be it with thousands of tiny
antennas but the 6-3 decision decided to
ignore Aereo's technological loophole
and that's kind of the problem
even if Arielle winning was a longshot
these arguments highlight just how fast
technology is moving and how slow the
legal system can be to understand it
this won't be the last time technology
is at the center of a trial and next
time let's at least hope for some more
updated analogies why isn't what used to
be called a phonograph records store
that sells phonograph records giving a
public performance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
