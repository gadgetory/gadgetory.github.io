webos anyone is that any huh any webOS
users here it's got to be willing in one
person we put them in the nosebleed
seats you just can't win can you so so
HP is open sourcing webOS and they're
gonna still make tablets basically you
think I talked I talked to the CEO Meg
Whitman and Marc Andreessen who is on
the board and you think they was lied to
me well you know it's really interesting
because their first announcement kind of
they put up and I think you said we'll
evaluate well well open source web wash
we think it's great we'll evaluate it
for future products which is basically
like we think it's not very good right
and we'll see if it gets better wait I
don't think one like random dudes in
their basement make it better for us
because we failed to do I don't think
that means that I think it means but
they also said we're gonna build the
tablets in 2013 which is like we're
gonna take a break we stopped at this
man maybe not this year maybe next year
that was basically already 2013 when you
think about it that's tomorrow
I mean look close our eyes Meg wake up
you can try the touchpad again maybe she
could be the guy the grand central guy
whatever I think I think they made the
first answer we're gonna open source it
you know we're giving up and they got
the give up vibe and they said well
we're not gonna give up when I talked to
her she kept mentioning how forwardable
it was going to be for them which is not
like a good necessarily good thing to
hear when we're making a big decision
you know like when somebody says I got
this for you it was affordable but you
don't think like this is gonna be great
you think like it'll be good enough
right I guess when they bought palm and
they bought webOS all they talked to us
we have so much scale we have so many
resources where HP we can do anything we
want we have all this cash it's just
it's in a it's in a box here you go
Sean Rubenstein and then do anything
with it where was John Rubenstein's it
was yeah nowhere right it was it was Meg
Whitman and Mark injuries and who were
basically not there when they bought
pawns right and Marc Andreessen has news
for what Netscape the new face of webOS
yeah the guy at Netscape and a lady here
an eBay Mozilla I mean there's wind
there you use the Firefox that I know
I would not write I am a chrome user
well another great Google product yeah
uber another killer I'll bet you urgency
to browsers mercy I don't know if I'm
talking about like I'm exteriors as they
walking around out there
yeah it's haunting haunting presence but
uh yeah I don't know this just feels
like this is the end of the line I just
think this is like really great for the
for the like homebrew guys yeah guys
they were already putting up pictures
screenshots of like the evo 3d like
running hacked builds webOS like TC in
our office you like still has a pre was
like super excited because there's web
less some real hardware you know that's
great that's that's great for those guys
I mean this is this is what me go big
Kilkenny go class right give him this
I mean you're a lawyer given this given
the open sourcing of web less does this
mean that if Matias Duarte wanted to he
could take cards he did put it it no but
like real cards and put it in Android I
you know I don't know they didn't say
what license they're gonna do they said
yeah totally I mean if device mark said
to me they want to completely
open-source whether the last I don't
know that means there's like there's all
these levels right it's it's pretty
straightforward what he said no that's
that I mean it seemed to be like webOS
in its entirety in terms of like as in
Oh apps but actually that's something
they're doing you know they said will
give will do web West right now will do
any later and it was like the big
application framework and then we'll do
the rest of the user space later so
there's three steps there saying yeah
what he was saying is there's part that
that need to be tweaked so they can be
open then you finish them
finish that look I think that this is
the end of the road for webOS as a
product I think we'll see a bunch of
like maybe Chinese phones with it like
call their companies I want to build it
into things maybe Google can take some
of it and roll ups on the but I don't
think they need to they have Mattia if
they have the brain behind why the last
I working for them right I think he has
new and different ideas and I think
you're a creative person you have new
indie the cards going up in debt so
complete look you already took most of
this
you know just finish the PlayBook with
webos oh it's dark it's dark very dark
my love affair with Paul Miz is is over
it you know what in died a long time ago
really wow this has got really sad
started it started beautiful you know it
really was like all relationships it was
there was hope
yeah then it would go on forever and
then they cheated on you with HP they
lie what he left me for HP and then HP
mess them up bad and when I went when I
saw them again
it wasn't the palm that I knew No</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
