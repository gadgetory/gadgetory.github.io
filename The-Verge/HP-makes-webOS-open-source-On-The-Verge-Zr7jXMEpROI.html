sourcing webos anyone is that anyone any
web OS users here it's got to be willing
cover it's all our staff in one person
we put them in the nosebleed seat you
just can't win can you so so HP's open
sourcing webos and they're gonna still
make tablets basically I didn't know
about you you think I talked to I talked
to the CEO Meg Whitman and Marc
Andreessen who is on the board and you
think they both lied to me well you know
it's really interesting cuz their first
announcement kind of that they put up an
FAQ said we'll evaluate well blow open
source web wash we think it's great
we'll evaluate it for future products
which is basically like we think it's
not very good right and we'll see if it
gets better wait I don't think that's
one like random dudes in their basement
make it better for us because we failed
to do I don't think that means that I
think it means but they also said we're
gonna build the tablets in 2013 which is
like we're gonna take a break makes we
stopped at this man maybe not this year
maybe next year that what would its
basically already 2013 when you think
about it that's tomorrow I mean look
close our eyes Meg wake up you can try
the touchpad again maybe she could meet
the guy the Grand Central guy the time
machine or whatever I I think I think
they had I think they made the first
answer we're gonna open source it you
know I think they were giving up and
they got the give up five and they said
well we're not gonna give up when I
talked to her she kept mentioning how
forwardable was going to be for them
which is not like a good necessarily
good thing to hear when we're making a
big decision you know like when somebody
says I got this for you was affordable
like you don't think like this is gonna
be great you think like it'll be good
enough right I guess when they bought
palm and they bought web West all they
talked to us we have so much scale we
have so many resources where HP we can
do anything we want we have all this
cash it's just ants in a it's in a box
here you go jon rubinstein and then do
anything with it where was John
Rubenstein's music ya know where right
it was it was Meg Whitman and Mark
injuries and who were basically not
there when they bought palms right and
Marc Andreessen his name is for what
Netscape the new face of webos yeah the
guy naked Netscape and the lady here on
ebay Mozilla I mean there's wins there
you use the Firefox at I know
I would not go for a swim right I am a
chrome user well another great google
product yeah Gruber by the way another
killer I'll bet your urgency to browsers
mercy I don't know if I'm talking about
like I like speakers as I walking around
out there piece of questions that haunts
us yeah real it's haunting haunting
presence but uh yeah I don't know this
just feels like this is the end of the
line I just like this is like really
great for that for the like homebrew
guys yeah web internals are getting so
psycho guys they were already putting up
pictures screenshots of like the evo 3d
like running hacked builds webos like TC
in our office you like still has a pre
was like super excited because there's
web lesson real hardware you know that's
great that's that's great for those guys
I mean this is this is what me go they
killed Kenny go ken with white glass
right give him this I mean you're a
lawyer given less given the open
sourcing of web less does this mean that
if Matias Duarte wanted to he could take
cards here I did put it no but like real
cards and put it in android I you know I
don't know they didn't say what license
are going to do a study a totally
addictive like Mark said to me they want
to completely open source web the last I
don't know that means there's like
there's all these levels right it's it's
pretty straightforward what he said no
that's like that I mean it seemed to be
like webos in its entirety in terms of
like as in OS but actually that's all
we're doing you know they said we'll
give will do web West right now will do
ennio later and it was like the big
application framework and then we'll do
the rest of the user space later so
there's three steps they're saying yeah
i mean he's what he was saying is
there's part that that need to be
tweaked so they can be open Teddy to
finish them yeah like we left that uh
the email client should finish that now
look I think that this is the end of the
road for webos as a product I think
we'll see a bunch of like maybe Chinese
fans with it like call their companies I
want to build it into things maybe
Google can take some of it and roll ups
on the but I don't think they need to
they have minty if they have a brain
behind why the last I working for them
right I think he has new and different
ideas and I think you're a creative
person you have a new indie the cards
going up and dead episode of the
prophesied side completely it's a rent
it like look you already took most of
the
you know just finish the play book with
webos oh it's a dark dark very dark oh
my love affair with palm is over it you
know what it in died a long time ago
really wow this has got really sad
started it started beautiful you know it
really was like all relationships it was
there was hope yeah that it would go on
forever and then they cheated on you
with HP they lie what he left me for HP
and then I HP messed them up back and
when I went when I saw them again it
wasn't the poem that I knew no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
