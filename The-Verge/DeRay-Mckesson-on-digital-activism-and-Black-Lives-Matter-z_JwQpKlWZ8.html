two years ago there are people who
thought that there was a problem with
Ferguson they did not yet accept there
was a problem across the country and
we've won that battle the next part of
the work is to create a critical mass of
people who know what the solutions
aren't have the skills to implement them
so in five years and I'm hopeful that
I'd be in a place as an organizer but we
have created that critical mass but I'm
also hopeful that we'll be celebrating
some of the accomplishments around the
criminal justice reform and we were
figuring out how to use technology to
build community differently I think that
the movement is a testament to the power
of Twitter you know in Missouri most
people don't realize that the reason
that you didn't see aerial footage in
those early days and August September
October 2014 is because they declared a
no-fly zone so if it were not for
Twitter and Facebook and Instagram
Missouri would have convinced you that
we didn't exist and we saw that we saw
those tools be powerful tools help us
build a different type of community and
I think that we have to be open to new
ways of organizing and new ways of
building community you know I'm mindful
that we aren't born woke something wakes
us up ever so many people woke them up
with a tweet or a Facebook post an
Instagram post a picture
so I'll never criticize people who
people deemed to be Twitter activists or
hashtag activists because I know that
telling the truth is often a tough act
no matter where you tell that truth and
that there is no one way to do this work
there's no one way to be someone who
cares about justice equity there's no
one way to use the tech platforms I
think about us that we had used Twitter
the way that all the articles said that
you use Twitter we will ever be here I
think that one of the things that we've
learned is that there's no one solution
that body cameras can be implemented
effectively as a part of a comprehensive
set of solutions but alone that they are
not the win the White House has actually
done some interesting research on body
cameras around body cameras about can we
use the audio from body cameras to
detect aggression in officers before the
trauma happened so right now we think
about body cameras it is post-trauma
it's like something bad happens we look
at the video but could we use the audio
I think that's fascinating that we'll
see many more things like that start to
start to come to the fore or how we can
use technology to hold people
accountable and the other thing is about
data
there are some huge questions about how
we use data if I could create one thing
in the next five years it would be like
a massive crowd-sourced Big Data project
that got volunteers from all across the
world to sift through some of these
issues so there are some towns and don't
have newspapers if the police kills
somebody in that town like they designed
the data set there are some places in
Texas for instance where it looks like
white people are being disappeared more
than people of color and we think that
in those communities and Latinos are
actually being miscoded is white because
it's just their names that people are
using you know most people don't realize
that the homicide rate in cities
actually includes the people that the
police kill some places like Albuquerque
one in three people killed in
Albuquerque is actually killed by the
police but if you just look at the
homicide rate you don't know that have
you heard any number about police
violence at all ever it is all from
local media reports that means that if
you get killed in them if you kill by a
police officer in American a newspaper
does not write about it you are not in
the data set that is wild I worry
sometimes that we forgot how to imagine
what is possible that you think about
things like slavery took a lot of
imagination rather till it took some
real mental leaves to be like these
people are just like worthless these
people worth more gonna put them in
Chains and so in concocting the problems
people were really imaginative in the
worst ways and when we're in these
moments we're like okay the problems are
bad and like let's figure out how to
undo them people all of a sudden are
like unimaginative you you say something
like give every kid in born in the city
and poverty give them a library and
people like we could never do that we
could never afford it it's like that is
just so mind-blowing to me that like
people just lost their imagination at
scale and you think about how we got
here took real leaps of imagination and
commitments in the worst possible ways
my sense of hope is rooted so much in my
time as a teacher I taught six math and
Easter of Brooklyn and I think every day
about fighting for Bill
in a world that is worthy of the kids
that I taught and that is real to me in
protest I've met incredible people and I
met so many people across the country
who did not understand their own power
who did not believe that the sound of
their own voice and they found it over
the last two years and every time me
another person like that it reminds me
that that the people are there we just
have to figure out how to organize and
we have to figure out how to activate
and mobilize but the people exist the
passion exists that we can do this
