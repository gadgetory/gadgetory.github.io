ready to crash some cars
ubisoft's the crew might seem like a
standard III driving demo and it wasn't
high on my list of games but that all
changes when you're inside a $35,000
race car simulator sim craft is a
company dedicated to high end simulation
machines there are various systems for
different game genres but the apex 3 GT
was designed to feel like a sports car
even if it looks more like the car from
death proof it made an appearance at e3
last year but this was the first time I
got to check it out when you first get
into the sim craft it's a lot like the
seat pedal and steering wheel system
you'd find running cruising USA in an
arcade fundamentally that's what it is
but the real story is the suspension and
force feedback system that can make you
feel like you're violently crashing into
a tree or pushing the limits of your car
it adds another layer to racing games
since you have to compensate for how
your steering wheel shakes when you go
too fast or the sudden shock of spinning
around sim craft isn't the kind of thing
that's going to show up on Kickstarter
for a few hundred dollars its creator
says individual fans have bought outfits
but he describes it as a labor of love
and it's the kind of big expensive
system that really exists for amusement
parks and events like this it may not
use gloves or goggles but it shares a
common goal with the virtual reality
systems I've spent most of e3 testing
making you feel like you're really part
of a game</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
