we're here to South by Southwest we are
checking out the leap motion controller
we're looking at the final retail
consumer product this little thing right
here it's gonna come May 13th $80
so tell me last thing we saw this we're
actually a much bigger prototype this is
the final deal yeah yeah that's all it's
in production it's looking good it's
final thing final cables final pretty
much everything software is wrapping
together now and developers are starting
to push their episodes we're actually
gonna check out some of those demos
where we can check out first we're gonna
do a clay molding one and then we're
gonna do a fish flocking one and then
we're gonna do a drop cord fish flocking
em hmm
might wanna change the name for that I'm
kidding yeah yeah that's cool that's
what they named it so we're doing clay
molding we're doing fish flocking yeah
be very careful I say that yeah and then
we go check out double fine's drop cord
their music game for this yeah also
check it out we're doing some little
clay molding right here kind of pushing
some clay in here kind of doing a little
bit of a happy face there changing the
brush size it's pulling a little nose
out and they moving up pulling some hair
over here over here over here so you're
just using basically just using things
just kind of pointing to get everything
kind of that molded I kind of moving my
hand around and they kind of move the
camera that's a bad as bad much as I
could do with actual clay in about five
seconds but it's cool that now that you
know that first five seconds is total
totally did a thing before whether
you're on the cook you know in the
virtual world with the room it's very
it's very uh Bart Simpson right there
take Bart Simpson into it can you pinch
to to pull out of clay or is it just
like not know I can I can pull from
different direction so this sort of like
kind of pulling it out okay I don't like
gravitational pull just killed him yeah
yeah yeah yeah sure let me reset it for
ya okay I can even spin it around so you
can kind of get a bit of a pottery wheel
going here okay and push it in and
here you go kind of this is gonna be
very embarrassing you go ahead and push
it push it in with little finger
there we go you can kind of hold it in
okay then I can kind of go right here
and yeah hiding a base you just push it
a little bit there you go there you go
okay and then just uh a little squiggly
lines and just say yeah I know what I'm
doing here to attain it two at a time
you know this is exactly what looks like
I did pottery class
this is alright let's let's pull out I'm
afraid to see what that is uh that is
exactly what looked like in art school
here we sort of have this 3d ai driven
flock of fish and you know you kinda
kind of move around with your hands as
if they're sort of being dynamically
attracted to them and kind of lead them
around through the camera maybe come
back out and then if you move too fast
to scare away and you know there's some
interesting sort of a sort of enabling
exploration and interaction with the
world at scales or places or depths that
people don't have access to normally and
there's some interesting sort of
educational and gameplay mechanics too
and stuff like that so how do you play
this there like these there are these
little circle things that you have to
hit and but then there's other ones that
you're not supposed to hit and it kind
of picks up and accelerates to the game
it kind of gets more and more intense
and more and more difficult and there's
little bad guys I just want to hit or
you'll see at loose points and you
thought it gets more aerobatic you start
like flinging this thing around and it's
this is a first this is the first level
it's like about its tame as it gets but
imagine it the music and all the
gameplay picking up and getting like
really intense as you go through and
kind of spinning things around and sort
of doing stuff like that and it's a
pretty dynamic and fun and sort of
arcade style sort of dance - a game so
what you don't want to hear the bass
drop right there you don't yeah the the
hitting those little bad guys they're
spinning it around and everything kind
of changes and is dynamic and is
different every time you play that you
go through yeah
yeah losing here no no okay yeah I lost
but that's pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
