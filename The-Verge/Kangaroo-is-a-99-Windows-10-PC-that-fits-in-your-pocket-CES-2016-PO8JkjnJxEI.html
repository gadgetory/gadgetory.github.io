is the kangaroo it's a $99 Windows 10 PC
it kind of looks like a portable SSD
drive you just plug into any laptop but
it's actually got an Intel Atom
processor inside here a 2 gig of memory
and 32 gig of storage so that means you
could just plug it in via HDMI with a
couple of years speed ports for your
keyboard and mouse and you've got
Windows 10 PC on the go so you could see
dock it and just like this into a
monastery of HDMI you've got the USB for
your keyboard and mouse it's a full PC
on the go and there's a little bit of
lag that I've noticed I think that's
mainly because it's an atom chip and
there's no like that that's literally
the system ownership graphics and stuff
so it's not going to be perfect but it
plays video okay you can navigate around
fine it's not too bad is some basic $99
PC so the only other trick that's really
good is so you could change an iPad into
a Windows 10 PC so basically it plugs in
by the lightning cable you download an
iOS app and then you got Windows 10 PC
that you can you can actually touch the
iPad screen navigate around again it's a
little laggy in this sort of interface
because obviously it's going through the
cable and onto the iOS app but if you
really want a port for Windows 10 PC you
can plug it to a monitor keyboard or an
iPad this isn't too bad for $99 so the
really unique thing about this kangaroo
Windows 10 PC is it has a four hour
battery life inside it before you need
to sort plug it in and recharge that's
pretty cool compared to like a PC stick
or any of the other alternatives so
might be worth considering if you're
really looking for something that's this
small on this port ball for Windows 10
PC so as a quick look at the kangaroo
Windows 10 PC is out now for $99 if you
want to see anything more from CES 2016
