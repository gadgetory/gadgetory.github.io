at the windows communications apps and
these are basically the windows live
replacements and Microsoft has obviously
pre-installed them on the consumer
preview version here so if we start off
with messaging so this is like windows
live messenger if we right-click we can
go to new and start up a conversation
with someone so select that person you
say hey and doesn't look like this any
way to share sort of images and the sort
of typical file attachments our stuff at
the moment but it's obviously just a
basic messenger at the moment expect
that by the time the ship's they'll
probably be a bit a lot more
functionality but the moment is sort of
you can change your status to appear
online or offline and you can message
people and that's about it there's no
sign of any SMS integration that we've
seen rumored but this is basically the
windows live messenger equivalent okay
so now we're going to take a look at the
inbuilt mail application and add a
hotmail camp
so you just seen as we're adding the
hotmail account one of the sort of
notifications from messing up i just
clicked on that so they'll switch is
obviously back straight into the Machine
up okay so this is basically the mail
interface it and we're running a bit of
a low resolution at the moment so we
obviously haven't got a good preview on
the right hand side here and but you'll
see is you can obviously access any of
your mail okay so you can use the Delete
key to delete in males here so just a
sort of normal thing that you do expect
and now one of the important
improvements is much less actually
editing exchange functionality and so
you don't actually require an outlet
capitation to get access to an exchange
mailbox and that's quite powerful for a
free application that will ship with
Windows 8 once you've had in an account
you can quickly switch between them if
you right click and go to the account
screen here and obviously if you've got
multiple accounts they will be listed on
the left hand side here but the default
sort of interface is just this to panel
one here so you've got your mail on your
left and a preview on the right hand
side here okay so next up we're gonna
have a look at the photos application
now this app will provide access to
SkyDrive photos and Facebook photos by
default and you can also link in your
flickr photos if you've got a flickr
account mina and now the pictures
library will see contain all the sort of
like local pictures that you've either
saved or you've taken from a webcam and
we haven't got any right now and but you
can go in and take a look at perhaps
some of the face version features there
save me look at some of the
your cover photo there obviously mobile
play so they all freely available to to
browse free okay so within the photos
application you can obviously go into
your photos here if you right-click you
get a few options you can you view it
directly on facebook or you can set it
as an appt tile or set it as the lock
screen let's just go ahead and do that
so it's gone ahead and done that so now
if we lock the device we've got our own
picture on that okay so we're just gonna
have a look at the actual work and in a
replication and we go in obviously just
a sort of basic calendar here and you
can add add entries as you'd expect and
you can you can also look at a week view
I'll give you your Ebola and debut that
gives you today and tomorrow and you can
also you switch straight back to to
today if you've gone like a few along
you get back today for any quickly so
fairly simple application</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
