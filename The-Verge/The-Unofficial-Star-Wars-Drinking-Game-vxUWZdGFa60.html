verge I'm here with my co-host bb-8
Sahai BBA
and it's May the fourth which means you
might feel inclined to watch all Star
Wars today that's seven films which is a
heavy load but luckily we figured out a
drinking game for you now before you go
on know first that we don't endorse
drinking in excess so let's get started
drink whenever you see a white
transition now you might see a sliding
wipe the window wipe the upward wipe the
diagonal wipe no star wipes which is
weird since was the 70s any time Luke
Skywalker wines which especially in
Episode four is constant come on you're
about to save the galaxy what's the
matter
whenever the Millennium Falcon fails go
to light speed whenever you hear a
Wilhelm scream
whenever darth vader force choke someone
whenever the Imperial March plays
whenever the number is 1138 or 2187 or
references Bing prisoner transfer from
cell block 1-1 3-8 any time a character
mentions the force which is basically
all the time
I'm sorry whenever someone says I've got
a bad feeling about this
which is again just that all the time
take a shot oh my god
whenever Greedo shoots first and he
doesn't shoot first so I don't know why
you're watching that version so take a
double shot whenever a large spherical
weapon is destroyed by a ragtag group of
rebels whenever a force ghost appears
whenever somebody has their arm or hand
chopped off whenever someone screams no
whenever anyone says it's a trap I know
you're trapped that's all that we've got
for you guys right now hope you guys
enjoy your Star Wars day and the fourth
be with you see you next time
Cheers doing your keys give me your keys
no you can't go home you're sleeping it
off no I know you need to get home but
you're sleeping it off don't give me
that look every time with him every time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
