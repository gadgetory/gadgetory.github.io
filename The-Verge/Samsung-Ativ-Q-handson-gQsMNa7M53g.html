verge and we looking at the samsung
active q now this is a new laptop the
samsung announced today it's got 13.3
qhd+ display assoc running a free 200 x
1800 resolution so it's extremely high
res first offense it looks like a
Windows 8 tablet basically it's crazy
hinge on it all right aces we can just
peel it out to reveal a keyboard here
it's quite a white keyboard you have to
kind of stretch to reach the backspace
it's got a little knob here as well so
there's no there's no actual trackpad
gonna bottom you got the sauce
traditional buttons and also you can
perch√© maneuver the screen so then eat
your dinner on it if you want or
something like that I don't know what
you'd use it in this mode for but it
works like that so you can also push it
forward like that now it won't it won't
snap around device but it just simply
stay there's like a stand so you can
display content on it and they're kind
of crazy thing about this device if you
will and it actually runs Android as
well so there's a little application
here called jus OS and I think speaking
two guys here you have to trigger it
from some sort of keyboard combination
when it literally flicks straight into
Android so there's no you a switch on
the side you're straight in you can
access the sort traditional Android
Stephanie could go straight back to
Windows 8 so yeah it looks like they're
virtualizing this
and it runs kind of okay and it doesn't
look too great on his five ways display
compared to windows 8 but all intensive
purposes it works now this also ship 256
gig of SSD it's got 720p camera up front
and we sort of other options like
gigabit ethernet and Wi-Fi social and
looking at it span of God a brushed
metal finish and then a map back and it
feels and looks very much like a Samsung
device and it sort of fits in with their
RT devices and I'm sort of right there t
VES windows phone as well so that was a
quick look at the samsung atif you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
