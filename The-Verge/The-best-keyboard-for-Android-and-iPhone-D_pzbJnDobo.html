which is great for everything from
browsing the web to watching video to
catching up on all of your ebooks but
with bigger phones comes one problem it
can be really hard to use your phone
with one hand hanging out a long message
with your left hand while you're sucking
down a piping hot coffee and you're
right it can be quite a chore
fortunately iOS and Android both let you
customize your keyboard so you can make
those long whatsapp conversations less
painful
custom keyboards are pretty new to iOS
in fact you couldn't even change our
Apple stock keyboard until the release
of iOS 8 in 2014 the default keyboard
has gotten a lot better to it now has
intelligent word predictions and smarter
autocorrect but if you want the best and
easiest typing experience on the iPhone
we recommend SwiftKey it's fast and
responsive for tap typing has a super
useful and fast tracing feature and it
comes with the best word prediction you
can get often times I don't even need to
type a word because SwiftKey already
knows what I'm going to say the using a
third party keyboard with iOS can still
be a somewhat buggy experience certain
actions like password entry are limited
to Apple's keyboard and apps like
messages can be prone to crashing when
you're using a third party option swift
key is one of the most reliable ones
that we've used but even it can still
crash and cause issues but on the whole
Swift key works great with a large
number of apps and it can really make it
easier to type on your iPhone especially
if you've got a 5.5 inch iPhone 6 plus
other keyboards like Touch pal or flexi
offer more theming options have
predictive emoji or boast ultra smart
autocorrect menuhim is a crazy keyboard
that can shrink down to a fraction of
the size of a normal keyboard and still
let you type accurately but Swift Keys
combination of fast typing response
smart word prediction and effortless
tracing make it the one that's easiest
to use over the long run plus it's free
so there's no investment required to try
it out over on Android third party
keyboards are nothing new and there are
a ton of options and unlike with iOS
Android keyboards work everywhere and
are really quite reliable even though
there are so many options available we
think that Google's keyboard is the best
one for the most people it's available
pre-installed on a bunch of phones but
everyone else can download it for free
from the Play Store here's what makes
Google keyboards so great it's fast and
responsive when you want to type out
characters and it also has a great
tracing option for when you only have a
single thumb to spare
it also has word prediction built-in
emoji and a design that fits in with
Google's material design rules that
isn't to say that some of the other
Android keyboards aren't great a lot of
people really like Swift key for good
reason as it's the same super smart word
prediction engine as on iOS it also has
a ton of different themes to change how
it looks but we find that Swift key on
Android isn't as good as Google's
keyboards when you just want to pick out
words manually
you've probably also heard asswipe which
was the first keyboard that let you
trace out words with just a single
finger but while it's tracing is really
great it's not very good for tap typing
what you need to do whenever you need to
type in a password or a word not from
the dictionary the same can be said for
flexi menuhim and others well they each
might Excel a one particular method of
inputting text to your phone none offers
many options or work as well across
different methods as Google's keyboard
the physical keyboard is all but gone
and voice input isn't quite where we
need it to be to replace your standard
keyboard but with SwiftKey for iOS at
Google keyboard on your Android devices
banging out long text messages or
writing the next great American novel is
within your reach</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
