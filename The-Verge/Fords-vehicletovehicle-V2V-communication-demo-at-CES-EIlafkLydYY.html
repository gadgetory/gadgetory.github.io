here at CES 2014 looking at Ford's
vehicle the vehicle communication demo
this is all about safety we're in a
little road course that set up in a
parking lot across the street from the
convention center here at CES there are
two Tauruses and they're wired up with
this system that's constantly
broadcasting information about where the
car is what direction it's facing the
yaw the speed and the concept is that by
transmitting that information to other
cars this car can stay safer by knowing
where that car is
so the first scenario for demonstrated
for us was the idea of you overtaking
car in expressway for instance a lot of
cars now have what are called list
sensors which are these little amber
lights that are in the side view mirrors
that indicate when there's somebody in
your blind spot but the problems that
they don't work at speed necessarily and
they don't work when a car is way behind
you so when you have these cars
transmitting data to one another you
enable that you don't need a sensor that
has to shoot that far behind you you
just communicate via what is this
effectively a Wi-Fi like standard the
cars positions relative to one another
and then the car in front knows hey I
shouldn't merge over right now because
there's a car that's about to overtake
me the system can literally see through
cars if there's a vehicle in front of
you that doesn't have vehicle to vehicle
communication enabled but the one in
front of it does and that car breaks
hard
your car will know so that you have more
advanced warning that you need to slow
down they showed us a second example of
this sort of seeing through cars
situation where say you're pulling up to
a toll booth the vehicle in front of you
suddenly swerves out of the way and the
vehicle ahead of that is stopped well
before you would have been able to see
that but with this system you can
because your car knew all along exactly
where the car and at the very front was
so if you're traveling at speed you can
get a warning that you need to slow down
you're not going to be surprised when
the car in front of you stores out of
the way and finally if so what could
happen when a car goes through a red
light
well actually we didn't see that and
that's a good thing and that's because
we had the system in place so say you're
coming up to an intersection you have a
green light you go well if a car is
coming at speeding in the other
direction it has a red light doesn't see
the red light you're dealing with a
drunk driver who knows and they have
that vehicle vehicle communication
system enabled they're going to be able
to communicate to your vehicle that
they're moving quickly your car is going
to know to tell you to stop even though
you have the green light
unfortunately this technology isn't
super close to going into production
there a few different challenges one is
of the standard still isn't set in stone
secondly they're dealing with a few
problems take for instance when you have
ten thousand cars on LA traffic and
they've been stuck there for days on end
in close proximity the bandwidth just
isn't there to support that many cars
while shooting these signals at the same
time so they're figuring out what to do
about that but if they can overcome that
stuff Ford is saying that we might see
this on the road say about 2020 which by
the way happens to be about the same
timeframe for fully automated cars and
you can obviously see how this plus
self-driving could work hand in hand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
