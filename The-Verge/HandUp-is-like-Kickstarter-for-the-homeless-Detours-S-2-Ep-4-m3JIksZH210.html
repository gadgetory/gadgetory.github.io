has quickly become one of the most
economically vibrant places on earth
because of this localized inflation has
caused the cost of living in San
Francisco to skyrocket there are many
nonprofits serving the homeless and
low-income communities but there are
certain needs that simply can't be met
by large organizations enter hand up the
public benefit company that acts like a
Kickstarter for people in need
homelessness is not just one thing it's
not just the typical stereotype people
think of people who are are homeless who
have full-time jobs who are sick who are
all coming from all walks of life
housing is is a huge issue it's just
it's so expensive to live here oh it's a
great place to live i love it but it
just yeah the the cost of rents are
escalating they already were high
escalating really quickly our clients
have all kinds of challenges in their
lives but even the ones who do awesome
and you get this great full-time job you
know even then it's really hard to raise
a family here you know it's just the
incomes are not on par at all with the
cost of living so hand up is a direct
donation system for homeless people and
other people in need that lets you
donate directly to a specific person
that you want to help and then a hundred
percent of the funds go directly towards
food medical care housing and other
basic needs for that person so this is
the hand up homepage we really try to
emphasize the human connections as much
as possible so we see this banner of a
lot of our members is there totally
random selection of members what we're
doing is using technology to help create
a bridge so that the community and can
help directly we are building technology
for people in poverty and for human
service organizations and we're also a
for-profit technology startup but we are
a new kind of for-profit called a public
benefit corporation and so that lets us
have the growth of a traditional for
profit while also having the values of a
social a socially driven organization so
the way hand up works is we build the
technology and we partner with
nonprofits that already serve the
homeless and at-risk community so we
sign up an organization like compass
Family Services teach them how to use
our software and then the case managers
will administer the site my name is
kevin and i hope to get into a one
bedroom apartment what I want most of
all especially for Christmas I don't
want two front teeth I my whole said and
I hope to receive a bed
anak tools like box open-end wrenches
socket ratchets breaker bars pipe wrench
crescent wrench screwdriver micrometer
early looking for employment I don't
have any codes to uh for the interview
any kind of job you have to have teeth
and you just look really funny and sound
really funny when you don't have your
teeth so being employed against on my
list one of hand ups many success
stories is single mother Janelle who
needed a computer to finish her online
school so I'm a single mother of two
boys and i work in san francisco for
human service agency and i go to school
at x equal city college i had enrolled
in an online class and i didn't have a
computer so i was using the computer at
work don't tell anyone to do my
assignments in and so as i was like no
you need a computer so she told me about
hand up and she said you should just
create a create a profile and see if
they can help me i did that and my
request was granted in like 24 hours i
think the donors were just awesome they
were just I'm happy to help I think she
put in a request for about five hundred
dollars for a computer and someone
donated four hundred dollars to her
right off the pad and just knowing that
there are people out there who would do
that and you know just for a stranger I
think that's been really cool and really
surprising to see one thing that hand up
does is tries to create this two-way
communication between our members and
their donors so on the bottom we see the
most recent update that Janelle sent
thinking the donors for all the help
that they give in so on the right side
we see this is how you can donate to
Janelle's account and then there's also
the option to add a five dollar tip hand
up and this is basically how we support
our operations we even cover the credit
card processing costs so we make sure
that if you select fifty dollars then
fifty dollars goes to Janelle
and then I have the opportunity to
respond here as donor and right Jenelle
little message so it really starts to
create this community feel and support
network a lot like your facebook friends
would technology isn't you know isn't a
silver bullet it's not going to to
completely solve poverty but just in my
experience working in nonprofits working
with incredibly vulnerable populations
it's so powerful as a tool to reach more
people and really importantly for our
model is sharing the story with an
estimated 3.5 million homeless people in
the United States and countless more
teetering on the brink low-income
America needs all the help it can get
hopefully for-profit models like hand up
are able to both maintain profitability
and more importantly adhere to their
founding documents</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
