from here Stephen Elop the CEO of Nokia
hey good to see you good to see you just
announced a very bright phone you tell
us about it let's go on there yes the
Lumia 1020 clearly the next chapter in
smartphone imaging with this device you
can get closer to things than ever
before in large part because of the 41
megapixel sensor that we have on that
yeah you can discover and rediscover
stories because you can take one picture
and then zoom in zoom out reframe at any
level of detail subsequently and at the
same time you can see things you've
never even seen before we demonstrated a
few minutes ago the needle in the
haystack take a picture of a haystack
and you can actually zoom in and capture
that needle image so they ask you during
your event and this is actually one of
the most unique smartphone launch events
I've ever been to so very cool but I was
actually struck by you didn't mention
the words Windows Phone until like
nearly 20 minutes into the event you
didn't talk about software until nearly
20 minutes after you sent so much time
focused on the hardware of this phone
because obviously have a very unique
camera you've got what's ball bearings
in the Image Stabilizer yep just tell me
how you think about Nokia is a hardware
vendor versus a software vendor other
smartphone companies like hey we got a
great hardware it looks beautiful you
have some competitor like hey it's
hardware don't worry about it here's are
all of our software gimmicks yeah but
you this was a really hardware focused
it's sort of distorted hardware because
in order to accomplish what we've
accomplished we have a backside
illuminated sensor we have optical image
stabilization when we started to
demonstrate the Nokia pro camera
application and the ability to do manual
zoom where you see the over sampling
where that large frame image is turned
into a five megapixel image for sharing
right all of that is software so there
is as much if not more software and
algorithmic work that goes into creating
this and hardware platform right so
that's I guess that's why I'm getting it
that's like it's it's it's standing next
to the platform right I mean you could
do you could do that software stuff for
the camera kind of anywhere and what I
was really grabbing about this was for a
while is like you're announcing
camera like this feels like a really
high-end camera when you put the grip on
it it looks like a high-end camera yep I
mean I guess what I'm getting at is how
do you feel about in terms of when a
consumer walks in the store they see the
hardware feature of the family what
you're doing at the hardware and then
you've got a seldom Windows Phone next
to it as the third platform you got to
move to do you think the hardware is the
way in to doing that sort of thing I
think it's the whole experience because
all of these imaging experiences are
done within the context of Windows Phone
you know sharing the Facebook being able
to see these images on my live tiles
that's all part of the Windows Phone
experience so I think someone walking
into a store they'll need to understand
that it's a Windows Phone experience but
I think will be taken over the goal line
by an amazing imaging experience see
okay so let me ask you one question
so 41 megapixels do you think average
consumers really want like 41 megapixels
or is that the marking line that gets
you to the oversampled 5 megapixel
images you actually what consumers
really want yeah is great images so for
example we had on stage with us the CEO
of AT&amp;amp;T Mobility ralph de la Vega just
before we went on he said all you got to
see one of the cool pictures I took and
it was a picture of a pool setting where
one of his family members was in the
distance the far distance so he took a
picture of that pool but then he was
able to zoom in afterwards and capture
the image of his family member as a
separate image that's a whole new
experience that excites people and
causes them to just go wow look at what
I've been able to do it's the same thing
here we took a picture of you just just
before we got started you didn't do this
like I can you know make that image
about you
yeah just showing it there or I can make
it about the gentleman behind the camera
like that or because it captures so much
more information around what I actually
took we can make it about the whole team
that's set up here today
so the combination of all of those
things is about great imaging being able
to shoot first and get the image you
want later that's what's going to make
the difference whether it's 41 that's
not the big thing that makes it possible
but it's this experience that will
convince consumers and you think that's
going to take the average sort of like
Gmail Google ecosystem consumer and
bring them over to new ecosystem that's
the important to people they say wow how
do I do that
and then if we can introduce them to
Windows Phone as part of that process
there's another wild factor there as
well that's great thank you so much
today thank you sir</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
