San Francisco in hopes of trying to get
developers to build apps for Windows has
a really worked out every year but this
year they've got a new trick up their
sleeves to Windows 10 this conference is
all about celebrating the creativity the
ingenuity that you all bring so the
biggest announcement of the week has
definitely been Microsoft bringing
Android and iOS apps to Windows it's not
quite as simple as it sounds and they
basically trying to get developers to
port their apps to windows and run them
there you will be able to compile the
same objective-c code that's being used
in iOS applications within visual studio
on Windows it's kind of a disruptive
thing and you books you got the two
powers and the mobile web which is
Android and iOS and Microsoft really
wants to grab those developers and get
them onto windows whoever it's going to
work hmm we're seeing it could end up
with a mishmash of apps on on Windows
Phone and no real identity and no real
like design ethos or anything like that
but Microsoft really hoping this is
their last chance to really get these
apps on windows and to get people buying
windows phones aside from the mobile
stuff when it's 10 obviously spans
across PCs tablets phones and Xbox one
and this week we kind of got the first
official name for the project Spartan
browser which is a successor to
internets bra so now it's called
Microsoft edge I might just keeping the
kind of circular II logo that they had
with ie for like the familiarity of like
your grandma using an explorer's when I
left kind of weird logo i don't if
they're going to keep it around like
they picked it so it's probably here to
stay in terms of Microsoft edge it's
news clean it's simple you can have
extensions coming by the end of the year
so much just really cleaned its act up
with the browser and it's bringing some
is that that's new and fresh and
bit more simple than in the Explorer has
been in the past because Windows 10 runs
across pcs phones tablets wherever you
want there's some interesting new things
that might just kind of doing with it so
one of them is continuing for phones
which is essentially an interface that
will allow you to plug your phone into a
monitor and keyboard and mouse and it'll
be an interface that stretches from the
phone to the pc so instead of getting
your phone interface on a monitor you
get like a PC in two ways you can launch
Excel Word and that sort of stuff and
use it as a pc so it's kind of cool and
what wasn't cool this week is that
Michael didn't really give us a release
date for other stuff so the phone stuff
is coming later this year the pc stuff
is coming this summer and summers pretty
broad we've heard like AMD CEO say end
of July we've personally heard July 29
Thursday we'll see if Microsoft makes
that but I think Windows 10 is going to
come in pretty hot it's going to have a
lot of updates to it and not all the
features going to be there straight away
and then the final piece of the windows
10 puzzle is hollow lens somites will
shade it back in January and it's
progressed somewhat in a hundred days
since then so it's now headset I've
tried it on i'd say i've spent about
fifty percent of the demo trying to
adjust it for my eyes and get the field
of view right and i think that's kind of
the one thing that i noticed from the
demos this time around back in january i
could look around and everything felt a
little bit more immersive but this time
it felt like i had to have the hologram
in a certain position and i had to move
to that and it didn't feel like it was
part of the world necessarily so i think
that's going to be the struggle with
colin ends and some of the demos were
cool i can inflate fishes ever put stuff
on the walls all that sort stuff it's
cool but i think there's still some work
to go and we don't know what's inside it
we don't know how much it's going to
cost or when it's are you going to
arrive so there's still some questions
around Halloween's it's cool it's
exciting but they're still there's still
some work to be done there Microsoft
really knows where needs to do and it's
kind of tried to put that on show this
week whether it really entices mobile
developers this time who knows this is
kind of like their last chance really
and if they go another year or two
without the apps across their platforms
and Windows becomes even more relevant
than it is now they've done a lot of the
exciting stuff this week they've shown a
lot of exciting stuff they're looking
towards the future I think Microsoft
knows what it needs to do is just really
whether developers are interested or not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
