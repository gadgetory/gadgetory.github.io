at CES so a couple years ago Adam Cahan
joined Yahoo when Yahoo bought his
company into now and when Marissa Meyer
became CEO she put him in charge of all
of the company's mobile products this
week at CES Yahoo and now some really
interesting things that they plan on
doing with their mobile products this
year we sat down with Adam to find out
exactly what they've got planned you've
had a big 2013 breakneck pace you
updated almost your entire product
lineup can you sort of frame that for us
what were all these redesigns about yeah
so I'll I'll probably answer it mostly
from the mobile perspective because
that's really where I spend most of my
time you know I kind of frame it in a
way of saying it's like starting a
revolution or what you need to start a
revolution is first you need people you
need exceptional talent and you know one
of the things that we talked about was
when we started in 2013 and my team in
particular was basically created in
November of 2012 and we asked the
question of how many people at Yahoo
were doing mobile and the answer was
somewhere between 30 and 50 people and
that was a big kind of aha moment where
we're like wow you know if we're really
gonna be a mobile first company and
we're gonna be exceptional it's probably
not going to be just 50 people so that
started the kind of revolution and what
we did is a tremendous amount of
acquisitions a lot of them talent based
to bring in extraordinary folks some of
them technology-based what happens when
you start bringing all those people
together is you really are focused on
building products and building products
means bringing together designers
product folks engineers to really craft
and create something and what we
basically set out to do was reimagine
pretty much every experience we asked
ourselves simple questions why do I need
another weather app the answer for us
was well actually why as a user am i
reading charts and data when I really
wanted to see the weather and that kind
of started that process so we went
through that type of experience with
each one of our products the results of
that Casey is now starting to show 2013
like you said we pretty much reimagined
every single experience at Yahoo just a
few that we're still working on and from
mobile when I started we reached 100
50 million monthly users we now and
Marissa shared an on-stage
we now reach over 400 million monthly
that's just extraordinary growth I mean
we added over a hundred million in the
last eight months alone I I'd love to
say that's purely because of the
products that we're creating a lot of
that is you know just the general
consumer shift but that was the result
of basically focusing and working on
that what that ultimately leads to in
the final step of the revolution is the
monetization right so when you have the
scale of users you really start to focus
on what can we do from a monetization
perspective I think the biggest thing
for us in 2013 was a recognition of what
happens with a platform shift when a
platform shift starts the first question
that people usually start with is
cannibalization they say things like
well isn't mobile gonna cannibalize
desktop I always find those
conversations incredibly bizarre because
I one I can't actually actually
technically understand how something
eats something else but that's okay but
the answer is clearly no in fact what we
found this year and are seeing more
broadly as a system is that mobile is
additive people are actually finding
more time in the day so this year there
was a Pew report that announced that for
the first time ever American consumers
would do more during their day than
watch TV that was the number one
dominant thing that that we used to do
now actually if you combine mobile and
Internet the time spent there is
actually more than on TV for the first
time ever so we found new time in the
day the second thing that people ask is
well wow these tiny screens
you know big display ads what happens
how do we you know we're gonna go from
dollars to dimes and the answer there is
definitively no actually these devices
are immersive personalized more focus of
the users attention and when you get the
ad formats right they monetize better so
what we saw this year was really the
birth of native advertisement at scale
really experiences that took ads and
made them feel like they were part of
that consumer product so these are
things like we launched with image ads
stream
we've got more and more these formats
coming out as an industry this was a
very big year and I'll actually give
credit to folks like Facebook and others
frankly for showing the way I think what
Facebook pulled off in q3 kind of going
from zero to really 40 plus percent of
their revenue in mobile what they did
was the sort of quadruple backflip of
the industry where all of us got to look
and say okay so that's how it's done
and I think you know at Yahoo we have
our own twist on it and our product
experiences are pretty unique but for
example what you saw with David on stage
with tumblr is a really a progressive
understanding of what advertisement can
be and so when you forecast for 2014
how are you feeling about monetizing
these apps you've been building I think
2014 is gonna be a crossover year if you
saw the math and Marissa showed on stage
800 million so this is exclusive of
tumblr just Yahoo proper eight hundred
million monthly users at Yahoo four
hundred million mobile users we're at
that like perfect 50/50 right now
pageviews not the same actually more
page views on desktop currently than
mobile we will cross this year so I
suspect that at some point towards the
latter half of this year we will see
more engagement more page views more
users on mobile then we will even on
desktop that's an extraordinary
statement right to cross over at that
scale alright let's talk about some of
the product stuff so one of the most
interesting things you guys announced
today was that you've acquired a v8
which makes a kind of home screen
replacement for Android what are you
gonna do with these guys so I think well
one the team is spectacular and really
enjoy getting to know them through this
process and seeing how they think about
stuff I mean one of the things that
you're really looking for when you're
buying a product a technology something
that we're excited about is how people
are thinking about that the team the
core team where do they want to go how
do we fit with that and accelerate what
they're doing a v8 is really spot-on for
where we see search in a previous
incarnation what most of us understood a
search was we would type into a box and
anticipatory computing and that context
was search suggests
type a few characters ooh did you mean
this did you mean that starting to
anticipate what a user was doing what
these guys are doing is saying why do I
even need the text in fact I have all
the signals and all the clues that I
need from the context of your device so
we view that as a natural extension of
where we were going we think a lot at
Yahoo about search is a core part of our
business and and when we thought about
it in the mobile context it really was
about hey how do we get these kinds of
systems what I love about what they're
doing is they really bring together the
spirit of an ecosystem it's a system
right it's really all of the
applications it's a way of thinking
about the user and saying gee what's the
world class you know local application
for when I'm in a new city what do I
actually look for what are those kinds
of things and I just I think their
approaches where this is going right how
do you make it valuable to Yahoo
outside of Android right because other
platforms aren't going to give you that
same level of access that they enjoy
there it's interesting so a couple of
things one is so Android is obviously
the right place to begin and like you
said I mean for us it's mostly an
affordance of the different kinds of
api's and and things that we can do in
that platform and how that starts to
extend for example in iOS or others is
in thinking about systems thinking about
system design you know we started
2012-2013 with a lot of thinking about
applications and thinking about how as a
user we wanted to bring value to you if
you use more than one Yahoo application
if I had news and mail how do those two
work together if I had news mail in
sports how do those work together so
that really started us down this path of
system design so I think the
applications can be the same way so the
example that I use is you know in
Android you can customize your entire
home screen and that experience in iOS I
can still customize once I'm inside an
application what are some of those
sidebar experiences what are some of the
things that we surface for our users I
think that's the same kind of dimension
and it's somewhere it exists a little
bit between the notification world which
is really push and search which is
really pull there's somewhere in between
there that I think we can bring users
value interesting let's talk about the
other big thing that you announced today
which is this app Yahoo News digest
which I've been playing around with now
for a day or so and I've I love it I
mean I think its interested in a design
perspective but what fascinates me is
that at a time when just about everybody
else is building an endless stream and
Yahoo has built its its fair share of
endless streams you've introduced an app
that says you know we're gonna give you
like 10 things and then you're done yeah
talk to me about like kind of what what
brought you guys to that place yeah so a
lot of the inspiration came from Nick
you know Nick is a pretty exceptional
guy and really spends a lot of time
thinking about sort of what experiences
are right and native to him and what we
found was all of us loved the stream and
that sense of endless really comes from
our ability frankly to parse information
super fast what the stream often doesn't
give you is that sense of completion
right did I actually find out what was
important today I don't know right I
looked at a lot of stuff hopefully I got
what was important but I don't actually
know and we started to really riff on
that a lot and say well you know what
what would you need to feel complete and
where was the right metaphor for us
around that and it really came in the
sense of frankly a metaphor from
newspapers morning and evening digests
why were they there they were there to
kind of summarize stuff for you where
Nick took that even one level further
which i think is the right instinct is
he took summarization technology in his
first iteration and said what if I take
an article and kind of distill it down
to those things that are important what
this is saying is if I crawl the web and
I look at all of the different documents
out there I can identify what's
important document clustering hey how
come there's 10 articles on this topic
and if I distill the elements between
all of those different articles I can
come up with a perspective that says
this is the
you really need to know and what I've
found in my own use is literally
flipping through this thing in a minute
I actually feel like I know what's going
on so the weird part for us is in fact
we almost have the opposite metric of a
typical stream
it's how little time can I get you to
spend in the application how can I get
you informed in the minimum amount of
time possible so we actually are like
the anti engagement application do you
think that's particular to news or is
there any way like that that idea could
trickle into other products so my hope
and I think you know we we take it with
the grain of we're still learning and
trying to understand my hope is that
actually this becomes a templating
format for all of our publications you
know for me one of the things that I
that I've observed and is a lot of the
news presentation or information
presentation generally on the web takes
its cues from basic HTML and it's you
know it's a page layout and it's pretty
simple and actually if you take the
metaphor of magazines and what we
actually experienced when we you know
look at some of those things the layouts
are pretty complex right sometimes
they're offset they have titling they
have all kinds of layouts I believe that
what those atoms so those elements right
the distillation of saying this is the
key quote this is the chart this is the
map that if we're thoughtful about those
we could actually get a tremendous
amount of page experiences that would
look really unique for us so I I think
it goes beyond news and information I
think that's the natural starting point
right one of the most interesting things
that you guys talked about on stage
today was as you sort of kind of refined
the public's idea of what Yahoo is all
about you are going to focus on kind of
four core experiences that are powered
by Tumblr and Flickr and that's the
first time I've heard
Yahoo speak about those two things as
engines talk to me about how that fits
into your world become on the mobile
side what are what are tumbling Flickr
gonna power inside of Yahoo absolutely
so what's amazing about those two
products in particular is that they're
really platforms
tumblr probably the largest sort of
blogging platform out there it's like
our certainly one of the largest photo
sites out there when you harness
user-generated content you just get huge
amounts of scale and those products and
experiences will really build as
platforms because they're really about
users contributing sharing outdoing all
of that kind of behavior there isn't
anything endemic that's there and
created for them so we think of Yahoo as
being powered by those experiences just
like our users use those platforms to do
their own publishing and creation there
really frankly creative tools what's
unique is tumbler has the opportunity to
power a lot of the digital magazine
efforts so kind of the next chairman of
of what we're talking about with media
as a publishing platform also as a way
frankly of getting terrific content I
mean you can go deep where you go as
deep as you want a tumbler in in lots of
verticals there so I think that's one
Flickr the imagery there is just
inspiring I mean for us being on the
creative side of thinking about products
every time we go into the Flickr
community and harness that we just come
up with exceptional stuff and this is
where weather came from the new
postcards mail launch we've done it in
pretty much all of our experiences
because the breadth and depth of the
beauty at that site is just
extraordinary so when you think about
those two kind of publishing platforms
you're really getting the creative tools
that you need to build at scale that's
sort of how the powering metaphor came
maybe it's the last question help me set
the stage for hell I just like I set the
stage for 2014 you have already revamped
almost the entire mobile product lineup
except for messenger so are we gonna
finally see a revamp of messenger and if
you won't answer that what can you tell
us about 2014 I'm not gonna answer the
first question 2014 so I think first
part of kind of that revolution going
back to the earlier point and creating
those products getting the users getting
the company back to growth
we shared on a couple of the earnings
calls the fact that actually we returned
to growth in terms of page views and
user engagement in fact returning two
years of losses right so we basically
eclipsed even 2011 numbers now that's
extraordinary the next part of that
revolution is typically monetization
than what you do so we are spending a
tremendous amount of time thinking about
how to get that user experience right
experimenting innovating some of the
stuff that my colleague Scott Berkun
Ounces on stage really critical the
stuff that David talked about in terms
of tumblr and native ads what we're
basically saying is we're gonna get
these ad formats right and when you have
that kind of user scale and you get
those ad formats right the system starts
to really kick adam keyne has really big
plans for Yahoo's mobile products in
2014 and the Android home screen
replacement changes to the rest of
Yahoo's mobile product lineup and an
ambition to make more money on mobile
than young ever has before can he do it
the ambitions are sky-high now he
actually has to go out and deliver</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
