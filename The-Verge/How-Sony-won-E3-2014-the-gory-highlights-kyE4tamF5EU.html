just the news it's all of the news for
the whole week we're in Los Angeles it's
hot we're driving around everywhere
there's traffic there's a million people
everybody loves video games and the two
biggest things are Microsoft and Sony
Microsoft is first Sony is last and Sony
where we are right now is in this huge
arena in downtown Los Angeles they had
food carts outside the event started two
hours before the actual event started I
don't really know why but I guess it was
cool so we all just sit outside and like
talk about video games and eat hot dogs
and then we're here so this is the big
thing of III every single year its Sony
the last couple of years especially they
kind of won last year and this year Sony
kind of won again they came in just full
of swagger and confidence and then just
kind of laid on the table why Sony is
doing so much better than Microsoft one
thing they didn't show except for a
minute when they were like hey project
Morpheus virtual reality and then just
kind of cast it off to the side and that
was it but what they did show is just a
lot a lot of games
it started with destiny the game we were
waiting to see for awhile and we're
gonna see more of this week we're
finally gonna get to play it we saw
Arkham Knight the new Batman game
including the Batmobile which looks sick
I was worried the Batmobile was going to
be terrible and it's not it looks
awesome you get to fight it you can jump
out it's gonna be amazing that game
looks crazy there was also this game
called no man's sky which I don't really
understand at all
they called it infinity the game is huge
and just bizarre and strange but
beautiful and colorful and looked really
cool and I kind of can't wait to play it
there's a game called LittleBigPlanet 3
which we got to see game play up for the
first time it's this adorable little
game where you play as a suck and you
just fly around and everybody has these
powers you have to get through levels
working together co-op was actually a
thing they talked about a lot being able
to play a game through the campaign with
a bunch of other people online is a
really big thing that both Microsoft and
Sony talked to that it's really cool I
don't know if it'll actually work or
really change anything but it's a really
neat idea one of the best trailers I saw
actually there were two of the best
trailers that I saw one was Dead Island
2
you're just a dude running down the
street listening to music and all of a
sudden you just turn into a zombie it
was crazy
and everybody's eating everybody and
fighting in that game looks amazing it's
you know Dom bees are still a thing and
that game looks awesome the other word
is Mortal Kombat which is just the most
terrifying goriest kind of like grimace
inducing ly disgusting thing I've ever
seen and by that I mean I cannot wait to
play this game and go like this to
someone's spine and just snap it in half
so the list goes on and on Sony's games
look great they have great trailers
they're excited about them it's really
good IP its new games it's exclusive
games and they talked a lot about that
the undercurrent of all of this was we
have things that Microsoft doesn't one
of the biggest cheers of the whole night
came for Grand Theft Auto 5 which Sony
came out announced is coming to the ps4
it's also coming to the other consoles
and I don't even know if Sony's getting
it first but Sony one big by being the
one to say it's coming to next-gen Sony
did talk about a bunch of things that
aren't games like the PlayStation TV
which lets you remote play from your ps4
to a different TV without needing a new
console there's PlayStation now the
online streaming service there's a new
TV show called powers there's a movie
based on Ratchet and Clank there's a lot
of stuff but that really was not the
focus here even when they would talk
about that certainly always came back to
the idea that they are about video games
and that was really what this whole
thing was Sony just throwing down the
gauntlet and being like listen Microsoft
we don't care what weird things you do
with the TV we have games and honestly
we got a lot left to play this week the
floor opens tomorrow there's a lot going
on but it kind of seems like Sony won
this year yet again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
