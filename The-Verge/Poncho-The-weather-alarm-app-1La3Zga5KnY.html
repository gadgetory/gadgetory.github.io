verge we're in rainy New York City right
now
wish I had a poncho but instead I have
the poncho weather app so you might know
poncho because they are a text and email
alert system that sort of every morning
gives you a forecast for your day and
it's funny they give you gifts and they
give you really funny little
descriptions about the weather so the
big thing with this app is it's a
weather alarm clock and really what that
means is if you set your alarm instead
of waking up to incessant beeping or
whatever the current horrible noise you
wake up to instead you're going to get
music that changes depending on the
weather the music is custom-made for
poncho they hired a couple composers and
they have six different tracks so one
might be for raining like today or sunny
or hot or whatever and it always just
changes other stuff that comes with the
app is you get your forecast just like
they've been doing with the texts and
emails they're also gonna tell you the
pollen level so if you've really bad
allergies they'll tell you if it's low
medium or high that day as well as
public transit information so if you
live in a big transit city like New York
or Boston or Chicago or DC they'll tell
you if your train is running that day
and what you can expect so another cool
feature in one of my favorites because I
have massive marshmallow hair is the bad
hair day feature what they basically do
is they look at the humidity level and
tell you if that day your hair is gonna
look really good or really bad and
whether you should be maybe considering
using some extra hairspray the app is
out today and they're also working on
one for the Apple watch as well as an
app for Android which they hope to have
out soon ultimately pancha wants to own
the weather for millennium and Gen Z
people all over the world so they're
really hoping this app Pentagon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
