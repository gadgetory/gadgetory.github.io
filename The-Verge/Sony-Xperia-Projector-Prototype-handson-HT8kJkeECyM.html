sony's new Xperia projector this is a
prototype it is basically an Android
tablet but it's also projector that look
at that so there's an infrared sensor
right here that can tell if I'm touching
the table basically it's multi-touch
it's 720p the other thing is it doesn't
have to stay right here
sync portable so let's check it out
the most important thing to remember is
this is an Android tablet so any apps
that would work on the Android tablet
are going to work here games you play
the piano you can browse the Internet
look at photos pull up recipes a lot of
stuff you can do because it's just an
Android tablet it's also basically a
Google assistant there's a microphone
there's a speaker ok Google give me
directions back to New York New York is
one day in 12 hours from your location
by car and light traffic and I think
most importantly for something that is
this close to Minority Report
multi-touch works because it's based on
a sensor that's like infrared if you're
blocking it well for one you can't even
see the screen and it's not going to
type touch but when you got your hands
in the right place it actually works
pretty well another place that this is
going to work is where you normally put
a projector which is in the living room
so when the screens vertical like this
touch still works but you're probably
going to want a bigger screen for
watching movies and stuff it goes up to
80 inches and it just automatically
adjusts how looks here we go nice nice
and sharp not the brightest screen in
your house but this is definitely
definitely works
what touch doesn't work anymore because
the sensors right here so bring your
controller swashing zootopia
my big question is who is this for
I don't have room on ax on a huge
kitchen counter to plan my day I just
pull out my phone I already have a TV so
I'm not going to move my TV all the way
whenever I want to project on the wall
it's just not really clear who this
helps it's really cool technology but I
went to buy one so this is a little pico
projector right right oh I already
ruined everything
