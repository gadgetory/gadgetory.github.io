2018 so today at CES we introduced LG's
global AI brand is called LG thin Q L do
you think you will completely change the
way we use our products our products
will learn from the users to provide
intelligence services not the other way
around so you won't have to study
instruction manuals anymore
LG think you has three main
characteristics the first is the ability
to evolve with time the more you use our
products the better they evolve to meet
your specific needs
for example the LG thinkyou air
conditioner learns your living patterns
over time it cools to the temperature
you want when you want it in the car
LG's cabin monitoring technology learns
the drivers facial expressions and
gesture it recognizes the moment you
start getting drowsy and it alerts you
the second characteristic of LG thank
you is the ability to integrate AI into
a diverse portfolio of everyday products
LG makes many products that you use
every single day in the home on the road
and in the office through this wide
range of network products you will be
able to benefit from AI as a seamless
user experience the third characteristic
of LG thank you is the openness our
philosophy of LG thank you is to provide
the best AI experience to our customers
whether it comes from our own
or from external partners solution the
world has become just too complex for
any single company to insist on a
proprietary closed solution so our open
strategy is always to provide the most
powerful AI solution to the users by
utilizing open platform open partnership
and open connectivity so in our open
ecosystem you can use LG's refrigerator
panel to control an IOT device from
another manufacturer imagine that I'm
very excited to be here to talk about
how the Google assistant and LG are
continuing to work together our
collaboration with LG which began on
phones has continued over the last year
and a half and because of LG's breadth
of products we've been able to work
together on all kinds of devices with
the Google assistant you can check the
status of your LG home appliances or
tell your LG OLED TV to turn on the air
purifier if the room gets stuffy you
know as head of marketing to for LG
Electronics here in the US I often get
asked do consumers really need all these
smart devices is there really any
benefit well today I'm going to
demonstrate how LG AI is making people's
lives easier and better both in the home
and outside so to help me show the LG
family of AI home appliances allow me to
introduce Chloe
hello Chloe
I hope you well what can I do for you
today
now look there are already a variety of
products that help make home smarter
including speakers that listen and even
talk and Chloe here is our way to
operate your lg devices via voice
commands and I might add the most
interactive as well it's Saturday
morning I get up I first like to make
sure everything is ready for the day
Chloe what's my schedule
smart learner has set the washer to the
sportswear setting sounds like the
perfect setting for my workout gear
thanks Chloe Chloe am I ready on my
washer and cycle
even robots have bad days the LG
interview thank you refrigerator is the
latest when it comes to smart AI in the
kitchen
29 inch full HD touchscreen display
helps you look up recipes check weather
and yes even do grocery shopping so let
me demonstrate Chloe what's for dinner
tonight
okay Chloe is not gonna talk to me and
Chloe doesn't like me evidently so in
this case we're gonna go to find out
that we've got chicken in the
refrigerator and it's expiring in three
days it looks like we should use the
chicken Chloe are you talking to me yet
what recipes could I make with chicken
okay we're gonna search recipes and
we're gonna find buffalo chicken pizza
we can actually send the recipe over to
the oven so the oven will automatically
now set and preheat you may wonder why
does a television need AI when we
already have so many different
intelligent speakers well there's a few
key advantages the first one is having a
eye on the television is the ability to
control the television with just your
voice you can also connect and control
all your smart home devices for example
before our next guest arrives to my home
I want to share more about the TV
innovations but I also want to make sure
that the room is all set for his arrival
turn the air purifier on you got it
turning on the air purifier my next
guest will be so pleased the air is pure
and clean now but the major enhancements
to our TV lineup don't stop with AI
integration and it all begins with a
tiny yet powerful processor our new
proprietary alpha 9 intelligent
processor will be featured in this
year's OLED TVs now remember the
processor plays a crucial role in
delivering realistic lifelike images in
a few different ways first by minimizing
picture noise the Alpha 9 processor uses
a four step process to reduce noise Auto
Foxx most only used to
now most TVs use edge base depth
enhancement but LG TVs use an
object-based enhancer which can
precisely separate main on-screen
objects objects from the
viewers can enjoy more accurate lifelike
color thanks to the expanded color
lookup table which offers more natural
color expanding the reference color
coordinates by over seven times compared
another important feature of the alpha 9
processor is high frame rate support
that LG OLED TVs will be ready to
support next-generation content at 120
frames per second LG's 2018 OLED TVs
adds support for advanced HDR by
Technicolor building on a legacy of
supporting most major HDR formats with
LG's nano Cell display with IPS more of
those rich accurate colors are
maintained even from wider viewing
angles however probably the most
meaningful change to the 2018 super UHD
lineup is the addition of full array
local dimming backlighting please now
this is critical for viewing HDR content
so ladies and gentlemen please allow me
to introduce our lineup of concept
robots so we have three here we have a
serving robot a porter robot which will
handle various hospitality needs and a
shopping cart robot which can provide
automatic payment and grocery service at
supermarkets let's take a closer look at
each robot so the serving robots role as
the name implies is to serve meals to
guests at a hotel may be room service or
even an airport lounge
let's see what the serving robot has for
me today maybe breakfast but instead the
daily newspaper now the porter robot is
going to be able to take luggage to the
hotel room but an additional benefit is
that it'll offer express check-in and
checkout services and finally shoppers
can reduce time spent in supermarket by
scanning the barcodes of the grocery
items using the shopping cart robot
ladies and gentlemen the future is here
today and with LG life's good
thank you very much for your attention
have a great show</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
