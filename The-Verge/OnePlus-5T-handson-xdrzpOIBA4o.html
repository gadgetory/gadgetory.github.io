the one plus five and then this is the
one plus 5t now these are virtually the
exact same phone except for two obvious
differences and one not so obvious one
so the most obvious new thing with the 1
plus 5t is its despite it's now a six
inch 18 by nine full screen display it
kind of stretches all the way to almost
edges of the phone it's still 1080p wide
and still AMOLED it's the same basic
technologies in 1 plus 5t but it's just
bigger and what's cool about it is that
it's bigger in a phone that's pretty
much the same size as the prior model so
the other obvious change to the hardware
here in addition to the bigger display
is the movement of the fingerprint
sensor on the oneplus 5 it's located on
the front of the phone on the one plus
5t it's been moved to the back it's in
the center above the oneplus logo
basically in the same position you might
find on a Google pixel or other similar
phone and it's the same technology as
before so it's very quick to use and
convenient to reach to unlock the phone
with your fingerprint otherwise the
design of the phone itself is virtually
the same it's the same kind of curved
aluminum finish this is a midnight black
model and that's the only color that
they're going to be launching at first
but it still looks very nice it's a
little bit finger printing and it's a
little bit slick at first but it is very
nicely made as well a couple other
points of note you've got the USB C port
still has one plus as fast - charging
there's still a 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack even though it supports bluetooth
5.0 out of the box and then on the side
you still have the ringer switch which
you can physically switch from ringing
to do not disturb in fully silent modes
which is kind of unique to oneplus
inside the phone is virtually exactly
the same as well it's got a qualcomm
snapdragon 835 processor you can get it
with six or eight gigabytes of RAM 64
gigabytes or 128 gigabytes of storage it
supports dual SIM cards everything is
basically the same as the one plus five
on the inside as well so the performance
is really fast one thing that I've
noticed in my short time with it is that
it doesn't have any of the jelly
scrolling effect that I saw on the 1+5
so that's it's a big thing if you can
see it it makes a big difference in your
everyday use and I'm kind of glad that
it's not here and oneplus fix that
problem now the other big difference
with the hardware is oneplus has changed
up how the camera functions it's still a
dual camera system but instead of having
a telephoto lens like on the 1+5 they've
swapped that out for a standard lens
that's a brighter aperture F 1.7 now the
company says this helps greatly in
low-light performance which is one of
the weak points of the 1+5 so we'll have
to see when we test it to see how well
it works what it does in extreme
low-light if you're under 10 Lux of
available light it will use a special
mode that combines many of the pixels
together so that you get better
sensitivity otherwise you're still
looking at a 16 megapixel sensor here a
20 megapixel sensor there they're both
full color and then the system just kind
of uses its intelligence to figure out
when to use each sensor because the
fingerprint sensor has moved to the back
of the phone
oneplus is added another way that you
can unlock the phone quickly and easily
if you don't particularly like the using
the fingerprint sensor it's calling this
face unlock it uses the front-facing
camera to see your face and then unlock
the phone it doesn't have the IR sensors
that you might find on an iPhone 10 or a
note 8 it is just using the front camera
to see your face and you can't use it
for things like authenticating Android
pay or logging into websites it's only
used for unlocking the phone many times
you can just double tap the phone and
will turn the screen on and unlock
almost instantly which is very cool you
can see I didn't even see the lock
screen there because it's just using the
front camera it doesn't have any IR
features you might have some trouble if
you're wearing big sunglasses or if it's
very dark and you'll have to rely on the
fingerprint sensor to unlock your phone
but for most signs indoors outdoors you
can unlock the phone really quickly by
just looking at it which
very cool now the software on the 1 plus
5t is virtually identical to what you
get on the one plus five it's still
running android 7.1.1 nougat the company
says it's working on getting Oreo out
the door for early next year and it does
have a couple beta programs in place for
that for some of its other phones but at
launch this is running Android 7.1.1
it's got one plusses launcher here which
gives you some customized ability it's
very fast and easy to use and you can
see there's almost no bloatware
installed the only pre-installed apps
outside of Google's r1 plusses community
app so the one plus 5t mostly builds
upon what the oneplus 5 already has and
then it improves them you get a better
wider display that's more modern to use
you get some new face unlock features in
theory the camera should be better
performing in low-light which is all
very important stuff but it doesn't get
rid of the stuff that made the 1 plus 5t
great it's very fast performance
high-end specs good build quality and a
pretty aggressive price so there you
have it that's our quick look at the one
plus 5t it's gonna be available next
week November 21st and it's gonna cost
about 20 bucks more than the 5 so you're
looking at $4.99 for model with 64 gigs
of storage or 559 per model with 128
gigs of storage we're gonna have a lot
more to say about this including our
full review coming up so be sure to
check out the verge comm and youtube.com
slash the virtual this is why we need
the garage-door on here it's like shut
this off for video we can use this as a
meeting room with the clothes we could
install a smart garage door opener there
