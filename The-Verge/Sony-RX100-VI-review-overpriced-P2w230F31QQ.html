review in downtown Brooklyn and it was
going to be beautiful a work of art a
masterpiece but Mother Nature and had a
little bit of a different plan
so it looks like it's time for Plan B
how's that so this is the Sony rx100
Mark 6 when I'm shooting stills I'm
almost exclusively shooting on a 35
millimeter film camera but when I'm not
I'm actually using one of these they're
super portable they're really light
lighter than DSLR and most certainly
lighter than my 35 millimeter and the
transfer speeds are incredible I can
quickly put on my phone and then up to
Instagram and it's video capabilities
are also amazing which obviously I can't
do it by 35 millimeter now Sony comes
out with a new one of these just about
every year which is why we're already at
the mark 6 when the mark 1 came out in
2012 now that's great because we've come
a long way but it also means that now
that we're at the later generations not
much is changing so let's figure out why
you probably won't pay $1,200 for the
mark 6 so just like its predecessor the
mark 6 has a twenty point one megapixel
one inch CMOS sensor with 4k video 24 30
P and at the lower 1080p resolution you
have the HFR motor high frame rate mode
that is capable of 960 frames for a
second the ISO spans from 125 to 12,800
so I find that it performs better in the
lower ISO range that's like 125 to 800
once you get to 1600 and especially at
3200 you're gonna see a lot of noise and
grain we just have to keep in mind that
this is a point-and-shoot camera after
all and with that comes a small flash
and small batteries that can't really
handle hot days or long recording times
be prepared to own a few batteries
especially if you're recording video and
also like last year's model there's the
pop-up OLED ebf god bless the pop-up EVF
I love it so much
yes yeah
it's one of the main reasons I bought
this camera and it's so crisp and so
clean there's something really intimate
about being able to look through a
viewfinder and take a photo I mean no
one else is behind you looking at what
you're getting it's just you and your
camera and it makes you feel really
professional now the big difference this
year though is that it's a single-action
EVF so it pops up and instead of having
to pull it out like you did on previous
generations it just does that
automatically then when you want to
close it it's one single push down the
photo burst modes and auto focus also
got a refresh on this model the
autofocus is fast and I mean really fast
and it's facial recognition is on point
too even when the face is super far in
the frame or you're really wide the
burst mode can also now capture 233
shots at 24 frames per second which is
almost 100 shots more than the rx100
mark 5s 150 shots for making gifts or
capturing the perfect moment this is
really great for the vertically
challenged among us and the foodies
you're really gonna love the extended
range of the screen in previous models
you had that 180 degrees screen which it
still does this is great for vlogging
this is great for taking selfies but new
this year is the 90 degrees tilt down it
typically only went to 45 but now you
have that full 90 I really didn't think
this was gonna be super useful but when
taking shots of food or at concerts it
actually came in handy so you pair that
with the touchscreen capabilities that
are also new this year it's kind of
bangin
you can finally touch the screen to
focus and to take shots but I can't
navigate the menu or hit okay so in a
world where touchscreens are so
intuitive they're on everything we use
why didn't we go one step further and
make it completely usable via touch
we're so close but speaking of close
hello Zeiss 24 to 200 millimeter lens
for tourists or festival goers or bird
watchers or a parent at a high school
event this is really a great feature and
it's clean it's crisp and it actually
flattens out the image and gives you
depth of field much like the Canon 70 to
200 millimeter wood it made me feel like
a great photographer even when I was
just on the fly doing something really
quick the problem is we gave up an F 1.8
aperture lens and those built in n DS
which I use all the time I loved being
able to get down to 1/8 especially at
night and the nd was so easy and quick
to slap on it was much easier than
adjusting the shutter and when doing
video the nd is like absolutely valuable
so this might be the difference between
buying this model in a previous cheaper
model that n D and F 1.8 is a little bit
more valuable to me overall the rx100
continues to be a great camera with
better video options and way more models
than canons g7 or Luminex LX line and
with all these models have come
incredible improvements I mean this is a
super powerful point shoot it has great
HDR features and with added s log3
support this model can even step up as a
B cam on shoots with an a7 s very
comfortably the real problem though is
the total and complete lack of a mic
input and the price I mean for $1,200
there really should be a mic input
especially for how many vloggers use
this camera just put it in so if you
have the money go for it you will
absolutely not be disappointed by this
camera but if you're looking for a bang
for your buck you might want to look at
the rx100 mark 4 or 5 I have the four
and I bought it on Craigslist last year
and it still works really well and with
that extra money you could buy an
external audio recorder
so thanks for watching if you like this
video and you like watching my hair
slowly deflate make sure you like and
subscribe also shout out to this camera
that is currently doused in water
alright we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
