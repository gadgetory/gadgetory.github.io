we're here at Lenovo tech world and
we're checking out well a pair of smart
shoes so this is Lenovo's new smart
lifestyle running shoe now this is a
prototype product but it's you know
quite finished quite well manufactured
you can see here the whole idea here is
well to give you a real honest-to-god
smart shoe so you have LED lights right
here in case you want to go running at
night the shoe has a customizable insole
it also has trackers inside of it for
measure accounting your steps measuring
your activity how far you've gone things
like that that does have some really
cool features for instance this
apparently can be used to play games we
don't really know what that looks like
right now but I'm imagining some kind of
dance dance revelution where it's
measuring your activity measuring how
you're moving combining with a
smartphone app to let you you know
control the game with your feets beyond
that just uh this shoe has a little
button down here that gives you
personalized news updates based on your
activity again we don't really know what
that would look like or how what kind of
shape that would take but it would most
likely combine to the companion
smartphone app to do so now because this
is a prototype product we'd have no
information on pricing or availability
but this is what Lenovo is thinking
about when it's you know when things
about the Internet of Things and
connected everything they want to put
sensors in your shoes and basically make
you have smart clothing up and down your
entire body for more videos like this
