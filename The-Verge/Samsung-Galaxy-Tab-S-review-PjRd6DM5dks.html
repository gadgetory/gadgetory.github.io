Samsung has released no fewer than nine
distinct tablets and that's not
including different storage and LTE
options that's just an insane number and
there's not that much to distinguish
them so of course Samsung did what
Samsung does it went ahead and
introduced tablets number 10 and 11 this
is the Samsung Galaxy Tab s the Galaxy
Tab s comes in two sizes one has an 8.4
inch screen and the other is 10.5 inches
and it's actually the screen that's most
important part of any tablet if it's
terrible the whole thing is basically
worthless if it's great everything you
do in the tablet feels better so with
the Galaxy Tab s Samsung focused on the
screen and it did something pretty
amazing both sizes have the same
resolution a super-high 2560 by 1600
pixels which puts them imperceptibly
ahead of their respective competitors
the iPad air and the iPad Mini with
Retina display the pixels are basically
invisible and everything is super sharp
and super bright the whole tablet is
built around this screen it's using the
same technology that Samsung uses on its
phone's Super AMOLED that technology
doesn't need a backlight so these
tablets can be thinner and lighter both
are just 0.2 6 inches thick and weigh
just a little less than the comparable
iPads the colors are vibrant often it's
just a little too vibrant but Samsung
has added software called adaptive
display which keeps an eye on the
content on the screen and the lighting
environment of your room to
automatically adjust the images color
saturation and contrast most people
won't notice these subtle changes just
that the screen is nice and sharp I'm
just impressed that the screen looks
good in so many lighting conditions I
can see it fine in daylight and in total
darkness you can ratchet the brightness
way down so it doesn't burn out your eye
sockets that's a story of the screen the
story for the rest of the hardware is
well not as good as usual Samsung is
sticking with plastic everywhere all
that plastic does make the tablet light
but it also makes it feel cheaper than
the iPad the back has the same stipple
texture as a galaxy s5 and in fact both
tablets basically look and feel like
blown up versions of that phone they
both come in two colors white and bronze
and they're both garish and kind of ugly
Samsung sells a variety of covers that
click into the back using plastic
grommets they attach securely and then
there's various origami folds you can
make to attach the magnets and prop up
tablets at different angles I'm not a
fan of the color options here but if you
want a case that looks more like a
handbag than a boring black laptop
sleeve Samsung has you covered depending
on which model you choose LTE or Wi-Fi
only you'll get
from processors the models we tested for
Wi-Fi only with a crazy fast Exynos 5
octa processor I gave it speeds fast
enough to handle even tough tasks like
intense gaming there's three gigs of RAM
and 16 gigs of storage but you can also
add a microSD card for more storage the
camera on the back is 8 megapixels and
it's fine there is also dual speakers on
the side that get loud enough for me but
are pretty easy to cover with your hands
battery life on both was solid Alaska me
two days of moderate use of that much
hassle
Samsung even added a fingerprint sensor
to the home button which works about as
well as it does on the Galaxy s5 phone
which is to say that it works only if
you're very careful with your finger
swipes the best thing about the software
is samsung split-screen mode which lets
you run two apps simultaneously
unlike the Galaxy Note pro 10.5 you're
only limited to apps but the feature is
really nice and for the most part things
don't slow down too much there's also
the usual array of Samsung features and
add-ons paper garden is loaded on for
magazines hand office for documents
and the home screen is a pretty crazy
pile of Flipboard style tiles Android
style widgets and that's not to mention
the direct access to your files and a
completely nutso pile of settings and
options the notification panel and in
settings there's also the latest version
of side sync which mirrors your Galaxy
s5 phone onto the screen of your tablet
so you can operate it directly from
there it lets you do everything your
phone can do right on the tablet
including making and receiving calls and
you can transfer files too it's too slow
to actually be useful in most cases so
it basically amounts to yet another
software feature that's more impressive
in the showroom than it is for real
humans at this point getting angry at
Samsung for all these software add-ons
it's like getting angry at the allergies
you get every spring it's better than it
used to be it's still not fun to deal
with but you're never going to get it to
stop of the two I much prefer the 8.4
inch version Android tablets work best
at this portrait size and though the
incredibly high screen resolution can
make something's difficult to tap with
your finger the fact that it just barely
fits my back pocket makes it totally
worth the trade-off the 10.5 inch
version starts at 4 $99.99 and the
smaller one is 3 99.99 that's the exact
same price as the equivalent iPads and
Samsung has tried its hardest to match
the iPads in every category there's a
bunch of hardware accessories like
keyboards and cases there's a ton of
hand waving software to distract you
from the fact that iPads tend to have
better apps
but at the end of the day even though
the tab S has a better screen and is
slightly lighter I still prefer the iPad
these are probably the best tablet
Samsung has ever made but the vast
majority people would still be better
off going with
I pad better luck with tablets number 12
and 13 Samsung</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
