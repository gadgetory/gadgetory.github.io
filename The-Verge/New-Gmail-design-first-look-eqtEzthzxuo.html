and I am here with the new Gmail,
which just got its
biggest redesign in years.
It's now supposed to be better
at managing tasks and security,
which is great news for
the 1.4 billion people
who use Gmail every day.
So the biggest change here, you'll notice,
is on the right side
with different icons for
calendar, keep, and task.
Task is sort of the newest
thing that you'll see in Gmail.
You can add different
tasks by just typing it in
or you can drag an email
that you want to add,
for example this one,
and you can click this
to get contacts of what you're looking at
and also edit it so
that you can add a date
and integrate that with
your calendar as well.
In addition to these three apps,
you can also click the plus button
for the G Suite Marketplace,
which has a bunch of different apps
that you can add to your taskbar.
So at first glance, the
new Gmail is super cool
and has a lot of white space,
but it also does look super busy.
For example, you can't actually
change the width of the
sidebar on the right,
and also, all your
attachments on default view
now appear in line, which
is not my favorite thing
because now it takes up a lot more space,
fewer emails are visible at first glance.
The point of all this, however,
is that attachments are kinda there
so you don't have to click the email
to get to the attachment.
Now, if you don't like all your
attachments showing in file,
you can always just go to display density
and click comfortable or compact
to get the paperclip back
so that none of your files
are showing at first glance.
There are also other useful shortcuts.
For example, you can just hover the email
and you'll get a shortcut
to either archive,
delete, mark as read or unread,
and the new button that says snooze.
Now, this was previously
available with Inbox by Google,
but now you can click snooze
and pick a later time.
It gives you some suggestions,
or you can click your own date and time
or, my favorite, someday.
So these are all the
new productivity tools,
but the next most important thing
with the new Gmail is security.
You might have remembered last year
where a bunch of Google users were hit
with the Google Doc phishing attack.
Now with the new Gmail,
Google is going to be better highlighting
these suspicious emails with a big red box
that is a lot harder to overlook.
There's also going to be
a new confidential mode,
which builds on features
you might already be used to
from apps like Snapchat and Instagram.
For example, messages can
now have an expiration date
which self-destructs after
a certain amount of time
or you can revoke read privileges,
which basically means
you can unsend an email.
You can also require
two-factor authentication
on individual emails
so that before the
recipient even opens it,
they have to verify themselves.
Now obviously that doesn't
count for screenshotting emails,
so it's not a foolproof
method, but it is something.
For business account,
Google will also block
forwarding, downloading, printing emails
to prevent sensitive
materials from getting out.
So by now you're probably wondering,
when am I gonna get this new Gmail?
Google isn't rolling this
out by default at first,
so to get it, you have to
go to your settings cog,
click it, and see if you
have the new Gmail option.
If it's enabled for you, it will be there,
if it's not, just hang tight.
They're still rolling it out globally,
but it's going to take some
time, so just be patient.
And if you have a G Suite account,
so that's if you use Gmail
at work or at school,
you wanna contact the system administrator
to make sure that they enable it
so that you can turn it
on from your settings cog.
If you don't have the new Gmail yet,
don't feel super left out.
Some of the new features,
like confidential mode,
aren't even available yet,
and it's gonna be a while
until Google rolls this out.
In early May, however, Google
I/O will be taking place,
so we can probably expect some more themes
around increased security,
getting things done more quickly,
and a whole lot of new features
to come with Android P.
Thanks for watching.
Let us know in the comments
if you have the new Gmail
yet and what you think of it.
I'd love to hear more.
