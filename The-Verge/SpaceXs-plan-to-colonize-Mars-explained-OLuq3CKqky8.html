make Mars seem possible make it seem as
though it's something that we can do in
our lifetimes Elon Musk finally told the
world his vision for colonizing Mars and
it turned out to be one hell of a show
his talk and Mexico drew insane crowds
people actually stampeded into the hall
where his lecture was in order to get a
good seat they were then treated to a
one-hour breakdown of all the vehicles
must wants to build in order to bring
people to the Red Planet so let's unwrap
all of this and talk about what it means
it starts off like any science fiction
you need a spaceship a vehicle to carry
up to 100 passengers maybe more and 450
tons of cargo to Mars first the
spaceship will be launched into Earth
orbit thanks to a massive rocket booster
and I mean massive when completed this
rocket would be bigger and more powerful
than NASA's Saturn 5 rocket the thing
would be powered by a combination of 42
Raptor engines that's the new powerful
engine that SpaceX has been working on
they also did their first full-scale
test of the engine the other day too but
unlike the kerosene engines that power
the Falcon 9 this one runs on methane
more on why later
so the booster takes the spaceship into
orbit the two vehicles separate and the
booster comes back to land on earth it's
one of SpaceX's signature moves similar
to how the Falcon 9 lands post launch
but once that booster lands it quickly
gears up for its next launch of a
propellant tank that tank then docks
with the spaceship in orbit filling it
up with the gas it needs to get to Mars
musk said it'd take maybe 3 to 5
propellant tanks to fully fuel the
spaceship strip then the spaceship is
off to Mars once it arrives the entire
thing lands using its engines to lower
itself down to the ground it's a
technique called supersonic
retropropulsion and again it's just like
the Falcon 9 landings it's also a way of
getting super heavy payloads safely down
to Mars which doesn't have a very thick
atmosphere to help slow falling objects
after letting out its passengers
eventually the spaceship will lift off
and come back to earth and where will it
get the fuel for that return trip on
Mars you see that's why SpaceX is using
methane because it can be made
carbon dioxide from the planet's
atmosphere or possible subsurface water
that saves spacex from bringing the fuel
for the return trip over beforehand Elon
and the team of SpaceX have showed
really well that nothing speaks for
itself quite like results so I think the
most important thing for for Elon and
for everyone who backs Elon and the team
at SpaceX to do is to go out and to take
some of these technologies that he
showed off today like the giant
composite tanks and the Raptor engines
and just keep developing those and keep
testing those so it sounds like he's
thought it all through right but for all
the things that must did say he left out
a few key parts of his human settlement
idea namely how these people are going
to survive a good analogy for living on
Mars is kind of like living in
Antarctica but worse we have a science
base in Antarctica all the time hundreds
of people there all the time but you
don't go there to raise a family you
don't build playgrounds
I love SpaceX I love what they're doing
it's fantastic they have changed the way
people think of space exploration but I
don't think you want to get a colony on
Mars
all right I'm open-minded of course but
it I just if you've ever been to
Antarctica there's nothing to eat there
is nothing to drink and you can breathe
on Mars you can't breathe you can't
breathe everybody that's serious yet
must said nothing about the types of
habitats these people would live in and
very little about how they would eat
drink and breathe and when asked about
the dangers of a space voyage like deep
space radiation or solar flares he had
this to say so actually the radiation
thing is softened brought up but I think
it's not not too big of a deal there's
certainly some risk of radiation but
it's not it's not it's not deadly there
is also little talk of in space life
support systems and perhaps the biggest
issue of all microgravity living in
space can lead to severe bone density
and muscle loss and things that Mars may
not be much better the planet has
one-third the gravity of Earth which
could also wreak havoc on the body we
don't know yet but for spacex these
problems aren't the company's primary
concern in fact must said that the first
colonists would have to be willing to
risk death
the goal of SpaceX is really to build
the transport system it's like building
the Union Pacific Railroad
and once that transport system is built
then there's a tremendous opportunity
for anyone who wants to go to Mars and
create something new or both the the
foundations of a new planet but even
some of the engineering claims that musk
made were a little ambitious he claimed
that the spaceship could eventually make
the trip to Mars in just 80 days of
accelerated fast enough
that's an insane estimate given that
most trips to Mars take upwards of six
months getting to such a speed would
take a lot of energy and then a lot of
energy to break he also envisions not
just one spaceship going to Mars at a
time but eventually a thousand let's do
the math there the launch window for
Mars opens up every 26 months so you'd
have to launch a thousand spaceships in
that time frame and then since each
spaceship needs at least three fuel
launches that equates to three thousand
launches in 26 months that's more than
15 times the world's launch rate in an
unbelievable amount of reused rockets
and then there's the timeline and cost
estimates both of which seem super
optimistic musk hopes to complete the
first development spaceship in four
years and then send the first big
spaceship to Mars as early as 2024
that's ambitious given SpaceX hasn't
ever launched people into space yet he
also says that factors like reusability
and propellant production on Mars means
the entire thing can be done for way
less than current Mars estimates the
ultimate result 1 million people living
on Mars and 42 a hundred years but that
timeline is very tentative especially
since basics isn't putting a lot of
money into the Mars plan just yet less
than 5% of the company's resources are
going into the development of the
interplanetary transport system and even
with these low cost estimates must says
that he's still probably going to need
help either from NASA the government or
the private sector so it's clear this is
just the starting off point there are a
lot of problems to solve ahead but musk
says there's only one way to solve them
the technology
not automatically improved it only
improves if a lot of really strong
engineering talent is applied to the
problem that it improves
oh yeah just join the Planetary Society
don't forget that no so at the Planetary
Society we have 52 thousand members and
after this meeting I hope we have 53
thousand of people who love space in
want to explore space and they are all
running to the front row today I mean
those people just this it's an exciting
time if we could lower the cost to
getting to space it would be great</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
