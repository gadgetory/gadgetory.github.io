at e3 including all the Xbox's and it's
the pip-boy deluxe bluetooth Edition so
there already was a pip-boy case but it
was basically just a phone case that put
on your wrist this is what it should
have been from the beginning which is
the world's clunkiest SmartWatch so you
can pair this via bluetooth with your
phone your tablet and at that point it
takes over some very very very limited
functions of your phone you can see but
not respond to text messages you can
make and receive phone calls you can
play audio files when it's not connected
it's basically just an alarm clock with
a nice screen that you can look at but
that's also kind of great it's promising
that most of the buttons and dials on
this thing worked and if you pop open
the top where a Jolla tape would be in
the game there's actually a little USB
Drive that can slide in so this thing is
supposed to come out in November and it
costs $350 but it's also a limited run
so the vast vast majority of us will
never actually try this thing out but we
can be happy knowing exists it's all
over but the crying and I can
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
