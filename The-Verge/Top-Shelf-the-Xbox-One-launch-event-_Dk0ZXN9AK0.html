Pierce and this week we're talking about
video games and TV and netflix and
blu-ray players and weird interfaces and
gestures like this and hdmi passthrough
but first let's talk about the Xbox 2013
really is shaping up to be the year of
the next-generation console even after
Nintendo launched the Wii last fall we
were still pretty much all waiting to
see what Microsoft and Sony would do
this year Sony didn't actually have that
much to say when they announced the
PlayStation 4 in March but this week at
an event at its headquarters here in
redmond washington Microsoft had a much
bigger story to tell they announced new
product it's called the Xbox one coming
later this year there's kind of a lot
going on with engadget terms eight years
is basically an eternity but since its
launched in 2005 Microsoft has done an
impressive job keeping the xbox 360 up
to date with new games new apps a
completely overhauled user interface and
more the 360 was originally a pure
gaming machine but it became something
more it's microsoft's Trojan horse into
your living room the company's attempt
to create the one set-top box to rule
them all but eight years is still a long
time and Microsoft needed more than just
new software to compete in 2013 not to
mention in 2021 from a hardware
perspective there are three parts to the
one there's the big blocky black console
which looks like a VCR but comes with
massively upgraded specs the one is an
eight core AMD processor eight gigabytes
of RAM that's 16 times as much as the
360 if you're counting plus a 500 gig
hard drive and USB 3.0 it also has a
blu-ray drive finally then there's the
new Kinect a smaller also blocky
rectangle that sits above or below your
TV and watches your every move although
now it tracks much more than your every
move it can track your eyes your facial
expression your muscles your fingers and
toes and even your heart rate it can
also do it in the dark and do it in high
definition it collects a lot more data
than the last version and does it much
faster and much more accurately we were
pretty blown away by it in the short
time we have at the new device Microsoft
didn't leave the controller out of the
upgrade cycle either it has 40
improvements we're told and a few are
obvious it's smaller with a better
integrated battery and its analog sticks
or a little more text
but the most obvious thing is the new
impulse triggers which is just a fancy
name for making the controls triggers
vibrate when you fire a gun in a game
you'll feel the recoil when you read the
engine you'll jitter along with the car
it's cool from what we've seen but it's
a little much sometimes and it's not
exactly earth-shattering anyway all that
new hardware is used to power and
control a lot of new Xbox software
there's a new UI based on Windows 8 plus
an involved Xbox Live that gives you
more ways to find games and ways to
upload videos of you playing there's a
new snap mode which lets you pin skype
or other apps to the edge of the screen
while you play a game and watch TV oh
and there's skype for xbox now too but
here's the thing about the xbox one it's
really only partly a gaming machine it's
mostly some crazy hybrid of a set-top
box cable box and blu-ray player the one
can connect to all your home theater
devices and even control your cable
through its interface you can say watch
ESPN to switch right to the channel or
ask what's on HBO to see the guide for
the channel you're looking for we
haven't seen much of the interface or
spent much time with it and frankly
we're worried about the whole HDMI
pass-through set up that really doomed
Google TV but hey anything's better than
your cable box last and weirdly kind of
least for now or the games Microsoft
showed us a half dozen or so new games
from FIFA and Madden to quantum break
and call of duty ghosts the graphics
look great but they still look like
video games quantum break a mix of game
and TV show might be the only really
innovative one of the bunch there are
many more games coming at e3 so hoping
to see more then but for now it seems
like gaming hasn't been upgraded quite
as much as the rest of the xbox
experience the Xbox one is coming out
later this year and we're certainly
going to hear more about it as time goes
on like a price for instance but even
now it's clear that Microsoft is making
big changes and betting big on the Xbox
taking over your living room can it
we'll see so we don't fare amount about
the xbox one now certainly more than we
know about the PlayStation 4 but there's
still a lot to come and kind of a lot we
don't know and a lot of questions we
have certainly a lot of questions that
these two have ross miller new hotel
hello I'm drunker welcome that's fine I
I've been drunk since the microsoft
event that's how I get through Microsoft
it is that's like days and days well
actually I've been drunk since the Sony
event well you should for all day with
it was it was a day so it was like what
you got there like eight in the morning
no we got there we got there at seven in
the most well a full hour and then it
was raining because it's seattle of
course that was me and then we just
stood outside near a tent for like three
hours until they let us in and we SAT
there for forever being like we were
probably here
yeah and I ready to the minivan just we
could get there early like it's great
but you did like it was like a Seattle
soccer mom the whole time but we saw a
lot yeah um but we we also kind of
didn't see a lot including like a lot of
the rumors we thought were gonna be
there a lot of things that we thought
Microsoft to talk about that they
haven't talked about um but so so I've
talked to you about this a little bit
night but I want to know what you think
just sort of broad strokes rock how are
the pulse vibrating sensors on the
controller that's what uh it's like I
don't really know how to describe this
tally really dirty when they put it that
way the pulse vibrant I just love to
phrase impulse triggers like I don't
know they just sounds like I have a gun
and I'm like trigger-happy like that's
why shouldn't in so many vaporizes yeah
exactly uh but no it's like you it's
cool in the sense that like if you're
playing like you're firing a gun like it
just vibrates in the right trigger so
you actually get like the recoil like
you just pulled a trigger or like if you
start up a car it'll actually feel like
you just started up a car and it'll sort
of vibrate but then the same time it's
like I really control pad controller
right we yeah well yeah you know as you
do if you shut up exactly uh but so it's
it also i was like holding it at one
point and it was you could rev the car a
little bit and I just kept driving the
car and it was literally my whole arm
was like I can't play anymore haha a
single room thoroughly told you I pretty
much and then it turned out the best
part of this is the demos were running
on a PC but they were using to xbox
360's to prop up the mind like a broken
yeah like a broken port story house it
was it was pretty fun I mean that's that
is the history of Microsoft was always
to like run on a PC the first xbox I
believe the dev kits were like max
you're there really yeah oh wow it was
little because you see the first text
box was like a pc the 360 was all Power
PC which was max mm-hmm Wow yeah no I
just got nerdy that's pretty well so I
mean history less I mean that's
basically what this is it's like it's a
pc like I'm running it on a computer in
a weird box of them not always a pc it
is a very similar if not the same pc
that the playstation 4 is using yeah
like it's some kind of AMD system own
ship and might be the Jaguar we know I
believe it is yeah so there it is the
same color should work before yeah good
guess no you
you go wherever you want raise your show
just just take up so what I want is my
big question is like you pull your
trigger story rebek right now my engine
is reven i'm like i'm shaking here as i
go it's ridiculous um but the like the
xbox 360 came out eight years ago right
and now now we're here and like a lot
changed but it kind of feels like a lot
more is gonna change in the next eight
years the question I wanted to ask was
at a basic level if they're building
with pc components can't they just
release a more powerful xbox two years
from now and be like we just put a
faster AMD system in on xbox three sixty
five or whatever like that's what PC
manufacturers do yeah it's what phone
manufactured asked you i mean like i
don't know why Ben Sony could
conceivably do it the same way I mean
like they're using these commodity
components the reason they couldn't do
it with the old consoles was because
they're developing their own chips their
own like architectures well any that
they could where they could they did it
to some extent like they're good they
released back 360s with more storage as
time went on for instance just to light
because they were like oh people
download things now give him a bigger
hard drive I think they added an hdmi
port right all kinds of crazy s'right
360 i'm saying like they never really
talked you could make it but they did
fundamentally make it more powerful is
if you never change the internals before
but we also we saw a shift in the
mindset because before the playstation 2
the playstation 1 these weren't just
like consoles like there were platforms
when the platform and the harder was one
to one and it was until last year with
the last and a race games like i was
warning that they did yeah and last
generation they're like you know what we
can just take this idea of a platform we
can expand it like we're not gonna
change it every four years like they
used to we're just going to connect and
say wait brands for a while right this
is new but like the Xbox itself has now
just two brands a platform I don't see
why they wouldn't know that's the weird
thing to me is that it seems like the
last and this is super you know
generalizing but it seems like the last
eight years were like software right it
was like let's watch TV on the internet
let's stream games it was all about like
different ways of doing stuff now it
feels like at least for right now we're
in this crazy hardware place where it's
like we have watches we have wearable
technology we have all this something
like but you that becomes a lot harder
to just build on top of this sort of
super computer that here's the other
thing because you say it's a hardware
time when it was a hardware time last
time like we're talking years and years
ago it was I need the fastest processor
at the fastest car
it starts anything with laptop some TV
that's gone last time it was literally
these are the first HD consoles right
and in order to even like have this
experience it wasn't the ps3 like the
most powerful computer either by
supercomputers of that right because
just to produce games HD resolutions
which I mean Sony until like two weeks
ago they're like the ps3's 1080p because
I thought they were so proud of it but
yeah right just to do that you need to
the hardware now it's like the hardware
is commodity it's cheap and you can move
on beyond it and because it's cheap and
commodity and more general purpose than
whatever is in the 360 the PowerPC or
whatever is in the ps3 you can do all
this other computer stuff with it and
what I'm actually getting out of this is
this is kind of Microsoft's new pc in
the same way that the iPhone and the
iPad were Apple's new pc like let's use
kind of this commodity arm stuff that's
out there let's take our existing
operating system and scale it down to
this new thing create this new closed
environment it's window I mean they're
running windows on the thing right and
it's as close thing or the games are
effectively like they have their own app
store with that xbox one Xbox a lot of
stuff you know it's like you have the
disc you still have to pay in download
whichever one I mean it's if you look at
it as these are pcs and what they're
really doing is they're changing the way
a living room pc operates a sliding it
instead of like watching and they
celebrate thing then then there are
there opportunities to do stuff in the
future are wide open well so let's talk
about that so there's we have presumably
what six months before all of these
things are going to be out of the market
so what I guess what I want to know is
like what are the next six months look
like and then what are the next eight
years before the xbox two comes out like
where where do we let's go six months to
real it's good trolls gonna be great
yeah good undercover case too yeah so
we're like where are we in the next six
months like what what does Microsoft
have left to show as games obviously is
one of the big things i console games
yeah but is that it like if they sort of
played their hands show us I think they
need to they showed us some games right
and they were games or video crimes they
need to show us developers doing stuff
with all that connects functionality
they need to show us developers doing
stuff with whatever half-hearted TV
things they need to show us that you
need to show us
the same thing that I you know that when
when when Google puts out a new version
of Android or Apple puts out new version
of iOS we're like that's great here are
some features right the developers have
to come in and use the features and
build applications that make them
interested and Microsoft is in the same
place but I think more so than sony is
because sony came out of the gate game
demo after game demo right put the
hardware in second place and you don't
even need to see it right here's a
controller this is the thing that you're
in an interface with and what here's
what we've given developers look at all
the games here's it's even harder cuz if
you look like an apple think you can
just phone iphone 5 you still have the
legacy of absent that will always work
right and when you see these new
generations like the backwards
compatibility is ultimately non-issue
they don't care we can take a technical
hurdle that's just not worth the time
and so it's kind of reset like I don't
have any loyalty to Microsoft now
because none of my games are there i
sold my 360 that's enough order sony
like to be honest I'm almost I iona 360
but I like once a week wind up debating
buying a ps3 because I have this giant
stack of ps2 games I really want to play
and you can't how to ps2 mmm that's good
say but you can't buy a ps3 bio on my
place 3 the day they announced they were
killing backwards compatible and I would
I run even I bought an old one nice and
I not use it exclusively as a blu-ray
player why why would they kill backwards
compatibility this is sort of a tangent
I'm on here but like that that pisses me
off like I have all these great games
that I've paid a ton of money for and
I'm there's not a dungeon technical
level on a perception because on
technical level obviously it's just so
hard you target sure i forget that i
guess i really like they could do it I'm
look I'm just over the math of it but it
seems like it's not dealing don't know
what's it like this is a tough thing to
do but I perception of what let's be
honest everyone's mad that it's not
backwards compatible but ultimately
people don't give a like I know
yeah and the kibbe now because it
feels like a big feo to the day it comes
out right people will forget but like
the first six months the ps3 you played
you know PlayStation 2 games whatever
you also had your ps2 next to you now
true you've had that stack and you've
not touched it my ps2 is so broken and
I'm so upset by features like one of the
best consoles ever in history absolutely
no one's playing games with it now right
and the online community that they were
there they still sell it I think they
still sell it I think they finally
stopped selling it
this but this is what I'm saying like
once you're on the PC architecture and
you're in the PC cycle maybe this
question goes away forever right right
maybe the next Xbox actually comes out
next year Yeah right and it's 1.5 xbox
to xbox one point five right and it's
just a little bit faster and they are
going to Like dot updates what's like an
Xbox one not what you can do with one
sea games or a pc game come out and run
the best on one system and run a little
bit crappier on your old system but
still run right you can definitely do I
mean these are this is a PC running
Windows right like what yes ultimately
there's no reason they can't be able to
they won't be able to do something like
that whether they will it's wide open
right but and I think that is that
that's like those are the questions for
them to answer in the short term right
is what what is the platform cycle for
this thing yeah how is the TV
integration going to work like will it
change over time I mean that stuff to me
is like they've given some hints of it
but they haven't explained anything
about how it's really going to work like
like what is their strategy for mobile
like it's not there yeah like they have
it you know they'd have a phone platform
they have a tablet Padre well so it's
emily is connected to act it seems like
smart glass is what they're trying to
make that platform and it's like ah oh
to be honest my only actual experience
of smart glass is that every time I go
to watch Game of Thrones on my 360 the
screen before i can hit play tells me
you should watch this a smart glass and
like I don't want to do that then I move
on but like that like sony has this big
rich sort of you know platform agnostic
play and Microsoft just seems to have
ignored it and which is weird because
they have all this stuff 20 thanks our
class is like it's great but it's it
doesn't hey I think like just a hurdles
to using it are they vastly outweigh the
benefits of having it right beyond like
I'm going to type in a text field which
is like great you know yeah but they
haven't come up with some like the
kinect they came up with all these
compelling reasons that you'd want to
use Kinect and a little bit later in the
connects lifecycle everyone stopped
using Kinect because those reasons we're
novel but they weren't great right and
so outside of like voice controls and
just like yeah batting at the TV like
I never do any of that stuff but I
remember there was a football game you
could like if you like bent down like
this and then went like this it would
like hike the ball but it would only do
it like forty percent side and the rest
of time just like yeah I think it was a
wonder forces like you can look around a
little bit garlic but what I also the
nuke act like maybe that'll enable some
of the stuff but they have that problem
with smart class which is okay well
you've kind of connected it to this
phone right but you don't have a real
quick xbox live on windows phone is a
hilarious joke okay it doesn't exist
like your avatar yeah it doesn't exist
anywhere else those games don't talk to
the games I almost called poppy see
those games don't talk to the games in
the console I think this is this is the
short term like sony has made this play
right right and it's sony has to do the
opposite thing they it's funny that
they've now positioned themselves so
opposite to each other yeah sony has to
tell us all about the platform and the
TV stuff and all the stuff in the
hardware Microsoft has done all that
they have to tell us about how they're
gonna take all this hardware that
they've introduced and build software on
top of it to connect all of it and then
ultimately show us some games yeah well
okay so let's look like let's look maybe
not eight years cuz that's sort of
ridiculous but like two years from now
or like three years from now what like
how does Microsoft win like what if
you're if you're Steve Ballmer or Don
Mattrick or whoever and you're the dude
in charge like where are you going in
the next two years both of you I'm
curious I just talked to you talk i know
i'm thinking like it's because they're
saying like if Sony plays it smart
Microsoft students Marta they had the
same video options right and like these
are third-party Services people aren't
going from Microsoft movies or Sony's
you know a lot gonna be netflix and hulu
and HBO right yeah and thats everywhere
and it's not it's not third-party trials
as much anymore because it's the same
architecture the ports are gonna be easy
right so unfortunately the solution is
gonna have to be like just like I think
exclusives I think you're actually still
going to win on games which is ironic
because that's the thing you're not
doing as much with us anymore because
last generation is like well we have
connect which is great and Sony's like I
got a wand you can wave this and we can
the games you may 41 didn't as I work
for the other right now that's that's a
non-issue and everyone's out some kind
of motion or voice control whatever you
call it so you kind of leveled the
playing fields i'm not sure what it is
okay i don't think it's a do you think
it's connect I mean I feel like to me
that's the thing that keeps
jumping out at me is like they've made
the connect so good and so almost like
overly powerful at this point like it
seemed none of the games they talked
about the other day had anything to do
with Kinect they're just like games you
play with the controller right but like
you know whatever five years from now is
connect are we gonna have thrown the
controller away like everything we do is
connect even if you like stand there and
go like this particular just nothing and
connect just like nose and figures out
what you're doing that can I hate that
kind of stuff cuz like it's it's like
the uncanny valley of input device it's
like you can do this to steer but you're
not holding anything but I can swing a
sword for like I'm not kidding you this
one is right through a steer a fake
wield it was fifty dollars yeah like
it's some kind of its strong wheel it's
a very good wheel uh no i mean like i
think the kinect stuff is that's
microsoft's long-term and if you talk to
them like anyone at microsoft and you
get them talking a natural user
interface and this is like from their
executives to like random when i talk to
their PR people or when i talked like
their lawyers we love naturally
interface the lawyers just want to
patent oh but there are the phrase
natural user yeah nearly me on a lobby
you can't get enough of it uh I just
gotten used to GUI and now a new way man
it's all good stuff um yeah that's where
they're going and I think their vision
of you walk in your living room and it's
like space aging you like talk the TV
and it does a bunch of stuff like the
illumiroom stuff too yeah right and on
that yeah I'm like we're gonna I think
that will be the kinect for the right
the mid cycle kicker that they call the
connection to 360 I mean ol umer maitre
CF and that is also like that is the
thing that Michaels pushing that Sony
isn't Sonja's like we've got a new
camera and its motion but it's great for
games I gotta be nice I used to connect
now I still use it for voice all the
time will run to the kitchen Xbox pause
I'm like I'm totally sold really yes
that seems totally insane nobody knows
there's my neighbors I still feel weird
pulling out my phone and something a
siri-like hey it barely works my
neighbors must hate me because they
probably just here through the hall
screen xbox can pause that works thank
you should it should know no matter what
you're doing yeah I'm starts screaming
supplies do you need a minute it's like
I'm sorry just like I'm out now I got 45
minutes Sonali does Microsoft like have
the technology maybe something is like
almost getting there with its new i toid
like Microsoft that's what it wants I
think
if that's the perception is giving like
we want entertainment and we just want
to be able to just talk don't pick up a
control or don't worry about your
smartphone just say something so you
think voice is really like the ballgame
here that's where we go next know is
that I think voice is great and I think
it's useful but I think there's just too
much as a primary interface there's too
much mystery to it I think if you have
an xbox that has multiple input sources
and like apps and a browser and TV and
games there are too many ways to go and
it's not going to help you get there if
you're just talking at it place to go
like you don't know what to say to your
TV basically I think it's too mysterious
of an interface I think I think when the
house nowadays I'll remember to like
cereal see on this is Leah halcyon it to
come and raise my eight already
vocabulary a computer is not well
delight no no but like okay what are you
use Siri for nothing no you set the
alarm with it and that's it yeah but I
did it already I was like every weekdays
never stop but I'm happy like that
that's all I want I don't need it to do
everything I just need to do things that
are make no sense for touch and that's
staying with xbox too I don't want to
find the controller when I want to pause
the thing I just want to turn it on as
useless though like I don't need to like
if I'm sitting down I can like push a
button oh no actually I'm happy about
that I don't want look to the controller
and then use voice the resident in voice
where we were with touch before the
original iphone right which is right
everybody knew a bad touch interfaces
were like and they were terrible in the
iphone come out and everyone was like
this is gonna be terrible because they
were all uniformly terrible and right
now everyone's experience with voice
interfaces is not so much Siri it's like
robot calling menus yes where you just
scream at it hits zero until like hope
something a human being and it can
understand your needs to be a chair
aside you are like I give up take me to
that it's called controller yeah like
that's the zero of the xbox and I think
most people are even I don't want to
deal with this like this is still at
that level and that's where the kinect
is for me right now it doesn't always
understand me in terms of voice I figure
the controller and use it i think they
need to get they need that kind of
transformative leap in the technology
and how effective it is before people
accept it the way it's its controller
plus it's like weird where there are
things that we've just gotten used to
use a controller for that actually
really suck like in putting
using as a keyboard like joystick left
joystick right I gotta find the letter B
just say the thing I want I want mommy
burgers up were you gonna do they just a
little bit yeah that's a like I think
that thing up the intro no not again
Bob's Burgers but ok I'll watch I'll
watch hell's kitchen that's what I think
Microsoft think that's what they're
doing I think that's the most
interesting is they're saying like
instead of let's make the controller and
console like really great and as good as
possible and let's make the graphics
great they're like let's expand how we
do this and that's where connect comes
in that's where illumiroom comes in
they're like why even deal with your TV
let's just blow it up beyond that right
you're seeing a ton of companies do it
it's not just the mic like valve is like
doing like report like graphics are fine
its marginal so valves like well let's
chest your heart beat like that's barely
with their testing connect compare do it
the luma room thing is like passing to
me I don't it feels like a novelty sure
but it's fascinating yeah I mean it like
I think it would be fascinating that
worthy the mid-cycle refresh and like
the stuff that they're showing off with
it I mean that is a you'll need the
additional graphics horsepower to make
it happen and be that's like you can
really change a gaming experience if you
take it from beyond the TV to the entire
room okay then I think we're going to go
through if it does ever take off and I
think the problem is just like with 3d
you have to do something else like put
glasses on a projector there but I think
would be interesting is not let's expand
the screen you've 106 inch TV of a 20
inch TV let's give you more space that's
never going to look good because you
have to build your living room around
that but we were talking before the show
like setting a mood like just make the
whole room black and white or make it
look like cartoony or whatever like set
some kind of color tone and some kind of
like a motion to go with what you're
seeing right like I think they just can
be abstract we're gonna do this on Kenny
moment again hypothetically if it ever
does take off right yeah all right well
Ross Neil I thank you both very much I'm
gonna go and I'm gonna invention
illumiroom for my for my TV now BBC is
doing it so I can do that's how I feel
so there's there's a lot we still don't
know about the xbox one and the ps4 in
particular but in a lot of ways where
we're going with the next generation of
consoles it's kind of set so let's look
at really where we are and where we go
going forward you can now play games on
your phone on your tablet or on your
refrigerator but the best and most
powerful experience is still
console and three companies still
dominate in the living room Nintendo
Sony and Microsoft all three have shown
off the devices that they hope will
carry them for years to come or at least
shown off some information about them so
where are we now who's winning the next
generation console for to start with the
Wii U is really kind of its own thing it
has a small hard drive and a slower
processor but instead of offering
limitless power and incredible graphics
Nintendo stuck with the tactic that made
the wii so popular get super immersive
and crazy experiential do we use huge
gamepad is its gimmick building a to
screen experience into the console
itself it's fun too but it can be
confusing where you're supposed to look
and not every game as well suited to
having such a gigantic controller the
xbox one in the PlayStation 4 on the
other hand are more directly competitive
and more normal they're both big
consoles with standard controllers plus
peripherals the promise to track your
body and respond to your voice both come
with eight core AMD processors 8
gigabytes of RAM PC like graphics
processing a blu-ray drive USB 3.0 and
Wi-Fi the connect on the one has a 1080p
camera while the PlayStation 4 I is only
720p but both are wide angle and come
with powerful microphones and voice
recognition they both offer plenty of
personalization totally revamped
interfaces and near instant booting we
don't know too much about the ps4
console itself but from what we're
hearing it'll be more or less just like
the Xbox one they both have different
software but also fundamentally
different visions of how you'll use a
console in the future the Xbox one is
all about TV and seamlessly integrating
all the parts of your home theater
system one voice command is all it takes
to switch from TV 2 games to music to
skype and back again the box is the hub
it's the center of the Xbox universe on
the other hand the PlayStation 4 is
really more of a service than a box
you'll be able to access games in the
cloud download them to any supported
tablet or portable console and keep your
game saved and accessible no matter
where you want to play they've plenty in
common obviously all three consoles come
with exclusive games access to netflix
hulu and plenty of other services though
the wii u definitely does lack of it in
this department there's still time
before the ps4 and Xbox one come out and
we're going to find out a lot more soon
at e3 but it looks like we're going to
be in for one big battle do we want one
box to rule them all or do we want to be
able to access all our games and
services from any place on any device
that's it for a show thanks so much for
watching thanks to ross miller nilay
patel for being here we're taking a
couple weeks off but we'll be back from
e3 in LA with lots more on microsoft
sony nintendo and basically every other
gaming company on the planet we'll see
you that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
