we're looking at up into running on a
Nexus 10 tablet now you'll see we're on
the lock screen here and you can flick
through all the available users and the
notifications on the right-hand side
will change depending on that and the
backgrounds are also changed and
everything's password protected but
there is actually a guest mode that you
can enable for friends to get in a quick
swipe to the left will bring you to the
actual home screen for AB into here and
you see apps listed at the top you can
swipe to the right to get more and
there's a video section and there's also
sections for people and for music as
well most of the navigation on the OS is
horizontal but it's also some scrolling
required - as you'd expect to bring twos
bundled in apps there's a people app
that provides all your contacts there's
a video app that where you can access to
TV and movies and there's other apps
that make this really a consumption
device and that's almost similar to
Amazon's Kindle the Geary app provides
access to pictures and photos but it
breaks from the norm by displaying them
in a range of sizes as the default view
it has all the navigation features you'd
expect but there's also an album option
complete with fake binders so it's clear
that the makers ever been to a fans of
skeuomorphism the album section will
also generate a Flipboard style view of
your photos it's not as smooth as it
could be but it's still early days this
have been - operating system really
comes to life when you start to look at
the gestures available so quick swipe
down from the top of the screen will
reveal a quick settings menu that
provides access to the date and time
network status battery levels and even
the ability to change the screen
brightness it also acts as a hub for
your notifications
allowing you to reply in lines Facebook
messages also implead to swipe and
dismiss them I've been through this
implementation feels very similar to
Android but it does it in its own style
that allows you to touch and hold to
navigate through the various sections
similar gestures are also available to
swipe back to the home screen the star
of the show here is really a pin to
sideview visually it's almost identical
to Windows 8 snap view and it allows you
to run apps side by side the aim is to
have phone apps running in the side view
but a vinter also plans to allow
developers to create apps that will
switch between full and side view in
future to take advantage of the
different screen sizes available it's a
helpful
you can imagine scenarios where you're
in a webpage and you want to copy a
chunk of text and perhaps paste it into
a note and side view allows you to do
this and a lot more and you can also
obviously launch other applications such
as a Twitter app you could be in your
Photos app or even the browser and you
get to monitor your tweets on the
right-hand side
speaking of browsers bintu includes a
WebKit one that acts as you'd expect I
got to test it alongside an on-screen
keyboard which is a fairly standard
affair for a tablet operating system I
got to test it with the verge homepage
and it's the first time that I noticed
the operating system experienced any lag
section images seemed to render well but
navigation particularly zooming wasn't
that great on the flip side I got to
check out another gesture that lets you
swipe up from the bottom to access a
task manager to switch between apps or
close them the widget also provides
access to the application zones in this
case letting you bookmark pages etc it
also provides access to search options
and the ability to use speech to find
inaudible commands in the Photos app
peek search for color balance and it
will display the relevant up commands in
the sidebar
instead of app settings you can in edit
an image quickly changing the various
options available once its feature is
activated it also picks up other
commands like crop so you can activate
that particular mode too this is all
contextual so you'll get different
options in various apps overall up into
4 tablets feels like a mix of android
windows a enkindle as is using similar
features for more free a developer build
will be released this week but the final
OS and hardware won't be available until
q1 2014</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
