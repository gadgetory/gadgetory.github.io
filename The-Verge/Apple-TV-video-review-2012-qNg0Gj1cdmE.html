the 2012 version of the Apple TV
physically it's absolutely identical to
the 2010 version it's really small 3.9
inches squared and just under an inch
tall it's still black glossy on the
sides and matte on the top it's really
nice looking and should slot pretty
easily and unnoticeably into your home
theater stack it's hardware it's still
super simple and basic you do pretty
much everything using the HDMI port and
there's also a micro USB port an optical
audio port and an Ethernet port even the
remote is the same as it used to be it's
also really basic it has the five way
directional pad plus menu and play pause
buttons and it's great for navigation
Apple designed everything to be really
simple but for typing it's actually
pretty hard cuz you end up going right
right right down down to just a type a
letter and fortunately there are
companion apps for iOS that you can use
easily with the Apple TV and those work
much better mostly because they give you
a full keyboard and some gesture support
to get around but the remote is really
good-looking and for the most part does
the job fine inside the box there's one
big upgrade the new a5 processor it's a
single core version of the processor
that was announced in the iPad and
iPhone last year and it powers the
biggest difference in the new Apple TV
which is its ability to stream 1080p
video setting it up as still as simple
as always you just plug it in connect it
to Wi-Fi or Ethernet login with your
iTunes account and you're done and now
you get access to iTunes Match which
gives you all your music and iTunes in
the cloud which gives you your movies
and TV shows and for the first time you
can actually see movies and TV shows
that you've bought and actually
streaming them from the Apple TV it's
kind of odd that that wasn't there
before but it is there now Apple's
trying to make setup even simpler and
and now lets you sign up for Netflix
just using your itunes cran chills so
it's just one tap to sign up for Netflix
and start watching once you're logged in
you see the other big difference in the
new Apple TV which is the new interface
it's really icon based and looks a lot
like iOS it's it's nicer to look at than
the previously text-heavy version but
it's not necessarily easier to use or
access you see all the icons at once
whether you want to or not and you'll
find yourself scrolling through apps
that you don't care about just to get to
the ones that you do most of the apps on
the other hand still look the same as
they always did they have the Cover Flow
style icons on the left and text menus
on the right it's still super simple to
navigate but it's not quite as
aesthetically pleasing as the new
homescreen
most of the content that you can stream
from iTunes and Netflix looks really
really great the 1080p is really
impressive and actually doesn't need to
buffer that much it's pretty fast and
looks really fantastic it's really sharp
it's not quite up to blu-ray quality
mostly because of some compression
artifact ting that you get from iTunes
servers but it's really really good and
is definitely a noticeable improvement
over the previous Apple TV
unfortunately apples content is still
its biggest problem the apses channels
idea is a smart one but it's having
trouble making deals with companies like
HBO and CBS and there are some apps that
we've seen on other devices like the
Roku that are still missing
there's no Hulu or HBO Go or Spotify and
all of those are available on other
boxes you can still play your own
content using home sharing and airplay
both of which are pretty good but have
their own limitations airplay still has
some issues with stuttering as you play
games and lag as you switch songs and
home sharing is kind of clued you to set
up and requires you to be logged into a
single account and it's just not as
intuitive as it could be other than the
1080p streaming the new Apple TV is
mostly an iterative improvement even the
new interface is available as a software
update on the last generation Apple TV
it's good it's certainly the best Apple
TV we've seen yet but you're still
choosing a superior user experience over
the wider content offerings of a device
like a Roku or a boxy or a WD TV device
at $99 it's not a bad price for
something that doesn't it flex in iTunes
so well but if you want other content
from Hulu and the like you might be
better off picking a different price
