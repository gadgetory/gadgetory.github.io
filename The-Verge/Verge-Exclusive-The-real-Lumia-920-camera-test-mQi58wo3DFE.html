are here outside of Central Park at 10
o'clock on a Thursday night because
nokey invited us out to take a look at
the Lumia 920 and more specifically its
camera you may have heard that they
announced that a brand new Windows Phone
8 device the Lumia 920 and one of the
core features of the device is a new
camera that takes pictures with optical
image stabilization it's something that
they're calling PureView now
unfortunately Nokia had produced a video
to promote the PureView camera and
unfortunately it turns out the video was
faked
we took a very close look at the video
and we saw a reflection of a different
camera not the Lumia 920 taking the
video nokia admitted that they had done
this and they posted an official apology
for it it turned out later that there
were images that also were purportedly
from the 920 that were faked as well
they were pulled from the video now
Nokia did post photos from the Lumia 920
right here in Central Park and those
were real but they invited us out here
to visit with them to take the photos
ourselves and to test the Nokia Lumia
920 up against several other flagship
smartphones with very good cameras we
tested it against the HTC One X the
galaxy s3 the Lumia 900 and I phone 4s
to see if they could handle low-light as
well as the Nokia Lumia 920 so in our
testing both taking photos with
ourselves and watching photos taken the
Lumia 920 performed very well in low
light there was a little bit of blur but
generally speaking we had no complaints
and in fact we were very impressed with
its ability to take still shots under
low-light conditions
the other cameras phones didn't compare
so well they were all very dark there
were a couple of phones that managed to
do pretty good if we switch them over to
the night mode setting specifically the
HTC One X and the galaxy s3 handled
themselves decently well once you put
them into that specific mode now
unfortunately nokia would not let us
test optical image stabilization with
video on the Lumia 920 in fact they told
us that it wasn't ready yet although of
course it will be ready for launch Nokia
Lumia 920 does take very good low-light
image but of course they're nowhere near
as good as fake images that don't use
marketing department them together we're
going to have to wait for the final
hardware to see what the image
stabilization video looks like but
unfortunately we just don't know when
that's going</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
