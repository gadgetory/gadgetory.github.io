craziest and the most beautiful stuff
that Google is currently working on it's
coming out of the advanced technologies
and products group it's a team led by
Regina Dugan and she's a legitimate
badass this is a time
Judah's presentation at i/o is
essentially a grand introduction for a
tab to the world
she told us who 8f is and how they work
for the next 45 minutes you're gonna get
a glimpse of a small band of pirates
trying to do epic here we don't
tinker we build new things the cool
that a tap is building is sometimes hard
to describe these aren't the traditional
consumer product prototypes are used to
the first thing they showed us with
project tango technically Johnny Lee
showed us the all-seeing tablet that's
able to see in 3d and know where it is
in space
it's called spatial awareness and it
might help blind people move around and
video game developers create amazing
their stuff the best demo that we saw
was of the tablet moving around five
floors of Google's campus with only 1%
of drift over the entire trip all map of
just cameras and motion sensors not GPS
oh and then there's soldiers attacking
bathtubs and real time portal puzzles
next up was Paul Eremenko and project
ara it's a modular smartphone that
should be arriving for developers as
fall and it's coming along for the first
time we saw real ara phone boot up
laughs then we saw it freeze but the
working phone should be arriving later
and when it does we might have some
pretty crazy modules for it why can't I
slide in a module that's my key fob then
take it out give it to a valet why not
share the most expensive sensor or
component among my friends my family or
perhaps across a village if you don't
want a new battery you can hot-swap a
regular battery module to essentially
get any battery life that you want last
but certainly not least we got an update
on spotlight story the neat little
animated virtual reality seems that you
might have seen on the Moto X a tap is
working on a new one called duet even
better they're working with animator
Glen Keane who's worked on everything
from my area of the Tarzan for Disney
googled his drawings were painstakingly
converted into CGI using gigabytes and
gigabytes of data and then combine to
make another virtual reality play
basically a type has got a bunch of
people who used to work at DARPA inside
the Defense Department and they're all
about trying crazy stuff that nobody
else believes is possible craziest part
of all is that they're actually pulling
it all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
