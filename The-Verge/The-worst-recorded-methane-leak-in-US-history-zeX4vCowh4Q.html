methane was released following the
massive blowout of a well connected to
the fourth largest u.s. natural gas
storage facility last October in Aliso
Canyon California the well was finally
plugged on February 10 2016 but by then
the damage was already done the Aliso
Canyon gas leak was the largest methane
leak in US history according to the
first study of the blowout that means
that it dumped more methane into the
atmosphere than the Deepwater Horizon
oil spill or the collapse of the yagi
natural gas storage facility in 2001
methane is an incredibly dangerous
greenhouse gas although it doesn't
linger as long in the atmosphere as
carbon dioxide it's far more potent
because it can absorb heat very
effectively and trap it in the
atmosphere and more heat trapped in the
atmosphere means higher average
temperatures around the world which can
have many consequences melting IceCaps
rising oceans extreme weather and
ecosystem loss to name a few that's why
it was important for researchers to
determine exactly how much methane was
released from the Aliso Canyon leak to
begin to estimate how much damage was
done to do that the researchers used
surface air sampling devices and a
specially equipped plane that flew over
the area of the leak 13 times between
November 7th 2015 and February 13 2016 2
days after the leak was temporarily
sealed
they found that at its peak the Aliso
Canyon gas leak doubled the rate of
methane emissions from the entire Los
Angeles basin and temporarily created
the largest known human cause point
source of methane in the US doubling the
next largest source and Alabama coal
mine
that means that the Aliso Canyon leaks
impact from the global climate is
equivalent to the annual greenhouse gas
emissions of over half a million
passenger cars the gas leak didn't just
release methane however samples taken
near homes in the nearby town of Porter
Ranch contained above normal levels of
potentially dangerous compounds present
in natural gas including benzene toluene
and xylenes benzene especially is a
known carcinogen not
levels higher than one part per million
methane leaks aren't uncommon natural
gas facilities but what's especially
worrisome here is how long it took to
fix the leak SoCal gas attempted to seal
the leak seven times over a hundred and
twelve day period before it finally
succeeded California Governor Jerry
Brown declared a state of emergency On
January 7th nearly two months after the
leak began thousands of people relocated
from the area after complaints of nausea
and other illnesses connected with
methane exposure became widespread the
disaster has drawn attention to the
broader issues associated with natural
gas production rogue emissions crumbling
infrastructure and lacks regulations
instead of relying on information
released from companies like SoCal gas
the company that owns the ruptured well
independent researchers could provide
fast and accurate information to
regulators and the general public during
major chemical releases having reliable
and continuous measurements of natural
gas and other facilities could prevent
major incidents like the Aliso Canyon
blowout from happening again</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
