I'm at daily eco US launch event in San
Francisco if you're wondering who let
you go is her hair supposed to say it
you're not alone my eco is a Chinese
tech company it's a pretty big brand
over in China they make a whole bunch of
hardware it actually started every video
shooting companies and today they're
bringing a lot of their products to us
including the new flip pro 3 smartphones
the company's flagship smartphone take a
look this is running on Android olive
leave those products run on Android I
believe the Hat let me go have some skin
on it I call this Bui you guessed it
ecosystem user interface one of the
standout features of GUI is supposed to
be this live video option here this is
where you watch all of the content that
Lego makes or licenses or distributes
like I've started as a web video company
so they announce a bunch of partners
today for us content will save the top
on this I'm supposed to be able to then
select
this little window up here and then that
video tile will follow you around so you
go back to the home screen you still
have that video there from the live
which is just one of the features of the
UI as their volumes let's talk a little
bit about the hardware itself it's
pretty single field training in hand and
the fingerprint sensor on the back has a
16 megapixel rear camera an 8 megapixel
front facing camera and has 4 gigabytes
of memory starts with 64 gigabytes and
she's no storage one of the things that
Lego made a big deal about on siege and
even fraud the chairman of Qualcomm out
on stage stuff this type of Qualcomm
Snapdragon 820 one processor this is a
super-fast
alkaline processor it is Google picks
and phone Google picks alone is a lot
more than this this starts at $399 and
liege-lady goes offering a hundred other
rebates if you reorder it before
November 2nd soon actually get it for
$299 this is at a pretty competitive
price points it's selling as an unlocked
phone and it's only available on Legos
own e-commerce website it's called
Coulomb all.com and it works on all gsm
networks but it is not available as a
CDMA phone so you won't be able to use
this if you have horizon
I should work on all of the other
networks in addition to the led pro 3
flagship phone Mako also announced me
ls3 the less three little brother
smartphone today and the less powerful
Snapdragon processor starts at 32
gigabytes of storage and starts at $249
that is also for sale on the mall calm
I'm Laura for The Verge thanks for
watching and stay tuned for more on
Lacko
