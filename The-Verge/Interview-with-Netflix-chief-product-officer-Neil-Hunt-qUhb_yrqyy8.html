with big question is content how can you
watch anything and her Netflix this year
at CES the company announced a number of
partnerships that will make 4k streaming
in your home reality we sat down with
chief product officer Neil hunt talk
about how they got there and what's
coming next
I'm here with Neil hunt from Netflix and
I think you're sitting down with us
today so you guys had a very very busy
CES today about 4k streaming it's one of
the biggest stories that I CES this year
tell us a little bit how you guys got to
this place there's a lot of
manufacturing hardware partners lined up
what's the story behind how'd you get
here today well we really wanted to
continue to push the envelope in terms
of delivering the highest quality
picture possible so in the last few
years we have moved to deliver high
definition HD we recently started doing
super high def which is a high bitrate
high definition still 1080p and the next
logical step was to embrace the 4k sets
the TV vent
TV manufacturers the building also
mentioned the the TVs that are coming
out lately it's an interesting dynamic
that's been going on because the last
year-and-a-half the TV industry's been
for Kay's the thing this is great and
everybody goes like okay cool what can
we watch do you feel like those
manufacturers are relying and you guys
do a certain degree the one of the
interesting pieces of course is that 4k
is not going to have a major life time
on a plastic desk
it doesn't fit on a blu-ray desk and I
think it's unlikely where people want to
create that DVD players similarly it's
unlikely that it'll be embraced rapidly
on the broadcast and cable science and
so it's a net delivery is where it's at
we want to be amongst the very first
that deliver really good ultra high def
4k picture across the internet that
means doing things like embracing Hg PC
h.265 and CODIS yeah I'm furthering out
how to use those and then coop early but
then even more important we have to go
back and get content today everybody's
shooting for HD but not many people are
shooting for her UHD 4k and so we're
very pleased that we were able to get
the adventure the
meant to shooting editing producing
house of cards season two in 4k and we
think that most of the other main
originals that we do in the future
probably before Kay as well this morning
we talked about Sony giving us Breaking
Bad all five seasons in 4k he's supposed
to watch it like for the third time all
the way through absolutely yes but
that's gonna be a pretty impressive
piece of content so it's gonna be a
handful of pretty mainstream pieces a
lot of smaller stuff and then and fill
in the gaps from there
so I'm also you mentioned it's like a
broader you know a broader game plan in
here like what comes next what's the
next step to you know moving is kind of
like technology forward for reference
well Ultra HD really contains three
different components there's 4k pixels
which is a spatial resolution sort of
the resolution of the screen in an area
sense and then the next piece of UHD a
high frame rate pictures and so moving
from 24 frames a second to 60 frames a
second or 120 frames a second and so
that's I think another major advance and
making pictures look better and then the
third major component of UHD is yeah as
about color space and color resolution
it's high dynamic range and that's about
brighter contrast ratio it's about 10
bits per pixel instead of 8 bits per
pixel in terms of last banding and
contouring and it's about packaging up a
color space that has bright the Reds and
bright the greens and bright the Blues
and so when you get to bright colored
objects they really look rich a bold
instead of a somewhat washed out colors
that we see with our sets today one
other thing I want to talk about really
briefly webOS TV you guys were involved
with bagging what was exciting about
that challenge what does you know what
are those products offer that made
Netflix really happy
wait you know let me back up a bit a
television has has had a channel up
channel down
and that's almost seamless you hit the
button and it picks up the next channel
and sort of sub second time and yet with
the internet with all the technology
list behind that in most cases switching
to an Internet app takes five 10 20
seconds which is an unconscionable odd
amount large amount of time it's like
I'm not even gonna bother trying it yes
and when we when we've measured
performance when we when we found
performance improvements and measured
the customer response to that even small
reductions in wait time or pause time
improve the user experience you generate
about a Netflix experience believe the
the the you asked about the the the
webOS stuff and the and the the
opportunity that's compelling there is
that the app switch back and forward in
a way that's much more similar to
channel up channel down you can have
multiple apps live you could bring a new
ones at the foreground it's ready and
it's waiting and that's much more
seamless that's components of what we
think of as the modern Internet
connected television experience well
thank you again for taking the time to
sit down with us I'm very exciting stuff
and I can't wait to watch Frank
Underwood do terrible terrible things to
people and 4k thanks again oh my good
good every 14 it's coming along soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
