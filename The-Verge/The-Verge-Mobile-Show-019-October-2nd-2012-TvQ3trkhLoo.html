symbol post for the the palm five
incredible PDA from a 1998 incredible
design it got me thinking about my
handspring visor prism this big chunky
thick PDA no internet built in unless
you put in a module on the back and then
you know I put up a picture of it next
to the the iphone 5 just how much
thinner and better it is and I mean I'm
gonna be honest we're going to talk
about specs today and it's easy to get
grumpy and complained that you know
these are just small iterative bumps day
by day week by week month by month but
or course a year's you you just miss
that we're living in the goddamn future
it's kind of amazing and we're gonna try
and give it the appropriate aww today
stay tuned for the rubble show I'm
dieter bohn I'm dancy from plasa and I'm
Chris tickler we don't have our process
down for the order I'm when we go for up
we have the whole time just thinking
about that yeah I was thinking about it
well the whole time we were we were
sitting here in silence waiting to start
like this is gonna be I'm always last
I'm always fast that's all you guys need
to know I'll take that one I think I
think it's my fault cuz we should
probably just go in alphabetical order
and I would suppose that we could just
answer yeah alphabetic my last name of
course right um so uh it is really hot
in san francisco and i'm just going to
start off with the off topic madness
it's october and it like i'm a sweaty
mess and like I had to walk and by a fan
for the office and it just hasn't helped
it it's uncomfortable and I'm unhappy
and I'm grumpy and so even though I'm
you know all optimistic in our opening
the truth is I'm really angry and
unhappy except my sister just had a baby
which is gay congratulation also look
yeah I you know didn't contribute at all
because that would be gross yet every
weird
but so do they not have air conditioning
in San Francisco not in my building
there is a like a 25 year old eric
window air conditioner sitting in a
closet but I don't know if I permission
to take it and use it but I might just
have to do that are our landlord not too
well I shouldn't say anything their
landlords a little bit persnickety and
so I can't do anything until I actually
talked to her about it well meanwhile
your regular San Francisco weather has
made its way to New York because it's 60
degrees and raining out so I would
totally take that right now I'm I'm not
used to heat I just can't handle it it's
been a long time since we've had a
mobile show where I haven't known a word
and I've had to look it up on the air
but I'm doing that right now with
persnickety ah placing too much emphasis
chris- you or mine details yeah actually
here's the thing have you guys ever
heard the phrase somebody's going to
have a bird no but there's a whataburger
my family it's always said it's like
it's like having a conniption fit you're
gonna have a bird so I was gonna say
that my landlord would have a bird if we
just took the air conditioner but person
aquino one with no yeah yeah by the way
a fun fact a synonym of persnickety is
pernickety I wouldn't know s dead oh
come on per ticket is that our social
one of those versions of the word is
American but you don't know each one I
don't know I know it's like aluminium
and aluminium and flammable and
inflammable I'm sure inflammable was
never meant to be or maybe but I know
which one was meant to be which was good
to me inflammable I presume it's just
flammable and answer Americans decided
actually inflammable sounds like a
catcher's flame so we'll use it for the
exact same meaning even though it sounds
like it's the exact opposite one which I
don't know what the exact opposite of
the first bubble show is but I think
we'll be doing it
dr. business I don't even think it's so
nice to have everybody in the same you
know for a box and just have us all
together I don't even want to talk about
phones I I just want to talk about the
fact that everybody has a beard except
for Dan and he really needs to get on
that no I actually I actually didn't
shave today uh so you know give me a few
more weeks uh-huh yeah you know exam
went when dieter Wendy turd came here he
didn't have a beard and he claimed that
he was unable to grow one and now he has
one of the most luscious beards a team
well I I want to say that I would call
it lucious my first week here I had a
pretty rockin beard and if you watched
the first 90 seconds I was in like back
in August my beard was you know in full
force and then I was like you know what
I might be on camera more often the
beards gotta go and and so I've been
I've been you know stay my friend here
it's gotta stay now I my beard is
basically like like hair that meant
order on my arm and just missed and it
hit my face it's not luscious all um we
gotta talk about we have yet to dog
Vodafone's I think we've been on the air
for like five or ten minutes now you've
yet to mention also the messages gotta
be less you see right yeah yeah okay
well okay we'll talk about Tiant optic
stuff and how quickly introduce the HTC
one x+ which is so bonkers is so unique
that only somebody who's had the
opportunity to see it and touch it in
person such as myself can really speak
about it I mean honestly it is such a
special phone such fish phone um and
this sarcasm needs to end and uh agency
just upgraded the One X and gave it
faster processor a bigger battery more
storage encoded one x+ and it's shipping
it with jen p all of it is actually good
news I'm just kind of underwhelmed with
these iterative upgrades and I don't
think I'm alone here and the most
notable thing can really say about the
one x+ is that it has a more matte
surface than the white one x and comes
in black so if you really wanted a dark
man
black one x is here and I mean I do
appreciate the fact that has a new
bigger battery that's good and jumpy
what isn't good and the thing that
actually annoys me is that HD is going
to ship this phone so this phone across
Europe before it ships up gently an
update for the WAGs in the 1s not long
before but it still before and that's
just a bad habit yeah so my concern I'm
really glad that it has a bigger battery
but it also has the switches to it's a
1.7 gigahertz Tegra 3 is that right
that's right yeah and one of the things
I love about the One X is on ATT with
LTE s it's got really good battery life
and you know a big fan of that that
Qualcomm processor so a little bit
concerned that switching to the Tegra is
going to offset that bigger battery and
it'll basically be awash in terms of
longevity and battery life on this thing
no I mean that's a very real concern
I've been using the tegra free based one
eggs and his better life is decent but
it's not great I believe he was Chris
who reviewed both the One X and the AT&amp;amp;T
one x and he freaked out when he saw the
ATT one with the extra efficiency from
the you know the latest s4 processor
from Qualcomm so yeah I mean to me it's
a loss and also ATT announced its
version of the 1x which is going to be
released in the coming months so it
seems to be a bit later in Europe and
it's actually going to come with this
new Tegra 3 processor and lt so this is
going to be the first I believe the
first Tegra free and LTE phone but i
think i'm with you DJ i would much
rather have the dual core snapdragon
steps egra free i mean the other thing
is as the problem with the 1x been the
specs I mean we know that you know
pretty happy with the device it just
hasn't done as well as you know HTC was
expecting and not as well as I was
expecting I mean it'll this will help
push things along a little bit and I
guess it's good that they're sort of
sticking with their plan to like you
know keep the 1-series consistent but
it's just sort of like you know would
they really hurt them that
to not release this phone honestly this
is fun going to help them that much you
know it's funny that you mentioned that
dieter because I was thinking this the
supposedly 2012 is supposed to be like a
new HTC with with fewer devices and a
different HTC than we've seen in the
past and that's so far that's been the
case but this device kind of feels like
last year's HTC when we saw like the
sensation come to the market and then
you know that phone that came out like
three months after the sensation with a
slightly faster processor which is
totally escaping my mind right now but
it came out for tmobile sensation XE
yeah the XE and the whatever the
t-mobile had branded it amazed the amaze
4g it was like virtually the same yeah
as a sensation but I had a faster
processor which just feels just exactly
the same as that and like you were
saying it's hard to say that this will
do anything for HTC it's still going to
be limited to ATT just like the 1x was
here in the US and you know it's it's a
it's nicer that it has the more storage
because it's got the 64 gigabytes of
internal storage as opposed to 16 but in
this day and age you know a lot of
people are dumping stuff in the cloud
and 16 isn't really a problem for the
average user I don't think so it's it
like I kind of agree with you it's hard
to see how this is gonna be really
beneficial for HTC yep what are you what
are you up to Chris and what do you
thoughts miss Lennox so I I can I have
to confess I think that my internet
connection is causing me to inject just
enough of a delay that it's impossible
for me to actually speak during the
course of a normal conversation in this
grand HTC debate but now that you
specifically called me out I will yeah I
do have a couple of thoughts on this
thing I think that expletive think of X
plus as being I mean it's exactly like
you guys were saying I think of it very
similarly to the jump from say the
iphone 4 to the 4s the difference is
that instead of turning that product or
any year they're trying to turn it
around
and what four or five months and and
that is not III think that that's a very
very difficult habit for Android
manufacturers HTC and Samsung included
to break Samsung has done a better job
and I don't think that will see you know
there were those rumors going around
recently that we'd CGS for at mwc next
year I don't think that's going to be
the case I don't think we'll see that
until june or july um but uh yeah so I
mean you know maybe it was a carrier
request and that's another problem for
HTC is that they're still beholden to
companies like AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon when
they want something it's probably very
difficult for them to say no we're going
to do this our way and they've they've
certainly tried with one series but you
know speaking of these announcements
today let's let's talk about the VX
which is an AT&amp;amp;T exclusive device and so
here's another example just like the
during credible 4G LTE of a carrier
bespoke a product that that does not
really line up anywhere in the grand
scheme of HTC's product portfolio apart
from the fact that it shares the one
name and the specs are weird but I mean
the you know the processors but it's got
the dual core it's got a 1.2 gig hard
stool core Snapdragon s4 which is a
great processor and we've done nothing
but praise it all year long but 4.5 inch
qhd is just a weird size resolution
combination and add in the fact that
they're not discontinuing the 1x on 18t
where the heck these three products not
because AT&amp;amp;T is already selling the 1x4
9999 and I in talking HTC earlier about
these phones I got the impression that
they're not necessarily keen on lowering
that price again in time for the
holidays so you're gonna have the X plus
presumably at one 9999 I would imagine
then you'll have the 1x at 99 99 and
then the VX is where 4999 free I just
like it's another price pressure
situated we've been talking about this
problem for years but it's it's
happening once again where you've got
too many products in too small of a
price I think
and yeah the thing about the VX for me
is like why did they change the design
that I mean that was the one thing
everybody said about the one v is it
looks and feels amazing are they I mean
they must be aiming for a lower price
point with this thing well right yeah
totally different than the one v I mean
if you compare the envy is like a 3.7
inch display vs this has got a 4.5 inch
display which is like you know a totally
different feel and I think target and
market and but though I do feel exactly
the same way as you dieter like the one
v's design was was great and it was a
great entry level 1 series so if they're
going to just do a spec upgrade on the
One X why not just do like a internal
spec upgrade on the one v and then you
know keep that in its entry-level slot
but doesn't look like that's in eighteen
eighties plans yeah it's true the Dana I
was gonna ask actually is if the one p
is available on AT&amp;amp;T I don't believe
that it is not right no no it's not
alright so yeah so this one VX is going
to occupy I guess that sort of position
n HTC's portfolio but such as it is and
I'm guessing in terms of display their
kind of dredging up old supply which is
going to be you know going really cheap
of the old displays of the class and
kind not the same type resolution as we
had in the HTC Titan and the sensation
because this sensation XE was the jumbo
size 1 4.7 inch one um see I think the
VX is HTC just be a little bit cynical
and just taking you know chief supplied
that it has particularly of the displays
and and the other thing is you know
nowadays as much as we don't like this
friends you can sell 4.5 inch phone more
easily than you can say a 3.7 inch phone
for each phone just because it's like
people seem to think he'd they get more
for their money right well I guess we
should also talk about so jelly bean is
coming to the One X and the one
s it's going to start rolling out this
month although as lad said probably
after the release of the X plus and the
VX man I hate these names anyway and I
mean I'll be interested to see how HTC
handles it because we know that their
take on on Ice Cream Sandwich they you
know very heavily skin it down to a
custom kernel made it really hard for
rom developers at least to start
especially with the two processors that
they had so I'll be hoping that it's
very buttery and very fast because if
it's not I think that it kind of sucks
for Android uh you know in a weird way
that if you know the big effort the big
important stuff that were part of jelly
bean doesn't translate to these other
OEMs these other skins like that just
sucks like although be there is you know
Google Mail which is cool but it doesn't
feel like a point upgrade to me big
upgrade yeah this is nothing good to say
it's just it's just a really
underwhelming phone and really
underwhelming upgrade I think and also
there's something here to also mention
although this isn't a substantive point
there is the matter of the perception of
your phone and HTC has been a premier
android phone manufacturer for a long
time and make it the premier devices
involves treating them in that fashion
so exactly as Chris was saying the
samsung galaxy s3 it's part of Samson
coming out with a ton of mid-range
phones the Galaxy Note phones and
upgrades and whatever else is now going
to be touched like spent the smartphone
flagship for samsung galaxy s3 which
will probably last at least until june
next year or as HTC just taking his best
phone and just upgrading it kind of
randomly like here's the 1x a favorite
phone it has soup roasted like theater
just mentioned and then here's the one
XL is the same thing but it has LTE now
and now he is the one x+ we've tweeted a
little bit more
so these things first of all they did
they reduce the resale value at the 1x
because it's not a unique phone and
people who go into x 1 x w know exactly
which version they're going to get now
exactly because you dilute it first of
first of all second floor I'm kind of
repeating myself but yeah because as I
lead the whole message of the one phone
which which was a HTC zone creation
you're going to get your marketing and
that same thing that agencies trying to
create that same emotional bonding
connection for people isn't going to
happen if you're going to tweak the
formula every few months even if it's
otherwise harmless so you're just not
great you could have been great maybe
could be redesigned like okay I'll say
something really positive or something
positive which is that it has 12 to 100
million power battery in the exact same
space and she'll as the eighteen hundred
million power battery in phone which AC
deserves credit for like digit jacked in
a better that's a sixth bigger without
altering the device size just you know
five grams heavier which is good
engineering that's good job by HTC yeah
and the screen is still for all right
I'm gonna I'm gonna challenge you a
little bit on this being an
underwhelming phone blood I think the
problem I mean you said underwhelming
phone under underwhelming upgrade and I
totally agree with you on the
underwhelming upgrade part the problem
is that I I think the proper HTC in for
the android business in general is that
the 1x did not need an upgrade this year
and this makes i think that the
existence of the X plus makes HTC look
little weak and it makes them look like
they're trying to get a you know get
some sort of leg up on the gs3 the like
they feel like they're in a defensive
position and they need to kind of like
rejigger the 1x just a little bit to get
a leg up and try and get back in carrier
scores which maybe they very well need
to do but still from a public perception
perspective that's not necessarily the
image that they want to protect
absolutely and also just to mention the
samsung galaxy note 2 just started
uh well it's on sale now here in the UK
and obviously other markets I think it's
already in Salem career so from my
thinking I just see HD seen the Galaxy
Note to grab in a whole load of shelf
space in cary stores exactly the same
chris and they're saying we need to get
something big to sit alongside it we
can't just let Samsung have this big new
product particularly is Samsung's first
shipping jellybean device as well so HD
decided to counter that but again
problem is that Samsung's Note series is
separate from its flagship where is for
HTC this quote-unquote upgrade is to its
actual flagship device and for what it's
worth here in the US it's still going to
be on one carrier and it's not going to
get the exposure on multiple carriers
like say the galaxy s3 has right and as
well news yet speaking of rudderless
directionless defensive actions while
we're treating open webOS release its
official one point oh four yeah yeah so
it's out and you can install it on a
computer there's a group called level s
ports which is associated with webos
internals they're kind of you know they
work together and they got it running on
a Galaxy Nexus they've been working on
it for a while they still don't have
hardware acceleration going on it and
Steve trottin Smith actually has also
got it running on a transformer prime
although I suspect the hardware
acceleration might not be going there
either so they really need to get that
figured out and I mean HP needs to help
if they want to get any kind of traction
here whatsoever um can I just say I mean
unreasonably excited about the Galaxy
Nexus board like I am super I don't know
why I can't explain it but I am
extremely excited to try a Galaxy Nexus
running open webOS for no reason
whatsoever well I see it this way it's
the best hardware webos has ever been
has ever run on even though it's you
know a year old hardware that wasn't
exactly cutting-edge at the time when it
came
out it's still the best town that web
les has ever seen because of you know
various hardware issues that webos and
palm had so that's kind of exciting the
other thing is like you know what's the
endgame here like I mean this is going
to appeal to webos diehards and super
nerds but you know where do they go from
it from with with it from here I mean
why I think the thing that's hansard
quite that's interesting to me I'll go
ahead Chris Ison say I think that they
they end up having that the same the
exact same level resounding success that
uh that me go and Tyson have had i think
that's that's I mean part of it part of
me wonders if we've just seen the end
game I mean if you read their like their
post about you know this thing you know
reaching 1 point 0 like the thing that
keeps saying over and over again is we
did what we said we're going to do we
met our goal like they care more about
the fact that they managed to stick to
their roadmap then they do about the
fact that they've just shipped in OS all
right like it there it's like it's more
about the first slide is like we did we
we've succeeded in our goal despite our
you know tiny resources instead of hey
look there's a new OS that you can
install and so you know the community's
going to get this up and running they'll
get hardware acceleration going in the
Nexus it'll be a fun thing to try and I
suspect that we're going to maybe see
like Huawei or ZTE or somebody you know
take a flyer on a webos device to sell
us a phone and you know we might be you
know installed like some kind of
corporate environment but I don't see
any evidence that now that this thing is
out that you know what's the next part
of the roadmap what's the next step they
need to make some announcements and I
mean we also need to see how this
relates to this this weird Graham
spin-off company and what they're
planning on doing so I mean it's you
know it'll be a fun experiment but I
really don't expect
you know don't expect level s to return
to like you know mattering in the
consumer landscape if it ever did well
right either I would actually like to
bring you back to our opener today which
was about status symbols that post and
funnily enough it was a palm device that
we're talking about this is the only
elicit I should the pinnacle of what
open webOS can achieve is become sort of
status symbol OS with Stella simple
devices which geeks will recognize and
appreciate and enjoy primarily because
the ecosystem issue the third party app
ecosystem issue is so prevalent nowadays
if you don't have one you're pretty much
dead in the water and this is why the
guys who are struggling to reach number
three behind Android and iOS struggling
so hot you know Windows Phone and rim
with you know the 2015 blackberry 10
release which there were plans so it's
always the case I mean I'm thinking
about the guys who left nokia the former
Iraqi engineers and set up their own
project field more phones on the basis
of Miko Harmison right I love to lock it
and nine I think most people who used it
and God spend time would it also really
enjoyed it but as much as I love that
software even if they put it on even
better hardware it's not going to go
anywhere because there are no apps yeah
you have to have the support of big guys
like skype and Instagram etc you have to
have the big social networks
particularly with twitter now I mean
Twitter boy will let you build an app
anymore right Twitter needs to be known
on the other hand the other option is to
have real and genuine web app ecosystem
where the apps are more than just you
know a glorified web page and it you
know have it be easy to install on
multiple devices I mean that's a
potential future that never came to pass
really well and it would have been great
if it had and if my opinion and I know
you're gonna rag on me for this but you
know blackberry 10 is pretty good for
web apps too but
in fact than webos really ever was and
where I was good as I could as all
somebody's ecosystem problems as a
direction that room is pushing in but
have we ever seen that succeed that's
the trouble no I clans never seemed my
wish was the mo yeah but I mean it's
frustrating because I mean you know I
ran precentral i luv 10 s um and you
know if you've used webos on a touchpad
you know it was a slow and buggy
experience but like you can you see
hiding behind the lag that the potential
for really great tablet experience is
there and you know there's this new
lunacy e things called lunacy for you
know managing windows that the
communities you know iterating on so if
they're if they're just were a decent
app ecosystem and they could get this
thing running with hardware acceleration
on decent hardware it could be really
compelling but it's you know it's one of
those just frustrating things like
nobody they're just not killing the
dream and part of me wants HP to just
admit that the dream is dead instead of
just limping along yeah I'm with you
actually it's like I bleeeh I would
rather just put a line under it and I we
can move on what's gonna be hilarious to
me is when HP makes a windows phone or
an Android device yeah oh that's
happening that's totally happening yeah
well I mean yeah it's definitely going
to make a Windows 8 tablet like that's a
no-brainer yeah so um well I guess since
I brought a blackberry let's just get
this out of the way quick well some time
we talked at the death last week's we
don't need to get a blackberry 10 again
but they did release their earnings and
you know they lost less money than
people expected yay and 7.4 million
smartphone ships would shipped which is
you know I guess let nothing for people
not to completely ignore them but it's
still pretty sad well it depicted I
guess a lot of people were back in this
figure around on twitter i think google
activates more smartphones in a week
then rim shipped in the quarter yeah Wow
nope we also saw leaked images
looks like a promotional video of I
think it's called the end series is what
we're expect to be called the quarry
keyboard device with the big square
screen and I mean I don't know it looks
cool it's gonna be weird to gesture
straight up from the keyboard there if
the keyboard is really that close to the
screen having to do that up gesture
constantly I think will be a little bit
awkward but I mean I'm probably gonna
buy one of these things it's like you
are enjoying were literally you are you
should be committed to an institution
immediately Peter before this listener
just happened listen when is the last
time that there was a front-facing
qwerty keyboard portrait phone with real
specs when was the last time we had that
well like that was like competitive in
terms of specs everything thinking it
was my time the treo pro that but I'm
even by the time that came around I
don't think that was competitive with
specs yeah that was yeah the gym someone
was close I mean and they have HTC to
thank for that device anyway um yeah but
I mean you know the 700p wasn't maybe
maybe the you know one of their other
windows phone 7 WX but once the last
time we had a properly SPECT modern
front-facing qwerty keyboard device I
can't it's been forever and just on the
virtue of that alone interested in
giving the singer shot venue pro if the
slider is cool well yeah but I mean the
venue pro was stuck to your standard
windows phone 7 specs that were kind of
aged by 2010 when window said phone 7
came around I wouldn't call that a
flagship hype high-end on the level of
say a 1x or galaxy s3 or even a knife I
can't believe I can't believe any of you
are seriously entered to entertaining
theatres ridiculous notion and giving
him the time of day you should be hey
Brendon our producer should actually
drop him from his program right now I
was going to I was going to actually
answered 'yes this question with a
question which I forgot which is fine
but the point I was going to make is
that this quality device from rim
doesn't exist yet so I think actually my
question was going to be do you know
that this will compete in specs when it
is actually on sale which has suspect
very much a really good point actually
really well and the perfect example is
1080p displays right because just this
week sharp announced that it's the
starting mass production of 1080p 5 inch
displays energy is already doing the
same and Chris and others myself
included was so incredulous last year
when we started seeing 720p displays and
you know we just threw up the idea you
know 1080p displays there's a next step
right and we're like no dude we don't
need them and now they're happening so
things are moving so quickly like
whatever we think of as cutting edge
which room is never cutting edge right
so whatever think of carnage today by
februari march april when room actually
releases is going to be blunt to extend
the analogy I just can't get over the
fact that it doesn't look like rim has
iterated on the 9900 design at all like
it literally it just looks like a 9900
that's half an inch longer which I mean
I'm okay with that it's an iphone 5 too
but I mean it did but it's like it's
it's it's exactly the same thing just
with a ballad difference the difference
then is that the iphone is iconic and
people have built up loyalty whereas rim
used to be iconic Andrew makes you need
to change yes look man they're gonna
make a Porsche version of this up a 99
99 99 and it's gonna cause and dollars
pinay and I'm not gonna buy that one I
can't even make the joke no dude that
that actually is dredging up bad
memories because I spent a solid week
review that garbage portion is I thought
and just giving it the time of day just
giving it another shot and
it's crazy it's crazy it remembers you
want to strangle somebody and actually
that's it that's a good point if you if
you ever buy anything branded by Porsche
or Ferrari or mitsubishi or Lamborghini
or anybody make sure it's the thing that
that company and brand is famous for
okay good I haven't seen anything good
I'm go ahead all right I'm going at
easily uh you know argue this point with
you because I want to say yeah it's got
to be like 10 years ago now there was a
line of laptops that actually bestbuy
sold that were branded with porsche
design and they were like the best
looking Windows laptops of the time they
pretty much just ate you know whatever
Apple was doing but at that point there
was no windows laptops that had you know
widescreen display and aluminum chassis
Xand you know relatively thin designed
for the time and they even have like
slot-loading cd-rom drives so those are
like the only that I guess that's the
exception that proves the rule there but
nobody nobody wants to corroborate this
on me with me I know sorry your your way
out on your own I don't know what you're
talking about but I'm to trust you so
I'm really excited if there's a new
years of sad man taian you should
totally jump all over that like a Batman
tie and I think you can like the Batman
give me an 800 which was amazing yeah
how about about a James Bond tyne isn't
that the the Sony Xperia T L got
announced isn't that gonna be James
Bond's next phone yes yes and I actually
can talk about that because I've had one
in for review and I can't bring myself
to review it because well frankly the
fact that i'm not going to review it
sorry should thank before you should
probably like 7k could say thank you
because it is annoying it well here's
the thing um it'sit's ships food ice
cream sandwich which is good and it's
generally responsive and in terms of the
widgets I actually think Sony might have
some of the best
the skin widgets and that was Kent weeks
so it has some really really good ideas
but Sony's habit of picking the ugliest
most annoying displays I'm talking if
you just look into the display straight
up in front of you like right in front
of your eyes it looks good and all of
this Bravia Engine talk that they have
with the displays bright top much great
you can get some great saturation great
color etc as soon as you tilt it in any
sort of direction and let me assure
people most of the time you're not
looking at your phone straight ahead you
know it's not a 20 inch display you
don't need to you don't need massive
viewing angles but you need some viewing
angle so a lot of the time you looking
at your phone while it's on table or
your hand etc and look at it from one
angle and when you're doing that the
Soudan displays is just garbage and i
thought this experience he was an
upgrade over the Xperia Arc with the
plastic back there's only still using
the exact same class signatures and it
ultimately you just start feeling it's
also feel really cheap I think it's such
a major and significant departure from
things like the Xperia x10 which to me
was he knows it's what was caught right
sony ericsson xperia x10 am the one dose
stuck on 1.6 for about a decade under
1.6 that really felt like a premium
device like you held in your hand you're
like wow this is a saudi phone even
though the software head issues now
Sony's getting better with software it's
just cheap eating out on the hardware
side and it's not learning for its own
mistakes and just annoys yeah the issues
that yeah and the the tea sounds like
the exact the exact same issues with the
eye on that came here in the US this
summer yes just you know display issues
all over the place hardware issues with
it all over the place ah right and just
a thing I'm trying to say is this phone
also makes James Bond appear completely
confused because he's going to wear a
mega watch which costs thousands and
thousands of pounds or dollars whatever
you currently costs thousands right
has got precision engineering and it
keeps time beautifully etc etc and then
just a little bit further down into his
hand you got this plastic piece of mmm
and it's terrible I mean it's basically
ruined a feel for me as soon as I see
the product placement folded the Xperia
T I'm gonna be like James Bond use of
garbage file I kind of respected me more
I wonder brushes to win whoever the bad
guys are well of course you do your
Bulgarian Vlad yeah you probably root
for the Russians in every single bond
movie pretty mine is there are Russians
in the movie Wow um by the way I have
nothing tight they had this conversation
Ivan Ivan played I will say this i don't
think we've ever mentioned it on the
show but we should Jeff leg and did an
excellent piece where he actually went
and talked to Sony's mobile designers at
their tokyo tokyo design office and in
part c I mean that the text of it is
great is that he interviewed them but
the gallery is really really fascinating
where you get to see all these different
design concepts they've iterated through
and there's this one shot in particular
this table with I think like literally
every phone sony and sony ericsson have
ever made and it's just in it's insane i
want to buy that table with all the
phones on it just for my own personal
use um uh but yeah I do think after
reading Jeff's piece I do want to
believe that Sony recognizes exactly
what you guys are talking about which is
that there's a you know their their
devices have felt very cheap sometimes
they look great but they feel cheap and
I think that as as the new management
and the new corporate structure kind of
congeal over the next few quarters I'm
hopeful that that's going to change Lisa
I sort of want it to and I think we all
do we all have everyone in our age range
has a very fond memory of Sony growing
up and we all kind of want to see them
turn around but this product is really
that and you know on paper the specs are
great
right but uh but you know too hopeful
that this fun that I watch and I look
great that's the thing yeah I I don't
know if I've said much positive in this
podcast today I'm just here ragging on
companies but Sony blew it on the spec
side as well it has a snapdragon s free
from about two years this is still the
s3 that was like one of the biggest
complaints of the ion was that it was
the s3 and it was you know old and is
you know okay oh my god yeah thats thats
Sarah blowing it yeah so juku is 1.5
gigahertz but it's old so that's one
part another part going to chris's point
about us hopeful geeks and the way to
sony's letting us all down playstation
certification HTC made sure to mention
that the one x+ is another PlayStation
Certified device and then I make sure to
mention to HTC when they'll tell me
about that the fact that the playstation
store isn't activated yet so being
placed in your certified basically means
zero for the one x+ and put pretty but
also let's not forget that sony is
trying to have its one sony campaign so
we got the HTC trying to give you the
one smartphone device campaign Sony's
trying to be the one sony it's also
trying to rationalize the product line
and at the same time they're falling
back on bad old habits because you got
the Xperia T which is I'm guessing is
good to be all across Europe then you go
to the xperia TX which is going to be
the germany only LTE version and that
one actually has a Snapdragon s4
dual-core Snapdragon s4 and LTE I think
I think okay had they had to combine the
two basically so that's why they went
for the new approach there uh I have
nothing more to say about Sonny speaking
of depressing a android garbage the
motorola atrix 4g depressing in and of
itself i know it's depressing that it's
not going to get upgraded ice cream
sandwich like come on guys really come
on you said you'd do it I mean this is
this is an old phone and that's fine
whatever but I don't know man I mean
what is motorola gonna get its act
together and act like it's owned by
google i mean you know we had the stuff
about the razor and all you know all
that but like i would just like to see
this company have the new motorola clean
break that we're expecting it to have
and just do that and the razr m and the
razr HD or not pit and you know this
contribute fiasco of you know is is it
gonna get an update isn't that when's it
gonna come oh now it's not going because
it's not powerful enough it just needs
to stop like my money and I think that
we I think that we talked about this on
the show in the past but my theory is
that there's still kind of cleaning out
the pre group ownership fight and the
you know the razor I'm is a perfect
example that I don't think the bed that
is a a product that the motorola receive
a that the google-owned motorola would
have necessarily greenlit but that was a
job that they had verizon prior to that
acquisition completing and of course the
atrix 4g is a legacy product and that's
probably an example of you know motorola
just trying to cut its losses and
refocus its smaller team keep in mind
that they're they're going through some
layoffs right now they're trying to
refocus their smaller team hopefully on
new and interesting products so i don't
want to sound like I'm shilling for
motorola here but i'm i'm cautiously
optimistic that we haven't actually seen
what a google own motorola come to yet I
could you know we have my view this kind
of delay yeah reminds me of HP and palm
it just took so long for HP to quote
unquote integrate palm get the scale get
the such-and-such get the middle
management to remember everybody's name
etc and in that a never gelled it never
materialized so I'm going to carry on
with my negative theme for today
and just be like why the question has to
be why does it take so freaking long
like you pull the company and it took
months for Google to get you know
ratification from Europe us even China
so they knew that this was going to
happen for a long time it could have
learned everybody's name they could have
learnt what everybody does and it could
have adjusted things I guess maybe I'm
being too optimistic about how quickly
probe maps can be changed in this
business maybe I am but it still just
feels slow slow as hell aside from the
fact is outrageous I need to be fair
that they tricks 4G was a pretty uh like
issue prone phone I I briefly trap to
own one but I just I couldn't do it um
but you know I mean if you look at it I
guess the bothersome thing to me is that
this is a perfect example of the device
they look at the specs on paper and
there's absolutely zero excuse board not
nice yes I remember sitting in
Motorola's press conference at CES 2011
and they they you know introduces atrix
4g and everyone was like holy crap 1 gig
of memory dual core processor um people
were in that that was the phone that
they they famously announced alongside
the droid bionic which got sent back to
the drawing board and then the bionic
didn't launch till what October or
something yeah but they mean this is a
phone that when it when it was announced
you know less than two years ago less
than one full contract ago was a far and
away the most high spec android phone to
be announced and and here we are in in
2012 and this thing has just been left
by the wayside i guess we should talk
about the other the biggest you know
what fail in mobile of the past couple
of weeks so we gotta address maps again
what's super interesting is Tim Cook
published letter apologizing for maps
and they have been promoting third-party
alternatives
the store and uh who else is using iOS 6
and maps i know that i am and i got
mentioned on the verge cast i literally
got home like just like David phone map
sent me to a random called a sack
instead of to my meeting and if I hadn't
shown up super early I would have missed
my meeting like it was completely insane
like I went to the address i stood at
the address and i searched for the
address in palo alto and standing right
at it and it gave me the result back at
the other place in in a different city
and i reported the problem but i
couldn't report the problem on the spot
that i was at so i guess the like the
big question for me is how long until
you know people feel like this isn't a
problem will it be a Google Maps or some
third-party app that everybody defaults
to or will Apple be able to fix up their
Maps product on iOS quickly enough where
we won't be planing about it and feeling
frustrated by it so so I've a thought on
that and I'm probably going to catch a
lot of hell for this but uh you know
I've been talking to my friends over the
past couple weeks since iOS 6 came out
and a lot of them are iphone users but
they're not they're not techie at all
they don't they don't read what we do
they're not like you know on the only
mention of maps they might hear on the
Today Show or the evening news or
something like that and and pretty much
every single one of them has said I
don't know what everybody is complaining
about with maps because they're just
fine for me and it's totally anecdotal
but I think that's going to be something
that a lot of average users are probably
not going to have that big of a problem
in you know a few weeks time once it
blows over the the whole storm of
complaints and controversy one set blows
over and everybody's kind of focused on
the next thing I don't think average
users are really going to have too much
of a problem with it in the law I I kind
of agree with you Dan but but uh except
for one thing which is that it only
takes one catastrophic incident to
really sour you on the experience and
get deters uh examples a perfect a
perfect you know case of that where it's
like if he had missed his meeting he
would have been pissed for
you know six months or more that that
maps had wronged him and I wouldn't
blame him for that yeah I mean that's a
designated point yeah yeah so that's
going to be a situation for regular
users to ninety-nine percent of time
they might get to their destination but
it's that other one percent that's
really going to cause long-term problems
for a polite as a potential to any um
yeah i mean it's it's it's definitely
perception thing and the question is
once you've been burned once you've sort
of in the air that there's it's a
problem and then you just have that
opinion and you know it's just gonna be
hard for apple that to turn that around
i mean i think i've said before like as
a first iteration of maps i think it's
really good but first iteration of apps
is not really acceptable anymore right
yeah there was this other this Wi-Fi
issue or you could have Wi-Fi add
verizon and maybe other carriers it was
still using cellular data but verizon's
not going to charge you for it I didn't
experience this but I'm not on verizon
either but it's good that that's getting
fixed and relatively quickly it looks
like to so yay um I think that's really
the big iphone news of the week to be
honest other than i had one piece
availing on me i have one piece of big
iphone news which is that do not disturb
is the best feature ever invented and it
really upsets me to say that because
it's like I I remember when they talked
about it during the iOS 6 event I was
like oh that you know that's awesome oh
wait that's so basic I shouldn't be
saying it's awesome but in reality like
the programmability of it it's just it's
it's awesome it's great they the
implementation is perfect um you know I
have like three contacts that that I
allow to get through if if it's in do
not stir mode and I I have peace of mind
that why on the mobile you schedule it
exactly where are you toggling it am i
what sorry are you scheduling it or are
you toggle Annette both so I what what I
do is like you know when I when the
mobile show started I turned it on
um and so that's an example of me
manually enabling it but I'll definitely
use it for like if I'm going to a movie
or something instead of putting my bread
in silent i'll put it and do not disturb
and then i also have it set so that
between i think like 2 a.m. and 5am or
something it it's in do not strip right
now I and that might change I might
adjust that depending on like what
events are going on newsy events but uh
you know I figure that's a safe range
for me to be able to sleep without any
potential text messages from friends
well it's it's I know you've done this
in the past Chris but it's it's kind of
interesting how much granularity iOS
gives you over notifications and do not
disturb as a part of that excuse me
where the rest of like the OS is you
have very little control over certain
things that you might expect have more
control of but this notification saying
you can like it go customize to your
heart's content where you can't even do
that on some of the other platforms so
it's just kind of this interesting
anomaly with in iOS yeah what's
interesting to me about the Do Not
Disturb is it's basically profiles and
we had this innovation with the original
trio 180 that oh you know and actually
no I'm sorry with the visor phone this
goes back to the visor phone that you
know what profiles that all these phones
these different like night mode and do
not disturb mode and movie mode blah
blah blah mode is really complicated for
users so we're just going to make a
physical switch and that will put it in
silent and that's that's the most
profile management that you need to
bother with and that is carried through
to a ton of different phones you know
the iphone of course a bunch of android
phones they do you know if you scroll
the way down and automatically goes to
silent it's a profile management has
sort of like fallen by the wayside is a
feature that most people care about and
want to manage and rather than just
bring back the idea profiles and setting
up multiple profiles they just bring one
this do not disturb mode which maybe
gets multiplied by the ringer switch or
not and i guess it makes sense to me to
do that because it's still simpler than
a full-on support for you know
customizable profiles but on the other
hand i figure if you're going to be
introducing
sort of complication in the first place
just do it right and do it all out I
mean you know you just said there's a
ton of settings in grandmother and iOS
like why not have more well that made it
as the thing maybe uh I've always done
it right maybe it's just give you a
little bit but not the whole thing
because I I fully agree i've seen so
many phones we're exactly like you
saying like silent profile outdoors in
the garden profile cloudy day he'll file
and you're like what exactly is this
adjusting like am I switching between
the crazy korean ringtone and the time
european one am i going to have a
ringtone it is the focal to vibrate is
not predictable whereas you do not
disturb you get exactly the predictable
thing you don't get disturbed and the
crisis point about scheduling zen our
london intern he's been saying that the
best feature hands-down of iOS 6 for him
is also do not disturb so it's kind of
notable that two of our extremely arid
I'd and intelligent members of the world
staff obviously Chris being celebrity in
the mobile business as well a lot of the
teacher and it's actually encouraging
because some people myself included
started questioning well hang on what
was the last time that Apple actually
did something really innovative in new
and kind of as a selling point on the
southwest side I I don't really know
like Apple did a whole bunch of catching
up with notifications etc and did quite
a few things well but it never had like
this one feature that it did really
nicely really neatly which has been kind
of a hallmark previous Apple stuff so
that's encouraging to see that it's
dunno disturb fig is been developed
in-house by a poor what has been done
right it is you know getting positive
feedback from people i do feel i mean
the nokia n9 coming back to that
favorite phone of mine it also had like
that kind of thing you could schedule
things like don't give me any alerts
from midnight to eight
or whatever all the time or just
disconnect the phone I believe sony also
has some of these things built into its
android skin or if it's not sony then
it's a friend of mine had a cell phone
hacked it with it wrong i don't remember
exactly but but the point is other
companies have also tried to do the same
thing and maybe if Nokia said selling
and pushing the n9 we see that being
successful but it's good to see Apple
doing it and Ally at least an opinion
not I haven't used it going on the basis
of what Christians and have said is it
Apple seems to have struck the right
balance here between customization and
simplicity i rescind my previous
comments and acknowledge that Vlad's
speaks the truth yay that success uh I
think one more thing we can't not talk
about is this that Deutsche Telekom has
confirmed that it's in talks to buy
metropcs and we've we've heard rumblings
that there'd be more consolidation in
the global industry this is obviously an
example of that and I'm trying to decide
if I think it's a good fit and I mean
it's a good fit just strictly from a you
know they need to increase customer base
and size the business but I'm a little
bit less sold on if it's a good fit in
terms of spectrum well there's a couple
different schools of thought on it and
there was some really a healthy debate
on Twitter today between some really
smart people and you know the one side
says that metropcs is a great fit for
for tmobile because it already has an
AWS LTE network and that's what t-mobile
needs to get to is an 80 AWS LTE network
and then the flip side the other
argument says yeah but metropcs also
runs this cdma network that it can't
really shut off right now and it's
incompatible with t-mobile's gsm network
so you know it'll be interesting to see
how it goes i personally i think that
t-mobile's access to the LTE network is
very important with the the the AWS
spectrum and since it already uses AWS
spectrum and that's what it's planning
on rolling out LTE on in the future I
think it's a good thing if this were to
happen yeah I think that that this is a
pretty obvious but I mean people been
talking about this as a possible tie-up
since before AT&amp;amp;T tried to buy team and
metropcs has been in discussions on and
off for years and years and years with
leap is the parent company of cricket
and they've been kind of like flirting
with each other for as long as I can
remember so it's a M you know I think
that those regionals that that are
sitting on a lot of spectrum and not
particularly many customers namely
metropcs and cricket are in perpetual
danger of being acquired if danger is
the appropriate word um yeah I think
this could work you know I metropcs has
some some LTE markets that t-mobile
could certainly use and i think that the
FCC is probably very the FCC in the doj
are probably both very friendly to a
tmobile tie-up with a small carrier more
certainly more so than they were with
AT&amp;amp;T so this is something that they
could probably make happen from a
regulatory perspective they wanted to so
you think it's gonna happen I think it's
probably gonna happen yeah yeah i would
i would put the odds it i mean if i were
a betting man I would definitely put a
dollar on this wow what American dollar
yes done such is life flows nowadays DD
are you sure you don't want to save up
that dollar and may be invested in sharp
oh do such a safe way yeah oh I think
I'm pretty good about that well I mean
this is just a very quick mention again
to pimp out jeff blagdon work over in
Japan he got to see sharks five
inch 1080p display in person and he's
thrilled with it it's extremely pics of
dance he's got over 440 PPI in pixel
density and according to him it looks
great so check out his post on the site
to you know get some more of his
impressions and take a look at the
gallery of pictures from that display
just one thing one thought the cross my
mind with shop today was that it's why
is one of I think every single Japanese
tech companies having some struggles
nowadays I can't think of one that's
driving maybe nickel ion cannon because
their business hasn't changed quite as
dramatically even though it is in the
process of changing but show up is one
of those companies are struggling
Foxconn has been looking to buy steak
eShop and help it out the Japanese
government I think approves a bank
bailout of some six billion for sharper
Renesys recently but the thing that came
to my mind is sharp can have a silver
lining to the future if it continues to
lead in mobile displays and that seems
to wear shop is right now because it's
one of the companies providing the
iphone 5s display which means it's
guaranteed to sell as many displays in
because as it can actually produce and
it's not one of the companies on the
cutting edge for displays for what we
show to be the next generation of
Android devices so it's in a good
position well on that hopeful note we're
gonna end on a hopeful note i'm making
it happen thank you very much for
