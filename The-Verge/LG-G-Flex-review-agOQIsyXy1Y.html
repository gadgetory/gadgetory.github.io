this is the LG G flex this is the first
smartphone in a while to offer something
genuinely different it might be the
start of a huge new trend or it might be
a pointless tech demo or it might be
something else entirely it's going to
live or die based on one feature and one
feature alone its curve display the G
flexes six inch screen is subtly
vertically curved so that the top and
bottom curl inward and the back sticks
out it's like a crescent moon shape or
maybe a banana it's supposedly more
comfortable to hold against your face
more immersive for watching movies and
less reflective because of the angle
light bounces off the screen it does
seem to be ever so slightly less
reflective but by and large there's
really no practical improvement or even
change with a screen like this you can
tilt the phone and see the wallpaper
move although that's really awkward and
laggy and there's a cool motion for
unlocking the phone straight to one of a
handful of media apps but those really
have nothing to do with the curved
screen the screen doesn't just Bend
though it flexes when you rest it
facedown on a table the screen doesn't
quite touch the ground but you can press
it down so that it does you can actually
flatten the phone with enough force and
it just pops back into form whenever you
let go there's also a coating on the
back of the device that supposedly self
heals protecting the phone from dings
and scratches that seems to work with
really imperceptibly small ones but if
you get your keys and phone in the same
pocket you're probably still in trouble
the screens only noteworthy features
that it bends and it's otherwise fairly
ordinary it's a 720p display which looks
good but can be a little pixelated and
jagged at such a large size and it's an
O that instead of a more standard LCD
and it has great colors and good viewing
angles but it's just not as stunning as
some other smart phones I've seen it's
all very futuristic using a phone with a
flexible screen that supposedly heals
itself but since none of it really comes
into play what you're essentially using
is LG's g2 the G flex has the same
Snapdragon 800 processor the same two
gigs of ram the same 13 megapixel camera
the same overwrought over-designed
software that looks like Samsung's
TouchWiz from two years ago just the
same everything that's mostly a good
thing actually
the camera is fast and versatile with
lots of scene modes and wacky ways to
take pictures and the G flex is
incredibly fast and powerful for even
the most intensive tasks there's a
monstrous feature list here - an IR
blaster with a universal remote control
app a notification LED eye tracking
phase tracking and on and on it goes
some are really useful and most are just
pretty inoffensive
I hate LG's scan of Android 4.2.2 though
from the rows of toolbars that take up
half the screen in the notification
pulldown - the ugly redesign system and
app icons everything LG touches here
just gets worse the slide aside apps are
a cool idea letting you store frequently
used apps off to the side of the screen
but they don't work very well neither do
the overlaid queue apps which show up
over top of whatever you're doing
otherwise and why do your Lord why is
the Vienna Boys Choir singing my
ringtone but where the g20 edge let's
the G flex down most is in the hardware
design the G flex is such an impressive
piece of engineering such a futuristic
object that it really deserves something
better than the slick plastic gray shell
it comes in it's not particularly thick
at between eight and nine millimeters
and at 6.24 ounces it's not very heavy
either but it just doesn't feel good to
hold it's huge as any six-inch phone is
but it's the slick cheap feeling body
that really lets it down the ergonomics
of such a huge device are helped a bit
by the power and volume buttons being
placed on the back of the device rather
than the sides at the top but it's
actually a clever spot for them to be
right where your index finger goes when
you hold the phone the only problem is
that the buttons are right next to the
camera lens which I keep hitting by
accident I wind up constantly cleaning
the lens to get my fingerprints off one
of the best things about having a huge
phone is that it can have a huge battery
inside and the G flex does it's one of
the longer-lasting phones we've tested
and can handle a day and a half of solid
use without causing any problem at all
okay I'll give LG credit for one thing
it did something new and if you do spend
nearly a thousand dollars and buy the G
flex you'll certainly never mistake it
for any non curved phone but other than
the sheer novelty of the thing it's just
not worth buying even LG makes a phone
with great battery life great
performance a better screen and a more
reasonable size that doesn't bulge out
accord Lee in your pocket the G flex is
just a tech demo a toe in the water a
proof of concept that LG can make a
phone with a curved display maybe next
time it'll show us why a curved display
is a good idea in the first place</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
