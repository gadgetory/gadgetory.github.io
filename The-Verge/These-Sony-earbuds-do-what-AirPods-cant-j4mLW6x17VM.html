some really awesome headphones.
But so far, it hasn't really
made a name for itself
with true wireless
earbuds like the AirPods
or Samsung's Galaxy Buds.
That's about to change.
Because the new $230 WF-1000XM3s
are some of the best AirPod
competitors I've seen to date.
(soft music)
Now if that awkward name sounds familiar
it's because Sony already makes
the 1000XM3 noise-canceling headphones.
These things get rave reviews,
and the earbuds are cut
from the same cloth.
They have the same matte black design
with rose gold accents.
And there's a gray color option as well.
More importantly, they
also have that excellent
active noise cancellation.
It's not quite on the same
level as Sony's headphones,
but it makes a difference
when it comes to drowning out
city streets or subways.
(train clattering)
So most earbuds that you buy
offer some level of noise isolation.
As long as you have a
good seal in your ear
you're gonna drown out some
of the stuff around you.
But noise cancellation goes
several steps beyond that.
Now it's not some miracle.
If you're not playing any audio or music
you're gonna hear things around you
but once the music starts
everything else just kinda fades away.
(soft upbeat music)
Sony packs in a ton of different
ear tips right in the box.
So it's pretty easy to
find a nice and secure fit.
And the lower part of the earbud itself,
that rests inside your ear,
has this extra grippy finish
to help it keep it snug.
And that actually works really well.
These M3s fit me great
and never came even a little
bit loose during my tests.
Now they're a bit on the larger side,
but overall I think Sony
made them look pretty classy.
And they're a huge improvement
over the plasticy design
from the first model.
Now of course sometimes
you do want to hear
what's happening around you.
And so when that happens you
can turn on Ambient Sound Mode.
Or if you just wanna hear
an airport announcement
or a subway platform announcement
you just press your finger
down on the left earbud.
That pauses your music,
turns up all the sound around
you, then once you let go,
noise cancellation kicks back in
and you're blissfully back to your music.
Now to control the M3s
you're gonna do a lot
of tapping on the sides.
The left side controls
the noise cancellation.
On, off.
Or the Ambient Sound
Mode I just talked about.
The right earbud controls playback,
so you press once to pause or play.
Twice to skip forward a track
or three times to go back.
You can hold the right earbud
to do Siri or Google Assistant.
But you'll notice that
I didn't say volume.
There are no built in
volume controls on here
so you're gonna have to use
your phone or a voice assistant.
Now let's talk about sound quality.
It's obviously very subjective,
but what I'll say about the M3s
is that they're very balanced.
There's a lot of bass, nice
mids and sparkling highs.
Now I don't know if the sound stage
is as wide or all-encompassing
as higher-end earbuds like
the Sennheiser Momentums
or the Powerbeats Pro.
But at this price, the
Sony's easily win out
over the AirPods, Jabras
and the Galaxy Buds.
Now for me, I think their best competition
are the new Powerbeats Pro.
These are Beats,
so of course they're
gonna be super bass heavy.
But both of these ear
buds sound fantastic.
Now you audio nerds out
there are gonna wanna know
that the Sony's only support AAC and SPC.
So they can't do aptX
or Sony's own LDAC codec
for higher quality music streaming.
Now a lot of people have asked me
how the M3s are at phone calls.
People can tell that you're on a headset.
There's really no way around that.
But they haven't complained
about being unable to hear me clearly.
Now unfortunately, you can't
pair two devices at once.
So if you wanna watch
a movie on your laptop
and take a call when it comes
in, there's no way to do that.
Sony, please figure this out.
(upbeat music)
Now the one biggest downside of the Sony's
is that they're not
sweat or water resistant.
It's summer in New York City
and I'm a sweaty human being.
The idea that I can spend $230 on earbuds
and have them ruined
just on a hot summer day.
That sucks.
Battery life in noise canceling mode
is six hours which is pretty good.
If you turn that off,
you get eight hours of battery life.
And the carrying case holds enough juice
for three extra charges.
So you get 24 hours
with noise canceling on
or up to 32 if it's turned off.
That charging case is a little big.
It's twice the width of an AirPods case
and about the same height,
but it's still plenty pocketable.
And I think it's worth it
for all the extra battery
life that you get in exchange.
Plus it'll charge over USB-C,
and, in a pinch, you can
charge it for 10 minutes
and get 90 minutes of listening time.
But unfortunately, there's
no wireless charging option.
Now a lot of the problems
from Sony's first true wireless earbuds
have been solved for the M3s.
I didn't really notice
any connection dropouts.
And the bad audio delay from
the first model is gone now.
Lips move in sync, and the
connection is rock solid.
How did Sony fix those problems?
Well now, both earbuds connect
to your phone simultaneously.
Whereas before, one had to relay
your music to the other one.
That also means you can
use them individually
if you wanna leave one in the case
and use one like an old
school Bluetooth headset
for making calls or
just listening to music.
So, we've covered all
the big picture stuff
but Sony also added a lot of small touches
that I like a lot.
For one, both earbuds tell you
their Bluetooth connection
status and battery level
when you put them in your ears.
Two, there are a lot of LED lights
on the earbuds themselves and the case.
So you definitely know
whether you have to charge them or not.
And three, when you take an earbud out
it'll pause your music
until you put it back in.
That's pretty common nowadays,
but it's still a pretty
great feature to have.
Now of course Apple's AirPods
are the best-selling true
wireless earbuds on the market.
So if you wanna take those on
you've gotta offer
something that Apple can't.
For Sony, that's noise cancellation.
We've seen it before in their headphones
to amazing results and now
it's coming to the earbuds
that you can just put away
when they're not in use.
There are downsides of course.
I would loved to have
seen sweat resistance
and be able to use them
with two devices at once.
But I guess, I know
what to look forward to
for the 1000XM4s.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
