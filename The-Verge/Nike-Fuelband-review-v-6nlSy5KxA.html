this is the Nike+ FuelBand it's a
bracelet that you wear 24 hours a day
and it uses a three axis accelerometer
to monitor the steps you're taking the
calories you're burning and a new metric
that Nike is calling Nike Fuel the
device itself is pretty straightforward
it's a black rubber band with a single
button with the Bank of LEDs as the
primary display a strip of colored
lights let you see how close you are to
hitting your daily goal of accumulating
fuel and when you cross that there's a
nice goal animation with some digital
fireworks the way fuel is calculated is
actually pretty cool the band is able to
recognize specific types of gestures in
motion and then uses that information to
determine the amount of fuel you're
earning using Nikes own algorithms
there's a companion iOS app and web
portal on Nikes website the app syncs
for your Bluetooth which is a big step
up from something like Jawbone's up
Fitness band and it gives you a graph
indicating your progress over the day
week and month a number of different
achievements are also built into the
system so if you meet your daily fuel
goal hit a certain threshold you'll get
a notification with some pretty intense
animations these can all be shared via
Facebook or Twitter as well if that's
your thing the website component pretty
much contains the same content though at
the moment it's not integrated with the
Nike Plus website the company already
maintains well both the app and website
are useful it does definitely feel like
Nike could do a little bit more here and
we're hoping we see some more
sophisticated use of the fuel bands data
and some deeper social networking
integration when the web interface gets
an overhaul this summer there's a fuel
band app coming to Android around the
same time as well using a new metric
that doesn't have the baggage or
something like calories actually makes
the fuel band a lot more fun to use than
competing products is probably not going
to interest hardcore athletes but
there's a much broader possible audience
out there for something like the fuel
band by covering everything from wind
sprints to walking your dog Nike Fuel
allows those that wouldn't necessarily
consider themselves athletic to
participate the fuel band is also in the
cooler watch replaces that we've seen
that said at $149 it's not cheap but if
you're looking for a fun way to
encourage yourself to be more active the
Nike Plus fuel band is definitely worth
a long look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
