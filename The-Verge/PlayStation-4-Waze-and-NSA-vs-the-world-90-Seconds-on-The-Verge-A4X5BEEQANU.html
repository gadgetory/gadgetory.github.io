psyker and just like the Xbox I need to
phone home every 24 hours this is 90
seconds on the verge Sony held its e3
press conference last night and came out
swinging against Microsoft the new
PlayStation 4 will cost three hundred
ninety nine dollars when it debuts this
holiday season Sony made it clear it
would not impose restrictions on use ps4
games nor would it require an online
connection which seems like common sense
but it's not exactly what xbox are doing
google has acquired the traffic mapping
service ways in an effort to stay on top
although the service only boasts 28
million users the deal was apparently
made as a defensive move towards
competitors such as Apple and Facebook
ways uses crowdsourcing to add context
such as information about traffic
accidents construction and even gas
prices these features all sound great
but when will it be able to tell me how
long I can hold and go into the bathroom
on my commute home finally in the shadow
of prism and NSA scandals both tech
companies and Senators alike are looking
for more transparency and less prying
senators Al Franken Ron Wyden and Mike
Lee are just a few of the Senators
proposing a bill that would declassify
both prism and the separate phone
records surveillance program on a
related note google has published an
open letter to Attorney General Eric
Holder and FBI Director Robert Mueller
asking for permission to publish the
aggregated number of national security
requests that received saying quote
google has nothing to hide except for
Google's secret private island of Google
cyber surgery that one's still in beta
and that's it for today's top stories
coming up tomorrow we finally debunk the
rumors that aliens have taken over the
verge
