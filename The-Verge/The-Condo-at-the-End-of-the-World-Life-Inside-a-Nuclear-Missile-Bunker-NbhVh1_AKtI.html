here in the Kansas countryside
underground in a nuclear missile base I
was teaching current events courses at
Topeka West High and I was hearing
people talk about the missile site
Ronald Reagan was president he was
talking about the evil empire I heard a
young father addressing a tremendous
gathering in California I heard him
saying I would rather see my little
girls die now still believing in God
than have them grow up under communism
and one day die no longer believing in
God and I had two young daughters and I
was feeling a bit nervous and so on my
birthday
in 1982 I travelled to discover this
site and and so the Odyssey began
there's two buildings the building here
is the launch service building where the
missile was housed and all of the
equipment to facilitate the launch down
there was the launch control building
where the crew was housed and where all
of the personnel were during a launch my
uncle Forrest died in France in 1945
also another of my uncle's died in World
War two but there was always a sadness
in the family about war about the loss
of life I mean my grandmother grieved
long all the rest of her life for the
loss of two of her sons these kind of
feelings left our family with kind of a
sadness about war and probably turned me
into kind of a hippie peacenik
yeah love is the only engine of survival
the only hope and if we can't get that
right we're in deep trouble
there's a group of people across the
country that are looking for bunkers
looking for hardened structures and I
think it's a symptom of the times and
what's going on the changes that are
happening in our culture 20th century
castles has been in business for close
to 16 years now mainly what they work
with our decommissioned missile bases
and a variety of communication bunkers
we have closed 55 sales of missile bases
over the last about 17 years it's a
pretty interesting niche market that
we've been able to jump into and it's
fun getting to meet different people who
who would live in a place like this this
is a survival condo project we are in
central Kansas it's a project is
designed to house up to 70 people
indefinitely off-grid yeah here's some
of the demolition pictures you know we
have over a year to get all the old
missile debris out of here not the
missile itself but the launch and the
structure that was in there to support
the missile structure took it 275 ton
crane just to pull the old doors off it
feels really good now to transition from
destruction to construction this steel
structure is now in place and they're
starting to put the concrete on the
floors now they built the steel from the
bottom up and they pour the concrete
from the top down when it's all said and
done this is kind of like the structure
what's it it's like a 14-story building
that's underground there's two
configurations you either buy a whole
floor down here you can buy it half for
a half floor is a million and a
full-force two million now this facility
was designed to withstand a direct
nuclear strike and the General
Accounting Office estimated in 2010
dollars to reproduce this concrete
infrastructure would exceed 100
a million dollars I've got 300,000 the
purchase price of this unit insights are
pretty cool these are the air intake and
exhaust valves for the LCC the smaller
the two-story you don't want to bump
your head on that Edie Peyton did it he
had a concussion yeah you hit your head
on that and it's serious
Wow if there was just an energy crisis
or a breakdown in transportation
networks most cities are only supplied
with just a very few days supplies in
the grocery stores if the grocery stores
were empty if the grid went down if the
water was off or contaminated a lot of
people in urban areas would have trouble
surviving just a few weeks and cities
could easily turn into jungles well I
looked at ice core sample records and
you go back and look at 13,000 years ago
which is when we lost the mastodons in
the saber-tooth Tiger that was when we
crossed this classic plane and it's a
it's a region of space that we go
through and if you think of the Milky
Way galaxy is a a pinwheel then if you
get closer to the middle I mean it's
like driving in the country out here
versus driving in New York City I mean
you come into a busier denser region and
what logically would you expect more
meteors more comments to be more cosmic
radiation warmer temperatures global
warming climate change do I think co2
has anything to do with our global
climate change no I don't but do I think
we're having global climate change
absolutely I just disagree on what's
causing I think it's a natural cycle
we're going through we know the
government's broke the government world
governments are broke everywhere the
Europeans are a terrible mess there are
protests growing you know against wall
street the political climate in this
country seems to be at an all-time low
they cannot seem to function together
and so there's this instability we don't
know what's going to happen the food
prices are going higher everything is
becoming more expensive the value of the
dollar is in decline there's a lot of
people with a lot of guns out there what
would it take to get you to do something
illegal possibly immoral or whatever to
go do something to provide for your
family I mean
first I'm gonna want to go get my gun
and go try to you know shoot some birds
or something or live off the land you
know I don't mind doing that I'm my
first thought it's not going to be to go
rob my neighbor you know my first
thoughts going to be but you know what
everyone else is going to be that same
thing there's only so many birds and so
many things and pretty soon pushes it
and come to shove and resources and
become increasingly scarce and your list
of things you won't do is going to get
shorter and shorter
we've got lethal and non-lethal systems
we've got our own remotely piloted
vehicle we have a two-person holding
cell you know we could respond and we
don't have to shoot them we can we can
send out a remotely piloted vehicle go
then fly 5000 feet up and it can fly 100
miles so it can look around and it can
see human size targets on the ground and
it can we can see it in real time if
somebody were more aggressive and trying
to damage the facility and to break in
you know we can put it into that too is
so funny I had a Jewish woman that I was
playing with her blood and she said well
you know I'm old and you know my kids
want me to do this and we're on here but
I'm thinking and I'm just you know let's
be honest here I'm not gonna say I'm two
years into this and I you know what are
you gonna do how are you gonna bury me I
go well we have an incinerator working
at Rich's now I'm Jewish you have to
bury I have to be buried like a well
that's easy we tell you we're going to
bury you then we incinerate you if it's
convenient we can have a nice ceremony
under a tree outside will honor your
wishes but if you're a health hazard
you're starting to decompose down here
and you're stinking up the joint or
we're going to burn you to play a drum
for very long creates entrainment of
heart rates the heart rate will begin to
entrain and we have you know we'll get
20 people drumming and have dancing in
the in the center and have have fun
we're interested in the human spirit
and it's been defined in many many ways
in many different times and in different
places and cultures we're interested in
all of it we we have redone this space
in kind of an eclectic spiritual context
we have a Hindu art Buddhists
native-american pagan Christian and
Islamic prayer rugs so
I'm hopeful that somehow we'll find our
way to a wiser path with our fellow man
on the planet I'm not optimistic but I
am hopeful it always irritates me when
the traditional interviewers asked that
cliche question is so do you think the
world's going to end on December 21st
2012 it's the wrong question to ask I
mean of course I don't believe that's
going to happen the fact that we're
standing here means that this you know
this earth is billions of years old
we've gone through this cycle before and
that evidence is in the ice records it's
in the soil records and stuff so it's
the wrong question the question should
be do you think life is going to get
difficult with the cycle that we're
approaching and that answer is a two
thumbs up I do think it's going to get
very difficult and I think it'd be you
know prudent for people to be prepared
what's it all about how big is it
who are you why are you here on our
journey to wholeness we meet darkness
and fear questioning all the old answer
denying what's too painful to see live
in life of false illusion getting off
track with destiny when the darkness
falls around me I don't think I'll make
it through
when the darkness falls around me I'll
need your light to see me through
we've been about this for a long long
time and it's bigger than we can see
making peace with our darkness
we reclaim our destiny
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
