and I'm here at Maker Faire taking a
look at cast a are a pair of prototype
augmented reality glasses built by a
spin-off of Valve Corporation but today
I'm playing with this infrared wand
picking off blocks from these Jenga like
towers in 3d this is happening right in
front of me on a retro reflective
surface there's a pair of projectors on
these glasses that are sending light
towards the surface the bouncing back
towards each of my eyes happening at 120
Hertz so that it's smooth and fluid in
three dimensions and I can I can just
walk around this and look at it from
different angles because there's
infrared infrared LEDs built into the
surface as well and a camera right on
top of the glasses so it detects exactly
where I am so now we're going to take a
look at a demo of augmented reality with
real world objects I can put in these
little bitty cards in the game and have
them grow up and become Team Fortress 2
characters and now we've got the scout
and the heavy from Team Fortress 2
fighting each other the cards use RFID
chips inside and interact with a coil
beneath the based and so you can tell
when they're on the right position when
they're on the right spot to bring these
characters to life in the virtual world
so here we have a couple of pairs of
these glasses here because we're going
to play a multiplayer game and now we're
going to begin zombie king of the hill
capture the flag
both of us are looking at the
retro-reflective surface simultaneously
but because of the way it reflects the
light we can actually both see
independent images at the same time each
have our own 3d perspective on the game
our objective I think is to try to kill
the zombies and hold on the flag but
pretty sure Jerry just shot me so right
now we've got a very rudimentary retro
reflective surface in front of us it's
held together with tape and it's just a
small small area for a couple people to
have a nice intimate game of capture the
flag King of Hell zombies together but
you can imagine much more grand things
with more players and and and more of
the surface and a higher quality surface
as well if you place the surface on the
walls of a room and brought some friends
over you could have an entire virtual
reality experience around you and every
other wall you look at could be part of
the game as soon as you turn around
technical illusions is targeting a sub
$200 price for the starter kit which
they plan to raise funds for on
Kickstarter starting in late summer and
early fall as you can see it's a fairly
hefty pair of wired PC goggles but
they've got some grand plans down the
road the technical illusions team just
showed me a prototype with B projectors
built into the frames of the glasses and
they'd like to connect it to smartphones
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
