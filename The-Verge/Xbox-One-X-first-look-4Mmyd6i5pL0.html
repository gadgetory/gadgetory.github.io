we're here checking out Microsoft's new
Xbox one X game console now this is the
consumer version of Project Scorpio
Microsoft has been talking about a mid
generation update to the Xbox for a long
time now and essentially the Xbox one X
is that Council it's gonna let you play
games in 4k at 60 frames per second
games like Forza Motorsport 7 for
instance which is coming out in October
right before the council launches in
terms of aesthetics the Xbox one X looks
very much like the Xbox 1s that came out
last summer it's a little bit slimmer
it's the smallest Xbox Microsoft has
ever made but beyond that it's pretty
much the same same controller same ports
it's coming in only black we don't know
if there's going to be more colors yet
but when it launches on November 7th
it's going to have a black only option
and the pricing is $4.99 some players
might think $4.99 is really high and
they're right that's a lot for a game
console it's a hundred more than Sony's
PlayStation 4 pro so pricing is going to
be a huge issue when it comes to which
one of these consoles takes off the rest
