Francisco where Google just announced
Android TV it's a big update to the
long-standing Google TV platform it's
basically part of their initiative to
have Android everywhere and it starts
off with a TV interface and a remote app
on their phone which is the basic you
know d-pad controls and along with that
there's a new gamepad controller because
Android is showing off lots of games in
the TV so with this you can go across
the dinner face at the top it has
suggestions for content that you may
want to watch or view from Google Play
TV YouTube Travel Channel other options
like that and if you move down you can
see all the apps that have installed you
can use the Google Play Store to add
more but it has your typical options
like Netflix YouTube Showtime as well as
other things like 24 which they showed
off on stage and there's a special link
for Google Play games the games are
broken out into a separate category down
here you can see all the games installed
the TV and jump into the most recently
play games here the TV box itself that's
running is a reference platform that
Google built specifically to let
developers start program with the
Android TV and the controller is the
same deal and that's basically it for
Android TV all in all it seems like this
is probably Google's best effort yet at
building a TV interface that people will
want to use and it seems like it might
actually be a good way to you know bring
casual gaming to the big screen in your
living room as well certainly a better
effort than Google TV we've seen thus
far and given Google's success with
chromecast over the last year this could
be you know their next big thing
