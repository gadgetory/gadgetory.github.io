Eva 2013 in Berlin and we're taking a
look at the Galaxy Note 3 as you've been
introduced it's a new 5.7 inch device
from Samsung it has a 13 megapixel
camera on the back and this only back
cover it's a four leather cover it's
still removable as previously and it
still actually brought a plasticy if you
take a look at it but it has a much
nicer looking few on the back it has
this stitch look also if you look at the
sides samsung has gone for this metallic
look again it's plastic but it's made to
look like metal and has these little
notches in it that try to make it
emulate the pages of a notebook so
something is going for much classier
look this is a bigger device 5.7 inches
Full HD Super AMOLED display but it is
lighter and it is thinner than the
previous Galaxy Note it comes with a
quad-core processor is going to be
either from Kokomo Samsung depending on
market and the big focus as usual with
galaxy notes is the s-pen this is a
brand new s-pen it's now actually
symmetrical so you can get it into its
silo in whatever fashion you prefer
which is my a nice little tweak one
other good thing is that the new s-pen
works just as you might expect good it
also works with S pen's from the galaxy
note or galaxy note 2 so if you have old
ones they're still just compatible the
key thing with these devices is they
have a set of button on them and you can
activate a menu when you hover on the
screen and press down on the button you
get this brand new menu and these are
the this is called air commands
that's what something's calling it and
these are some of the most commonly
accessed features one is an action memo
then you have a scrapbooker screen right
s finder and pen window I'll show you
pen window right now this essentially
lets you throw a little space onto the
screen and then select one of its a
limited set of applications but one of
these sort of small apps so for example
if you want to watch to YouTube and this
hovers above everything else that you're
doing
you can minimize the tea up into this
little circular window which is pretty
quite key again the hovers above
everything you're doing you can maximize
it take up the full screen you can run
multiple instances of these apps so
again if I go into a command and window
and I can have another rep so for
example if I want the calculator I can
have that up so the multi window feature
works pretty much like has done on the
previous Galaxy Note devices with a big
difference being the fact again that you
can have two instances of the same app
running at the same time and Samsung is
also saying that they have a wider range
of applications that are compatible with
the feature so things like chat on
internet browser maps YouTube video
player etc so this is a first look at
the Galaxy Note 3 this device is coming
to all US carriers AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile Verizon
Sprint u.s. seller they were going to
get it sometime very soon as I say
you'll have pokum and Samsung post
eruptions depending on the market event
on the carrier and that's it myself
