with the new TV app on the Apple TV so
this is just regular fourth generation
Apple TV you know you love it but what's
new is this new app which is just called
TV so if I bring out to the home screen
here you can see it's right there it's
called TV I can go select it I open it
and what it really is is kind of a new
home screen for all of the video apps
you have on it on the Apple TV so if
you've got Showtime HBO Fox all that
stuff on here it's going to start
showing you the content that is inside
of those apps so you can jump right into
it so I can hit Modern Family it's going
to show me the modern family page it's
gonna say it's available on Hulu who's
on this one I can hit play it's going to
switch me over to Hulu and start playing
it right away what's interesting here is
that I'm in the Hulu app so if I hit
menu I get dropped back into Hulu not
the TV app but Apple has remapped this
button the home button on the Apple TV
remote so if I hit that instead of going
to the home screen I go back to the TV
app to where I was so all of these apps
are on this thing there's also a store
page in here so I can go over here hit
store it's going to show me a bunch of
the other apps I have available if I
have a TV provider like Comcast or Time
Warner or Verizon I can pick all of
these apps that are supported by those
TV providers there's also now single
sign-on the Apple TV so if I open the
ane app here and hit install and then go
and sign on to the a any app that
sign-on credential my Comcast
grandchildren Verizon credential is
going to be carried over to all of the
other apps that are supported by that
cable provider so really what Apple is
doing is its reacting all the content
from your cable subscription apps from
your other subscription apps like HBO
now and showing you the content inside
of those apps in kind of this new home
screen format but when you start to
watch it you still have to jump into
another app it's a little bit messy kind
of feels like you should be able to
watch everything inside of here but this
is where Apple is right now now there's
one huge important caveat here I don't
know if you've noticed it none of this
stuff is Netflix content as far as we
know right now Netflix is not partnering
with Apple to put their stuff in here
but Apple tells me very confidently
they're working
to add new partners all the time
hopefully Netflix will be here Netflix
is of course a Maine Apple TV app so you
can just go download a Netflix app there
it is right there but it is not included
in the new TV app so that's new TV app
it's a really interesting way to kind of
find content and see content much more
interesting Lee series also been
expanded a little bit so you can ask it
to just play the game it'll play live TV
it'll find more stuff but the big news
here is the new TV app which lets you
find things a little bit more easily
than before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
