other cause in the United States because
it's the best lover we've seen for
giving every child in America a chance
to make the most of their lives some of
the work we found is focused solely on
United States students and teachers but
a core piece of it online courses will
be a global asset available to anyone
with a smartphone or tablet availability
of the world's best teacher who can
connect up and see where you're stuck
and give you some advice we're not there
yet 15 years ago we were just sticking
cameras in front of people and putting
online and saying okay isn't that the
solution now people like Khan Academy
and hundreds of others have said ok the
lecture piece is part of it but
interactive problem sets and having your
coach see what it is and understanding
the nature of what you might be confused
and so the view is that over the next 15
years that type of material will be
wildly better than even the best is
today and it will be available through
phones and tablets in a free form
through anyone who's got that internet
connection there is one major caveat
here not everyone will be able to reap
the benefit of this progress until we
close the gender gap in Africa women are
24% less likely than men to own a cell
phone in Asia it's 37 percent education
is a great leveler but if the factors
that hold girls back are not addressed
and have access to education isn't equal
then it can become a cause of inequity
rather than a cure for it this is
particularly important because when a
woman gets an education it has a
powerful ripple effect as an adult she
earns more money she has children
they'll be more likely to live past the
age of five her daughters will be twice
as likely to go to school themselves
there's no way to get around the fact
that more girls need to be in good
schools for longer the online education
will open up new opportunities for girls
with the means and motivation to take
advantage of it primary school enrolment
secondary school enrolment 15 years ago
versus today countries are making a lot
of progress on this
the idea that parents should not keep
the girl in the house should let her go
out to primary school that's broadly
accepted now we need to get there for
secondary school in the United States
now Business School medical school you
know male-female ratios are actually
some cases favoring the women it's still
the sciences particularly the very hard
sciences and particularly you should get
up to the PhD level where we still have
this huge gender imbalance it's a very
cultural thing each country may have
slightly different tactics of how they
get the parents mindset about the
investment in both boys and girls or you
know equally valuable equally important
as technology drives down the cost of
quality education more and more people
have access to the tools they need to
take control of their future anywhere in
the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
