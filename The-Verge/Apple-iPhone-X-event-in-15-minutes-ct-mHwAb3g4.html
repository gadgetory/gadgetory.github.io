first to welcome you to the Steve Jobs
theater there's not a day that goes by
that we don't think about him Steve's
spirit and timeless philosophy on life
will always be the DNA of Apple we
dedicate this theater to Steve because
we loved him and because he loved days
like this now let me tell you a little
bit about our new home
Apple Park has been built to reflect
apples values for both technology and
the environment
it's powered by a hundred percent
renewable energy we have one of the
world's largest on-site solar
installations right here we've got a
great visitor center which will be open
later this year where we will welcome
everyone you'll also find a fantastic
new Apple Retail Store so before we get
to some incredible products we'd like to
give you an update on retail we've
launched today at Apple we've created
new programs like photo walks where
customers can perfect their photography
skills with features like portrait mode
or swiftrage where the next generation
active ella purrs can begin to learn the
basics of coding and one of my personal
favorites teachers Tuesdays where our
teams help local educators stay updated
on the newest technologies and apps and
I'm thrilled to personally announce the
opening of our newest flagship store in
the heart of the Midwest Apple Michigan
Avenue in Chicago on October 20th
introducing Apple watch Series 3 and it
has cellular built-in you can receive an
important call with just your watch and
and the number is the same number as
your iPhone and third-party apps like
WeChat work over cellular as well
Cellular is going to change the way we
listen to music because with Apple watch
series 3 and Apple music you can stream
40 million songs on your
inside is a new dual-core processor
delivering up to 70% more performance
and thanks to the new processor for the
first time on Apple watch Siri can talk
for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity we
developed a custom wireless chip we call
w2 it delivers up to 85 percent faster
Wi-Fi and we've added a barometric
altimeter so now you get flights of
stairs climbed and elevation gains after
a workout Series 3 comes in a wide
variety of cases and bands we're excited
to introduce a new band we call the
sport loop we have two versions of
series 3 there's one with cellular at
399 and a version without cellular that
has all the other great features at just
329 and we're gonna keep series 1 in the
line at a new starting price of 249
orders will begin September 15th and
availability will be September 22nd
that's the update on Apple watch and now
back to Tim I am so excited to introduce
Apple TV 4k but resolution isn't
everything there's an even bigger
advancement that's more important and
it's called high dynamic range we've got
the powerful a 10x fusion chip this is
the same chip that's in our iPad pro and
the new Apple TV isn't just slightly
faster it's remarkably faster CPU
performance is more than twice as fast
as the current Apple TV and graphics are
more than four times faster now you'll
have the biggest releases in the best
picture quality all on iTunes all
available for the same price as HD new
Apple TV 4k starts at $179 it joins the
existing one you can order it starting
on September 15th and it ships just a
week later we have huge iPhone news for
you today and it gets started right now
I am so excited to tell you all about
the new iPhone 8 and the new iPhone 8
plus the design is all new there's glass
in both the front in the back
we're so excited because this glass is
the most durable ever in a smart phone
iPhone 8 and 8 plus it's also
microscopically sealed for water and
dust resistance and they have a new
Retina
HD display in each model there's a 4.7
inch Retina display in iPhone 8 and a
5.5 inch and iPhone 8 plus built in our
3d touch technology into the display and
for the first time an iPhone display it
is our true tone technology along with
the displays iPhone 8 and 8 plus have
new stereo speakers as well the 25%
louder than the speakers in iphone 7 and
they have a deeper bass inside iphone 8
and 8 plus is a brand new chip we call
it a 11 Bionic this is the most powerful
and smartest chip ever in a smartphone
the 64-bit design 4.3 billion
transistors six core they're managed by
our second-generation performance
controller that now can use all six
cores at once it can deliver up to 70
percent improvement in multi-threaded
workloads and they have our first ever
Apple design graphics processing unit or
GPU it's 30% faster than the graphics in
the previous 810 this more to it
the 11 viana concludes our first new
generation image signal processor or isp
the delivers faster autofocus in
low-light as new pixel processing for
sharpness and texture and for the first
time to help reduce noise it is Hardware
enabled multiband noise reduction all
this helps to improve performance and
helps us take better pictures is an
all-new 12 megapixel sensor it's larger
and faster it provides 83% more light
and it provides more it's more power
efficient at the same time this is
deeper pixels and a new color filter so
this adds up to having better color
saturation a wider dynamic range of
color and lower noise in your photos and
videos I Phone 8 plus has two new
sensors in its dual camera the
wide-angle camera is an F 1.8 aperture
and optical image stabilization the
telephoto camera has F 2.8 aperture
using the new dual cameras in a 11
Bionic chip and the iPhone 8 plus team
has come up with a new feature called
portrait lighting
this is beta but it will ship with the
iPhone 8 plus and here's how it works
you can pose a photo in the camera app
using the portrait mode they create a
depth map they separate the subject from
the background and then you see machine
learning it creates facial landmarks and
actually changes the lighting of the
contours over your face that happens
while you're composing the shot right
when you're in the camera app you use
portrait mode and there's a new menu to
select the lighting effect you want to
use you just swipe to pick a different
effect in fact you can go in later after
shot a portrait mode photo into the
Photos app and change the lighting
effect to select which one you want to
use on your photograph iPhone 8 at the
highest quality video capture ever in a
smart phone along with the isp we have
an apple design video encoder this
enables faster frame rates and higher
quality video it does real-time image
and motion analysis to predict changes
in the content and optimize the video
encoding algorithms now you can shoot a
1080p HD 240 frames a second but there's
a third category of use of the camera
that's going to become increasingly
important in our mobile devices and
that's augmented reality we custom tune
each iPhone for augmented reality an AR
greatly benefits from the new a 11
Bionic chip so here's one example from
Major League Baseball's advanced media
team they're enhancing the at bat app
with AR kit so that when you're at the
game you can hold up your iPhone and see
real-time player information and stats
on top of the game you're watching now
let's talk about Wireless it supports
LTE advanced for fast networking
connections bluetooth 5.0 for the latest
accessories
of course it supports our great beloved
air pods and the beats X headphones that
use our w1 chip and now with iPhone 8
with its glass back we're enabling the
freedom of wireless charging
what makes this possible as we're
building into iPhone 8 and 8 plus
wireless charging with Qi many
restaurants shops airports cars have
started to build and support for qi
wireless charging many companies are
offering qi chargers and those that are
chief certified should all
with iPhone 8 now iphone 7 came in these
three configurations starting at 32
gigabytes will really happen to iPhone 8
it's gonna start with twice the capacity
at 64 gigabytes and have a second one at
256 gigabytes the price will be six
hundred and ninety nine dollars iPhone 8
plus will have the same two
configurations and it will be priced
starting at $799 we'll be able to
pre-order them starting this Friday on
September 15 and to be available a week
later on September 22nd and we can all
upgrade to iOS 11 starting on September
19th our teams have been hard at work
for years on something that is important
to all of us the future of the
smartphone this is iPhone 10 it is the
biggest leap forward since the original
iPhone and it is all screen it is
beautiful to look at it is incredible to
hold the display fits edge to edge top
to bottom it has glass on both the front
in the back using the same super strong
formula as iPhone 8 the beam is made
from a surgical grade stainless steel
but both durable and polishes through a
beautiful finish it's engineered to be
water and dust resistant at a
microscopic level comes in two beautiful
finishes space grey and silver iPhone 10
has an all-new display it's called a
super Retina display the super Retina
display is five point eight inches on
the diagonals guts
24:36 by 1125 resolution is 458 pixels
per inch now this is the highest
resolution in pixel density ever in an
iphone this is the first OLED display
great enough to be in an iPhone in
addition the new super Retina display
supports HDR in both the Dolby vision
and HDR 10 formats it has an incredible
a million to 1 contrast ratio it is the
best color accuracy it integrates our
unique 3d touch technology right into
the display unlike iphone 8 includes
true tone how do you wake up your iPhone
10 well certainly you can raise to wake
just like before but now you can also
just tap on the screen and it wakes up
now with the display going edge to edge
and top to bottom
there's no more home button so now you
want to go to the home screen simply
swipe up from the bottom you go home
you're running an app like Mayo and you
want to go home
it's simply swipe up from the bottom you
go home now the same fluid gesture also
works for multi task so if you're in an
app and you want a multi task swipe up
from the bottom you pause for split
second and you're in multi tasking you
can just speak to your phone as before
and say hey Siri or you can now press
the side button in which has been made
larger once you press it in you can just
talk to Siri how do you unlock your
phone with iPhone 10 and 10 your iPhone
is locked until you look at it and it
recognizes you we call this base ID to
make face ID possible took some of the
most advanced technology we have ever
created we call this the true depth
camera system there's an infrared camera
a flood illuminator the front side
camera and a dot projector is also the
proximity sensor the ambient light
sensor the speaker microphone
every time you glance at your iPhone 10
it detects your face the flood and
illuminator even in the dark
we built Apple's first-ever neural ng
the neural engine is a state-of-the-art
ultra-fast processing system it uses our
highest density computing ever base ID
learns your face even if you change your
hairstyle you decide to put on glasses
you're wearing a hat and it adapts to
you as your face changes over time and
the team's worked hard make sure the
face ID Kimmy's gonna be spooked by
things like photographs he's even gone
and worked with professional mask makers
and makeup artist in Hollywood to
protect against these attempts to beat
face ID the chance that a random person
in the population could look at your
iPhone 10 and unlock it with their face
is about one in a million
face ID also works with Apple pay base
ID also works with third-party apps so
apps like mint 1password eat ray will
all work with face IDs so our team
created something called in
these are emojis that you control with
your face the way you create and share
an emoji are right from within Apple
messages you said and literally where
are you iPhone 10 has dual what 12
megapixel sensors dual cameras both a
faster sensors wider sensors just like
in iphone a does new color filters
through deeper pixels is an F 1.8
aperture on the wide-angle camera and a
faster F 2.4 aperture on a telephoto
that lets in 36 percent more light to
the telephoto camera the big news on the
camera the iPhone 10 is it as dual
optical image stabilization with
compensating for handshake and to take
better photos and videos in low-light
it's also a better quad LED two-tone
flash that has twice the uniformity of
light on our subjects iPhone 10 you get
great portrait modes especially in lower
light an iPhone 10 supports the
brand-new portrait lighting feature as
well as now with selfies can take
portrait mode photos as well and it also
supports portrait lighting all through
the front side to depth camera it is
cheap charging through the glass back
and it will work with the Qi charging
devices like the ones we mentioned
earlier from both V and Belkin the mat
that you place your iPhone 8 or iPhone
10 down place your Series 3 Apple watch
down on it you can place your ear pods
or the optional new wireless charging
case on it and it starts to charge as
well we call it air power so look for
the air power charger next year
iPhone 10 also comes in two
configurations 64 gigs and 256 gigabytes
we priced $9.99 can order it starting on
October 27 and begin to ship on November
third we work really hard at Apple to
create wonderful thing
and we hope you love what we've
introduced</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
