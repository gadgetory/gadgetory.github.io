IRS has made its decision because hey
they just want to text something on the
adrianne jeffries and this is 90 seconds
on the verge after previously saying it
was unsure how to tax Bitcoin the IRS
this week decreed that virtual
currencies will be treated as property
and taxed accordingly ultimately any
income earned due to Bitcoin increasing
in value will be taxed much like stocks
and bonds likewise losses can be
deducted if bitcoin loses value Bitcoin
and other similar virtual currencies act
much like digital cash using
cryptography to control the transfer and
creation of money however bitcoin is
proven to be very volatile so far going
from 100 US dollars last June all the
way up to a thousand dollars this past
January while this IRS ruling does
legitimize virtual currency as a real
financial assets it's a far cry from
being a replacement for cash the IRS
acknowledges that Bitcoin can and does
it times operate like quote real
currency but also notes that no country
or jurisdiction currently accepts
virtual currency as legal tender now
although bitcoin is the largest and most
well-known cryptocurrency it's certainly
not the only virtual currency being used
in the real world members of the reddit
sub-community dogecoin which dedicates
itself to the cryptocurrency based on a
popular internet meme pool of money
together to sponsor a NASCAR driver Josh
wise a previously sponsor lyst driver
after less than a week the group
surpassed its goal raising almost 45
thousand dollars in the virtual currency
for more about virtual currencies check
out the verge calm coming up next I
purchase my very first dogecoin can I
get a receipt please</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
