today so far and I've been stopped at
least 100 times probably okay i know
that perfect is my sister was counting
repop to run 12 events you know in the
pop culture space but New York comic-con
is the biggest most exciting it was the
first event we launched and sort of the
closest to our heart we are the second
largest avenged in New York City it's
the new york marathon and us this year
will be about a hundred and seventeen
thousand people which is insane I've
been coming since 2006 I was a little
embarrassed at first I came in regular
street clothes then I just started
getting a little courage coming in dress
we have a mutual acquaintance and we met
through Facebook just so many
similarities right between the two of us
once we were getting to know each other
it was he just decided you know that you
wanted to meet up with me and here we
are I've been going to Comic Cons since
2003 and I've never been to one as my
real self I've always cosplay he would
show up in like shorts and a tank top if
you work for Goldman Sachs you know
you're coming to the con you know to a
certain percentage of the population you
gotta dress up or you just you're not
living it man my name is Vanessa Peng
I'm a mechanical angel I wanted to do
something that was like Steam put but
mechanical but like a serial like an
easel I've to Anna Oswald from the new
doctor who and we have here one of those
nasty dollar each Germany you think
they're really cool they're robots that
kill people I'm here looking to make the
boy on oh sorry they're octopus people
in costume you can actually be whoever
you want well in real life you're pretty
much born
do this outside like people just give
you exchange this but in here you're who
you are you're in costume it's almost
empowering everybody wears masks every
day let's let's let's be honest but here
I'm wearing a mask and people are
recognizing it and people having fun
with it and they're enjoying themselves
because of me and I'm enjoying myself
watching them enjoy me and I'm watching
them enjoy their costumes it's it's a
big community right and like any
community you get to know people over
time to get close to them I like to wear
women's clothes but it's today I could
do it without being hassled you could be
whoever you want to be it's wonderful
there's actually our first year yeah we
saw the confidence level just like shut
up yeah we assimilated sense like
talking to the pictures with people I
don't even wanna yes people always ask
us befitted yeah oh my God look at iron
man made out of boxes i'm sarah and i'm
casey and we are captain america and
Carter Peggy Peggy Carter we have an
infinity for couple costumes we're
actually cosplaying as Amy and Rory
separately and met at a convention it's
not unanimous will you do like can come
to an agreement eventually like I'll be
like I really want to do this character
and he's like
I really want to do that yeah like I
really wanted to do a shredder costume
but she's like april O'Neil know so you
know yeah I like to have a weapon
everyone is a people watcher so everyone
is staring and everyone else constantly
and it's perfectly acceptable because
you're just admiring the costumes I love
people watching I love seeing the love
of either anime or science fiction or
anybody's character you can tell how
much heart these people put into it it's
a fun place where you're going to see
something new every second and you're
going to enjoy yourself we kind of share
the same philosophy that cosplayers we
all are part of a universal family and
we try to lift each other up no one has
as you know involved is you you could be
whoever you want to be it's wonderful i
love i love coming here it's pure and
utter joy this is my Super Bowl</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
