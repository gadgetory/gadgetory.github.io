this is a robot a robot vacuum cleaner
what is better than that and this is a
vacuum I push around like a capable
human being yeah but this one makes my
life so much better because tech and
this one is a fraction of the price of
that one and it also has basic vacuum
stuff like a hose which one should you
get first the Roomba the Roomba has a
bunch of tech inside of it including
wall sensors and an infrared receiver
but basically let it size up a room and
chart its own path for cleaning even if
there are obstacles in the way that
sounds a little complicated you know
what I do it this one I push it and I
avoid walls and furniture using my own
eyeballs
yeah but the best part about a Roomba is
that it's a robot you don't have to do
anything you just set it on a schedule
and then when you're at work you're out
with the kids or whatever you're doing
the Roomba does all the cleaning for you
does it go upstairs it does not do that
so how do you clean multiple levels of
your house well you just you just pick
it up and set it up upstairs or you do
get another Roomba wait
get another one how much does it cost
okay rubus can be a little bit expensive
this one the roomba 790 can be found
online right now for around $500 but
some of the more high-end models like
the new one with Wi-Fi can cost as much
as $900 that's a lot of money do you
know how much of this one cost your
basic run-of-the-mill dyson dc33 $250
yes but does it come with a remote the
Roomba has a remote okay so there's no
remote with this Dyson but I'm willing
to bet that my dustbin is bigger than
yours this holds 2.3 liters of dirt and
dust what does that hold six point is a
little bit smaller but it's really easy
to remove and dump which I'm guessing
yours isn't also the battery never runs
out of this because it's plugged into
the wall
don't you have to charge the Roomba yeah
but it finds its way back of the
charging dock by itself
when it's finished cleaning also it
makes this triumphant little Berber
brother Cooper noise when it's done
cleaning which frankly is just adorable
and I still don't understand how you
clean messes or get into small corners
with a room but oh it has a spot
cleaning mode and you just press a
button on the top here and it will spot
clean for you let me ask you a question
when's the last time you actually
vacuumed I vacuumed a fair amount I mean
I like unless I forget Aurum we're
kidding your grocery shopping and all it
but I mean I I mean I I vacuumed right
right exactly
also this thing is great if you have
pets do you have pets you look like you
maybe have a lot of cats I actually do
have a pet and you know what I can do
with the Dyson I can vacuum pet hair off
of the couch or I can clean in small
corners or I can vacuum the curtains I
mean if you have vacuumed the curtains
with a Roomba oh yeah well people name
their Roombas we they love their Roomba
so much they actually give them
nicknames like this one is named Truman
after the Truman Show what do you call
that thing a Dyson because I'm a
grown-up
look Roombas are great there's a reason
why people love them myself included I
mean aside from the fact that they're so
expensive you kind of wish it would go
to the fridge and get a beer for you
they're pretty cool technology they run
on their own you never have to push a
vacuum around yourself they keep the
floors and the carpets clean with the
push of a button or with a remote or
through an app if you can afford it I
highly recommend it okay I have to admit
room bows are pretty cool but just know
that they're not going to do everything
most people I know who have a robot
vacuum cleaner end up buying either a
second vacuum or a pretty powerful dust
buster just to get in corners and
putting couches and curtains and other
things that a Roomba just won't do so I
would just keep that in mind before you
spend that much money on a robot vacuum
cleaner also did I mention it's adorable
