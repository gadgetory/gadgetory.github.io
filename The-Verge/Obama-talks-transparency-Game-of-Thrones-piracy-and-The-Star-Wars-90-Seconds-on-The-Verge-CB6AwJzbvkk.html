President Obama announced for reforms he
says will increase transparency and
public awareness of the surveillance
programs being carried out by the NSA
and other US intelligence agencies those
reforms include amendments to the
Patriot Act and more public advocacy in
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Court the president also said that while
critics of surveillance are patriots he
doesn't believe Snowden himself is he
does say however that quote the leaks
triggered a rapid and more passionate
response and would have been the case
otherwise Game of Thrones may have been
the most pirated show of last year but
that's not upsetting the people who
bankroll it Time Warner CEO Jeff bukas
whose company owns HBO says that
pirating the mega-hit show only helps
spread word of mouth something he
believes has helped the show greatly
even when as far as saying that being
the most pirated show is better than
winning an Emmy although we at the
virtual prefer an Emmy over you guys
pirating 90 seconds and finally no this
is not your grandma mispronouncing it a
tissue comic book adaptation of George
Lucas's original the Star Wars is coming
