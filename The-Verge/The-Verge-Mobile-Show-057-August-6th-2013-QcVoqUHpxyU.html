the verge mobile show I'm dieter bohn
and forth at seven i'm dan seifert and i
am chris sigler and i have my phone
vibrating like a maniac right now this
is episode 57 yeah i blame chris
everything is chris's fault strom Chris
and I have been trolling each other all
morning it's hard to say who won uh I
mean I feel like I came out on top given
that I have fifteen dollars in my bank
you have the night how did this happen
how did you end up with fifteen dollars
or no he missed here no reason it made
no sense chris has been a cheapskate on
refusing to purchase something that
would make all of our lives better and
easier for a very long time and so I
just sent him the money to make him do
it and now instead of actually using it
to buy the thing that I told him to buy
he instead of buying Zima with let but
but let's really break this down either
because what actually happened was you
said why don't you just get skype out
like a normal person I shook hands show
of hands who on this on this hangout has
skype out as this guy bad subscription
yeah that's what I thought yeah I do
raise the roof okay i didn't i'm just
letting Chris we just hand up like this
like it was with me he's me like I had
put like 20 bucks into skype like a year
ago and I still have got like 11 of it
left so it's like you do it once and
then you just got that money to be able
to call a regular phone number from
skype if you need to well now I need to
figure out what other things I'm missing
in my life that would make your life
easier that I can get you to pay for
gonna bet a subscription here or just
skype credit Chris you just gotta like
grow your hair out to be like hobo
length we're just like dieter can't take
it anymore and then i'll send you money
to go get a haircut I mean this whole
thing is necessary because skype even on
LTE in San Francisco I just can't seem
to get a decent connection on a phone
with it and I know there are hundreds of
thousands of people that have no problem
with it but for some reason it's just
the worst for me
and even the new client which they fixed
they added a proper sign out option at
the top level used to be buried in like
15 menus and it was ridiculous I still
have problems with it so I don't know I
just need people to call me on my phone
and why do i do I want to use like
normal like you could place phone calls
from google google hangouts now right
you can't leave it everybody hates
google hangouts except for us on the
verge bubble show nobody ever wants to
use another Cod guys but I mean like
even if even if someone needed to call
you instead of like Chris using skype
out to place a phone call you can just
use Google to call your phone number yes
he could and then that would involve
getting people that don't want to want
that wanted me on the conference call to
be at Google instead of so what he needs
to do is he need use Google to calm with
Julian us all from google to sky
described if anybody is listening this I
just want you guys to know how screwed
up in difficult conference calling still
is in 2013 yeah unbelievable there's a
lot of stain on you made by somebody I
don't know who somebody is going to
solve all of the telecommuting problems
that exist in the world and make
billions and billions of dollars it
might recruit me because those guys have
a really nice me look messaging
application the solution is there it's
beige suit videos its web arts illusion
that like the solution exists for
browser browse or communication and
someone who gives needs to monetize a
decent version of it that works really
well for cops yes than the mention of
teleconferencing that Chris dropped I
have to say I'm reminded of actually
doing that nokia's headquarters in
London this one time in like twenty ten
way back in a day and those guys do not
mess about with their teleconferencing
they have enormous like 50 inch flat
screen displays three of them one next
to the other on a wall and then you sit
around them and then I have a massive
American record and webcams cameras
pointed at you and every one of those
displays turns into
person over in housing key could then
does the briefing for you so you have
these three people on three massive
displays and then you have various
cameras pointed at journalists and it's
just completely unnerving is completely
like a scene out of a James Bond film
can we get that how do we how do we get
that well again like I said lost the
mouse fiction has the thing feat of boat
cruise subscribe credit but nobody has
yet seem to found the money to buy me
that samsung oled wraparound display
that I've been asking for dieter get to
it man yeah i mean i have no version
yahoo here in a better it's it's
unbranded i'm having the worst and
accessories on the planet i don't
understand what the deal is sounds like
Chris's bro we should talk about phones
uh because what the hell moto X we
finally wall the wall moto x forever it
feels like feels like there's nothing
left to say about the Moto X other than
like I don't know what is it getting
released what's the release date yes
sometimes it's do you guys even okay I I
do yeah hey goodbye one yeah I think so
I'm more excited than I thought I would
be about the customization program like
I'm kind of looking forward to just
making the phone that I want and it's
not say will be my primary phone but
here's the problem that you're going to
have chris is you're going to be
customizing the phone that you quote
want and then you'll get to I don't want
18t scrap and i want android 4.3 and
you're gonna hit a brick wall yes yeah
that's that's a good point that's a very
good point so the thing with the Moto X
surgeons rupture then I'll be brief I
mean for number one Europe is getting
ignored and this is all we know is the
u.s. situation and there's a whole bunch
of us patriotism going on because it's a
assembled I believe in the u.s. designed
engineered and assembled I think debbie
p has put it really well it's like of
the four steps design engineering is 12
assembly is a full step all of those of
them in the US and then the parts and
manufactures step 3 over in China I
think so yeah I mean customization is
appealing yes I'm sure if I was an
American I would like to support some
local industry so that also appeals but
the price point just seems wrong for me
with this oil let's let's at least talk
about what the device is uh you know we
we had the announcement last week we had
a review go up yesterday um it for all
intents and purposes it's a really solid
phone or a view it's very positive Josh
reviewed it for us and you know he liked
the build quality of it the design of it
the screen is you know not something
that is bad which is usually the case
with Motorola phone so that's not a
hindrance its performance is just as
fine as you'd get with most other
high-end phones so that's not holding it
back there's really nothing terribly bad
that you can say about the phone at
least the impression that I got though
was that there's nothing like really
great that you can say about it either
um and Vlad mentioned the price point
it's priced at 199 on contract I mean
it's same price that you're going to
really a design story right yeah yeah
yeah so it's a very different industrial
design for them I suppose it's different
in the US right and unless we're seeing
in the droids which are sharp and hard
and rough and stuff like that but i
think you know in other other markets or
even in other carriers the motorolas
design sense has been softer and more
toned down it's just not as it's just
mostly more dramatic than on or this is
more dramatic than we've seen in the
past so yeah there's that some extent um
but at least in my opinion the whereas a
lot of people have been building this up
as like a comeback to Motorola you know
that it's going to have a lot of design
and finish innovations and its
smartphone innovations I feel like the
Moto X is more to get Motorola back in
the good graces of US carriers and back
in the minds of consumers than anything
else especially since it's going to be
on all
for carriers which I can't think of any
motorola since the razor the flip razor
that was able to achieve that that feat
ah dude the galaxy s2 none of the
motorola specifically oh I'm motorola
yeah so so I think that and and for that
purpose that I think the more so far
it's accomplished its goal but as far as
being like a groundbreaking smartphone I
don't know if it's don't think its wings
know it category categorically isn't
groundbreaking and let us against the
tinge of disappointment that I have
because this is the first real product
of the google motorola partnership and
the point of those mighty is that sorry
just very brief with you two um what is
making about price point was when you
have customization physical design
customization that's usually an
appealing point for a lower price
product you know that that's the sort of
thing you get why lower price well like
i said at least typically it's being a
way to give you an extra appeal because
it's superficial I mean let's face it
just superficial tweak I hear you but I
think that what what Motorola is
recognizing with this product and I
frankly I tend to agree is that we've
hit we've hit this this brick wall with
specs we're with the exception of
outliers like blooming at 10 20 there
really isn't that much you know what
everybody is flush with ridiculous
processors two gig of ram 4.72 5-inch
1080p displays Moto X accepted and and
so you know this this kind of
customization is very very unique not
just for smartphones but for consumer
electronics in general and it's like
this final I think in some respects is
like this final frontier that Motorola
is exploring here we're like you know
we've we've hit the wall the specs we've
hit the wall with software you know that
they can't think you know they can't
really go much further further than 4.2
there's nothing 4.3 that said that is
that intriguing so they're they're
turning 22 this direct ship
customization and I think it's a great
innovation I mean I still have to play
with the phone maybe it sucks but but
you know we gave it an 8 and I certainly
trust Josh's instinct on this stuff so I
think it's pretty good fun I mean with
regards to the design of the device it's
it doesn't look like it's groundbreaking
or anything like that but it if there's
one thing to give motorola credit on is
that it is it's got that big 4.7 inch
screen which has been very popular on
android devices but it is significantly
smaller in size than the competition
it's smaller than HTC One and it's
smaller than the galaxy s4 so it's it's
a motorola was able to put that big
screen on there it kept the the border
and the bezels around the screen really
thin and then there's not a whole lot of
stuff going on above and below the
screen so it's a much more much easier
device to use in one hand much closer to
like what you get with an iphone 5 as
far as one-handed experience which is
something that we've been asking for
forever and it's and it's this isn't in
a quote mini version that's got dumb
down specs and dumped down features this
is Motorola's flagship so so I mean we
have to I think they're due credit for
that as well well you raise a good point
Vlad would you take this or the the one
mini because you need one mini yeah
really although I will take the first
above all of them really yeah I think
you were inside me you know what here is
the point the first has stopped google
as an option on the freaking phone but
survived another following let me hold
out of my little bone I open up the box
I get around mess around with the
settings and then I have stuck android
buy a stock android 4.1 which is now two
generations old and with no i updated
why okay i need to credit Brian plug
from an emetic for this because it's we
did the idea first and he's a hundred
percent right why does google's official
own brand phone because Motorola is
Google's own brands smartphone why does
it need a google play edition this is
the thing I don't understand I may be
the purest distillation for Android
physically any software should be like
you should set the bar for everybody
else is either
goes back to the thing that motorola and
google have been saying all along and
that they're separate entities and the
left hand doesn't speak to the right
hand which maybe that's good no I'm not
saying that's good I'm not saying that's
what it should be but I think that's the
answer why um not that I fully believe
that that's the case either i'm sure
there is more crosstalk between the
companies and google is willing to admit
but I I think that would be the
explanation for why this is launching
with what's not especially stock Android
the other thing that you can look at is
that the carriers are going to get in
there and muck it up and customize it
for their own versions and that no
longer makes a stock Android either my
sad thanks for the US but we might have
had a show over here in Europe I would
be shocked if Motorola didn't release a
very similar product in Europe in the
near future it might not have all the
customization features as far as the
color customizations and things like
that but to and I mean that's again
that's the differentiator for them and
if they you know that's why it sucks to
not be on AT&amp;amp;T also right because
they're they're not getting access that
that either which is completely not
ridiculous not yet at least that some
right seems like they're going to get it
but but for some period of time 18d is
gonna have an exclusive on that yeah
this moto maker that's really bizarre
but you know I'm just thinking about
like all the people i think you know
many of us working for the birds correct
me if i'm wrong but i think many of us
choose not to use cases on our phones
and in reality if you look around on the
street in the subway wherever we are in
the overwhelming minority oh yeah almost
everybody has a ridiculous looking case
on their smartphone you know presumably
because they they want to be able to
drop it and not worry about it um but
that you know that there's a lot of
personality that comes out in these
cases people choose pink people choose
crazy designs people choose wood and
translating that into the phone itself I
think could end up being a really big
win for them and if they market it as
aggressively as they seem to be doing so
far
they get buy-in from from carriers and I
think we'll see that from AT&amp;amp;T at least
initially since they have the exclusive
on the customizations that's going to be
I think they have a very real chance of
selling very very well with this phone I
really do i will say that that if the
wood one is is as cool as I want it to
be and as cool as what I've seen from
the previous I'm gonna be really tempted
to buy it wouldn't want everybody is
tempted by this I've no idea why we've
seen budem phones before and they
completely impractical nauseum what
where are we seeing the wooden phone
that I could buy for each from AT&amp;amp;T
nicey like i see like i wanna be one of
those now one off one off concepts and
like Kickstarter projects and things
like that that have tried to do the
wooden phone thing but like I never
could buy any one of those or maybe I
could import something for like a
thousand bucks but I'm not going to do
that so but yeah you asking for wooden
shack when you can have a nice I don't
know a lunatic one but I guess the other
option with motorola's the plastic right
yeah it's a theory so with the other
answer there thank you four types of
gamer yeah you are your president
accounted for okay I couldn't tell cuz I
kept on trying to talk and just kept on
talking yeah well we're only discussing
the 18 different shades of plastic that
Americans can choose from and Chris was
saying how much of a revolutionary step
this is in mobile technology so look how
it's really moving us going it is made
this point while I was off rebooting my
stupid freaking computer about which I'm
very angry but I don't care that this
isn't revolutionary if you're expecting
the Moto X to be revolutionary I mean I
think you were expecting too much the
store at the Moto X's does the overall
design feel cohesive and better with all
the little things adding up if you add
up a nicer feeling phone that's just
like straight up well designed looks
good feels good in the hand on top of
good battery life on top of some nice
subtle things on top of Android that
just make it nicer there's there's no
like you know there's no good sales
pitch for it other than here's the Moto
X it's just really nice and like that
that's respectable and especially on
Android it's you know on Android you've
had a choice
mean two things mid-range which has
always been code for like fundamentally
flawed and crappy in some way or crazy
high end which has always been code for
expensive and you're probably not
getting that good battery life in most
cases because it's got some ridiculous
process or the androids not optimized
for yet and you haven't had something
that's just like really nice and the
Moto X seems like from our review and
what I've been seeing about it it's just
really nice and that's something that I
would be willing to try out because
you're here you're here but the problem
is it's 200 bucks you know is that right
can they can they can they get away with
that if I see a hundred bucks I mean I
don't know so my conspiracy theory is
they're selling a tutor brush because
they make a better profit margin from
you know what they're getting from the
carrier's etc etc and it's a lot easier
for Google someday to spin off motorola
if it's turning a profit that it is if
its operating at a loss I don't think
that's true but that's my conspiracy
theory yes but also operating out of the
US will surely be more expensive you
guys remember the Nexus Q when it came
out it had a quite a city price attached
to it as well and it was because Google
was trying to work out of the US and
Google last to 1,500 bucks so well I
motorola the woodside was hinting that
the motorola might be involved in
manufacturing glass someday we just lost
an hands gone everything is broken
everything is terrible everything is
genoa that sentiment is usually safe for
the end of the the yeah yeah you've been
premature dieter okay I'm just gonna
drop one final point here because then
raise the point about Google erecting
kind of a firewall between a cell phone
motorola and having a separation between
the two companies and i just wanted to
point out that what Microsoft is doing
right now is trying to get over exactly
that same sort of fragmentation and
separation within itself within its
company right because Microsoft is
trying to be a devices and services
company and a cohesive one at that
whereas previously there was a whole
bunch of tribalism going on within
Microsoft you know the office team will
do their thing the other team will do
something
and there will be in competition between
them and they wouldn't communicate and
collaborate like they should so well the
tribalism at Microsoft is a
fundamentally different problem than
Google and Motorola I mean I guess
they're there are some similarities but
but Google as a whole doesn't suffer
from the same sort of internal strife at
least so far as I can tell right now it
doesn't at the moment but the point is
everybody seems to be doing well is
doing well because they're the whole
company is working together and doing it
properly like two other examples and the
kind of easy ones HP and palm I don't
think those guys have a you know spoke
to each other after the first party
where they were like yeah you took us
over and the second example is nakia
when it was still working on symbian and
you know those guys were like at the
final month before they decide to
release the phone they pull all the
software teams to get in this decide to
integrate the OS with a month left to go
before they release things whereas you
compare that with Apple which is now on
I think it's beta 5 of iOS 7 months and
months ahead of the release of the next
iPhone and full release of iOS 7 well
they seem to be moving really fast and
those betas all right and changing stuff
relatively quickly which I mean we could
get into I mean we saw the leak so that
came out today from the beta and they've
added some icons and they're cleaning
stuff up and you can get rid of command
center and they're still tweaking fonts
which i think the donation every beta
yeah and so I mean a lot of people like
well you know you should have expected
this that there was a beta so things
will change but I don't know if we've
ever seen you know in the history of all
these iOS betas like this much tweaking
of like fundamental design concepts well
I mean to be fair we haven't seen this
drastic of a change in the whole
fundamental design of the previous iOS
versions they were all very iterative
like what what was the one between one
of them like the wallpaper changed I
think that was that was the interface
design change so yeah and I also think
that that the the redesign came together
very very quickly because I've wasn't
installed in
that position until what I like
september-october of last year somewhere
around there yeah i was 14 stall was
exited yeah yeah anyway sorry back to
the Moto X like what else what else we
talked about the they made ridiculously
bad advert ads it's like it's like moths
to a flame like no smartphone maker can
help itself like they feel compelled to
make an awful ad well but lashonda you
got would joke they made all these jokes
and they released this adds and this
campaign and then literally like mere
hours later it was all reversed and
changed like it saw people hated it and
then and then and then fired whatever a
person approved them and and changed
everything which was like one of the
fastest turnarounds I've ever seen on on
an ad campaign which generally has many
levels of approval many committees that
say okay to this before you can publish
and push it out so that i don't know
that was kind of crazy to me I just want
to take partial credit for helping with
the headline on Nate's Nate's post here
that the article about bad sex jokes and
the headline started with ill-conceived
oh wow well done do you you actually
managed to save that Paul calls me
because I didn't even notice it I read
it and I didn't notice the fun speaking
of puns we had this you have glad you
did this article this morning about how
did humans become acclimated to lactose
yes and someone asked me why did why do
we write about it and I said well the
verge writes about culture you know I
have to give credit that is good but I
heard it all right I've read it this
morning there are about eight or 10
comments in the comment thread for that
post which is just amazing I mean
amazing dad there are puns on way could
I mean everything cheese yogurt does too
cheesy cetera cetera it was beautiful
it's a beautiful stream of pun off the
bow did you guys talk about the when I
off the Google Play version of the Moto
X's come we mentioned it and asked why
why it exists I believe Vlad was making
that point yeah yeah I mean this might
be the first android phone where I'm not
like oh my god just give me a stock
version of this please yeah I you know I
think I feel the same way like the
things that Motorola has changed are
generally for the better right right the
camera interface is nicer i I've said
this before I can't stand the stock
camera interface on Android 4.4 for
point whatever the standard Google
interface I'm just not a fan of it so
like support three yeah and I'm like it
I'm I with living thing is awesome and
and the other thing is the always
listening thing which is cool it takes
advantage of the specific hardware in
the Motorola X to do it so unless the
Google Play version had that for some
reason I don't know why I'd want the
Google Play version the only thing is
maybe I can roll this into a next point
is that the Google Play version will be
updated to the next version of android
really quickly which we found out just
last week with the galaxy s4 and the HTC
one that received their android 4.3
updates already which was only nine days
after Android 4.3 was up d uh was yeah I
don't even know if I've got android 43
in my nexus 4 yet to be on yes as going
to say there's probably a whole
truckload of Nexus phones are still
waiting to get the update notification
here we are with the google edition
phones that have so that's not receive
this is impressive very expected that oh
the other i'm not that the Moto X a
thing is is that the woodside I think he
told CNET that it's going to be a brand
and there's gonna be more Moto X phones
coming like a cheaper one and yeah
there's gonna be a whole body yeah he
said that earlier this year he said that
when he was on the D conference that you
know Motorola's is gonna produce a line
of devices and it's not just going to be
the Moto X so I mean I we're going to
see lower end ones i'm sure that to
explain the portfolio bring the give the
company more price point options and
things I mean don't call a moto x
straight up that should be the same
phone and you can help Moto X once a
year come on but don't i mean this is
this is the thing the problem i have
with HTC One mini and then there's good
be the HTC One max or the galaxy s4
bazillion right we're in
it's aggravating okay so like is moto x
if that's supposed to be a product name
is it technically like full name
motorola moto x ya know ya can't wait
for the google edition one motorola moto
x by google we should just cut we should
call it a motocross yeah i like
motocross it's pretty good yeah so i
don't know who's making up for his bad
connection with a bunch of nice buns I'm
doing my best wait wait wait wait you
guys you guys weren't supposed to stop
first start talking again yet because i
wanted to do too slow on the trigger
there man yeah yeah I'm wondering if
playing around with the stuff in the
hangouts toolbox is what broke hangouts
for me and maybe have to reboot it's my
fault it's always my fault Nvidia shield
we got a review up from mr. sean
hollister and he likes it yeah he's
gonna buy one yeah he's a few crazy he's
gonna put his office and he's plunking
down money for it I mean if you were you
acquiring roms from classic systems and
or you are into you've got a the exact
right pc gaming rig and you're in ya see
gaming and yeah the steamboat is awesome
one of like three graphics cards that
actually works with the damn thing yeah
if you're like in that tiny sliver of
humans and sean is then yeah i could see
this thing being cool but the idea that
I would want to play android games in
this thing is completely insane what
applies that you can play rit rim rim
rim grinned Rick epson now that were a
mess up we're not living on until until
Dan gets this right uh rymdkapsel rim
capsule ruined capsule there's a
pronunciation to this isn't there and I
don't know
it's an amazing game and I'm I'm much
better at it than you or if you if you
follow Chris and dieter on Twitter it's
pretty much all II been talking about on
twitter today so he's are so Ellis yeah
Ellis tried to break to me that he
survived 30 waves this morning and then
like we'll wait a second how the hell
did dieter survive 37 38 now 38 excuse
me and I still don't totally understand
it I'm obviously doing something wrong
how do you no doubt it written capsule
room cancel okay anyway and well not my
achievement for the day was that I
actually went out and saw the Sun in the
sky and they were birds chirping outside
whatever you yeah but you you probably
haven't survived 38 waves of rain
capsule Bledsoe I mean and to be fair
who's who's the winner for for us here
in the states that we still have quite a
few hours left in the day to do just
that one so they're not that I will not
not that we're looking up for rymdkapsel
but yeah okay solo track is back to
shoot well let Chris drags Beth shield
hopeful I was just gonna say that the
one thing that really bothered me about
I've only played with shield once but it
was a pretty late prototype den you were
there it was a DJ and the notion of
having a portable with a fan on it is
just completely like it get over that
and so that's my first problem but I
agree with what dieter said that you
know if you have the right pc for this
it makes a pretty amazing companion
device but that's a really small markets
and and you can't leave your house
either right like it's only that only
works on Wi-Fi so you can do it on your
couch but you know you go it kind of
surprised me how much battery life the
thing has even with that fan and running
that processor I guess it is a huge
thing it's yeah tiny little box I've got
plenty of space to throw battery in yeah
right that's true but the thing is in
terms of is you know core functionality
I think shows review sets it already
it it gets the basics right so it gives
the fundamentals right so like that and
says it has a big battery ergonomically
it's a very good controller it has a
really beautiful screen although I
ergonomically actually like touching
that the touchscreen is impossible like
it's a completely right you're like see
if you interrupted me I would have just
Illustrated that which I'm going to do
anyway so okay well I mean that's the
trouble so you have all the fundamentals
and the basics done right but the actual
functionality that is on offer is the
thing that's lacking so yes you can
stream a game from your nvidia geforce
gtx equipped pc to the shield and it's
lovely and smooth and great fine and you
can get roms most of which you can't
really do to it via legal ways but if
you go to if you just again going back
to this idea of you by the device you
open up the box and then you say okay
this is a gaming device it's an Android
let me get some games on it right so you
go to the Play Store you look for the
games and it's just not that there's up
there are very few games attraction
compatible with the controller itself
and I were you know properly correctly
with it isn't it video curating a store
for it they are yeah I mean it yeah
they've had TegraZone for a long time
but team this is this is the first thing
I think about when I wake up in the
morning and this is the last thing that
gives me heartburn and keys for you from
going to bed at night and I'd like I
think they're making a big push mean
we've got the shield you got oh yeah
that's like off to the side and then
we've got google they just put up 4.3
with opengl that was a big push OpenGL
s3 they've got the new game center
they're making a huge gaming push and
there's rumor that Google itself is
working on a game console I think Google
is trying really really hard to fix like
the gaming on Android problem if you
want to call it that and I think it is a
big problem right uh this is my point
how long is it going to take what are
you looking at which cheer right now
it's two ninety-nine dollars in the US
what you're looking at is a very
incomplete machine very complete
experience
which requires either that you put in a
whole heap of effort to get that
excellent gaming experience which you
can achieve but you have to know what
you're doing yet to know where to look
and if to put a time in or you basically
get something that disappoints you
because you don't get the games you
don't get the experience and the other
thing is the thing I wanted to
illustrate with this little book here is
that the shield is supposed to be used
in a what is this the landscape mode
yeah but then most android apps are in
portrait mode so when you do that you
actually have to hold it like so which
looks flying with a really thin book is
that it's an absolute disaster with the
freaking controller in your hand you
have to watch that insurance video yeah
it's just ridiculous holding this thing
in any sort of portrait mode and there's
no other takes users yeah if you think
it to use this thing for anything other
than gaming you're a madman yeah exactly
so if the gaming is lacking and you
can't really use it as an Android device
or as an Android tablet then what is the
point I cuz i could see watching movies
on it the sound is pretty killer no okay
but hey for it for any sort of yeah out
of stuff set it on a airplane airplane
tray table and just flip it up and your
phone sure but as far as like like
you're saying any sort of app stuff it's
really really poorly designed for that
yeah but I mean why it's for that each
market that wants to play games and want
some games from there nvidia powered
computer i mean if you if you're looking
to do that then this is cool but if
you're looking to play just android
games the new Nexus 7 is seventy bucks
cheaper and if you really want a
controller they've got you know standard
Bluetooth controls now and you could
like buy a little thing and I'm out if
you really want to like there's better
ways to do just straight android gaming
such as it is say no fan and no fan yeah
and 1080 screen if you've got the right
if you've got the the pc then whatever
go for it otherwise just get a nexus 7
has has any of you actually plunked down
for a new nexus 7 yet not yet right nope
I'm
torn I'm seriously torn because I still
don't think the app situation is quite
there despite Google strenuous
protestations to the contrary and I've
got an ipad mini so I don't know if I
want to spend the money on that if I get
one guy's gonna say yeah if I get when
it'll be the ulti version anyway right
yeah that that's what i was thinking i
don't really want to spend 350 bucks for
the LTE version but that's yeah if I
tablet is like honestly my tablet is my
number one go-to tethering thing because
of my phones in eighteen t I put my
tablet on verizon and the tablet has a
huge battery and so I don't have to
worry about my phone dying because i
needed to tether so it's really super
insanely convenient for me to have LTE
on a tablet yeah or you could have you
know a modem yeah I do have one that we
you know the office has one we share it
around but if I'm going to be paying 30
bucks a month for tethering why not have
a big ass screen and apps on it right so
it's fair point I mean I'm I guess I'm
just kind of a node thoughts about this
in so far as I still can't find much of
a compelling reasons to be using a
tablet you know for many many purposes
like the only so this is what aters able
to last 38 round since playing on the
ipad where it all falls that everyone
else is playing on the iphone all their
games yeah as for you you is hilariously
bad hey it's like me don't know about no
no I'm saying on the iphone the UI is
hilariously bad because like the text
like each letter is like one pixel it's
ridiculous okay wow we talked about 4.3
that hit the IR blaster works on my one
now very excited about it yeah I
discovered that this week well like I
knew I'd heard reports that the IR
blaster was at it support was finally
added they said it was coming and it was
added so I went into the play store and
like found an app to use it because even
though the update adds it
system-level it doesn't give you the HTC
TV app or anything to actually use the
IR blaster so you have to go into the
App Store and I found this free app that
lets me use my phone to remotely control
my sony camera which I found to be
really really cool and really useful so
now I don't need to carry around a
wireless remote if I want to wirelessly
control my camera because I can do with
my phone so fun and nerdy that that is
actually a really big deal because as yo
sony camera is it NEX camera is is the
best camera range that we recommend
people buy right now does this work the
next NEX evan owe me a six yeah yeah
we're son the six i mean it's it's a
very basic app it's it's called like HTC
I our control or something like that put
a link in a lot yeah the UI is about as
bare bones as you can get ah but it
gives you controls for nikon canon sony
DSLR s and then a whole host of TV's and
even air conditioners and all kinds of
things it's pretty much just a fruit
yeah it's a proof of concept of what you
can do with the IR blaster on your phone
but it works really good on you know
just round your brother ridiculously
ugly this app is terrible yeah it's not
winning any design but it does maybe I
oblasti useful it does make it actually
useful which comes a surprise too
because I've been saying it's a gimmick
and I haven't been alone in saying that
but but actually tying it to something
that you can you know put to use and to
pretty practical use like that is really
nice and I just want to say on a more
optimistic note because I know I've been
kind of bashing the motor works in
fashion to shield and then somebody's
going to be bashing me over Twitter and
may get an email saying that today I'm
pay by Apple or Microsoft or whoever we
were both at the same time and they're
gonna find out now that you're getting
for getting paid for the bold blue you
blew your racket there uh and you know
what and you know what they can't
complain because both of them kind of
dodging texture in the UK so they can
you know they can sort out their own
affairs before they start dealing with
mine um 87 has a cousin
infrared port uh this I'm not a hundred
percent sure on the seven I'm like 99%
sure on the six which is the one I
thought you had you have to put the you
have to put the camera on right you have
to put the camera on remote drive so
yeah how's she gonna be like most remote
can you go ahead let's say something
happy we should probably say that have
me screw out with my camera during the
middle of mobile show I'm sorry guys i
would agree yeah okay but via the
positive thing was I was wrong about the
IR blaster we have a practical use for
it and the thing I would say is with the
motorway X the moto maker program could
expand dramatically so where where is
today's just pick your color in the
future we could you know give you real
customization and real tweaks and you
know just grow let's go the same way
with the shield with the games you know
once the shield is out there if there
are enough crazy people like Sean who
actually buy it and pursue it doesn't
work either it works work nice this was
me like yes let this saturday i love
sitting here in my office and I'm just
like oh my god I'll just like taking
pictures of the junk on my desk because
that's what yeah I'll post this to
twitter later this is I'm pretty excited
about this tone your way to take selfies
yeah so yeah to explain what you were
saying blood would they could expand the
moto maker program right now you can
change it choose the color of the device
and you can choose your wallpaper and
like have it inscribed with your name
but you can it's very similar to the
what amazon does with the kindle when it
says when you open it after you buy it
it says like dance kindle right when you
turn it on right set it up i would love
to know maybe this is the case maybe it
isn't but it'd be great if it was if
like you are already an Android user and
you're upgrading your phone android has
a way of signing in and then pulling
down all of your apps and restoring all
of your apps yeah which works about a
quarter of the time it yeah I mean when
you're coming from like various
different devices it
emily has hiccups but I would love for
it to be like smooth and be like I open
up my new Moto X and it's got all my
apps right there I don't have to worry
about downloading and setting them all
up that would be awesome that would be
some serious customization that I would
like yeah I can't go quite that far in
the optimism afraid I'm just saying that
be cool I don't know if it's gonna
happen but it'd be cool I mean they
might try I'm just saying it's not it's
not really going to be something that's
that they going to make work seamlessly
I don't expect but anyhow I think dieter
and Chris are busy Roger again yeah it's
happening yeah speaking of trolling we
talked about this Samsung astroturfing
drama well might I mean is I've actually
kind of gotten over it by this point
yeah i was a bit outraged and then a few
days past things happened so i mean if
you're not familiar samsung bulldogs
that's well a agency got in touch with a
developer and said hey could you go and
happen to mention the samsung developer
contest on Stack Exchange and get all
these other developers interested well
pay you some money and then of course
this developer being an upright guy said
this is ridiculous and then the guy from
the PR agency or the marketing firm
denied it and then it turned out he kind
of was lying and then Samsung disavow
all knowledge of the whole thing and
just said that's their marketing people
of thought our fault and basically the
whole story from top to bottom is like a
repeat of what we heard with people
getting paid to rag on HTC in forums
only this time is to promote Samsung
Developers instead of hating on HTC yeah
I just like to point out that the
upright citizen who reported Samsung's
Samsung's ad agencies invitation / bribe
is Bulgarian so yay for us link address
Bulgarians sometimes like okemos but I
mean I think we've all kind of had the
suspicion that companies do this and and
the thing is there was a very client
line there because the way that the ad
agency reached out if they just said you
know we want to spread the word can you
help us spread the word and didn't offer
the game money they might have actually
had a chance of having him do it you
know but what they wanted was to make it
seem organic like he just really psyched
for the show or for the developer
whatever it was they're setting up he's
really psyched about it and he's just
asking around and trying to stir up
conversation with people organically and
another thing that's the problem Harry
if if he just openly said hey such and
such it would be fine but they want to
make it seem like the community psyched
about the app development program which
I don't think that they are no I mean
yeah I mean why would you want to
develop specifically for samsung stuff I
mean yes they're number one but if you
could also have a work on other Android
points great maybe you know maybe
they're holding out hope that people get
it really into Tizen well to some extent
I think that device agnosticism is what
kills the awesomeness of Android apps in
general right like that that's that's
why you know console video games are
usually very tight that's why iOS apps
are you are quite often great and that's
why android apps usually aren't great is
because they need to be very device
agnostic so maybe if Samsung can congeal
I don't know why I'm advocating in favor
this I remember saying that like you
know if they can congeal if they can put
together an API layer that is broad
enough and and tight enough to really
focus on the galaxy line and maybe they
can do some cool things I don't know
couldn't cousin developers just like
target high-end devices though like if
they if they were only concerned with
you know a performance and offering the
best experience couldn't they just say
that you know what you've got a two year
old single core processor this just
isn't going to work for you you can't
install it well if nothing else you
still have to worry about you know um
Snapdragon vs. Taylor
versus Exodus that's right oh yeah and
so this is the worst mobile show ever
guys I'm sorry like this is a google
hangout has dropped I spent a whole
bunch of time taking a picture of myself
with an IR blaster and then I spent how
much time trying to post it on Twitter
but now twitter is down on the west
coast time iphone but all i'm doing is
like noticing the twitter is down I'm
just just leaving and I'm making objects
I'm just gonna jump in with a rogue
segue and say uh we were just so goodbye
android apps you know what can run
android app so at least some android
apps is the blackberry z10 Wow which is
one of the most exciting phones of this
year if you have thoughts enhance that
is have we seen the the the leaks of the
the a 10 / now crackberry is calling at
the z30 z30 yeah I cannot possibly get
excited about that thing I'm sorry I
mean that supposed to be like a gaming
centric oversized phone but I'm not
really staggering to that I wanted to
segue into the porsche design
BlackBerry's attack we actually is worth
discussing that oh we did this happen
wait wait wait I was on vacation last
week is there such a thing or are you
trolling me like no there's such a very
very clear pictures of this thing and it
directly is exactly what you expect it
to be oh no no listen all I want to know
is how much is it gonna cost the last
one was like what 20 100 bucks or
something ridiculous right yeah yeah
crazy it's time thing is we're talking
about let's let's hear what you have to
say that well the thing i would like to
say is first of all I reviewed the
original porsche design blackberry which
was essentially a p99 p9981 i think it
was cold it was a 9900 there's an
apostrophe somewhere in there yeah yes
and I am still traumatized
quite an experience I have to tell you
guys and the fact that another one is
coming apparently middle of next year
whatever which makes it completely crazy
we're gonna be laughing so hard if this
thing is actually released with the z10
specs in the middle of next year when
we're running like 16 core or Motorola's
do the calculations like 24 call ya
opposed to smartphones or whatnot but I
mean it's just like why is this company
not learning from his mistakes well you
know how this works I mean as much as I
hate to say it they're going to announce
this thing in Dubai they're going to
sell it in Dubai and like Moscow and a
bunch of like really rich people with
debatably questionable tastes are going
to pick this up and and rim and porsche
design we'll both are see me rip
blackberry and porsche design will both
make a few bucks and you know the
waterway happy the profit margins on
these things have to be like through the
roof right right right i mean they're
they're they're certainly not gonna sell
this in the US i would bet they're not
gonna sell in canada maybe one or two
carriers will pick it up in europe but
even that i'm not sure this is primarily
for i think ii mea- Europe because
primary care is big oster that have got
way too much money to spend that's who
this is primarily for ya not even in
Europe is there a subsidy motto for two
thousand dollar freaking phone but there
are rich people in Europe right and and
many of them have questionable taste Wow
absolutely for the recognized too many
Americans yes yeah I'm not hey this is
not an anti Europe rant I promise there
are many Americans both rich and poor
and in the middle that don't have taste
myself included I mean listen yeah the
other thing you need to know is that if
this phone is on sale here in the UK is
going to be a sale at Harrods and
nobody's going to be asking about
contracts or whatever it just going to
be talking about
you're going to be talking about things
like the packaging is that real leather
or is it fake leather and and it's like
sits since we're on this topic virtue
also announced a Ferrari branded edition
of its Android phone so we may miss the
most good ear when I was on vacation so
yeah I didn't either far to Ferrari
Sonia wvga 3.7 ash single core android
4.4 with Ferrari branding all over it
and of course the usual over to jewels
and metals there's like some fake
leather stitching on the side and he's
really over the top three thick dynamics
the top of the phone like the part of
your ear pieces it is almost supposed to
look like at least I think it's almost
supposed to look like a turn signal and
it's like really red and crystal looking
and it's got the Ferrari horse in the
middle dude this is awesome oh my god
then are you kidding this is sick like
on the side of his leg it's got like
this like a black anodized metal like
thing with the Ferrari logo on it like
its got like screws in it this is
awesome dude this is this is just a
freaking study in how to degrade your
brand particularly if you're a luxury
brand like these guys like the way
Ferrari has just given his name away to
guys like ASA with subs completely
forgettable horrible colored laptops and
these phones are being trotted out it's
just a nightmare and yeah but I'm not
into that but virtue I mean like at
least virtue has never made a cheap
phone and there's and it's limited to
2013 pieces yeah you know Vlad actually
vertu is the uk's motorola because
vertices are made in the UK Motorola's
army in the US wow that's a pretty
posted in that at your right we're
talking about virtue so whatever it's
fine maybe another thing ferrario so
branding instead of completely
forgettable headphones as well which I
mean frying Ferraris like they're
getting to be like kiss they'll throw
their brand on anything that's when we
say you can get for years it sucks words
on the other hand guys like being w 4
doors I think puma sneakers at least
that kind of ties in with the whole
racer equipment mentality Adi Adi other
sport sporty types you can kind of build
it into your brand whereas Ferraris like
okay we need more money we don't make
enough of profit margin on a
million-dollar car so we need more money
so just set soda brand you're honestly
when whenever somebody at like an
analyst asks Stephen Elop when Nokia is
moving to Android he should just be like
we're already doing Android devices
which we own like two percent of or
whatever make Henrik that that's we
should say it's fat point as far as what
do you buy one of these I'm already as
we speak i'm placing my pre-order and
ready 42 site i just want to register
that it's completely impossible to
transition from whatever we've been
talking about to another topic and i
just don't even don't even have the
strength anymore it comes up Lucifer re
ringtones oh my god i'm still shopping
this wow that is pretty cool ok let's
talk about sony i wanted to let us i
just keep talking about ferrari in
virtue what have they merged wow I I
don't know what to do with that dieter
I'm sorry I like plaids header all right
ah yeah I've no Johnny stony sony has
good news so my point six million
smartphones in the quarter between april
and june and it is turning a profit
still kind of a small profit i think
overall food entire group is 35 million
dollars but it was the same story that
it's that's a weak yen that's that's
helping their bottom line right right so
I mean Sony and all the Japanese
companies in fact of really affected by
the yen's perform so they were
struggling when the yen was strong now
this going week they're benefiting from
it but if you look at our chart in our
coverage of this it really illustrates
how important smartphones to become for
so many because they're growing in in
terms of sales but everything else is
actually shrinking so obviously
smartphones TV
different profit margins but smartphones
are the thing that is growing the most
so needed and is the thing that is
growing its bottom line right I'm gonna
I wanna tweak that that Sony doesn't get
based on that chart from whoever it was
that would talk about Edward
fragmentation that Sony might might be
after Samsung number two at least
according to those numbers there at
least in the top three or four right or
the total sales like they they don't get
nearly enough credit for their influence
on the android marketplace then you are
going to say so i just wanted to point
out that just to soften your point vlad
that home consoles which is now like the
smallest fraction in the last quarter
once the PlayStation 4 comes out uh
assuming that it does is successful it's
probably going to take over as like the
main profit driver nobody's buying the
playstation 4 xbox one is where it's at
XCOM wow this really has been a holiday
for too long no no but seriously i mean
if you think about it and and what we're
talking about here is also if you just
look at the mobile product division
facility which include smartphones and
laptops and its laptop division isn't
doing particularly well it made 60
million dollars in terms of net profit
in the end so smart phones are probably
holding up the laptop division which i'm
not sure what a profitability is there
and they're driving the overall company
profitability so smart phones are just
fundamental to the Sony's feature and
listings are looking up police things
are looking good and just to add to what
dita was saying about sony set setting a
bunch of phones i mean one thing is that
the xperia a which sam byford Japanese
writer choose me is an Xperia Z or Zed
shrunken down a little bit is actually
the best cell phone in Japan that's what
so many tells us and apparently it's
being pushed really hard I think well
one of the carriers and I'm gonna be
getting which one it was the one that
doesn't have the iphone they're pushing
really hard
galaxy s4 and the xperia a is very a is
the best cell phone in japan so it's
very popular but also sony has a bunch
of mid-range phones which you and i have
completely forgotten about so I actually
looked it up its things like the xperia
tipo and the xperia c i remember the
other one's name the mirror they're like
3.2 3.7 inch android smartphones that
wonder why i forgot about them without
contract and the thing is people buy
them you know these cheapo android
phones people buy them and they also
form part of Samson's foundation is a
discussed previously with all the tiny
little freaky galaxies that the company
Kickstarter week you know we haven't
talked about the the old xperia mini pro
in like two months what's wrong with us
yeah we went back to that meant with bad
people all the time tipo reminds me that
just a little bit so little cute do you
still on one xperia mini pro yeah yeah I
think I do I mean it was on amazon for
like 200 bucks or something off-contract
I was like yeah I'm buying that was was
that the one with the keyboard without
the keyboard with what it looks like a
little bar soap yeah love me fudgy yeah
it had its own UI to write like because
the screen recorder thing you could like
PF and the updated and four point oh I
mean you know what Ben not that um do we
have anything else we're going to talk
about that we've just got like a random
smattering of other topics di I do have
a big one that I want to address
specifically with Vlad I mean other
comments are welcome but I I really want
to get Vlad take on this what are your
thoughts on the fat bird as L say does a
whole lot of really wasted fat that is
good and it's a lot of let me give the
background because the background for
the people who have been reading The
Verge religiously so I've only over here
in London they discovered a bust size
I'm just gonna I'm just gonna guess that
it's a single decker bus not a
double-decker bus yeah i don't i don't
think there are sewers or tunnels under
London that can fit a double-decker bus
inside somebody's probably go to your
tweet at me say yes there are but the
point is I think it's a single decker
bus but it's a massive lump of fat and
other nasty things Appalachian combina
say the tripes yeah that's right up yeah
yeah so it all kind of congealed into
one huge mess that was the size of a bus
and go cleared away this is good news
you go cleared away so the people of
Kingston in southwest London can breathe
easy even if you know my I'm a bit
smelly around because this is a clear
but that's just yeah and a code of fat
bag because it's made out of most foot
but where did it go what did they do
with it did they burn it I mean
presumably it's flammable hopefully okay
there's a there's a royal baby joke here
somewhere and I can't quite formulate it
I think you're right there there's
something better um yeah what else
happened in the past week in the in the
world of mobile apples doing they've got
like this is a charger trade-in program
than they also speaking of chargers
they're fixing a thing where you could
use a fake charger to hack an iphone if
you have direct connection to it I'm
tempted to make like a fake charger out
of like paper mache and and bring it in
just to get ten bucks off a charge are
they offering the training program
everywhere just in China I'll go to
China I'm yes oh man that's worldwide is
it what we do okay okay I mean just
let's let's be clear here they're still
making a hefty load of profit on the $30
charger that they're taking ten dollars
off of but they do not charge thirty
dollars for these things do they I'd be
surprised if it was a different price
it's probably 29 bucks that's impossible
vr charge 19 for the lightning cable I
know that yeah that's just the caper
short one don't they make a long one
that's 30 I think they about luckily
makeup they make a fish along one now I
think so and the 30-pin to Thunderbolt
connector RC made a lightning connector
that I need for uh for my tractor z1 is
30 bucks which is enough I mean like any
time a piece of plastic is that small it
should not cost more than its weight in
coins it's my bed that's the golden rule
I think okay so according to the apple
store the little got the worst
navigation ever I can't find the
chargers on the little brick the USB
power adapter that's not the cable just
the little thing that plugs into the
wall has USB port is nineteen dollars
yeah okay that's what I am so you pay
999 or whatever not so yeah and I'm nine
bucks i'm pretty sure there's there's
like five dollars profit in there at
least data is bottom with the apple site
if you actually do a search with apples
in turn research on the store site for
my book air charger I got nothing I'm
searching the apple store website for
macbook air challenge or not hair we
can't find ur guys we don't know where
it is but the Christmas point I think
apple is applying exactly the rule you
saying Chris but instead of coins they
using notes so way to the cable in notes
yes but I mean it's ridiculously well
known this about a box histories for the
longest time it's like if you paid that
much like thirty forty dollars for an
hdmi cable your texts have your friends
would be like you're completely nuts
idiot you you'll pay for this by about
ten times monoprice is where it's at but
what's funny about minor price though is
that I haven't checked recently but last
time I looked even their lightning I
mean monoprice is notorious for being
like absurdly cheap with cables and
their lightning cables were not actually
that much cheaper than apples if you
know yeah Amazon's aren't either yes
because economy is right it's because of
the authentication chip right that they
have to put in the cable yeah I ended up
buying an apple brand lightning cable on
Amazon because it turned out to be
cheaper than amazon's brand it was like
a sale or something is it a real Apple
cable though yes I mean I paid fifteen
dollars for it but it's a real Apple
and the amazon one was like 15 99 or
something yeah the most the most
egregious violation of of capitalism is
uh not violation i guess egregious
taking advantage of take advantage
capitals and thank you there is is the
the micro USB to lightning adapter
because it's literally the size of like
a dime it's like I will lose these by
the dozens and if its twenty bucks it's
the same price as the cable which is
just completely absurd agreed okay
turning up mostly means the new Doctor
Who very excited by this I mean I'm
given up guys i mean if i had if i
didn't talk about reg I had never seen
an episode of Doctor Who I guess I would
be happy about that or excited about
that go go rent in the loop and just
watch this guy swear he's he's a genius
is that is that about being the cussing
is that is that about being in Apple's
infinite loop no it's it's about the
run-up to war Iraq war and like the
British side of it yeah that's good the
movie that came out of the TV series in
which he starred it's right both the
thick of it any it has to do with how
things run behind the scenes with
ministers in the UK Parliament so Peter
Capaldi who's the actor he's like one of
the leading figures in the guys who
running things behind the scenes foreign
minister and he swears just so
beautifully and so creatively that there
are you know that there are best of
highlights video reels on youtube of him
and and just the way that he destroys
people with all that swearing and he's
got he's got this amazing Glaswegian
accent the Scottish accent so it all
just sounds vicious as hell and then you
have him go into his you know you
friendly sci-fi series doctor who and
now supposed to be a nice guy all of a
sudden I hope that he's just mean and
nasty if he's yeah I would love
everybody tased out of that that ladies
