looking at the razor blade this is
razors 17.3 inch gaming laptop long and
development it's about 28 inches thin
6.66 pounds a little lighter than a
macbook pro which it gives you got a
17.3 inch screen they've got Dolby Home
audio for should quit keyboard actually
true a matte display 1080p resolution
giant want to look at this giant power
button this is basically only thing
outside the keyboard and the big thing
of course is the Switchblade controls in
touch screen this is actually a
multi-touch trackpad but has the
functionality personal num pad I've got
my num pad page down num lock you can
see it changes want to go back a hit via
the razor button you've got little apps
like you to and go ahead just watch
whatever here while I'm playing games on
here go back browser I can look up you
know if your website i can catch up on
the verge news i can look at if they
keys what i do that other little things
macros razor said they're going to open
up the sdk to public hopefully sometime
in the next six months i'm not sure
about that and we can also do is you can
add shortcuts like we have a league of
legends here although i know it's not
going to load youtube that's should load
up something and these are fully
programmable in the final build this is
final hardware but pre-final software
there should be a rumor that comes out
either right as it ships or just before
specs wise you've got a core i7
processor you've got it should be sandy
bridge you've got a number of USB ports
here you've got our Ethernet of course
there is no optical drive so if you're
doing gaming you're gonna have to
download you're gonna have to get a
separate drive this machine again long
and development long time coming is
coming out finally shipping into January
we're 2799 there is no configuration
options so you have to be half of the
GeForce you have to be happy the core i7
processor it's it's not bad for the for
the price but there is no
configurability and there is no upgrade
if you can't take the battery out you
can't take the ram mounts and you can't
take the storage out</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
