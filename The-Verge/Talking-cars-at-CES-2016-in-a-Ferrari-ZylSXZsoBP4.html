i'm feeling suave but i think it's the
ferrari now with white hold on i think
it's the fryer at myself hey this is
chris from the verge i'm here sitting
the passenger seat to my pilot during
Golson transportation reporter at The
Verge yes and good to be here day 7 no
dey 33 yeah of CES 2016 but we're
finishing it off on a high note yes area
for already California tea with a price
of this model is 275 thousand dollars
Turner said Odin with a balance this
particular one is brand new 345 miles
that's like I mean if this car came from
LA which is like it did somehow
driving it I have to drive in la tinh
not LA I have to drive in vegas traffic
yeah is less than fun last what no I
think we'll be alright today normally we
have to go anywhere I'm so sorry you
have to drive a ferrari in vegas ground
I know it's been rough I mean Mary it's
not that bad could be worse basically in
Vegas that's what you do you cruise the
strip Miami you cruise miami beach yeah
here you cruise the strip so strep we're
really what else is there to do in Vegas
besides gamble and cruise the strip so
let's talk about the highs and lows of
the show yes long had a boat a lot of
both and as we keep saying over and over
again this really is becoming an
automotive show right yes car cars
electronics show car and that was I
don't think it's been more true than
this year crux yeah
and of course it always revolves around
three themes there's connected car
there's autonomous driving and there's
electrification and we hit on all three
of those so we get here faraday future
hyped event this is the mysterious car
company we didn't know where they were
getting their money now we do now we do
that was the only news so they brought
us to this event that was remote from
the rest of CES yes long way to unveil
this car that is nothing really i mean
it's it's a design exercises design it's
like could we put it's like when a kid
goes to automotive design school they
have a senior project yes and that's
their senior project yep and apparently
when you are a world-famous designer
after making gorgeous supercars you
continue making senior projects the
money is real the car as far as we know
if not is no well well that from 01 is
it anyway yeah maybe they have a real
car somewhere yeah so that happened and
then the next day for had some
announcements right yes if Ford had
their press conference in the morning
right 730am prank you forward we
appreciate that guys and they they
announced
they are tripling the size of their
autonomous research fleet this year from
10 to 30 cars yeah they claim it'll make
them the largest they'll have the
largest autonomous research fleet of any
automaker yes an automaker right they
never specifically said automaker
because Google has a few more cars than
that I think people as 50 yeah something
like that between california and n texas
right oh man out support for carplay and
android auto yeah i'm lee and that's
good took it well considering the
history of Ford's infotainment system it
was about time yeah via the Microsoft
Sync was not the best effort yeah the
puddle filled road to yes way and
Android Ottawa but we have moved on
we've moved on we've moved on to other
bigger and better and now we've got car
place ok let's go really go to that you
wrote about this they're adding or
they're experimenting with Amazon echo
yes they have ideas for the future of
connected cars yes and they said they
had things that they were working on but
they weren't ready to release yet
and one of those was was connecting to
amazon echo and so you could do things
like in your house tell your amazon echo
to start your car so if you want to get
it warmed up in the wintertime right or
tell me the range of my car which is
important for electric cars you know how
much charge does it have Ford did not
announce something that was rumored
forward and out did not announce yes
Ford did not announce that they would be
building cars with Google which had been
heavily rumored and supposedly well
sourced and oh my goodness this is
coming this is going to be the big news
of CES Google and for going to build
cars together and nothing not a word
sofort happened and then GM was the next
day yes GM
blew it out here yeah star of the show
yeah that will the crazy thing about
that is that we knew it was coming we
knew it was coming we knew what they
were going to launch we knew what they
were gonna launch so
GM showed the sheva the production
version of the chevy volt which debuted
as a gas car at the detroit auto show
laughs here yes so nine months later ten
months later whatever yeah load actually
close to 12 at what it's like to be one
week that's true yes so they they showed
the production version of the bowl which
is let me give you a rundown of the
basics it's a it's a small EV with a
promise 200 plus mile range for around
thirty thousand dollars after tax rates
yes federal tax for a federal tax breaks
your state may have more your state may
have more fun around 30 grams and the
reason that's a big deal is because the
only high range
the eds that come within an approximate
range of a gas car are really expensive
yes and there's really one that's
there's Tesla
so
yes
your car is lovely and yeah so weird
it's going to be very difficult to
record a show so people rubbing we're
the annoying guy in Fast and Furious we
are the annoying guy and Ferrari yeah
only we're not going to race them
because we have better gets the strip
and where why are you gonna go I'm gonna
get to the red light faster than you
yeah now yeah in a drag racing on the
strip going going full tokyo drift on
the strip right now would be explored
now for am baby for a maybe now now
we'll bring it back out uh anyway so the
bolt yes new is coming we knew it was
coming i had a chance to drive it
briefly on before before before was
announced because you're a baller
because i'm a baller yeah that's correct
and you drove it and what did you think
I drove it and the way I put it in my
article and I believe this to be true is
that it is very unremarkable
it doesn't stand out in any way it's
just and that's it other than seeming
like a solid car it's a solid car it's a
practical car and that's what the EV
industry needs right now is a car that
can say hey we can be your primary car
like this is a livable yet to make a
comparison it's it's like corolla s and
it's boringness yeah which is fine
because Toyota selves a boatload of
Corollas right and they're a great car
and so that's pretty high praise I think
right and we'll see if it arrives as as
prey as claimed that's right but I think
I think they're doing pretty good i
drove it as well and I agree it's you
know it's it's perfectly adequate
perfectly that's a good weekend and you
know if it goes 200 miles for a lot of
people that's going to be way better
than 85 miles you get in the leaf i
thinkI think yeah any of the Denny of
those cars and fine and the infotainment
system is is unique to the bowl yes it's
made by LG they're very proud of it on
behalf of GM and I think it's really
good I think it's better than any
entertainment system GM's ever made
that's not saying a lot but it's pretty
good
and it supports car cleaning
I found the classic rock road trip
playlist oh no no no so dr. GM I think
we have BMW Toby also i've had a busy
CES BMW had a busy CES BMW really like
CES they they've been coming out here
for years they'd run some wacky stuff
here they did the self drifting car a
couple years ago I'm so disappointed
that I missed that oh it was so much fun
they last year they did the self-parking
i3 and the collision avoidance i three
and then this year you had a chance to
demo it yeah they had what they called
the eyes vision future interaction
concept which is an i8 spyder yeah it's
hard that doesn't exist by the way you
can't buy one they took a nice fighter
and
and did a bunch of producing stuff in
there yes they did so it the last couple
years of CES and really of car shows in
general have been car companies talking
about how autonomous cars are going to
be here real soon now and it seems that
this is actually true now and so what
car companies are doing is thinking
about rather than the technology to make
the car drive itself it's now focused on
the driver what you're going to do while
the car is ferrying you down the highway
right okay so as the thing called air
touch which is sort of like a how would
I just it's an iPad but instead of
touching the screen you just sort of
wave your hand around like you are
touching an ipad 4 10 there's an iPad
and you can swipe swipe back and forth
you can sort of move up and down and
then there's a button on the steering
wheel that you press to make selections
so it's their vision for what you might
do and it's a concept they may or may
not make it but it's pretty neat and
it's nice to see them thinking outside
the box and what I'm most excited about
about the this feature is that it means
that autonomous cars really are close
and so did the system feel like natural
to you
is it easy to use yeah so there were
there were two ways to use it one there
was a line of cameras tiny tiny cameras
running around the edge of the dash and
you could wave your hand in front of it
and they would see you and you could do
that or down in the center console where
the eye dr would be on a standard BMW
you could wave your hand magically over
the leather armrest and there were
sensors in it and it would notice that
your hand was moving around and you
could swipe back and forth with that and
I suspect that's the one that will make
it to the production car when the air
touch it's cool but it's a little
gimmicky and I'm not a huge fan of
holding your hand up in the air and
doing things right but if you keep it
down there and use it that's a little
bit more natural and probably where
they're going to end up and I should
point out that last year BMW also
previewed the gesture control system
that ended up in the seventh series that
they launched later in 2015 yes so later
this year I believe we're supposed to be
getting a new five series 5 series so
maybe you see something like that yeah I
think
coming together
definitely got a little loose there how
to do that at least once it is in in
sport mode which I'm sure has some great
name in Italian and then it's somewhere
around that point in the week it all
became a blur yes because we were
getting for know you know we have what
we still have is Vito Oh vida we got
v-dub we didn't talk about v-dub we got
me dub with the hoodie yeah will you
Chris will you be my buddy oh I see your
buddy know what won't be my buddy I'm
sorry is the buddy its I like the look
but it's a little too kia soul for me oh
and the interior the interior ulta money
I understand it's a concept yeah but
doesn't it doesn't do it there kind of
is no interior it's like it's very
concept they've got a big screen thing
which okay fine I'm sure that's the
future big screens and cars as Tesla has
proven yeah big screens and cars of the
future but he I don't know I don't know
about that car they sure made a big deal
out of it they made a very big deal out
of it and you know what and the press
responded the presser so you know it had
cool stuff from my vantage point when i
was doing our v-dub live blog I can see
the front of the car which has LED
lights on it and they made it look like
a slot machine yeah which was pretty
cool yeah that's definitely a feature
that should never come to a production
vehicle definitely not a Department of
Transportation recruit no I don't think
so and definitely completely distracting
yeah is cool as a concept it was
great yep but uh yeah don't so the back
right buddy's cool let's talk background
about yeah
it it was teased before CES as being a
new electric long-range concept for
Volkswagen yes there were rumors flying
that it was a microbus throwback and
indeed it is time ever it's inspired by
inspired by the microbus and I would
argue that it likee I you know I'm not a
MicroBot bus like fanatic personally so
I can't speak to it that much but I just
think a lot of microphones five from it
no it's it's the microbus the whole
point of microphones you could live in
yeah you could pop the top and camp and
have your grill and have your you know
hippie girls in bikinis hanging out by
the beach or the lake or wherever and
this one doesn't have that this is a as
they call it the social car if which is
basically sexy yeah it's your buddy it's
basically an excuse to use some buzz
words right so i don't know i don't i'm
not sure what they were doing there but
that's okay
thanks for watching that's been our CES
