The Verge, and I'm here
at Sony's booth at IFA
2018, where the company
just announced it's new
Xperia XZ3 smartphone.
It's Sony's latest flag
ship and if you've seen
the company's XZ2 smartphone that released
earlier this year, it
should look really familiar.
There are a couple of
new things on the XZ3.
There's a new 6-inch OLED panel.
There's some new gesture controls,
some new swipe gestures and
some new AI functionality.
And it ships with Android
9.0 Pie, which is nice.
But on a whole, it's very iterative.
(techno sounds)
The display on the XZ3 is great.
It's a beautiful OLED panel,
has really great blacks,
really bright colors.
And Sony's again borrowed
the same curved glass
from the XZ2, so it's really
nice to hold in your hands.
It curves around all
the way and then curves
around all the way in the front.
It's really a seamless
hunk of glass and metal.
It's really nice to hold in your hands.
The big change here is that Sony's updated
the 5.7-inch LCD display on the ZX2,
to a 6-inch OLED display on the ZX3.
It's also shifted the form factor a bit,
the ZX2 had a 2:1 form factor.
This is an 18x9, so it's a little taller.
They have the same
Snapdragon 845 processor.
The have almost the same battery life,
or at least, almost the same battery size.
There are some new AI features.
So there's a new feature
were you can double tap
the side and have this little
contextual menu slide in.
It'll be populated with apps based on
your location and what you use.
So if you're commuting, on the morning
it'll pop up your music app.
If you're at work and you're in a meeting,
it'll show you your calendar.
Similarly, there's also a
new feature where you can
just take your phone out of
your pocket and hold it up
and it'll automatically give you a prompt.
Just tap the screen and launch the camera.
It's super slick when it works
but I had a couple issues
getting it to work in my
few minutes with testing
and, again, it's just a small update.
The cameras are pretty much the same.
There's an identical 19 megapixel sensor
on the back for the rear
camera, and the front camera
has been upgraded to a 13 megapixel lens.
There's also a new camera app which should
make things a bit easier too.
On the back of the phone,
there's a fingerprint scanner,
which is nice, considering
that up until the XZ2,
Sony's phones didn't really
have them on the back
and that's pretty much the natural place
that you'd want a fingerprint scanner.
And it's 2018, which
apparently we've decided is
the year of the smartphone notch,
and Sony's not gonna get
left out with a seemingly
decorative notch on the
back above the USB-C port.
This isn't a new practice for Sony either.
The company's historically been
releasing two flagships a year.
One at Mobile World
Congress in the winter,
and then one at IFA in the fall
but these phones really just
start to blend together.
We already had this with the Xperia XZ2,
which honestly there
were three versions of it
and they all just kind
of blurred together.
And at $900 for the upgrade,
which is what the XZ3
will cost when it launches
some time in October,
that's a lot to be asking for
such an iterative upgrade.
It's not that the XZ3 is a bad phone,
it's just that Sony's had
so much trouble getting
it's phones to, well, sell
in the past, that this is
such a small update that
it's really hard to see how
this will tip the scales in it's favor.
Still, if you are interested, it'll be
available for 900 bucks in the
US, or 700 pounds in London,
when it ships sometime in October.
