something else mo dudes house is a
10-gram ok Shima oh I apologize
ok Google Chinese interpreter ready when
you are
hey it's Shannon with the verge and
we're here to check out Google
assistants new interpreter mode which
can translate 27 languages in real time
this could be a real game-changer for a
concierge is or anyone who wants to
speak to somebody else who doesn't share
the same language if it works luckily
we're here at the concierge desk so
let's check it out ok let's start how
may I assist you Annie Hall which is
also being the doing all the tango hello
I want to find the flow field in
restaurant here restaurant
and he may talk wish on that's also
being the tank one yeah I'm sorry I
don't understand
Michonne thought that being the tank one
chance against Sue I want to find a
restaurant here to eat some food
what type of cuisine would you like to
have
these are cumulative the she-camel a
single time wash answer Europa is more
sheep on time' what's the shower you
didn't call me I want to eat western
food with steak I am a little allergic
to sin we have a lot of great options
here on property what time would you
like oh sure sure
thank you great you are confirmed so we
just tried out the Google assistant
interpreter mode it works pretty well
you do have to cause a lot to wait for
the translation to happen so if you
partially understand the other language
you can't just interrupt somebody in the
middle and say hey I dunno what you're
saying
let me just keep talking because then
the translation is interrupted it
doesn't work how may I assist you Oh
what could be in the translate I forgot
to pause and it actually works pretty
well at one point I thought I was
allergic to sand and not shrimp which
might be problematic for tourists coming
by but for the most part is pretty fluid
I would say the translation has been
pretty good the new interpreter mode
will be piloting today at hotel
concierge desks in New York San
Francisco and here in Las Vegas I
thought it was pretty funny like I was
like I'm allergic to sand and then I
don't know how he's good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
