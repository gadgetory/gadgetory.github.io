Congress just passed a bill that lets
internet providers sell your data
without permission the bill overturns a
rule passed under the Obama
administration which required Internet
service writers to actually ask for your
permission before they sell your data it
also required ISPs to protect your data
from hackers and inform customers of any
breaches this is pretty simple stuff I
mean just look at this bill who would
vote against this but the Republicans
just erased it
no one likes this even the comments
section on right Bart thinks it's stupid
so why and how did this happen well ISPs
hate that companies like Google and
Facebook can use your data and make a
ton of money by selling advertising this
new bill makes it easier for ISPs to run
those same kinds of ad networks ISPs
spend a ton of money lobbying Congress
and the Republicans in Congress
seemingly bought into the idea that ISPs
and Google should be subject to the same
kinds of regulations that argument is
extremely misleading if not straight-up
wrong Google and Facebook can't see your
entire web browsing history they can
only see what you click on while you're
using their services or websites
connected to their ad networks and
Google and Facebook provide you with
valuable free services in exchange for
that advertising well valuable and if
you don't think Google and Facebook are
valuable or you hate their data policies
you don't have to use them but you pay
for internet service you pay for it and
internet providers get to see almost
everything you do online because it's
their pipes and most people in America
don't have any choice between broadband
providers if you hate what your ISP is
doing with your data competition isn't
just another click away it might not
even exist
look if 18t Verizon and Comcast want to
have a big ad based business they
already can they can take their huge
profits and invest in building services
that are just as valuable people as
Google and Facebook and I'm sure a lot
of people gladly hand over their data if
those things are valuable enough but
that's hard work and I Spees don't want
to do it they just want to scoop up the
data they already had and sell it
without giving you anything back you'll
basically be paying them to eventually
sell your information and make no
mistake
all of these ISPs think selling ads in
the Internet
is a huge part of their future they're
all trying to control both the pipes and
the media that flows over them just
follow the billion-dollar deal trail
AT&amp;amp;T bought DirecTV and is working on
buying Time Warner Comcast bought NBC
Universal
by the way NBC Universal is an investor
in Vox media which owns the verge so hey
guys sorry about the video we're gonna
keep going but 18 t literally trialed a
plan where it charged it's in our
customers an additional $25 a month to
opt out the bad tracking this is
ridiculous
but here's the big one Verizon bought
AOL and Yahoo and a company's explicit
plan is to use AOL Zaid Tech and Yahoo
scale to become a major competitor at
Google in Facebook Verizon also modifies
every packet you send over its network
with tracking information they call them
super cookies which is very cute but
still evil and the company got in
trouble over them a while ago and it's
all still there unless you go and turn
off under the new bill the road is clear
for Verizon to combine the tracking
technology in its network with the
advertising technology it bought from
AOL Yahoo to create an ad tracking
juggernaut and it's not like your prices
are gonna go down when this happens your
prices never go down that's just not how
any of this works no matter what they
promise you okay just as an aside did
you know that FCC Chairman LG pie was
Verizon's associate general counsel for
two years before entering the government
what a surprise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
