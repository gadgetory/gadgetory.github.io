with photography for the past 75 years
the cameras were behind some of the most
iconic images taken at the 20th century
yet even Hasselblad's Envy abour
reputation wasn't enough to protect it
from the onslaught of the digital
revolution I remember at the time
thinking that maybe this company's
better days were well and truly behind
it most medium format camera
manufacturers fell by the wayside taken
out by smaller cheaper lighter DSLRs I
sold all of my Hasselblad's over
fourteen years ago Hasselblad have just
released their h 6d a brand new camera
that offers some significant
improvements over the previous models
including a new autofocus system that
enables the photographer to lock onto a
specific point such as the subject I and
then recompose the camera even offers a
few features more commonly found on
today's smartphones and compact cameras
Wi-Fi touchscreen and even 4k video
recording but in truth you're not going
to be buying this camera for the gizmos
you're going to be buying it for the
amazing quality of the lenses and of
course a very high-end digital back when
it comes to digital backs big is most
definitely better the h-60 comes with
two options for the digital back a 50
megapixel sensor which comes in at
around $27,000 or a huge hundred
megapixel back which comes in with an
equally huge price of over $33,000 and
remember that doesn't include the price
of a lens my name is Barry Osteen
Embassy of House of blood leads 175
years since
Hausa but as a company existent victor
was a passionate bird photographer but
his biggest frustration was that had
those days the cameras was very big and
he started to develop his own camera is
a more kind of compact and easier to use
in a modularity way moreover there were
some iconic moments that were captured
on a husband
The Beatles Crossing Abbey Road Steve
Jobs portrait shot went to see a V as
what was the first camera on the moon
Buzz Aldrin shooting armstrong still 12
cameras on the moon and one came back at
the end as what has to
livers a platform where they can push
the creativity and we are just at the
end the enabler there are more pictures
being shot and viewed than any other
time in human history and most of those
are being uploaded to social media and
most of those a bit a size of six
hundred to a thousand pixels Apple are
even running shot on iphone ads on
billboards and bus sites clearly
printing high-resolution images from 12
or even an 8 megapixel smartphone camera
isn't a problem these days there are
plenty of DSLRs mirrorless cameras out
there and most of them only cost two or
three grand there are in fact a few
practical reasons why you need a camera
like this the food photographer can
capture my new detail in the still life
of raw vegetables or a fashion
photographer can capture a resting image
with tonal variation and texture in the
clothing that a lesser camera simply
can't match if you're a technical
photographer you can shoot macro shots
with a level of clarity that means you
could print them out the size of a house
and all of these pictures can be shot on
a camera that's still small and light
enough to be handheld but smaller light
still relative terms there's no way a
blad is as practical as a DSLR they'll
learn it fun there's still undeniably
big heavy and slow yet in many ways I
don't know that that's such a bad thing
we snap pictures with our phones we take
pictures with a hassle web cameras like
this inspire a considered approach to
photography when I shoot with a blad I
think more about the picture that I'm
trying to take I align the composition
better
I don't just snap off a few frames
quickly and then think that I'll find
the best one later the camera doesn't
shoot more than a few frames a second
it's not a rapid-fire experience it
makes you slow down even if it's just by
a few seconds and almost ask you do you
want to take this picture is this just
okay or is this really good and when you
finally do press that shutter you're
rewarded with images packed with
incredible detail and a gorgeously wide
dynamic range but do professional
photographers really need to buy this
camera my answer is most definitely no
thinking back over the past couple of
years I can't even remember a time when
shooting on a Hasselblad has even
entered my head I've always known that
my DSLR workhorse will be more than
enough
job the h-60 truly does deliver on the
promise it's like the difference between
a regular screen and a Retina screen
it's not that you ever thought your
standard screen was bad it's just you
never realized that it could be this
good and that really sums up the house
of Ladd h-60 for me it's not that other
digital cameras are bad and the smart
phone you have with you will always be
better than the DSLR you don't but
that's not really the issue here
you don't buy an Aston Martin so you can
go shopping at the mall you buy it
because you want to go for a drive
buying a Hasselblad isn't a practical
decision it's an emotional one or at
least it always used to be with the h 6d
I think maybe it will be again we used
plenty of handcrafted aluminium and even
though I'm stopped smiling it's not that
the edge Christ more on your bus is
leaving here we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
