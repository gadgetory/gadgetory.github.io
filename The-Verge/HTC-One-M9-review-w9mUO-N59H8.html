best design phone from a company that
talks an awful lot about design the one
of mate was fast and beautiful but it
had a couple critical flaws it had a too
slippery finish and more importantly a
camera that just couldn't keep pace with
the rest of the field
now HTC has launched the one m9 a
successor to the m8 designed to
specifically address those two faults
while still keeping the rest of what
made last year's phone so great the one
m9 is so similar to the one m8 it's
really hard to tell them apart
both are virtually all aluminium both
have 5-inch 1080p displays that look
really great and both have two
front-facing really loud boom sound
speakers believe it or not the speakers
are even louder this time around the m9
is a subtle refinement of the MAS design
the sides of sharper edges and the power
button has been moved from the top to
the side even with Samsung's renewed
focus on design for the galaxy s6 HTC is
still leading the Android pack in design
and manufacturing abilities and the m9
is both better looking and nicer feeling
than Samsung's new models despite being
so similar to the m8 the m9 is somehow
less slippery than before and it doesn't
slide out of my hands as easily it's
slightly shorter and ever so slightly
thicker than last year's model yet it
doesn't really feel any different in my
hands or in my pockets the power button
on the side is much easier to reach than
when it was on the top but it's too
easily confused with the volume buttons
the m9 is a new color option it's a
two-tone silver and gold finish that has
more shine than the dull finishes of
last year's model HTC compares it to
jewellery but I really wouldn't go that
far
it still looks like a gadget to me if
you're like me and you're not really a
fan of that two-tone look HTC is
offering all gold black and even pink
options as alternatives but what
everyone really wants to know about the
One m9 is if the camera is actually any
better this time around
this year the low resolution ultra pixel
camera and gimmicky duo lens system have
been swapped for a more traditional 20
megapixel camera on the back of the
phone that ultra pixel camera is
actually still here it's just on the
front of the m9 and it works pretty well
for low-light selfies sadly the main
camera is a disappointment
it opens focuses and takes pictures
quickly enough and it has a resolution
that the m8 lacked but it just doesn't
take great photos in medium to low light
conditions and those are the areas when
you're taking the most photos with your
phone there's just so much noise noise
reduction ugly color casts and
unpleasant blooming and
highlights it feels more like a camera
from a smartphone in 2011 then a 2015
flagship HTC's camera software is
actually great to use it gives you a lot
of control over things like exposure and
white balance but the end photo result
is just bad the camera was the one thing
I wish was better than the m8 but in
many instances it's actually worse on
the m9 last year's m8 was a fast phone
but the m9 is a whole nother level it's
easily the fastest Android phone of ever
used that never have to wait for apps to
load or home screens to redraw
themselves that's largely thanks to the
new Snapdragon 810 processor and three
gigabytes of RAM both of which are
upgrades over last year's model HTC
software that sits on Android 5.0
lollipop is also quick it's a new
version of sense that looks largely the
same as before the big differences here
are a new theming engine you can
customize things like your fonts icons
wallpapers sounds and more with
downloadable packs or even from a
picture that you take and then there's
this new home screen widget that tracks
your location and tries to predict which
apps you'll use when you're home at work
or out and about the theming feature is
neat it's fun to play with and it's more
comprehensive than I expected but that
smart widget just isn't particularly
useful it took a long time to learn my
habits and includes a folder of
suggested apps that were completely
irrelevant to my interests fortunately
you can just trash that widget or use
another contextual predictive launcher
that works better to achieve the same
effect
HTC's other software features such as
blink feed and Zoe or present and just
as easily ignored this time around
there's a new photo editor it's got
various effects and filters but it's not
really any better or different from
popular third-party apps the m9 battery
is slightly larger than the m8 but in my
experience the phone stamina was just
about the same as last year it goes
anywhere from 14 to 20 hours depending
on my usage and it's enough to get me
through an entire day but not really
much more it doesn't have a long battery
life of larger phablets but if you're
accustomed to charging your smartphone
every night anyways
it'll get the job done and that really
sums up the m9 it's a beautifully
designed phone that's built well
performs well it's a pleasure to use and
takes really lousy photos it's virtually
the same story as last year which is not
only a disappointment but it won't do
anything to improve HTC's position
against the rest of the field with
Samsung finally paying attention to
design and the iPhone 6 taking better
photos and most point-and-shoot cameras
can do it's hard to see how HECS effort
is going to make much of a difference
perhaps next year they'll figure it out
but it didn't happen this time around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
