it's January 8 2013 i'm brian bishop and
i can see through space and time this is
90 seconds on the verge presented by
ford last night qualcomm gable is
without question the craziest
presentation of CES so far CEO dr. paul
jacobs at an in-house and online
audience through a surreal mind trip of
awkward moments cringe-worthy
performances and general strangeness
steve ballmer big bird room five
lip-syncing to dido that all happened
check out our supercut trust me on this
one we're out here at CES it's 0 l ed as
far as the eye can see samsung and LG
spar today with a pair of curved OLED
televisions both claiming to be the
world's first the idea is that a curse
screen is more immersive Samsung even
says it has an imax field looking ahead
both Sony and Panasonic showed off 4k
OLED TVs both of prototypes the
combination of 4k no I was frankly
stunning we're sure they'll be
affordable eventually what we watch in
those televisions sony has an answer the
company announced we'll be rolling out
its own solution to the biggest problem
with 4k the fact that there's nothing to
watch while details are still scarce CEO
caused her Ayatollah stats onecys 4k
delivery as a differentiator and the
service would be similar to Video
Unlimited it's riff on the iTunes movie
store he'll be launching sometime this
summer it might not be alone at
Samsung's booth there's a demonstration
of at Netflix for Kate's demonstration
right now and those were today's top
stories join us tomorrow we'll wait for
reviewing Swan Lake as performed by
dancing vacuum cleaner robots</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
