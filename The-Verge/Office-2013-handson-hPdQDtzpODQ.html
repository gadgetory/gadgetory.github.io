we're here looking at office 2013 which
just released into public preview today
for Windows 7 and Windows 8 there's a
lot news so let's jump in now the first
one is word which everyone's pretty much
familiar with by now and not that much
has actually changed you still get the
ribbon but you can fortunately hide it
now so you get a slightly better view of
what you're looking at there's also a
new full-screen mode which gives you
kind of a distraction-free look and
everything is technically able to be
touched but it's not really optimized
for it you still get a lot of small
icons and things can be kind of hard to
tap but it's you know it's there for
touch if you really decide you want to
write a word document using your fingers
there are a few new features that
actually do work for touch there's a
reading view which lets you take
whichever document you're looking at and
basically lay it out like a book and
then you can swipe through it it's nice
for you know if you have a long document
that you want to read without having one
long scrolling page but other than that
it's pretty much the word everyone has
you know known and loved and it has you
can edit PDFs now which is great you can
just pull a PDF straight into Word and
edit it there and then re-save it as a
PDF you've always been able to do that
but it's always been kind of a pain now
it's much easier and there's some new
layout tools if you want to add images
or anything like that to your documents
it's much much easier to do than it used
to be next is Excel Excel has not
changed much either it has a new start
screen just like the rest of the other
apps which gives you access to a bunch
of different templates which lets you
layout your documentary or chart however
you want to and it's a lot more helpful
in Excel than some other places because
you're dealing with kind of complicated
data sometimes but again it's very much
the same as before you can hide or show
the ribbon depending on how much screen
real estate you want there are some new
tools for visualizing your data but for
input again it's not great for touch and
it's still pretty keyboard and mouse
driven it's a little cleaner and a
little nicer to look at but really not
that much different PowerPoint is one of
the apps that actually benefits the most
from touch since you might do a lot of
presenting or flipping through slides it
actually makes some sense to have
enabled on a touchscreen device as you
can see you get the same start screen as
always you can easily open doc
this goes for all of the word documents
you can open docs from SkyDrive or on
your computer or you get a quick look at
whatever documents you've had open
recently once you have a presentation
ready actually presenting it is made a
lot better in office 2013 you get a
whole new look for your presentation
where you can see notes and your slides
and you can easily just tap from one to
the next you can quickly change all
kinds of settings and it's just a really
nice way that actually makes sense with
touch to show PowerPoint presentations
you get some of the same layout tools
when you're designing documents as
before but again there's really nothing
special other than that presentation
mode outlook on the other hand did
actually get some significant changes
the look is now totally different you
get it's a similar kind of three paned
view but it almost feels like a metro
app with a lot of swiping back and forth
and it's much more touch enabled so if
you have your hand on either side it's
pretty easy to scroll through a message
or navigate around it's just a much
better app than we're used to from
Outlook which has always been kind of
cluttered and slow and clunky again the
ribbon is here and you can hide it or
show it I don't know why you would ever
show it but it's here and one of the
other cool things is called peeks you
can easily see what you have on your
calendar while you're in your email and
it's actually a live preview so you can
add things to your calendar straight
from your email and it's just a nice way
to have everything all in one view
outlook is also now much better with
Gmail it syncs with active sync I have a
gmail account set up here and I used to
be really slow sinking through IMAP but
now it uses active sync so it will sync
your calendar and your contacts and your
mail all automatically and all really
seamlessly it's also integrated with
obviously the people app which is one of
the big things on Windows 8 it will
bring your contacts in and show all of
their accounts across various different
networks and it's just a really nice
system for seeing people all in one
place the last app there are a bunch
here but the last interesting app is is
OneNote and there's a desktop app for it
now but there's also going to be a metro
app styled just for Windows RT the
desktop app looks just like it used to
is again very simple and kind of
redesigned to be much less cluttered
this also works relatively well for
touch you get the kind of
right in the left rail and it's easy to
type but as always it's very much a
keyboard and mouse based system one
notes always been a favorite of ours and
it's a pretty good app here too as I
mentioned though what's newest here is
the strategy everything's connected
through office 365 and SkyDrive and even
the business model is different where
you pay for a subscription rather than
just buying the disk we're not sure on
what pricing is going to be yet but we
do know that when our T devices will
come with office when they ships
beginning in October overall office 2013
isn't a huge step forward yet but it's
definitely moving in the right direction
for Microsoft</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
