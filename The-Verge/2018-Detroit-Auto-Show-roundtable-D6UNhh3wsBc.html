I'm Tamra Warren from the verge I'm with
Andrew Hawkins and Sean O'Kane our
transportation team and we're going to
tell you about all the news at the
Detroit Auto Show so I think we should
start with probably the biggest news of
the show what kicked off the show which
was four decided to dramatically
increase its promise for how much it's
investing in electric cars
how many electric cars it wants to build
it's sort of bridge the gap between CES
last week and Las Vegas to Detroit this
week and you're at the story why don't
you give us a little bit more
information about what it was before we
talked about it sure so I think it was
in 2015 that Ford said that they were
gonna spend around four and a half
billion dollars on electric cars and
they were gonna have around two dozen of
them and they were going to be rolling
out sometime in the 2020s now they say
that they're gonna spend eleven billion
dollars more than doubling the amount
that they said that they were originally
gonna spend we're gonna start seeing
some of those battery electric cars
rolling out a little bit sooner maybe
2019 so I think it's it's a big deal
that Ford says they want to spend this
much money whether or not they get that
you know this produces vehicles that
people actually want to buy and drive
and can drive like there's an
infrastructure in place that people can
charge these cars I think is gonna be
the real big question that I think
facing forward and all companies that
are making electric cars well I was
gonna say they showed up they did this
and they showed up with a diesel f-150
so I mean like there you go no what does
it mean in the short term it feels like
it doesn't mean much in the short term
right
and it's also even the charging network
to that I'm wondering a part of this
investment is investment in the
infrastructure I mean they talked a lot
at CES which was just a few days ago
seems like a year ago but where Ford
talked about really wanting to be
involved in smart cities and so I'm
curious if these two strategies meet or
if they're just separate ideas
fishing in the pond I mean they almost
have to have some sort of infrastructure
investment because I mean that's what
makes Tesla such an exciting company
yeah sure they miss all their deadlines
and sometimes their cars are a little
janky but they also have sort of this
like complete picture of electric
vehicles right they they have the cars
they have the charging network with the
superchargers they have the the solar
panels in terms of in the battery power
the the home chargers for people's homes
so they sort of present this clear
picture where it's like a welder wheel
type of investment so let's talk about
some of the other big news of the show
Mercedes came out with the new g wagon
that was that was for sure the craziest
event we saw all week hands down you
should go watch the video if you haven't
already it involves fire shooting up
from a mountain on the stage and an old
theater and also on the neck are doing
shots of schnapps
why did Mercedes go so far pulling out
all the stops to announce this new G
Wagon I mean the G Wagon is it is a
ridiculous car like it's a huge it's
it's expensive as the s-class it's this
massive wagon that are a massive SUV
that dates back to the 60s as well
another another move in that play but
it's a lunchbox on wheels
yeah it's boxy it's square lots of power
it's not particularly comfortable to
ride in so it doesn't have like what
Range Rover has which is that it's
evolved over time but it's also
completely like look at me I'm
ostentatious and it's all about the body
of it which is why they brought a former
bodybuilder and the former governor of
California to introduce this car along
with Dieter Zetsche who is the CEO of
Doppler and so it's it was all about
spectacle and if you're gonna do it do
it big and that's what they did by
having this event at the Michigan
Theater an iconic theater that's
decaying and falling apart and I thought
the buyer going off and I thought the
most telling aspect of that announcement
was when Schwarzenegger asked dieter
whether or not there was going to be an
electric version
of the g-wagen coming out and he had
apparently retrofitted his own g-wagen
to be to run on a battery electric power
deer kind of hemmed in hot he's like Oh
our lineup is going to be electric at
some point and he kind of press them a
little bit but you know I think that
that's sort of like it speaks to this
sort of like this internal conflict that
all these automakers are facing they
want to you know sort of like you know
speak to their audience people want to
buy
you know these cuts the types of cars
that people buy are not electric cars
but at the same time they feel like they
have to sort of trudge their way into
the future with electric let's talk
about the Jetta well that's the type of
car people buy right this is it this is
an accessible car this isn't a car
that's affordable it's a car that we see
out on the road and it got a little bit
of a refresh to see I think the most
interesting thing about the Jetta is
we've seen Volkswagen overcorrect maybe
a little bit post dieselgate and and
sort of try to make themselves seen like
a better more clean company than hey
obviously were well they're definitely
trying to grab on to this like this this
place that they hold in American history
where they're this iconic brand and this
is the microfiber normal thing I think
we've seen them do since these okay
right like it here it is here's the
Jetta there's not really anything
special about it it'll probably still
sell pretty well it's not electric it's
not hybrid it's just like here it like
that was I think the the funniest thing
about the Jetta announcement to me that
that Volkswagen feels comfortable enough
that they can just sort of get back into
the groove now
as opposed to making big claims about oh
you know we want to electrify our entire
lineup by 2020 whatever you know it was
it was the first time that companies
felt normal and a little wild like I
don't know if consumers are ready to
give them credit for that I don't know
if the press isn't ready to give them
credit for that but like they're trying
but their sales are there which is
totally crazy to me that dieselgate or
not people kept buying their cars yeah
so it was time for them to get back to
you yes and also what does I mean they
did a great job of marketing diesel as
as clean technology it just wasn't true
let's talk about some of the weird
screens that we've seen especially in
some of the concepts we've talked a lot
about the cars that are actually going
to be on sale but there were a couple of
interesting concepts that came out at
the show this week the the infinite EQ
inspiration I think was a real
noteworthy one who described it as a
land yacht for movie villains Yeah right
like for Bond villain specifically I was
intrigued by it coming into this show
because the the teaser image they
released looked like a lot like the
Lucid air or the Model S that had this
sort of like stout rear end and it just
had that sort of vibe that sort of curve
in the ceiling of it and it looks
totally different here on the show floor
it actually impressed me more than I
thought it would it is like the name
suggests supposed to be an inspiration
for
infinity's design going forward and I've
never particularly liked infinity's
design and this one actually sort of
strikes me as different and like a
thoughtful reimagining of like what
their cars look like and so I'm excited
to see where that goes
one thing I thought was interesting even
though it sounds ridiculous in their
press releases they talked about this
whole concept of there's like a Zen mode
that like before or after you drive the
screen will enter the Zen mode to try
and like calm you down and it's like
that's a ridiculous idea and it's not
something that's going to come to a
production car but it I think at least I
hope means that they're thinking about
things like that and not using the
screen to just horribly distract you
while you're driving because this also
isn't a concept where you know the seats
turn and it's all about full autonomy
it's like it's it's still very much a
car you're gonna drive maybe with some
assistance from Nissan's pro pilot but
you're still going to drive this thing
the seat you know it's built like a card
which is a way that we no contrast to
the Nissan cross-motion SUV concept that
Nissan introduced Nissan obviously owns
infinity but the cost motion SUV was not
my favorite car of the show but I
definitely think it was the most
interesting in terms of like how they
were sort of tackling this idea of the
the how the car's interior is going to
change there was also a sort of pillar
to pillar screen on the on the in the
front of the seventh screen on the
center console one and there one in the
roof two of the sides
it was just like everybody else as far
as the eye could see plus there was a a
virtual personal assistant that was a
koi fish that would swim across all the
screens and tell you about some of the
places that you were seeing as you were
autonomously driving through whatever
city you were driving through here's a
McDonald's the koi fish would say or
have some sort of advertising tie-in no
doubt but so those concepts concepts are
fun they're cool to look at they're cool
to sort of pour over and and debate but
it's still a show about trucks and suv's
it is and I mean one thing I'm thinking
about what you're saying being here the
reason to still come to an Auto Show is
to actually see everything in physical
form because oftentimes what we see in
pictures looks very different in person
and so we're all here as media covering
the new announcements but when the
public day is open on Saturday this is
where people will come to do their car
shopping yeah and so what are they
shopping for the best selling vehicles
are trucks and SUVs and also something
that we've we've seen since last year's
that we saw some dips and sales numbers
and the auto industry so this show is
critical for them to to get to that
place where they can have koi fish
swimming on their screens right so so we
saw a lot of big announcements from
the big three who love to like make a
splash in Detroit this is their hometown
their front page news and the local
papers it's important to them people who
live here work for these companies on
all levels and they get some get perks
on driving these cars it makes it's a
sense of pride and it's also sort of a
insider competition and so what we saw
here was those wars are still going on
the first reveal was the Chevy Silverado
pickup truck it's a big pickup truck
with lots of features and you can have
eight different trim levels it's just
really going into the heart of what
pickup truck drivers what in their in
their vehicles which is power payload
towing and all and increasingly what we
saw in the other truck that we just
mentioned which is the RAM 1500 and
another big seller neck and neck with
the Silverado for sales in the US market
super important for the success of FCA's
future is selling that truck this year
and so that's what we're seeing here and
then and the other the other side of
that is this in the mid size range Ford
had the Ford Ranger on display and Shawn
I think you described the Ford Ranger
really well yes it's a tumbler truck
yeah it's like what you want if you're
if you're a younger person in this
country and you like maybe want to go
camping but maybe not maybe you just
want to appear like you're going camping
like this is what Ford's going after
it's like Toyota has owned this part of
the market for the last decade probably
with its smaller pickups and so this is
for trying to get into that game I think
what's really interesting to me about
trucks and SUVs and all the stuff we've
seen in the the larger vehicle space is
that it's finally starting to really
bleed over we see the Lexus LF one
concept here is an SUV the Mach 1
electric car that Ford is teasing is
like probably a crossover of some kind
and so we are seeing a lot of concept
sedans and coupes but like we're
starting to get to a point where all
just seeing bigger stuff and like
they're imagining maybe they don't have
to be electric maybe they can be hybrid
and that way we can still make them real
big right well part of the announcement
from Ford it was the Ford f-150 that's
coming that will also not be the
traditional gas guzzler that we've known
I mean they've gone increasingly lighter
by the last generation using a low
minimum frame but we're seeing that
happen across the space so it's like all
these worlds are starting to come
together and maybe what is also is
interesting too is that you're coming
from CES where everything was kind of
crazy and out there so it's hard to been
at CES and seen the future to come here
and really be impressed with the present
so what do you think both CES and
Detroit are telling us about where we
see things heading with the car industry
and the transportation industry in 2018
and 2019 my take was that this is gonna
be sort of this is like the calm before
the storm you see I mean like this is
about the reality of the car business
this is what they sell trucks SUVs let's
make some money
CES is more aspirational it's about the
future it's about ride-sharing it's
about autonomy it's about things like
the Toyota concept of the e pallet where
we're gonna have all these sort of like
self-driving retail businesses the
board's got its self-driving Domino's
Pizza Delivery car here but at the same
time it sort of shunted off to the side
it's tucked in the corner it's not being
given as much prominence as the Mustang
or the Ranger so I feel like you know
it's we're starting to see like an
industry in transition but there's still
like a lot of fundamental realities that
they're dealing with maybe there's a
little bit of denial mixed in with a
little bit of it you know there's like a
resistance they don't want to go whole
hog on the autonomy and and and the ride
sharing and the idea that they're gonna
be losing money in the future because
these are technologies that are going to
come out and it's gonna rob them of like
40 percent of their profitability and
that's like got them probably scared to
death it's it's an interesting thing
because you think about the idea of
brands here like the brands are still
the car companies we're at CES the car
companies often sought to partner with
earlier brands and then you think about
the screens that are gonna be in all
these cars and that's advertising space
and so I think that's an interesting
thing that we're all seeing is that
these names that mean something in our
consumer lives whether it's Amazon or
something like Domino's or Pizza Hut
it's it's things that we know creeping
into our personal space in the cars as
we move toward autonomous driving and
another part of that is within the next
10 years they every executive you talk
to tell us we're gonna see more change
in the auto industry than we have since
the Model T was produced right right I
think these two shows back-to-back
helped us see that there's some things
they're actually starting to like
coagulate like we're we're finally
starting to see all these balls have
been up in the air
autonomy electric electrification all
this stuff and and now we can actually
sort of see where it's headed in the
sense that everybody's been talking
about the cars no one's been talking
about the infrastructure to support
electric cars and so we're probably
gonna just see a whole bunch of hybrids
up until we get to the point where
electric cars are viable for everyone
everywhere which is still a ways out and
once we get to that point then we'll
probably have these sort of other
services creeping in at the edges in
cities and hopefully outside of cities
where you will be able to pale like a
self-driving lift like I got to ride in
in Vegas and we also seen that even
before these two shows you know like all
these companies talk about the
electrification of their fleets not
electric cars and they're trying to like
Bank off the goodwill of electric cars
by saying that but also talking about
hybrids insight that that seems to be
the clear path forward you know 2018
2019 2020 we're gonna get more electric
motors in these cars but they don't
exclusively be like
on the way to eventually maybe getting
there it's like the companies like Ford
thinks that you're more likely to buy an
electric car if it's an electric Mustang
if it's a nameplate that you recognize
maybe it's an easier transition for the
public but you know it's like it's a
crazy show every year yeah
it's always a lot of fun to see the
ideas that people are bouncing around
we'll be back next year again talking
about all this stuff probably and
scolding the companies that aren't doing
a good job and you know drooling over
the cars that seem like they're gonna be
badass to drive so thanks for watching
