vacation or going local I spent as much
time there during the summer as I
possibly can it's a place for me to
collect my thoughts and ponder my
minuscule existence in the vastness that
is the universe it's also just a ton of
fun I love playing in the water
skateboarding on the boardwalk surfing
you name it for me going to the beach is
always a great time the beach also kind
of sucks it's hot and there's sand
everywhere which I find in my shoes and
in my clothes days or even weeks after I
go and there are no power outlets which
is fine for some people but I don't want
to leave the beach with a dead phone so
if I'm gonna track all the way out to
the beach we're gonna have to solve some
of these problems first
I've done some really crazy stuff with
action cameras for The Verge everything
from riding skateboards to go-karts to
planes to Indy cars so if there's
anything that's gonna get me into the
water it might be that so we reached out
to Mikey to temple who's a filmmaker and
a pro surfer to see what he could do
with GoPros newest camera this is a guy
that's shot all over the world with just
about every kind of camera you could
imagine how did you get started in
surfing and filmmaking I had gone on a
trip to the Maldives we were sailing
around from I told it's all like a dream
trip and I was going man how do how do
we not have someone shooting motion on
this right now I got a friend in Florida
who there's a really great filmmaker I
was like hey let's let's make a surf
film
we'll go travel around the world we do
like five or six trips I have no clue
what I was doing and that's kind of what
what started my filmmaking and from
there I haven't stopped Mikey took us
out to one of the private beaches near
his home in Montauk whoa
it's a camera technology you know were
you able to use waterproof cameras the
first surf film I did we actually did on
all super 16 so a Bolex water housing
it's like pretty much the biggest
nightmare there is so we got the newest
GoPro here's the gopro hero4 session and
i'm curious what you think something
that's this small and this waterproof
out of the box does for a surfing
expedition if you want to bring this on
a shoot that being that it's that much
smaller is insane yeah that's the only
problem with them the bigger one is it's
a lot it's a big commitment when you
take it in the water if you're shooting
with it in your mouth or if you have a
handle with it or something like that
you have to pay attention yeah you've
got it you've got this thing but that
could change things even more than the
GoPro already has this thing tops out
around 1080p 1440p it doesn't have 4k is
that something you worry about as a
filmmaker I mean everything has
limitations but as long as it's shooting
60 at 1080 if that's all you really need
Mikey was only out there for a few
minutes but he was still able to get
some pretty amazing shots like this POV
shot from his hand which was using
GoPros new hand mouth but the waves
weren't large enough for him to do much
more than that or for us to get out
there ourselves so we went to our backup
plan so Mikey we brought along this
underwater sea scooter thing yeah and
you can just really just like take it
it's like you're James Bond under there
sounds like something I'm gonna need
I've never surfed before the CDC scooter
is more or less a toy that pulls you in
the water at 3 miles an hour
it's fun but the choppy ocean gave us
some trouble especially for Sean every
time I went out there with it it just
felt like I was getting pushed around by
the water and not being pulled around by
the CD
so yeah it didn't work that great at
pulling us but it did allow us to get
some great underwater footage with the
GoPro we had somebody in the water
shooting with a Canon 5d Mark 3 and we
honestly like the GoPro footage better
it's more dynamic and plus the cameras
just so much smaller it was small enough
that we could forget about it and do
what you're supposed to do at the beach
and that's have a great time after Mikey
took off Sean and I set up camp inland
to check out some more Beach tech one of
the big problems I have was going to the
beach is there's sand everywhere so one
of the things I found is called the sand
dousset towel it's got a special
material on the bottom that not only
repels sand it also won't let water pass
through it so let's test this then to
see actually if it works right so yeah
that does a pretty good job of keeping
the water out yeah the nice thing about
this towel is it's not crazy expensive
and you can just find it online it's
made in Australia well ship it anywhere
in the world one thing that I think is
essential when you come to a beach is
having a way to play music as long as
I've been going to the beach with
friends or family we would always stop
and pick up a crappy $10 plug and
speaker and now we have Bluetooth
speakers
this is Logitech's UE roll it's
waterproof you could toss it around in
the sand and the best part is it
actually sounds good we have the JBL
pulse here too which is one of the
better Bluetooth speakers but it's not
waterproof no it's not waterproof in
we've been playing back and forth with
these all day I really think I like the
sound to that thing better right a
little bit cheaper too so I'm always
worried when I'm out here that my
phone's gonna die so what we brought
here is a gold zero solar panel charger
I really like the idea of this thing
it's a little cumbersome it's kind of
hard to set up there's a lot going on
yeah the wires just kind of like hang
out the back and everything like that so
if you're gonna be outside all day and
you want constant power and you have a
lot of sunlight I think it's a pretty
good option but it's not perfect so my
solution is just this little brick that
I got off Amazon it has a smaller
footprint overall but this thing is
pretty cool yeah but that thing you're
gonna be able to use indoors that's true
also yeah
alright Sean as someone who doesn't
often come to the beach what do you
think the coolest thing we looked at was
the thing that's probably gonna bring me
to the beach more than anything else
that we saw was the GoPro I really like
the idea of being able to get something
out of your Trek to the beach you know
whether it's some footage or some
pictures something like that but I think
all of this stuff is actually like worth
looking into if you want to like make
your beach experience a little bit
better not even so long ago five years
ago the idea of coming to the beach with
your phone with a good Bluetooth speaker
and being able to stay charged all day
was expensive and today it's really
simple to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
