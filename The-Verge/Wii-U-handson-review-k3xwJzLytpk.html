this is the Wii U it's Nintendo's
brand-new gaming console the Wii U is
partly Nintendo trying to move forward
into 2012 with better graphics and a
better machine but it's partly Nintendo
trying to keep doing what was so
successful on the Wii all those years
ago but let's sort with the hardware the
console itself is kind of huge it's
almost a foot long and it weighs about
three and a half pounds it's glossy and
it picks up fingerprints like crazy it's
just kind of ugly but fortunately you
can hide it in the stack by your TV and
never really pay attention to it then
there's the gamepad which is by far the
most interesting thing about the Wii U
it's also big and it actually feels like
a portable console by itself and it has
a 6.2 inch 854 by 480 touchscreen in the
middle along with two analog sticks a
directional pad for buttons and even a
microphone and front facing camera it
really is its own self-contained thing
now the screen is pretty good sharp
enough and colors look fine but it's not
nearly on the level of most tablets
we've seen the gamepad really dictates
how you use the console and there seems
to be a lot of debate over how best to
use the gamepad with the Wii U in some
cases it acts like a second screen
adding supplementary content and options
to what you already see on the TV other
times it's just a mirror showing exactly
what you see on the TV and that's when
it becomes most like a portable console
and I actually found myself going long
periods of time without looking at the
TV at all and just playing on the
gamepad then there are times when you
use the gamepad exclusively like when
you make a Mii character it's kind of
odd and it can all get kind of confusing
you're constantly seeing pop up saying
things like look at the TV or look at
the gamepad and it's not always clear
what you're actually supposed to be
doing or looking at I got to test six of
the Wii U launch titles and each of the
games works a little bit differently
Super Mario Brothers U is one of the
most fun games but it's really nothing
special for the Wii U it's just a really
good Mario game with the gameplay
mirrored on the gamepad and your TV
there's no lag at all and as long as
you're within 25 feet or so at the
console there's no interruption in the
connection either other games like
Nintendo land didn't do as much for me
the game is like a big amusement park
filled with rides and games you can play
but you spend a ton of time learning how
to play each game each game makes you
use a different combination of the
gamepad and the TV and it's just awkward
and confusing at times the games are a
lot of fun but it's just kind of a odd
world to navigate FIFA 13 has some of
the coolest features with the gamepad
you
can actually set your lineup on the fly
or even aim your shots and passes just
using the touchscreen but the resistive
touch screen on the gamepad is really
awful and everything takes so long to
actually get to register that you've
probably already been scored on anyway
Ninja Gaiden probably does the best job
of the games that I tested you don't
specifically need to use the gamepad and
you can actually always stay focused on
the TV but the gamepad lets you use
special moves or change weapons
it's just supplementary and it never
takes your focus away from the game
while you look up or down the gamepad is
central to almost everything you do but
there are other types of controllers as
well the Wii Remote from the last
generation system is required for almost
all multiplayer games and you don't get
one with the system which is a bummer
there's also a controller that's
basically the gamepad without the screen
which feels like a normal console
controller and it works ok too except
there's one weird big problem the
buttons are laid out differently from
any other console the most used button
is a which on every other console is
located on the bottom of the diamond of
buttons and here it's on the side it's
incredibly hard to get used to I never
did even after hours and hours of
playing games one thing we didn't really
get to test was the media features on
the Wii U which actually makes me kind
of nervous
a Nintendo really missed out with
Internet features on the Wii and though
there are apparently apps for Hulu
Netflix Amazon and YouTube on the Wii U
they're not here yet and might not make
launched at all at the moment the Wii U
just isn't a great console the gamepad
might be a really useful accessory at
some point but for now it's being used
poorly more often than it's being used
well when it works the system's a lot of
fun to play to know the graphics aren't
great but the Wii U could eventually
have the same kind of appeal as the Wii
now you can buy the Wii U for $299.99 or
get the deluxe version for three $49.99
the deluxe version gets you 32 gigs of
storage instead of eight plus a bunch of
stands and chargers and a copy of
Nintendo land you should definitely get
the deluxe package if only for the
storage but unless you really want to
buy it right now I'd say wait before you
buy the Wii U I think eventually more
developers will figure out the best way
is to use the gamepad but for now it's a
mix of really cool and complicated and
confusing and frustrating and most of
all wait and see what Microsoft and Sony
have coming next year
