launch a new model of their wine
preservation opener and basically it's
supposed to let you pour a wine without
actually opening the bottle by piercing
a needle straight through the cork
pumping in gas pouring out the wine and
then it's supposed to be able to just
sit there in the bottle as though it's
unopened after that so this new model is
called the model 11 and we're gonna see
it pour wine so it wakes up
automatically and then when you turn it
put it onto the device it turns greens
let you know it's good then you just
push it in and you're ready to pour and
right now it's pumping gas in to
displace the wine which then pours back
out as you see it's like a slower pour
than if you had fully opened it what's
cool is that you can now turn the bottle
upside down and it will not actually
pour out its resealed to support it's
kind of flexible and dispose it back in
but it's pretty neat so this is their
first connected model and it has
Bluetooth built in it connects to an
iPhone app actually like a bizarrely
gorgeous app for like a wine opening
device it's able to tell you if you need
to replace different parts of the wine
opener you need to give it a new needle
every once in a while you need to
replace the argon gas it uses if you
ever looked up wine preservation
techniques argon is a really common one
and you can buy canisters of argon and
pump it into the bottle and then put
your own you know cork back on top this
doesn't without actually ever really
fully removing the cork which will
theoretically preserve it much longer
and the idea is that argon is inert so
it doesn't interact with the wine at all
so you won't have any you know aging or
spoiling effects it's going to launch in
September this new model is suppose to
sell for right under $1000 which is
extremely expensive obviously they have
cheaper options that are not connected
that sell for as cheap as $200 and do
basically the same thing
so $1,000 is obviously insanely
expensive for a wine opener especially
because they have a 200 dollar model
that doesn't have the smart features but
functions exactly the same save $800 get
the normal version if this seems cool to
you I'm glad there's some weird
Bluetooth features but they're not not
that worth that much money
there's i won</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
