taking a look at the new
second-generation Microsoft band so the
first thing you'll notice here is the
design is way way sleeker than the
clunky old thing you got last year it's
now that a curved display and it's got
rid of glass 3 so it should be a lot
more adorable I'm got scratched really
really quickly so that's improved we've
got stainless steel around here around
the back it's still a little bit bulky
on this side but it's way better than it
was last year so we've got
do all the same functions as last year
the heart rate sensor is apparently very
much improved so that's going to be more
accurate for when you run or workout or
get any kind of physical activity in but
otherwise w sleep tracking guy to the
workouts all those sorts of things with
you last year plus it's also got some
new metrics like vo2 max and things that
usually are found on only like really
serious athlete watchings and things
like that so my gosh talk is kind of
making this rotational fitness people
but also the more serious athlete much
like last year but if you were a fan of
last year's fan this one is a lot more
comfortable and a lot nice to look at
and it's a bit more expensive than last
year's bandulus its 249 now and you can
free our roads starting today and the
tennis ship on October 30</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
