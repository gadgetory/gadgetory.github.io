nightmare sure one day we might get to
the point where every cable every gadget
every screen uses the same
next-generation connector but we're
nowhere near that point today which
means if you've got a new USBC laptop
like a MacBook Pro or Dells latest XPS
13 and you want to use those old ports
from your old computer stuff like
regular USB HDMI Ethernet DisplayPort SC
micro sd all those old connectors that
you used to use every day you're gonna
need a USB C hub to be clear for the
sake of this comparison we're only
looking at a small subset of USB C hubs
that means that we're only talking about
ones that offer some sort of
pass-through powers that you can keep
charging your computer while you're
using other stuff and ones that don't
need their own integrated power supply
that means unfortunately all those super
cool $300 Thunderbolt 3 hubs are at the
best of USBC hubs should have all the
ports you need while still being thin
and light enough to keep in your bag at
all times
it shouldn't be too expensive and it
should work reliably without getting too
hot the Satechi aluminum multi port
adapter v2 manages to check almost every
box on the list and it's our pick for
the USBC hub for most people first and
foremost
Satechi hub had the best port selection
of any of the hubs that we tested in
this price point there are three USB 3.0
ports both micro SD n SD card slots HDMI
Ethernet and USB C port for power
pass-through the hub itself is a compact
aluminum hub that doesn't take up too
much room in your bag or on your desk
and despite the all-metal construction
didn't get any hotter than my normal
laptop charger during use the port
layout is also one of the better designs
that we've seen on any of these hubs one
end has the single USBC cable to plug
into your laptop the other end has the
USB C input for power and Ethernet one
side of the wedge has the SD card slots
and the other side has the USB 3.0 ports
and the HDMI port and most importantly
everything is spaced far enough that
it's always easy to plug stuff in the
Satechi hub isn't quite perfect it only
offers 49 watts for a pass-through
charging and 4k video only works at 30
Hertz not 60 Hertz plus the $80 price
tag might be a little hard to swallow
especially if you're someone who just
spent thousands of dollars on a new USBC
laptop but for a well-designed portable
hub with the port selection that this
offers nothing else came close at this
price point if you're looking to save a
little money the next best option is the
who - USB C hub it's got the same 3 USB
3.0 ports a full-size SD card slot and
HDMI for video out
there's no Ethernet or micro SD but at
almost half the price of the Satechi hub
it's a great budget option assume you
can get by without an Ethernet port
which might be a deal-breaker for some
folks the who - hub does feel a little
cheap compared to the Satechi despite
also being made out of aluminum and
there's just no getting around the giant
glowing koutou logo on top but that's
nothing that some electrical tape can't
fix if it really bothers you now there
are plenty of other USB C hubs out there
with different port configurations price
points and form factors they'll probably
get the job done in a pinch but for one
reason or another they didn't top our
best fix the okie 8 in 1 USB C hub had
the second best port selection of any of
the hubs that we tested but it weirdly
chooses to cluster all the ports at like
one end of the device which makes it
kind of hard to plug things in also you
can only use the SD card slot or the
micro SD card slot but not both of them
at the same time but the okie hub makes
up for one of its shortcomings by
swapping one of the USB ports for a VGA
port which is useful if you need the
connectivity options VGA z'n that
comment of the port these days but if
you need it if you okie hub is
definitely a best bet if you want
something a little more premium there's
the Borge design archive it doesn't
quite match up to the port selection on
some of our other picks and at 135
dollars it's the most expensive hub that
we looked at but it's also far nicer
than some of the other hubs with a
removable USB C cable the weighted metal
base that doesn't slide around and a
premium glass and aluminum design that
felt just much nicer than some of the
other picks on the other end of the
spectrum there's a few things that you
should avoid when you're buying a USBC
hub stuff like apples official USB C
digital AV multi port adapter which
while you might think might be a great
option because the Apple name actually
offered one of the slowest pass-through
charging rates of any of the things we
tested it also worked the least well
with things that weren't Mac's computers
and at $70 it only offers a single
USB port an HDMI port there's plenty of
other options that'll give you more bang
for your buck
I'd also caution against any hubs like
the hyperdrive solo which connected
directly to your computer I get the
appeal here they're pretty much designed
for Apple's new MacBooks and MacBook
Pros they clip directly on to the
computer they're color-coordinated to
match and it looks like they might feel
that whole that apples removal of the
ports might have left in your life but
they also felt incredibly flimsy when
attached to my computer and I was
constantly afraid that they were just
gonna snap off or damaged the ports at
the end of the day almost any functional
USB C hub will probably get the job done
for connecting your old gadgets to your
new devices and hopefully this whole
product category will be a pretty
short-lived thing because in an ideal
world every mole just switched over to
using USB C so we won't ever need USB C
hubs but until that happens this is
attached is probably still your best bet
for getting by in this crazy mixed-up
port standard world hey thanks for
