am learning to use a mouse cursor with
just my finger this is the idea of
modok's when it's is actually a project
it's been in development about two years
now this device itself however has been
in development since july and the
general idea is using this sensor in
this digital pad and your thumb of the
digital pad you can actually use your
finger to kind of adjust where on the
screen you're doing so you can type
without having to grab a mouse or
trackpad now this model which was
actually come out next month it does
need some calibration the app itself for
calibration is as you can see here is a
little more detailed oriented but it's
fairly simple an idea so basically your
thumb rest on this digital pad and based
on where it on the pad it is how
sensitive your finger is going to be so
you can stick and move more extreme here
and I can fine tune it as i slide my
thumb over this is not going to be
available in stores at launch I'll to
get on the website i'll be 119 dollars
and ninety-nine cents and again this is
going to take some getting used to we've
only been playing for with it for about
a few minutes it does take a lot of
getting used to to kind of find to i
think just now I'm sort of getting kind
of hang of weird like move my finger I
can go through a little bit typing
tapping is taking a little bit of it
used to but it is a fun concept it
something like we really are excited to
see in practice we will need however a
lot more time to kind of get the hang of
this if you want to see more of more
hands-on videos like this more
