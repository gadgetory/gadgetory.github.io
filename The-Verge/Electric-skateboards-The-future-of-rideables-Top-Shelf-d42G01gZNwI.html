Part two Marty McFly travels to the Year
2015 and he ends up getting chased by
futuristic bullies I need to worry
hoverboard on hoverboards here when the
film opened in 1989 the whole world
decided that this was the future of
course we'll be riding around on
hoverboards someday
well 2015 is right around the corner and
we've seen at least one real working
hoverboard but you need a huge copper
floor to ride it and it only floats half
an inch off the ground not exactly where
we thought we'd be in 2015 according to
the movie but we're getting maybe we
don't need a pink board and moon shoes
to make getting around a little more
awesome in the past few years dozens of
startup companies have slapped motors on
just about anything that moves
bikes individual wheels scooters
unicycles rollerskates longboard
skateboards and plenty of other weird
things they last long enough through
your daily commute and they're fast and
easy ways to get from point A to point B
and they're super fun to ride okay so I
may not be floating six inches off the
ground on my way to work anytime soon
but the real dream of the hoverboard
that effortless and cool personal
transport might actually come true but
what's it going to look like how will I
be getting to work in the future
Aaron aiders is the founder of a company
called leaf technologies and he had his
partner Dan Seagram created the Leaf
skateboard it's a longboard with two
additional wheels with motors that
rotate individually allowing you to
complete 180 degree turns without
lifting off the ground it is insane so
what is leaf so the leaf is a board that
allows you to ride down the street like
a snowboard so you can write it forwards
backwards you can cruise sideways you
can spend 360 down the streets just as
you would as a snowboard and that was a
regional dream we had we're a longtime
snowboarders really passionate about the
sport and just kills us during the
summer with nowhere to ride so this was
a childhood dream come true of being
able to ride like a snowboard everywhere
we go
so this looks a lot like a traditional
skateboard except for these two
Frankenstein motors here yes so this is
a six wheel system based on a framework
of a piece called free board amazing
device but you have to have a hill and
if you don't live near Hills like we do
in Manhattan we're out of luck so the
drive wheels drive you forward if you
could go sideways that's going to drive
you this way you can even go backwards
whichever way you point it's going to
drive we have three tracks to send the
AC signal to the motor we have brushes
that connect the controller so the
brushes are always touching the readings
no matter what direction the motors are
turning how fast can this thing go we've
tested it and it's gone up to 20 miles
per hour
it's actually probably able to go a lot
faster than that but we want to keep it
you know safe when you first got on this
thing did it take you a while to adjust
and learn it's kind of like your first
day snowboarding when you get on the
wheeled version just to to get used to
that but by the end of the day you'll be
shredding I'll admit I've never
snowboarded before so I don't know about
shredding but I've been skateboarding
for over a decade so I figured it
couldn't be that difficult I slip my
feet into the holsters hit the throttle
on the Bluetooth remote control and I
was off
my back wheels immediately started to
drift out because I was riding it like a
skateboard with most of my weight with
the front but then I shifted my weight
instead to both of my heels and then to
my toes and back to my heels something
clicked and I started to get the hang of
it this is what snowboarding on pavement
is like
after a while I even managed to revert
or turn 180 degrees without lifting the
wheels off the ground I was feeling
pretty good about myself but then Aaron
got on and I was blown away
the leaf skateboard is insanely fun and
surprisingly easy even though I've never
snowboarded before I think I could get
the hang of this and carve through the
streets but for as cool as it is it's
still very similar to a skateboard
you can change bikes and skateboards all
you want and make them electric and more
powerful or you can do an inventive
stuff and come up with completely new
modes of transportation they've created
some crazy writable x' like the
solowheel hovertrax luna cycle and orbit
wheels and they're doing it all from a
small office and Camas Washington tell
me about in ventus and what you guys do
here we do everything no emissions
efficient so far everything everything
missions from me what is your favorite
toy to ride around here last few months
I've been writing the Howard Triton
office I want to go to a different power
building I can get there so quickly you
know talk to someone and do right back
do these work indoors only Earle source
that's what the harbour trash actually
was designed for indoor good we are so
small so mainly I'm thinking like
airports warehouse shopping or anything
just conveniently going around ok you
can almost like you're doing your
walking yourself you can you can spin
right quick spin is go somewhere turn
around go back that kind of people and
then do you ride the solowheel
around here solar oil it's more
transportation for outside you want to
go from one place to another they call
that our last mile yes yes so they can
get out a train get a bus you like that
to where we want to go up handle right
it's kind of like briefcase those
communities people are starting to see
this now is not just a toy it is a fun
thing to use but it's more than a toy
it's transportation something you can
travel miles on so where are these
popular they're very popular in China
very popular in France and the rest of
Europe Germany so you sort of just like
ride that from the house to the Train
and we're trying to promote that in the
u.s. too because obviously at places
like New York or San Francisco Seattle
that's something you can do so it sounds
like it could be pretty convenient for
commuting
but how easy is it to ride how does the
solowheel work it generally takes people
20 minutes to an hour to learn everybody
we've ever taught has learned it so it
works by you doing as little as possible
and let it take over for you the whole
concept is it's trying to balance you
just like you would bounce stick on your
hand so your hand is the sole away yeah
the hand is the sole wheel and you're
the stick up there if your stick up here
is moving around and bending and moving
like that it's going to be obviously
harder for you to do it so the less you
do on the solowheel easier it is okay
can I see you write a thing so to get on
it you basically just want to put your
leg on pad then you put your other foot
on there Wow
and then just as I'm as I feel it
falling over I can just twist it to keep
upright okay okay so I think I get how
this is supposed to work but let's see
what happens when I get on
these two companies are working on the
bleeding edge inventing things no one
has seen before but what if you want
something more simple to say right to
work on right now you've got a few
really good options actually there's the
Z board which is what I like to call the
Hummer of electric long boards the deck
is huge and so are the wheels and it
works in an interesting way you lean
forward on the front foot pad to
accelerate and do the same on the back
pad to slow down then there's the ego
Cruiser it's a super simple electric
longboard that's controlled with a
handheld remote and as a top speed of 12
and 1/2 miles per hour the best thing
about this forward it's only 700 bucks
the boosted board cost $1,500 but I'd
say it's justified it has two motors
that allow the board to hit 20 miles an
hour going uphill but it only has a
range of six miles what's neat about
this board is it's three settings
beginner intermediate and expert each
with a speed throttle and finally
there's the self-balancing unicycle or
SVU it's exactly that
it's a unicycle that has a three axis
gyro and a three axis accelerometer very
similar to what you'd find in a Segway
learning to ride it is pretty difficult
but once you do you can cruise around
town at 12 and 1/2 miles an hour while
looking oh so cool and this is just the
beginning as battery technology advances
we're gonna see more efficient faster
rideable it's great to see so many
companies playing ball on the space and
has me really excited about the future
hey maybe someday I'll get my hoverboard
