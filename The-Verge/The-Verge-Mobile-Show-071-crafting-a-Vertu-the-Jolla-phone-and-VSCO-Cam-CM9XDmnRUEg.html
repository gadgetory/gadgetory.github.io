welcome to the Virgin Mobile show this
is episode number 71 for Luke December
second 2013 I am dieter bohn i am glad
Sabbath and I'm delighted to know that
we are now accepted gineering show i'm
dan seifert and I don't have a witty
comment to add and chris ziegler is here
at least his thumbnail is here with us
but chris sigler is coming to us from
chicago where ok so we have a running
stick on the show where we troll chris
by making fun of the city of Chicago the
city of Chicago if we tell the truth is
a beautiful city that I love that we all
like to go to and we have the chance
there's a lot a big great tomato
casserole yeah they may see I was trying
to be nice and you know went straight
for it oh I've been talking this entire
time and apparently I was on mute oh I
would rewind rewind rewind i'm chris
sigler yes yeah i'm just going to go
thing where i was going to say that the
one problem chicago is apparently it
doesn't have internet how many different
ways if you try to get online past week
Chris it's kind of like I'm living no
not kind of like I'm literally living in
a post-apocalyptic future we're like you
know instantly the only currency that
human beings still have is their
connectivity and so like you're you know
you're like you're trading my thighs for
food or water you know fret you know
clean water not that not like you know
still water that's going to make you
sick or like you know a fire if you're
cold that kind of stuff that that's
where I'm at with my life right now i
have three my thighs each of which well
no I don't even have three my thighs i
have two phones and one mifi on three
different carriers that all get one bar
of signal and they're all finicky like
sometimes they like to work sometimes
they don't depending on their mood
so like I can I can go for a little
while on one and then it craps out and
I've switch to another and that's what
I've been doing for the past four days
and I'm about ready to just say never
mind and move to Costa Rica and
disconnect from the internet apparently
and and disappear off the face of the
planet so is Ian here's the thing that I
understand is from what I can tell from
the maps you've shown me the entire city
of Chicago has no comcast internet
service and hasn't since friday i mean
i'm sure that's not actually the case
but that seems to be the case that
you're making and in any other modern
city on the entire planet that would not
stand there'd be riots on the streets
but apparently in chicago it's like man
no internet whatever well so you know i
went to starbucks both yesterday and
today to try to get some work done
because at least i get single therefore
my my hotspot and the the the Wi-Fi
situation there is kind of the most
depressing thing ever because you you
get like the you know the starbucks
connection screen and then you accept
their terms and conditions and then it
just no matter what site you go to it
goes to the same terms and conditions
page so it's like it's like you're just
permanently looking at a pay wall and
that not a pay wall because it's free
but like it's it's the worst possible
it's like if you were using the internet
in hell and and you just had to keep
accepting terms and conditions to get on
Hell's Wi-Fi that's kind of what I was
so yeah everything about my life has
kind of been terrible as a result of
comcast for the past four days and the
word on the street I've been doing a lot
of Twitter searches about this obviously
as you can probably imagine the word on
the street is that a fiber cable in
somewhere in indiana may have been cut
by a construction crew on saturday which
somehow took out all of Indiana and
Illinois which leads me to the obvious
question why is comcast infrastructure
such that a single cable cut takes down
two states which leads me to the next
question of why are you at all surprised
yeah yeah fair enough but then I also i
talked to a comcast person earlier today
who I think heard my my rant
um and she said she said that there is a
problem with my node whatever that means
wow I've absolutely no idea what that
means that almost sounds like a like a
diss or a threat i don't know but so
anyway this is this is the hell I've
been living since Saturday its ongoing
that's why you can't see my beautiful
face right now and hopefully I'll be
resolved this week well I think maybe
the no she's speaking to about is I've
memory sure how comcast does it but when
you have fiber to the cabinet the
cabinet is usually the node where the
fiber ends up and then the couple starts
coming out and and and also if I could
just hijack or jump on Chris's tale of
woe well my video is gone it is perfect
fitting no but yeah I've had one
wireless issues and issues with my isp
how weekend and Monday night as well and
the thing that actually frustrates me
and I don't think it's terribly unusual
is how many Wi-Fi networks that can
actually pick up in my home and there's
usually a solid dozen of all my
neighbors but the thing is in spite of
the fact that we some of us share a
front door end up building and all of us
share our street we don't know each
other and if we don't know each other we
notice I could go to trust each other
with sharing Wi-Fi passwords so when my
connection cuts out I need to go out and
hit the library or hit a coffee shop or
whatever to continue working whereas if
we were actually social beings as
opposed to being social things like
Twitter we could save ourselves a lot of
hassle but I just I don't think that's
true I don't think that's true Vlad
because I mean if I had access to my
neighbor's Wi-Fi that's where I download
all my all my illegal you know all my
pirated stuff you know and then all the
nano society is basically your focus I
think I think the minor inconvenience of
once in a while having to go to a coffee
shop is much less than the the major
inconvenience of having to getting to
know your neighbors
it's a good point touche or you know you
could just pay for internet that works
and not have it fail I Burnett I I have
never comcast has actually been super
reliable for me in the past and then
over the course of the last four months
or so the frequency of outages has
become greater and greater and greater
and this is kind of the you know icing
on the cake so we'll see they're
supposed to call me today to discuss my
whoa they haven't yet we'll see if it
happens but then again I can't get a
phone call because I rely on a micro
cell which relies on the Internet so
we're back to square one I hey from the
hood broke my reports look man I ended
up I have no sympathy for any of you
because I have files and when it fails
I'll demand sympathy from you but until
then you're on your own is hangouts
acting differently now like it like what
things shows on the screen is completely
random hangouts is different every
single week so I don't even know if I
can answer that question cuz like I I
don't know all of you guys look like
really beautiful pulsing sir it's kind
of like hip hypnotic you're all pulsing
circles for me yeah well when i talk
like your circle stays on the screen
because that's that's what the people
want to see that people just want to see
chris sigler and I don't blame them I I
don't blame them either yeah um actually
what the people wouldn't know this is a
terrible transition I'm doing it anyway
I'm powering through what the people
want to see is however to makes it's
ridiculously insanely expensive phones
and Vlad went to the factory can so give
us the set the scene where is this place
what's going on here triad well said
seen well first of all you gotta say the
guys in vertu were extremely
accommodating extremely nice and I have
to punch that like for a luxury company
and they were just so modest and sweet
it was really surprising like usually
you kind of expect and to be honest I've
being inverted stores and divide you get
in those places is no
one of welcome everybody when I see you
like if you don't look like you have
millions of dollars in the bank they're
not particularly interested because they
know then I'm going to say but anyhow so
the virtual HQ this is a place on the
outskirts of London near place called
fleet the specific location is called
church crookham which is just a really
amusing name and also worth mentioning
the virtue chief designer is called
hutch Hutchinson which I would just love
to be able to put that on a business
card my name is hutch Hutchinson I'm the
chief designer / 2 and I work in church
crookham as like the salami the next
bubbly that is the most British thing
I've ever heard yeah um well what are
the important things about it first of
all this is where everybody phone has
been made from the beginning so it's one
pretty large building but it could say
is basically the entire go to operation
have another facility still in the UK
which handles repairs but this is where
every phone is manufactured and and it
has an atrium on the inside high
ceilings it's kind of like its a mix
between a manufacturing spot a factory
and just a you know a classy modern
office and it's just it's really what
really surprised your mother is the
scale is how smooth it is and how
compact the whole thing is so basically
you walk in and on the right side
there's a design team the admin team etc
etc and on the left side there's the
guys assembly in the phones and why are
you standing at reception you can
literally see through some dark and
glass people putting together the
ten-thousand-dollar phones now I was I
know kind of burning I have a question
for you glad uhh you keep saying that
they're they're assembling the phones so
is this like the same kind of thing as
Motorola's factory in Texas where all
the parts are essentially made in asia
shipped there and then people hand
assemble the phones or are there actual
part manufacturing going on here oh oh
is it is very different it's very
different from the Moto operation there
there's a lot of custom make parts for
me Hansen so a great example was the
battery cover of the sing
Shiva which is ten thousand dollars and
above on the inside of it they have this
pattern it's an angular person but the
thing is it's made out of metal and
we're talking about the inside of a
freaking battery cover ok this is this
this is the damn metric opposite of
Samsung's plasticky thin cover on the
inside is pattern is it's very geometric
it's very pretty but it's plated metal
and it's done so in such a refined
fashion that we actually touch it there
is no texture to the pattern ok so the
amount of precision that's required in
this is crazy you bay like literally the
guy who explained it to me he made the
sound of kissing is like we just make it
will make it kiss the surface in the
back right what I believe that I believe
that you're like I was kissing the thing
they're very passionate about making it
phones is like people invest their pride
in it but the thing you told me is that
fifteen percent of those parts get
thrown away because they're imperfect
and this is the thing that sits next to
the battery the thing that you pretty
much never see so wait you're telling me
is that there's good money to be made in
standing by vertues dumpster collective
discarded parts and making secondhand
virtues that are like almost as good
yeah I mean if you could like a simple
cobble together that discarded like
sapphire crystals and things like that
and and throw together a verte you look
like you're not really good report the
cityscape like renowned British sculptor
Richard Wilson did yes over to his plan
even the discarded parts probably
because of freaking expensive is turning
into a kind of a scale model of a
futuristic city which is I don't know
two square meters it's a really nice
thing I didn't understand it because I
was like usually it's right next to the
reception area and usually when
companies do that is the wide facilities
or like a map or something related to
the company but this was just you know
having fun with essentially
rejected parts antennas display panels
etc etc and it just made to be
futuristic and they are going to make
money out of it because they're going to
sell it off auction it off for charity
so they have a plan for the rejected
parts even though Christie strategy
always thinking with his business mind
isn't a terrible one to be honest right
so here's the thing that I don't get
like when when I imagine vertu I imagine
that they're like pumping out like five
phones a week and they're just selling
for ridiculous amounts of money but
looking through your pictures here like
they're making a ton of these things
like relative to what I imagined like do
you have any idea how many phones are
kicking out a day out of this place it
seems like they're working on a whole
bunch at a time and there's a whole lot
more people I just sort of imagined like
I don't know five jewelers in a room
crafting handcrafting phones one by one
like an order comes in and they're like
all right Jim you go do it like I'm
trying to think what the market is for
you know $10,000 phones and apparently
it's way bigger than I the market is
Gwyneth Paltrow is she is a known vertu
fanatic okay there's just got there
making all of them for her yes yes and
and what's his name from Coldplay her
husband mo the dude from called the dude
no people who find it and well does to
answer this question how many phones are
they shipping out is exactly what they
wouldn't tell me but for my observations
I walked through the entire process from
start to finish and packing and then put
it into the boxes and get in the ready
to ship and there was there was always a
phone in progress so to date this point
they are doing a higher volume the most
of us probably expect in total though
since his beginning vertu has shipped
roughly 350,000 phones and I think I
kind of imagined they started ramping up
more recently and write numbers are
growing and particularly now they're
doing android phones and touch screens
and have google play store axis and all
these more contemporary features you can
see how many audience open it up to
their devices but actually to dance
point you know Dan said hey Jim we're
going to order pick it up that is
actually very close to what vertu is
doing because one person is responsible
for each handset and at the end when
answer is completed there's a laser
engraving somewhere on it with that
person signature now that doesn't mean
that they make every single part because
did you essentially serialize some of
the tasks so some of the polishing I
think some guys are just doing polishing
and some guys are just doing whatever
which might require works with tease but
generally speaking one person is
assembling the components of the
motherboard screwing that down into the
case polishing it testing etc etc and
the virtual actually had customers call
in and say I would like Wendy and there
is a lady called Wendy Bevan he's been
with words you from the beginning I like
Wendy to put together my next phone and
and then yeah the Wendy in question was
apparently in the brink of tears because
it was she was really humbled by that
Wow nah did you get a tip I don't know
about that and Chris stop thinking about
money Mac what yeah I gotta know Vlad
did you bring the blackberry bananana
with you I did and did you compare it to
the the virtues and which one is is more
luxurious very good question that
fantastic I mean the first thing I had
to do was present for two chief of
design with a blackberry / no no no no
no no 9 a-9 a 2 and ask him what things
with it and actually he was more more
positive on it than I thought I mean he
pulled a credible effort I don't think
that was everything goes pure diplomacy
like he was like I think it's on his
design because it's honest in terms of
what it wants to be and what it was to
present and project to people it's quite
a clean design because he's a designer
he's not talking about the software
which obviously would be how other
bag of hurt but yes I compared the a
competitive there's the virtue
constellation which is the most
affordable hanser you can get it's only
thing affordable very loosely yeah it's
a real so it's nothing like five
thousand euro whatever it is you know
it's oh just I'll take two yeah I mean
if you get a nice text break you
probably cover that but that's if you
led to be clear that's if you get it
without any that's if you get it without
any options right like you can get them
in cold you can get them with diamonds
or whatever you want that's right I
would like to point out you know
somebody else covered my article with
the visit to go to and he said that they
make phones up to fifteen thousand
dollars in price and that is not correct
thirty thousand dollars is where the top
end 42 begins right there are parts and
components that you can put on in
customizations and laser engravings and
I mean you can basically call them and
say I want you to draw the Mona Lisa in
diamonds on the side of this phone and
they will do it because they're having
skills they have the expertise and they
have the diamonds I hate to say this I'm
actually I'm on vertu site right now uh
the the signature in black stainless
with white ceramic inserts is absolutely
gorgeous it's a really beautiful phone I
i would i would rock that with android
like four point oh and uh no no that
your old processor so here's the thing
like signature is that's we 40 rate we
do you point out that like I understand
spending okay I don't really but I can I
can live in a world where I understand
spending tens of thousands of dollars ah
jewelry on something precious that i
will have with me or that i will keep in
my house that is beautiful and expensive
and unique and amazing the problem that
i have with vertu is that it's tied to a
thing a computer that is essentially not
going to be timeless it is going to get
old and break down and at that point
like
what do you do with the rest look I
think here's here's my theory and Vlad
maybe you can expand on this but my
theory with vertu has always been that
the kinds of people that that by these
phones are the kinds of people who don't
want to deal with their phone they just
want to press the concierge button on
the side and talk to someone who makes
magic happen at any cost and and if you
look at the signature series in
particular if you look at you know it's
been around for a long time and if you
look at a signature from say 2005-2006
it looks basically the same as a
signature from 2013 so they've done a
good job of making at least that line in
their design DNA kind of timeless I
ensure the innards have changed i'm sure
it's you know 3g or maybe even LTE now
whereas a USB edge but that you know the
the appearance of the phone is the same
and frankly for the for what people are
doing with these phones which is
pressing the concierge button a 2005
signature works just fine I'm curious
Vlad did you ask about the concierge
service and how much it's used by virtue
owners I did I didn't they they have
metrics you should head to but they
say it gets a lot of it gets a lot of
these but what I noticed was that the
latest Android phones the cheaper ones
aren't getting as much uses signature
wounds but I basically goes Chris's
point oh so then I saw you grinning when
Chris said maybe has LT and you're like
no it doesn't that is exactly the case
there is no aunty here and I mean
seriously the signature again the most
expensive phone is basically and chases
when into since it was introduced in
2008 the fact it runs nokia series 40 is
just amazing to me i mean and the screen
is probably like what the same
resolution is my pebble more or less
it's cuz screen let's go look at that
guy i mean it's it's a 2006 or 2007
arrow nokia with a fancy shell on it
that's that's what it is right but you
buy for the fancy ship right you buy it
from and listen the thing is i am really
surprised by how candid
vertu were abroad their motivations as
well like they weren't trying to spend a
whole other story about giving people
the best in technology and what not like
they're not particularly interested in
competing respects they want to have
leadership but their idea of leadership
is will give you the customer service in
the cosmic air and frankly they do give
you that because we need call up tech
support Weaver to you call the guys in
that building so when when somebody
picks up a tech support advert to they
can literally yell at a person who put
together your phone it can be like you
know what Yuri from Moscow ordered
Alpine letter and he did not get that
and you know you're from Moscow knows
about leather because easier e from
Moscow and and and also to that point
the letter on the virtue consolation is
a little bit rougher in texture a little
bit more sensual than the leather on
blackberry porsche design so if you're
picking between the two I would stay for
2 as a better level but then it also
costs twice as much but then again if
you're spending thousands upon thousands
of whatever currency cheese and a phone
again I don't agree I don't even think
the considerations that data presented
of particular importance of these people
like it's not it's not really a case of
I want to have like a family heirloom
that I passed down to whatever it's just
it's just pure ostentation what is it is
an invert to the virtual guy said to me
when you pull out the signature and you
put that thing down on the table that
basically says of people I'm the boss so
there isn't a question about who is the
chief in whatever the hell is going on
here i well I was never I was never in
out that that gwyneth paltrow is the
boss I mean if I i sat down at table I
carranza yes that's Tony Danza probably
can't afford a vertu unfortunately oh
man ganzel burns dang it there's some
like back catalogue very hopeful show
where we made fun of Tony Danza I seem
to recall this happening don't even
we're Tony Danza all right like back in
the legit panda days when that was a
running joke I feel like honey um yeah I
don't know I I mean I hate to the
standard joke about virtues oh my god
why would anybody spend that much mana
phone what idiots is gonna be obsolete
and this is just money and like I'm you
know I want to look deeper than that at
this but at the end of the day like it's
it's it's a lot of rich people thanks
it's very cool very well made very
interesting rich people things but it's
just like Birkin bags and you know all
those other things that are exceedingly
expensive and they become out of date in
a season and they end up you know I
don't swear it was the same thing later
did you buy it if you buy a
fifty-thousand-dollar watch like the
$50,000 watch isn't like out of date and
can't run its software and tell you the
time in 10 years right right that's what
I'm saying yeah yeah if you have a small
wood right I'm actually kind of
surprised oh my god virgin watch maybe I
mean maybe vertu does have a either a
trade-in program or an upgrade program
where they can swap the guts out on the
device well well while we're bringing up
watches in virtue uh there was a report
recently that uh forex virtue designer
or current virtue designer is working
with metawatch uh yeah on an upcoming
SmartWatch which would believe the guy
on the po2 he was head of design and
look here yeah Frank nuova with his name
right yeah acetate yeah I mean it's you
know I've said for a long time I still
will say metawatch has exactly two
problems that prevent it from from being
a much better solution than pebble one
is the display is a sick sick joke and
two they need they have some work to do
on design I mean the frame actually is a
pretty good looking model but the strata
is really unattractive and getting some
serious design shops on board hopefully
we'll do some good things for them well
it's it your engine isn't a steaming
pile of reflective guard
right having good design shots would do
good things for this this this
burgeoning SmartWatch industry as a
whole right I mean right that's that's
that's probably the biggest complaint
levied against the pebble you know aside
from maybe it's it can be a bit of a
user interface issues but most people
complain that it just looks cheap in
like a toy and they don't want to wear
it doesn't match their suit or just you
know doesn't have the high-end feel that
even a watch of a comparable price
offers so right uh if if this does come
through and actually happens and you
know metawatch is able to release a
watch that can match the the
craftsmanship that you get on a regular
wristwatch that would be very good for
the the wearable world I thought you
were about to say match the
craftsmanship of the pebble and I was
going to reach through the microphone
and punch you in the face so listen guys
I just wanted to wrap up with a couple
of points and uh yeah grandpa very
briefly one of the things that really
amused me and the thing that I couldn't
photograph was the fact that they
actually have essentially a bank vault
at the back of packaging cities it
wouldn't let you take a picture of the
bank vaults like there's maybe an oceans
15 style like George do need Brad to do
and steal all their phones though was
wider than I don't know my body is just
massively white door and then you go
steel bars and behind the Super Bowl a
citation for ostentation sake that's
hilarious yep I guess it's fair right I
mean it's wearing diamonds and gold and
sapphires and all this other crap they
glue on there I guess they need to keep
it safe right yeah I mean Dan had to you
know class it up by saying the glue all
that crap on but I mean those are
expensive parts doesn't like is set
aside the home phone element of it they
work with some seriously expensive
components and I mean it's like things
like the alligator skin on the s40
answer that handle which I have to tell
you is completely indistinguishable for
anything else and it's just kind of like
any other surface there's nothing
alligator about it but then again I
haven't
fondle too many alligators to tell you
didn't try and bite you no I mean the
phone almost it is so sharp and angular
I mean these phones are crazy there's so
much oh this is this is what I think
chris is in love with him because
they're just completely totally yeah so
this is like the the dream phone for the
droid set I don't know gotta try said
anything like that the ultra masculine
you know that the whole droid thing that
verizon's been doing with the four years
with the ultra masculine angular edges
see see now I'm getting this vision of
influence you with a droid notification
he'll be quite quite terrible hmm oh
there he goes fire goes Chicago he got
Chicago Tricia's did the Chicago remix
in himself wait you hear me how their
your back okay I I wanted to ask you
what you were you were talking to us
through a mouth harp which I don't know
where you got a mouth harp um good is
that another word for harmonica no hmm I
have no idea what a mouth harp is mom
yes well know what's not called a little
like durian gran-gran what's that thing
called so-called mouth harp right yeah I
could be um I mean have to yeah its
copyright yeah uh but no my question for
Vlad was is there a signature vertu like
a ringtone or sound set oh they have
they have custom ringtones and
notifications yes do they have a
composer who like customizes ringtones
for each client it's just a ching ching
sound right every every ringtone is just
like ching ching ching ching ching just
just the money cash register sounds I'm
not going to answer that then well it is
only talking my honey you just not well
it's not a good heart that's really
offensive I'm guessing but that's that's
what wikipedia has it as a main entry a
one heart just let it go ah sure no I'll
get very very fun to put a fine point oh
my god
is you don't get any more final points
ever I go ah just kidding that's her it
exactly exactly the point about not
talking about money I in no way I'm
going to seek to justify spending
thousands upon thousands of whatever
currency on the fog I'm not trying to do
that but what I would say is having been
through their factory and have you seen
the way that they work and haven't seen
you know how long people have been
working there and the fact that you can
have a career as a phone maker assembler
whatever and you can feel proud about it
you have job satisfaction you have
customers reaching out and say I like
your work etc etc I mean I think I feel
like this is the way things should be
done you know and as a customer if I
could afford a phone that expensive I
would spend the money on it because then
I would feel me buying the phone isn't
victimizing whatever person is making it
and we keep making these complaints you
know working conditions at Fox phone etc
etc Billy would keep buying the devices
and and they remains their fathers
there's a middle ground here like I i
yes not absolutely okay I'm just saying
that what I saw there is so much closer
to what we expect and wish this industry
to look like I'm again I'm not trying to
justify the cause of these phones well
there's a there's a middle ground but I
think I mean to vlad's point I mean I
think it goes beyond just making sure
that people have like good working
conditions and at like a basic living
wage I think it has as much to do about
like a supporting craftsmanship which is
something that is like increasingly lost
to robotics um and like it speaks to
like a simpler time like almost
pre-industrial age where like everything
was made by like you know professional
craftsman so that's kind of cool too and
and you can understand when you have
these extremely highly trained basically
you know jewel makers we can these
devices that's why that's in part why it
costs so much to make them it's not I
mean obviously have the cost of the raw
materials which in some cases are very
but then you're you know you're you're
paying people I'm sure very very good
money to do extremely high quality work
you know man i blame the steam engine
for all this like I think we're better
before we automated things I mean is
what I'm saying is that when you think
that you have something cheap so I price
is paid somewhere yeah you know it might
be cheap to you but then somebody
somewhere is paying the price it s so I
have no way to the transition from that
to Jana that I think we should talk
about y'all are briefly know the
transition is really obvious they're
both former nokia or you know it and
they have relationships with Nokia's
right there well they've both X nokia
well ver 2 is X nokia y ella is like
nokia expats yeah yeah they both sure
the nokia germ so you had to spend some
time with with selfish and the other
actual shipping phone right flap edit
and which I mean the thing that I
discovered is that the Nokia fanboys do
alive and well he just found a new
outlet in yola which y'all yes y'all are
yola this is working out your Nokia's
honestly I asked him and this I was
gonna say the Swedish the Finnish
pronunciation is yalla yalla but their
tolerance of people calling in jolla if
it's more convenient or comfortable for
them okay so there you go they you
already have a fragmentation issue with
this platform so right and but on the
software side it's a continuation of
what we saw it in Akutan nine so it's me
it's the Mego project that Nokia
abandoned but at the same time it isn't
building on the nokia n9 or the hobbit
an interface davis and she started from
scratch and done the whole their only
new spin on a gesture interface with a
lot of swipes left to right a lot of
uh coming in from the edge top bottom
left right they will do different things
my issue with it is that Dean's face is
just highly intuitive and it's also not
visible so they've taken away all the
chrome of the interface yeah lets you to
guess well yes others you need to
memorize these gestures it's not
intuitive it's crashy and there's no app
library so I'm wondering um I know ality
what I know us okay let's oh you know
they can have no LTE that's again like
you get if you get a mulligan on that
one um other than like the dream of me
go and the dream that they'll be
somebody else I can actually compete in
this smartphone world yeah you know
maybe by getting android apps on there
somehow so if they've got some kind of
parity like I'm at a loss to know why I
should still be excited about this I was
excited about it as a possibility now
that it's like becoming a reality the
reality seems like they didn't like
finish the work to make it like to get
there there's like there's just a lot of
stuff that feels maybe I hate everything
today it's a theme yeah and so I'm just
continuing that theme of anger and
frustration well you write though you're
right it isn't finished the sailfish OS
is an official terms is still in beta
beta aah the thing after alpha whenever
no I'm good now it's been a long time
since we've heard you say beat us I felt
it's nice to hear ya alright so yola is
in beta and so sick officio is is in
that state the LT support is software
issue which is going to rectify it it
has DLT hardware as please do four point
oh and as NFC it has decent aspects and
in terms of the actual physical design
is blocky and chunky because they have
that other half second part which
attaches to the back of the phone and
that can include upgrades so one of the
ideas maybe if you into physical
keyboards you can buy an other half
which adds physical keyboard to your
phone so there's a bit of modularity
going on there but none of that as you
saying is available today so again we're
kind of looking at quite a bit of
potential and essentially it needs to be
driven by the investment of enthusiastic
supporters which is fine I mean I can't
think of a single person who's rooting
for yola to do well because it's small
start-up company and they invested their
money the effort the passion their pride
is such a intimate and they've had a
successful launch I think they've had
over a million euros sale sales since
they started shipping the devices out so
they're doing decently well and and the
one reason for optimism is actually
they're still such a tiny tiny company
with small expenses and making a profit
on a per device basis as a company they
obviously not making a profit yet but
because if I have such a fast cosplays
the way the Nokia did they can
potentially afford to just so few
devices work quickly on the software
keep its rating keep giving people more
and then you know survive long enough to
have a second generation which will be
refined and improved so it's the same
problem as always though where you have
all these guys at the tail end fighting
for table scraps right you have the the
bun to phone which is coming and and
this you can obviously see how this
device would go kind of head-to-head for
the same hearts and minds well I think
you bunch of phone is a great example of
flathead mentioned that it's you know
sort of going to survive on the interest
of these enthusiasts who are willing to
plug down six hundred bucks for an
unknown uh the a buncha phone didn't get
enough of those enthusiasts to make its
its goal by a long shot yeah but I mean
mark shuttleworth is a billionaire so
like hey if the dude wants to make in a
bun to phone he'll make an app onto
phone well III think that the I think
that the crowdfunding campaign as is
increasingly the case with crowdfunding
campaigns now was really just a
publicity stunt to drum up interest in
the phone and he succeeded he got a lot
of publicity for that device and now he
can take it back to the drawing board
and decide what he wants to do with it
but I mean like money is not a problem
for the guy
I'm Eliza you talking about money again
I'm keeping I thought that you weren't
supposed to be okay I'm no I really
wanted the jolla phone or i guess i was
rooting for it i didn't put down my own
money I didn't have you know help them
out but uh I was really hoping that it
would be better a better execution that
I guess we've seen so far and maybe as
what says it's a betta uh so maybe
there's room for improvement that we'll
see obviously there's room for
improvement maybe we'll see them
actually take action on that that room
for improvement but they've got a
they've got a very very uphill climb as
as far as I can tell yeah i mean the
thing that I want is for the interface
and like the thinking of the way a
smartphone should act and behave and how
you interact with the stuff that a
smartphone does would be like radically
different enough for me to go like I
want this to succeed this is so much
better than what's out there and um
that's like when I saw the early stuff
I'm like they are thinking differently
they are thinking better about how to
like change the way we manage stuff on
these little screens and I want them to
finish that and that's like the thing
that I wish they had done was let's
finish that and maybe they still can't
because it's still in beta mode um I'm
kind of hesitant to say this because I
probably endangered wildlife but given
that i'm not in finland I'll take the
risk I have to say the blackberry 10
interface actually makes so much more
sense to me than the only one yeah a
smoother animations it's so much more
okay you still have to figure it out but
they do give you a really neat tutorial
on the blackberry and you swipe up from
the bottom to dismiss the app get back
to multitasking you swipe down for
notifications Oh settings Radha and then
all your notifications are in the hub
and then all your apps on the right side
that's it I'm done I'm ready to use the
phone numbers of the yellow you do a
whole heap of trial and error it just
takes way too long I don't
I or anybody else living in 2013 has the
patience to sit and study and learn a
new phone precisely because the point
dita was also making is that by the time
you've gone in the language of this new
interface is something else on horizon
right on this company's debt just by the
time we figured out unfortunate well I
mean yeah a talking about palm here DJ I
am getting literally rage about whether
less as that's all I ever do um then me
why I wrote it back speaking of
unintuitive hard to understand
interfaces vscocam is available for
Android Oh Glenn come on that's not fair
totally fair is no fat totally barren
tell me what M does in biscoe can tell
me what the little flag button does tell
me when I take a flexor image yeah
except it doesn't actually appear for
like ten seconds on the little thing a
little corner thing tell me when I take
a picture inside visco cam where it's
backed up to yeah Josh couldn't even
figure that already tweeted about it
today so so okay so this go cam uh I
want you to tell me it's not backed up
and that's what anyone see one does
that's one of the filters that tell me
what which one what does it do it's if
you tap it and then you tap it again you
can see the name of it and then you have
a slider for how well how strong at you
Peter it turns out the time I've tapped
that it's already applied a filter and
you can go back it's non-destructive why
don't you just tell me the name of the
filter make the thumbnail a little
bigger and I can see it's called see one
you're turning your toggling see one on
and off is look I'm not going what's
doing em to fend m5 I'm not going to
defend the interface because i don't
think the interface is perfect i think
it's very minimalist and maybe it's too
minimalist for people like dieter ah but
at the end of the day when you're
talking about a photo processing app all
that really matters to me is the output
that it produces and produces some
really really impressive pictures from
uh android phones which is not something
that we ever say so you know I'm really
excited about it
does you know a really great output on
the iphone and it's I've been using it
on android phones for a couple of weeks
because I was beta testing it and it
does really well there as well so you
know as a photographer I'm really
excited maybe it's a little too dense
for the average user not offending you
at all theater that was not a comment at
you at all and I'm sure that I agree
that it's annoying that the photos don't
save directly to your gallery and aren't
automatically backed up and there's
definitely room for improvement with the
interface but as far as the photo
processing goes I think it's great i'm
excited for the photo processing I'm
excited that on my Nexus 5 when I hit
the shutter button in fiscal cam it
takes a picture within a second or less
whereas in the you know the default
camera app it takes about four seconds
lately so okay that's an exaggeration
it's like two and a half but still but
teach it to your point about give me a
larger thumbnail on the filter etc
cetera that just sounds like somebody
who says I can't order a restaurant
unless the menu is on laminated paper
with pictures of every single meal um
look I want to know what actually I
think I think that physical cam has a
learning curve there's definitely a fire
I think there's a definite learning
curve once you learn what's frustrating
with the learning curve is it's
unnecessary the interface when you're
looking at your different filters
there's a ton of unused space there
you're already having to scroll left and
right just like tell me what this button
is going to do when I tap on it besides
giving me a color a letter and a number
if you're already giving me a color a
letter and a number is there some system
why one thing is labeled B and one thing
is labeled P I don't know I bet there is
just like if you're gonna put that much
work are you complaining about the
iphone version here the iphone version
is exactly the same as the android
version their UI is exactly the same and
you know a lot of people complain that
it doesn't adhere to you or a lot of I
guess Android users are clean that
doesn't adhere to Android standards but
the iOS version doesn't adhere to iOS
standards yeah I don't care about to
hear that their own their own interface
for it and like I guess the only reason
I'm being
so like vehement about it is because
I've been waiting for something you know
like this i mean snap seats fine but
like I want better photo tools on
Android I want photography's better on
Android and so there's a whole lot of
pent-up desire and then like you know I
don't know for some reason i decided to
rage on vscocam today and I'm going to
continue stands right it does take
really good pictures i wish that i could
make it my main camera but i totally
can't because i need to have my pictures
secure in the cloud it's great for like
composing shots but it can't become my
main camera advocate it's also it's also
good for editing a photo after if you're
if you're processing the phone if you
take a whole bunch of photos and then
you got time later on you import them
into the app and you can process them
and get all the quality and effects and
all that fun stuff did you guys ever use
like you know like what what was what
the first computer the first pitch is
like what it is what OS dinner uh I had
like toss I mean I didn't he's a junior
so before da so the best word processor
of all time bar none is WordPerfect 5.1
because it was wicked fast nothing could
slow it down no matter what you did was
instantaneous but everything had to work
by a function keys and so you had this
plastic thing you kept on your keyboard
with different color codes tell me what
all the functions did since you can hit
ctrl f5 do one thing or a five to do
another thing I'm just going to get one
of those stickers laminated and pasted
to the back of my phone so I can
reference it when I want to edit photos
and descriptions that's the plan and
then I'll be super happy I mean to be
fair the little thumbnails at the bottom
that have the P for the c1 and the m5
and so they have little previous of what
the filter is going to kind of do i'm
using as nexus 5 I do not have a small
screen and come on like come on just
saying it doesn't get but then you want
to be fair whereas dieter is grinning
and trolling so hard truth is always
like might be for today is a good until
disco has me two copies webos is card
interface I will never move
you know what it could copy webos is
awesome eat off cameras and uh oh god
you really really want to go there we
all know how great the priests camera
was oh so bad did you ever use the
pixies camera okay we can't talk about
we can't go down this path I don't know
speaking of failure motorola doesn't
know how to make a website that runs god
this is so embarrassing it's like their
cyber monday sale for the Moto X was a
complete and utter debacle they sold no
phones because I well well they sold the
developer edition yeah but they sold
none of the moto maker customers
customized phones which is just like
cyber monday is the biggest online
shopping day of the year yeah you are
run by what is re or owned by what is
arguably the biggest internet company
the world yeah and you can't get this to
work like I just don't understand how
this fell apart so hardly I bet you that
the people who ran the Google Play
device sales for the nexus for last year
got put in charge of this year and
that's what happened I was just gonna
deja move for that exact conversation
around the nexus 4 where Dan was raging
about Google being the biggest web
company and not being able to you know
handle honeymooners no I know this is an
ongoing problem that Google has had they
didn't have any problems with the Nexus
5 uh an order seemed to be no the store
stayed up orders going through it
handled whatever demand was there uh but
I just I just can't see how this went so
wrong for them like on what is the
biggest shopping day of the year for the
internet it's just like and I can't
imagine the demand was really that high
because I mean as reports have shown
nobody was buying the Moto X before most
people don't buy phones off of contract
it was an off-contract promotion to give
you a really good price on the phone
which is without a doubt not arguing
that at all but it's still a lot more
than you would pay if you bought a phone
on contract in a carrier store like most
people actually do so
I just I'm trying to figure out where
all this demand and we're all this
trafficking from that actually took the
kept the site down all day and I don't
know if it was really traffic or demand
or if it was some other factor well
people don't realize that I was trolling
vscocam like that that was all stick
we've got a couple tweets at me they're
angry at me breanna rutter little let
that go yeah well actually on the part
about this go cam that is the most
interesting arrival and Android in terms
of software for a long time for me like
to me I don't feel like Android his head
I feel like Android has had an app where
is fallen behind iOS even though even
though i have to mention badland just
came to android over the weekend god
it's so awesome and I somehow hadn't
played it it's great ways yeah neither
and I play that thing on Android and it
made me smile and that just stood out to
me because okay well what's funny about
badland is that it also last week or the
week before very recently another
high-profile iOS game finally came to
android in the form of ridiculous
fishing but the Android version was such
a poor port initially they've updated it
since its launch but at launch it was
like really slow and choppy it made my
phone turn like a thousand degrees and
it just nuked my battery so it was a
really bad experience so then went bad
land came and I downloaded that and was
playing that I was just it was just like
so surprised and relieved at how well it
actually ran on Android it's just as
good as it does on iOS and it's a
wonderful thing but you know when you
when you have all of these frustrations
this is frequently happens where games
or apps get ported from iOS to Android
they frequently stink on Android I
thought Eric Schmidt told us that people
are going to develop for android first I
thought that's that was wearing live in
that world Eric Schmidt's is a lovely
day she some people do I mean it might
not be stuff Schmidt says
it might not be the premier apps out
there but people who I think android now
has a dedicated following a dedicated
user base which as I've been saying
recently includes me now I am attached
to the gmail app on Android I literally
if I have too many emails to filter
through I might step away from the
computer and go and do it on my phone
because it's nicer to swipe things away
particularly if you have spam email and
you want to have a physical gesture to
go with your disgust it's so nice to
just swipe to delete it's like screw you
man I'm not interested you know also
great there's a good thing work you
swipe with your middle finger of mutes
and so just archive I like that and you
can use the touch sensitivity all those
other senses and whatever yeah but yeah
top tip if you have media alert in the
headline of an email trust me you don't
need to be alerted it's not that input
oh speaking of a ruler they we aren
interviewed or interviewed well I just
want to say before we get to know that
Motorola is going to try again tomorrow
uh and next cycle Wednesday so they're
going to offer the same deal again uh so
hopefully they're able to to get their
stuff sorted out and real when it goes
live again just go to ww Motl calm wah
wah that might not be the exact address
you should probably look it up before
you try um anyway uh yeah uh the Moto G
not bad not a bad phone not bad at all
you know what's funny is that normally
we would say in a situation like this
it's not a bad phone uh it's not a bad
for a two-hundred-dollar phone or a
hundred a telephone but like this is
just not a bad phone pure well I mean
the camera is pretty terrible right but
so is the Moto X's camera so you know
it's definitely not a bad phone for the
price and it's not the worst like like
this is
a better than say that HTC first right
yeah yeah um I mean and it's way better
than the galaxy s4 mini in the galaxy s3
mini and all these other phones that
occupy this mid-range garbage level
sphere uh it's like our esteemed
producer by the way heaven rogers who
you got to watch on the mole show last
week as soon as i mentioned the HTC
first he literally just like thumped his
chest kisses fingers point is this guy
that's just happen I don't even know so
much potential yeah so so so much is is
this really the mid-range that we're
talking about here I mean the Moto G is
so cheap price its sole its sole at the
low below the low end right if you're
comparing it to like priced phones here
in the US uh it's sold out like the
lowest of the low end but it is operable
with a mid-range vote right so that's
that's what makes it so interesting so
appealing and kind frankly so surprising
so intimately to me the biggest
challenge two guys to newcomers like
yola is their pricing their phones let's
assume it's a reasonable number right
for the company to have some success
have some chance of survival in the
future but they're facing a market we
have the Moto G which costs so much less
than we used to paying for the amount of
stuff that it gives you and the Nexus 5
so today it's like the Moto G owns a
low-end the Nexus 5 owns the mid end and
then everybody can have the big scuffle
with the high end but it's a where's the
room full and you come up to step in and
compete it's hard to say I mean Motorola
says that at the pricing that the Moto G
is that they are still making a profit
on each phone if assuming they sell them
so how a small company like Joe loyola
could make the same kind of profit
margins it's really hard to fathom that
yeah yeah i mean the moto g is that it's
not just cheap into you as a cheap
everywhere
it's a play to be a global phone to be
globally available in and I think that's
the point with it the absence of LTE
still it's so sad i have to say you know
if i was in bulgaria and saying we don't
have OT so that's cool that would be
kind of predictable but I'm in London
and the cases for most carriers and most
people here not having to use not a
problem because you don't have a network
that you'd be missing out on so there
are still plenty of spaces in places
that lag on the LTE availability where
the Moto G could be quite an idea phone
I mean even if you get the HTC One which
is really nicely design and all of that
you see a kind of a crummy camera no so
why not save yourself to my get a moto G
and then gosh I don't know do something
nice with your family um take a boat
ride one last thing to talk about sort
of a bad news and then good news and bad
news cyanogenmod pulled from the Play
Store I honestly am a little bit
surprised that the move against
cyanogenmod was pulling their installer
from the google place while they're like
how to install our thing whatever my
call it from the google play store
because it like encourage people to void
warranties that seems like a really i
don't know it seems like kind of a cheap
move from google like if you're gonna if
you're going to go after cyanogenmod
then like go after people distributing
google apps and google code don't go
after like an app that like you're not
quite sure you like the you know what
they're asking users to do in your store
oh yeah it just it feels like there
instead of having the fight that they
ought to have and like I'm like actually
saying what it is google apps are and
what it is android is and what their
what it is exactly the relationship to
android hacking is an android openness
is there like doing this like Nick keep
doing what you're doing but make sure
you do it over there in the shadows so
you're out of the store but we're not
going to address this other stuff like
that just feels a little chicken I don't
know
dan is making fun of me right now in
some chat room right now I can hear
typing oh no I apologize i was
completely distracted by our chat room
okay i was you waiting for the good news
hit me with the good news oh the good
news the good news is that the mad
geniuses at XDA a whole crew of them
together have ported uh and installed
mostly okay kind of successfully KitKat
on the hd2 the redress putative oh man
yes sir easy to it you know why five
maybe that's working so much cell phone
connectivity maybe not quite there yet
running other HD two I mean that's
amazing right kudos that that is
deserving of epic phrase when did this
thing come out when the Leo was released
it's 2009 wasn't it was late two
thousand one turn of 2010 I think well
the the the evo 4g was like spring of
2010 or summer 2010 and this predated it
by a good six months so the first giant
orange juice came out and then yeah so
may not it may have been late two
thousand nine when it came up maybe
early 2000s employer on phone guys yeah
but the coat the thing what kick-out is
it's designed to run on low-end phones
right so why not give it a shot man it's
got yeah dude I'm gonna try this I
don't have an hd2 anymore and I really
am unhappy about it I had one for a
while and I let it go and I could man I
get it's all so much software I think if
I haven't I remember the first time I
saw somebody using an hd2 just out and
about in the wild as they said yeah uh
and it just like blew my mind how big
the phone what like how big the display
was and how thin the phone was and we're
talking about a 4.3 inch screen and I
think it's like something like 10 and a
half millimeters thick or something and
I just was like I remember I was with my
wife and I had like a total geek out
moment and she did not understand why I
was like freaking out like oh my God
look at
look at look at it and yeah so and then
here we are with you know the average
phone is for half or 4.7 inches or
whatever it is yeah and I just like to
point out that the hd2 can now get
KitKat and the Galaxy Nexus cannot so
Merry Christmas well to be fair the same
nerd source different nerds at XDA have
ported the galaxy neck courted KitKat to
the Galaxy Nexus already so I mean
technically they both have it in the
same capacity right wait around the joke
damn sorry I didn't want to say I didn't
want to be pedaling uh inaccuracies oh
yeah well I had to add to run my own
extended joke what vscocam so that
ladies and gentlemen is the verge of all
show we want to thank you so much for
watching and or listening if you want to
follow us on Twitter you should I am
back on Vlad it's wet Sava dan is DCC
fair with Annie I chris is said power we
