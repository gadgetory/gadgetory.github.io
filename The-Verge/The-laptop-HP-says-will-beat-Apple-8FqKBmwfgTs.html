13 and it's trying to give the MacBook a
run for its money
The Spectre 13 is supposed to be the
thinnest laptop ever made at ten point
four millimeters thick that's thinner
than the MacBook thinner the Dells XPS
13 and just those few millimeters in
difference really show it really stands
out when it's sitting on a table and
feels super light when you're carrying
it it's just under two and a half pounds
even though this is thinner than a
MacBook it's actually a lot more
powerful that's because it has a core I
processor which is what you usually find
in an ultrabook
or a MacBook Pro rather than a core M
processor which is what you usually find
in these super thin laptops HP says has
done a lot of engineering to get a core
I into such a small machine that
includes getting the heat dispersion
just right so the laptop doesn't get too
hot and making sure that its battery can
last it's supposed to go for nine and a
half hours there are some trade-offs at
this size it doesn't have a touchscreen
and the display is only 1080p but it
looks pretty good this is HP's new
vision for breaking into the premium
laptop space the same area that you'd
find a MacBook MacBook Air and Dells XPS
13 it means having a really eye catching
laptop and one that works really well
too and at least at first glance the
spectre 13 seems to meet those
requirements when you see it sitting
around on a table it's definitely going
to catch your attention because it's so
thin it has this really stylish dark
aluminum finish on the top and HP has
even made a new logo for itself that has
this sharp angular letters it looks
pretty cool HP will start taking orders
for the spectre 13 this month starting
at around twelve hundred dollars with
shipping starting next month that's also
one we'll get our hands on it for the
first time to find out if it really can
stand up in the high-end laptop market
no ok my ankle show you're gonna have to
edit them out and post lets you have to
take send like my jeans okay that's a
threat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
