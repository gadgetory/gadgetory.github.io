miller i'm david pierce this is the Moto
X so is this that's also the Moto X
because it's got a lot of no excess this
is really nice one we've got a cool
video we're going to show you and when
we come back from that will be answering
all your questions about the Moto X
tweeted us hashtag verge QA and up six
minutes give or take we'll be back
answering all that so stay tuned google
bought motorola 14 months ago and today
in new york city we're getting our first
look at first device they built together
this is the Moto X and it's really what
happens when Google becomes a hardware
manufacturer but this story really goes
back a week to verizon's announcement of
a lineup of new droids motorola made
clear to us that moto x is the future of
the company that it's where motorola is
headed but it's hedging that future a
little bit droids have a special place
there they go after people who are
looking for a lot of power top-end
hardware specs they're looking for
phones that have a unique design
character to them new phone isn't quite
as angry as your average droid i still
don't know if it's called the X or the
Moto X but whatever you call it the
phone is beautiful it's curved glass and
plastic front has tiny bezels and a big
bright display and the back curves from
flat edges to a slightly convex center
that nestles perfectly in your palm
nearly everything else about the phone
is negotiable you can choose how much
storage you get your Moto X you can also
choose the front panel either black or
white there are 18 options to the back
panel which you can also in grade + 7
for the access which are the ring around
the camera lens and the buttons the
colors look and feel different from a
woven black to a mat and rubbery grey
and if you don't like the one you pick
just send it back within two weeks and
get another assembling phones to order
like this is complicated and it takes
time so Motorola moved its operations to
Fort Worth Texas in a huge factory where
it assembles all its phones we realized
that it was really critical to be able
to deliver phones to people in less than
five days and so that's why we
moved manufacturing we took all of our
supply chain and we made it based in
Fort Worth and there's approximately
2,000 employees that put the phones
together it's a very it's a complicated
assembly process and and they're working
at our partner flextronics who we do our
manufacturing with we also course have
most of our designers engineers most of
our employees at Motorola are in America
as well and so putting our manufacturing
close to our engineering is a really
really nice feedback loop for us buyers
get to help decide what their phone
looks like but the specs themselves are
left up to Google and Motorola the two
companies made a big bet they
essentially build a mid-range phone it
is a 4.7 inch 720p OLED screen in an era
of 5 inch 1080p panels and we had a lot
of debates about what the right what the
density of display 1080 versus 720 what
the right size is so started with size
to really find the sweet spot and then
we decided the resolution to be what we
thought was ideal we could go and make
you know a higher resolution screen but
it would just suck battery and no one
would know the difference right because
we saw that we knew that the screens a
little pink to our eyes but otherwise
looks really good the Moto X has
Motorola's x8 chip which really is
little more than an off-the-shelf
Snapdragon processor plus a couple of
additional cores it's not a bleeding
edge or even necessarily top knocked
processor but it goes back to the simple
message of the Moto X it's not about
what your phone can do theoretically
it's about what it does do and what you
do with it one of the things we found is
a little bit of a curious behavior was
people turning their phones off and on
about 60 times a day and so so we
developed something we think is really
cool and very useful which we call
active display it lets the user know
that real basic information and it shows
it sort of right on the screen in this
case like it comes on and I can just go
right up to the text message it'll take
me right to the message so it's really
fast part of the reason we use the email
that display is that we can selectively
illuminate one portion of the display
which gives us a very kind of energy
efficient way to
this the Moto X knows when you're in a
car and jumps into driving mode
automatically it knows your voice and
only your voice just say okay Google now
and command your phone as you please you
can make an end calls get directions or
look up almost anything without ever
needing to touch your phone or even turn
it on the phone runs nearly pure stock
Android version 4.2 point2 somehow even
though it's owned by google motorola
still can't get the latest version of
its software there is a clear separation
between motorola and android but we also
of course have quite a bit of google
influence it doesn't help us per se
upgrade any faster there's no difference
in operation there than any other OEM
but our strategy does motorola strategy
does which is to remove a lot of the
customizations that have plagued android
phones for a long time and really just
focus right on the core android user
experience which we think is evolved to
a great place it has unlocked an
opportunity for us to pursue a path that
before we thought about but really
wasn't wasn't really going to work for
us at motorola given what our products
were what we stood for it allowed us to
design in a different way google's been
involved with the moto x design
throughout and there's even a program
for sharing employees between the two
companies it's almost like motorola
hasn't figured out what to do with
google yet and google hasn't figured out
how to use its new hardware arm either
it may not be a google play edition
phone unlocked and an android purists
dream but the Moto X is fast smooth and
powerful the only thing that didn't work
very well was the quick launch camera
you wiggle your wrists like you're
jimmying a lock and it'll jump straight
to the camera no matter what it was
doing before it's great it just doesn't
always work the camera takes good
pictures too but it has very few
features it might be too simple but
Motorola believes in simple in making
phones that fit our lives perfectly
without changing them it believes we
want phones that do what we want them to
do and they look the way we want them to
look and everything else from spec
sheets two SKUs is second there I think
three years ago the company made 45
phones we're we're obviously down to a
much smaller set and we think it's
critical to do a smaller number of
things much better at a hundred ninety
nine dollars on contract and available
on all four major US carriers we're
going to find out if simple can win
Motorola's taking on the galaxy s4 the
HTC One the I
phone 5 and even its own line of droids
those phones all have more power and
more features Motorola's fighting fire
with glow sticks here but it's glow
stick is pretty it's really easy to use
and it doesn't go out so quickly maybe
there's something to be said for glow
sticks glow sticks close to those dicks
David I know you're exhausted you
haven't slept much you wrote that huge
piece it's on the verge calm if you want
to look at it after you watch this of
course but I want to get your thoughts
you've been playing as a lot lately what
do you think the Moto X so for me that's
this whole thing kind of comes out of
what I felt about the HTC One and the
galaxy s4 where it was it was really
design versus things it does right and
this kind of takes that to a totally new
level where it's it's not about what it
does and to some extent that's sort of a
hedge for motorola for not putting great
specs into this phone but they're
focusing on design they're focusing on
how it feels they're focusing on all
this stuff that I think actually matters
in a way that the difference between
dual-core and quad-core really doesn't
matter and I think that's fascinating I
think this phone in some ways is not
perfect the more i use this AMOLED
screen the more I don't really like it
let's talk about what is actually on
this right now I mean or motorola been a
big deal about saying specs do not
matter but here are the specs that are
there is 4.3 and 4.4 points74 points an
inch and can't this goes good i can't
under i can't overestimate i guess how
small this thing feels for a 4.7 i felt
like we didn't believe that spec when we
first saw it it just feels really good
and you can actually legitimately use it
in one hand unlike basically every other
phone this size I've ever seen right
which is a big deal it is it is like
this is this feels good they're like
it's a nice weight too yeah and like
when I heard that I was doing this like
customized plastic bags I thought I was
gonna feel cheap but test- motorola
actually is pretty sturdy yeah no thank
you I mean well it's really think so is
it the event this morning right and they
were showing off you know you can
customize the back there are all these
different options and then they're like
we also have these cases and I was
literally all he said he was like hey I
don't wanted we make cases it was
basically please for the love of God do
not buy them
that was it it was great and then I
talked for like 30 minutes about
headphones but they're clearly that's
you know that way they're trying to
discover that buzz so what school is
they're partnering with Sol Republic
who's like they're sort of the hipster
cool kid of the headphone industry and
what they're doing is making headphones
that are the same color as your phone
right so when you go on the Moto maker
thing it'll suggest a pair of headphones
that look just like your phone and you
can get any color you want but it
suggests it so that's cool and so
republic makes good headphones so that's
kind of neat but the sort of the point
is they it's it feels good you don't
have to you know the galaxy s4 you
either have to buy a new back or put on
a case to make it feel decent and this
just comes out of the box and feels good
and works well right but they made a
bunch of sacrifices to get to that place
which is it looks I don't know let's
talk about sacrifice and like to me i'm
actually very happy with this i mean
going back and forth we've argued
probably three the last 10 hours over
this non-stop i know you've been writing
sorry about that but what are the
sacrifices have been made to make what
essentially Motorola's flagship albeit
mid-range phone sure so the big argument
that i think you can make for really
high-end specs is that every Android
phone kind of becomes terrible over the
course of its life and a new sign Oh to
your contract to get this phone you want
it to be good and really only Apple has
a reputation for continuing to be good
over the course of its entire lifespan
but and so the the counter to that is
basically just buy the best specs you
possibly can and hope they last the
longest right this doesn't have that
this is already sort of behind the times
it's a Snapdragon s4 pro which is a good
processor it's a very good processor but
it's you know two steps below the best
ones that are out there and it god only
knows where we'll be two years from now
like how many steps back that'll be it's
also it's a 720p screen instead of 1080p
which the argument is essentially that
it's really diminishing returns and I
tend to agree with that but it's also
you know who knows what we're going to
be able to do with more pixels and more
resolution
two years and the trade-off that he kept
saying for it was battery like that i'm
actually the theme 8d sacrifice
processor in like screamers whichever
better life if they actually get what
they're claiming is about 24 24 hours
that was really exciting so we everybody
says we're totally right that's the
everybody says right we'll get a full
day of battery life and almost
everybody's lying and when you ask them
they're like well a full days eight
hours because that's your workday rights
like well that's that's not it that's
not it that's like otay tars idle not
browsing right listening to music
locally on Spotify right but so but then
Rick gets up this morning at the event
and says a full day and somebody meeting
goes well how long is a full day he says
24 hours and then sort of gets this
smirky smile on his face because
everybody was everybody sort of was
taken aback by it but that's huge and
that's another thing where it's it's
like that matters way more to most
people than the cores in their processor
for me it's like if you give me a phone
that lasts as long as I needed to I will
make lots and lots of sacrifices to get
there and the question is do you make
the right ones and I don't know with
this honestly I need to spend more time
with it right and i need to you know i
really want to see where this is in a
year but for right now they're thinking
very much the right way which is what do
people need and it's i need a phone that
isn't bed at six pm and i need a phone
that feels good and works well and like
this is all of those things right that's
the thing that scares me the most about
this we have been going back and forth i
like this phone and there's reasons i
don't forget to especially price and
things like that but if in a year from
now this still feels like it does now
i'll be happy like we're getting apart
like their 99 maybe 100 of the apps i
want will work just as well on this as a
world es for make the process provided
me that extra developers are making for
you know this dual core processor right
now because that's what everyone's going
to have and by that being said we
thought the nexus 7 the original would
be better for a while sure we were wrong
well that would have turned out to be a
weird software thing in a lot of ways
because 1.3 noe old Nexus 7 faster right
which is sort of remarkable and that's
um you know the guys at Monroe let
didn't use that as an example yesterday
but they might as well have and they
were saying you know our hardware is
already beyond what we need from it and
now it's about making the software to
catch up and we can use the software to
better our hardware
and I don't have a ton of evidence that
that's true but it seems to be I mean we
have some a little bit of evidence that
that's true and I think you can build on
top of good hardware a lot better than
you can build on top of bad hardware and
this is good hardware but it's not great
but it's just this weird balance a game
that I'd say it's a figure out a
question like are we at the point like
we're hardware specs or plateauing to
the point we're getting what we need but
before we get into the specs I do want
to talk about the obvious thing here
which is the colors now this phone is
assembled in America designed engineered
in a simple in America that's step one
two and four step 3 of courses parts are
being made outside the camp which is
everywhere and just label to be super
clear that's only four people in America
so you live in America your phone is
assembled in America otherwise all hell
breaks loose I don't know what they were
they were oddly unclear about that they
just he basically kept for saying
America is they're not stopping America
is those it I was like okay all right
yeah apologies to every non American
person interested in stone look it's not
me it's motorola they're not apologize
for you what's how i am a little bit but
let's let's talk about the back so
there's sure 18 bags yeah does that
include cuz i know we saw i was with you
a little bit before it was does that
include the wooden back it doesn't so
there's 18 available at day one and wood
is there testing would they're testing
or testing would they don't have wood
there they're thinking about having
would you please buy another way of
saying that so what would they were
saying and I thought this actually
really interesting is that wood is it
completely different I've got a kind of
material to use just move on just moving
okay moving on it's a totally different
kind of material especially for things
like RF frequencies and some of the
cellular stuff and so they're uh Milicic
ntt docomo at least 23 years ago we're
in Tokyo for the trade shows and like
they were showing off wooden phones
right like the same issues there's
frequency concern right all that and so
what they've been doing is testing a
bunch of different kinds of wood and I
think the challenge that they're having
is figuring out which one works best so
it's coming out the fourth quarter of
this year and it'll be wood and we saw a
prototype of it yesterday I really liked
it I don't know what you thought it felt
she wasn't I liked it I just wonder what
its gonna be like in the rain yeah I'm
going to get the phone got in the
your phone shrinks a little bit a little
bit it starts growing moss that would be
amazing i would i would pay extra for
that I have no problem it's a cheap at
widget on the back of the phone no so
we've got 18 colors at launch you have
any care exclusively talked about is it
just a team well this is the weird thing
is all of the so black and white this is
this is black and there's also white
which looks like this but white but tech
arms on black and white are always
textured a little bit so there's there's
a much sort of smoother matte black that
doesn't have quite this look to it but
it's always it's the same kind of
rubbery grippy but those two are
separate consider like right there's
black and black texture yeah there's
black and black and then a different
light and white it's like paint swatches
right it's like egg cream and cream egg
and is that like dream agreement I hope
not but so you can get either of those
two when the phones come out on the
carriers which is at the end of this
month or early September but for now
AT&amp;amp;T has an exclusive on the moto maker
software which means if you want one of
the crazy colors you can only buy it on
AT&amp;amp;T which makes absolutely no sense to
me so dighton it's so pretty like don't
you want this phone I want that phone
but you can't buy it unless you're on
AT&amp;amp;T which struggles completely insane
from now like everyone I asked would go
up to me and be like it's an exclusive
for now yeah it's a second ask you
literally see that's right hop up next
to the night like we're going to give a
DTV first but just you was just like a
big eye in the sky waking at me yeah
exactly but uh no it's great so at
launch 18 colors 7 accents and the
accents are the Bob do you think is
super cool right so as to what it's it's
the the ring around the camera here
right and there is sort of a ring around
the buttons that's a little bit hard to
see but it's it's really cool and it's a
clever way for me like I'm not sure I'd
want a pink phone forever mmm I want a
pink phone for like a week and then I'd
be over having a pink phone but but at
the same time you can have like a little
bit of sort of flair to it without
because my problem with the with having
an iphone is everyone I know was an
iphone it's hopeless I give other people
my phone I take other people's phone
it's just it's a poor that's why you do
cases too true just different shapes
yeah so I like the idea that your phone
even sort of very subtly can
like your phone so was it 1818 backs
yeah seven accents yep and two front two
fronts black or white yep and 504
permutations basically that includes two
storage options food salts and two more
storage options 16 32 gig span so 504
choices for now and there's Henry
hundred those are probably very ugly but
they'll let you do those right yeah sure
I know what they should and it was funny
there they're doing Motorola's doing
this big promotion with people on
facebook where they're basically saying
show us what else you want and sort of
the sky's the limit people are just
designing wacky things and they put up a
bunch with the weirdest names ever one
was called binary curious and it was
just like ones and zeros I that's what
they they're like is funny way to do
that we're getting to the point where
like I remember Del years ago like their
big thing was by laptop right this it's
kind of fat but design anything you want
the back or we'll find some ours do a
really good job and is that kind of
where motor oil is going what's that
that's the thing is is what it kind of
is that's the that's the floor for
motorola if this goes poorly that's what
it is it's it's covering a crappy phone
with not a nice-looking shell in that
case like i could just buy a case for my
good phone everybody wins uh but in this
case it's i don't know i still I'm so
torn about this and the part that really
bums me out is this could have been the
phone that changed everything right like
if this was a nexus phone it if it came
on all four carriers but was totally
stock Android was gonna get the updates
immediately was you know sold unlocked
for 299 dollars like the nexus for the
universe might have exploded my head
would be somewhere else right now and
everyone here would already be in line
to buy one and that they do that it
sucks and heres thing kills me we've
argued back and forth on what this means
motorola is proud very proud to say that
we're an oem of google's like we're not
giving any special preferential
treatment at the same time it's almost
like saying we know Google bottle for
the patents and they don't care what we
do so will make a good phone right which
is great and so they have they have all
this time to actually make good phones I
was at the event this morning they were
talking about how they went to they went
to Google with a bunch of ideas so I
guess they have I'm not totally sure of
the setup but it sounds like they have
basically update meetings with the
Google leadership
um and there was somebody at event this
morning who was worried that Larry Page
was going to call and be like so moto X
really love the name let's change that
but so so they said early on they went
to the leadership team and you know laid
out a bunch of prototypes and was like
here's what we focus for grouped here's
what we found and the immediate and
overwhelming feedback was now any more
data so they went back they went around
the world they have this big archive of
thousands of people's hand prints they
did tons of focus groups and they really
got to it seems like take their time and
try to figure out what everybody wants
out of a cell phone and at some level
they kind of built the phone that
everybody wants which is not necessarily
a good thing in that you know you end up
in this awkward middle where everything
is pretty good and nothing is great
right um because I see you see like I'm
generalization sure broad generalization
just three different design groups are
designed by vision that's a large lake
you're Steve Jobs and jony ive doing
their thing they're designed by
committee which is I'm just gonna say
it's Samsung I mean or something it's
like like they're kind of figure out as
a big big group and this is designed by
data models like right an incredible
amount of data it sounds like we're a
very thing to do to write their famous
for having you know the 41 shades of
blue on on the home screen there's that
guy was I wound of reading it today his
his letter quitting was like i went in
and i had to argue three four or five
pixels for a border like I'm sure they
did that on message and i'm sure they
focus grouped it and I'm sure they have
tons of data and reasons why and usage
response and like it's crazy I mean I
say like this is uh this is form and
function this is fashion actually sorry
there's function it's functional enough
that's what he said it's functional
fashion let's control fashion yeah um
we're gonna make something looks pretty
and I will say this is this is the
18-team all right there's no AT&amp;amp;T logo
on this oh no I'm sorry that one's not
the 18-team also in love so yeah so if
they will have logos on them and just
little tiny ones back here and my my
favorite promise that they maybe that's
unlocked I think oh yeah your fancy like
that but so there are little logos back
here but the one thing they promised us
over and over yesterday was we will not
put anything on the front of the phone a
verizon can't put anything on there we
won't put anything on their Google can't
put anything on there
and in this case like I can live with
this I can live with a little bit of a
verizon logo and I get why they put it
there and that's a course had minimal
which what they call the batwing I don't
know why I love the tiny little bat
wings dimple is a sight just awesome I
keep just sitting here and like rubbing
this phone for some reason I don't
totally understand while David on the
phone if you have questions a hashtag
verge clear on Twitter we will get to
those questions very shortly right
before we do though I do want to talk
about the software just a bit yes
android 4.3 android 4.2 point to knotts
4.3 again another reason no professor is
on a nexus phone yeah right um honestly
like I get the rationale behind not
doing the not having it be a nexus phone
and not getting any particular
preferential treatment there why not
they owned them like Samsung gives
Samsung preferential treatment that's
not a weird thing to do it's just I wish
they would just own it and be like look
you can all use this software but we're
going to use it to for our phones so
beat us that's how you beat the
ecosystem is google saying we're gonna
build killer hardware and killer
software you beat us right anything that
uh i want to get the software i want to
get to this after that but real quick
like the thing that I'm surprised
they're not doing at lodge a very
googley thing to do is the Play edition
yes there's no bone stock Android at
large there will be a google play
edition they're not saying when but it's
not at launch right now it's again 18 to
exclusive locked exclusive but before
you get to that android 4.2 point to yes
it's not stalking android there's new
additions in fact we kinda like a half
dozen verizon apps here that are just
making me sad we do a few motorola
things they're not bad what we've seen
them what last week yeah that's a lot of
the droid features yeah a lot of this
like which is very strange and they uh
they didn't really have a good answer
for why we asked this morning why they
announced the droids last week and then
the phone that's supposedly way better
than the droids this week and all he
said was basically we finished them at
the same time it's like I guess that is
actually the answer all right uh but
there doesn't seem to be any particular
strategy to it they just you know
verizon columns like we want droids so
they made droids and then
they've made the motor it's very strange
but I think that they're increasingly
okay with droids being a big name for a
particular segment of the market and I
think that segment of the market is not
the person who's going to buy this that
segment of the market is people who say
holy crap battery life and by monster
phones that have big battery life or say
look at all of the GPUs and like that
and that's that's great and that's
there's a market that deserves to be
served of that but this is for like my
mom who's never heard of a GPU but once
a phone that works well and it feels
good but your mom is on rice i got my
mama droid she would hate it she would
cry it's funny because it might kill it
or not I don't terribly different from
this like in terms of software like
you've got a touchless which is it knows
when I say okay Google now it does stuff
yep it sure knows knees hands you gotta
train yours I got trained mine later but
the thing about droid to me and people
are going to yell at me percentile
talking to moto PR earlier like Libby
just let me just give an example and see
if this fits at all okay I told this to
the droid para guys like all right
Hollywood makes blockbusters shitty
summer blockbusters that do very well
right so they can make 10 arthouse films
is this art house and has droid your
shitty summer blockbuster right I didn't
say ease that many times mostly not
that many times yeah and they laugh they
wouldn't say anything really great PR
people of course but I don't know that's
my feeling like it d makes so much money
with the droid right I don't know if
they're actually proud of it at all
though no but I don't think it
necessarily matters that's like the what
is that that's the movie you let Johnny
Depp make so that he makes parts the
Caribbean for you but it's I feel like
the weird thing about this is it's such
a big play they're launching on so many
carriers it's coming to lots of other
countries there's going to be a google
play edition this is this is the play
like this is how they get into AT&amp;amp;T
stores and try to really make noise so i
don't know i'm not sure i sense is just
that droid is so powerful and so well
known that they'd be stupid to stop
selling it but that they also want to go
in a very different direction so they
can basically make this phone and i
would not be surprised if they do this
forever is make the moto x slap a bunch
of kevlar on
give a better processor call it a droid
charge honor dollars more for it when I
kind of thought the war for a little bit
but actually technically they're
charging our dollars more for this I
felt like well depends on which droid
there yes there's any time with the old
sugar than any all of them oh it doesn't
matter this is better we're going to get
into these questions in just a minute I
just wanna get to the last bit yeah
because you're talking with carrier so
I'm about pricing and availability in
everyone's course asking about that AT&amp;amp;T
exclusive 199 dollars on contract
carrier locked there is no off contract
price yet correct and it's not ATT
include exclusive it's on all four
carriers but all the customization is
all right it's just eighteen t ah this
is it's weird they don't it seems like
they don't know does this phone is
coming honestly that's coming out at a
very bizarre time where they don't have
a firm release date it's either coming
out later this month or at the beginning
of September it's they think it's going
to be hundred ninety nine dollars but
it's up to the carrier's they think
there's gonna be Google Play version but
they don't know when they think they're
gonna use would but they don't know when
and all this stuff it's like is it a
just ran out of time they're like a half
restore some order this fall because I
thing is it Eve not actually or is it
like a week we don't I honestly think
they don't know because they were so
candid about everything else that you
know saying how much it costs on tmobile
doesn't seem like it would be that much
extra work but i think i would say it's
safe to assume that it will be the one
thing they said for sure is that it will
be priced competitively with high end
phones right so it'll be as expensive as
all the other expensive phones like
whatever the iphone costs this will
probably cost like that and i think and
my conspiracy theory is like they know
it's a mid-range phone but there was one
other phone very recently tried to sell
mid-range at a price HTC right first a
facebook phone and it was nine dollars
in contract right it felt like a piece
it looked like it was i loved it i
really did like sewage so nice little as
I he's really fast like yesterday I was
doing using it um well with that I mean
but they priced it to look like you
should look at this right next to the
one that goes for it next the iphone
right well yeah one bomb because it was
nine dollars he knew was mid range okay
I almost feel like the charge 200 for
this you know it was probably hunted on
contract worth of it but they wanted
this to say this is our flagship
flagship 200 specs be damned we want to
make it look just like that I agree and
I think you can't
the argument that they're trying to make
which is that specs don't matter without
charging as much for the iphone right
because if you come out and say well we
have you know all these great things and
also it's a hundred dollars cheaper
people like oh well it's a hundred other
shoe because the processor is worse like
it then that's you know they lose that
argument so i think i think you're right
i think they they came out and did that
because it's impossible to make the we
are as good as the iphone argument
without being expensive as expensive as
the iphone exactly which is a weird
thing about our cell phone market but
it's sort of how it is what whatever 24
hour left yes anyway right we're good
start taking questions again if you are
on twitter hashtag verge QA we're going
to start answering everything we've got
here not everything a lot of things
first we've got tech aholic 11 sorry 1
through 10 uh he he or she asks how was
the camera the Moto X go to a battery so
there's this gesture where you go like
this and nothing happens in my case okay
I just supposedly oh there we go I guys
worked okay so then it opens up the
camera just by doing that gesture and
it'll you know and then you just tap
anywhere on the screen and it takes
pictures so that's neat it's cool for
selfies because you just be like what's
uh uh and I was talking to a gym wex
earlier name it's like i was like what
if you're drunk he's like that's why
it's tap anywhere cuz ever how drunk you
are sure you can take a picture are you
but the problem at this camera I think
and I'm curious to know what you think
yeah the problem the problem with it for
me is they got rid of everything so it's
cool because it's super simple and you
can just you know tap and take a picture
but if you want to do anything other
than tap and take a picture but it's a
lot of work so you have to you know you
get into the settings and there's a way
you can tap to focus which is neat but
then it's still once it's focused it
just fires you can you know you can
enable a couple of things but there's
just not that much to do here and one of
things they said was that nobody ever
goes into the camera settings that was
one of things that they found in all of
this message is fair I get that sure but
for someone like me who's you know
paying two hundred dollars for a phone
that I expect to do all the things I
wanted to do like simplicity is great
but only when it's masking complexity
like when you can do a lot of things and
make it look
they simple that's when you've succeeded
but in this case all they did is pull
out a bunch of features and say hey
there's only one thing you can do right
simple it's almost like oh I don't know
that counts when they design Mike here's
like no one goes in the settings it's
not because they don't want settings is
because it's terrible to use so instead
of designing a simpler interface what
look my doll that's it it does have to
take pretty good pictures I haven't had
nearly enough time to spend with it to
say for sure but it does seem to take
pretty good picture to take the counter
I do think this is a good enough no it's
average in ariz I said is if you come
from the iphone you're used to tap to
focus i like that feature but you're
also used to tap to exposure I like
nothing not working on yeah you'll get
to it no I agree Association and that's
the big thing to me is I take I found
myself yesterday I guess it was you
taking this picture right where it was
the guy standing in front of a really
bright window right and no matter what
you did you couldn't he was just pitch
dark and everything outside was in focus
and exposed and bright that there's also
this this hallway there has to be a way
to figure that and if you don't give
that to me you blew it there was also
this uh this hallway we're like what
kind of walking to that room there's a
dark hallway and it was kind of bright
over the Sun was hitting it and also
like staring it's the dumbest picture
tap does it change the exposure and try
to like compensate for the dark area did
none of that so you're just gonna have
to hope pointing it up is it getting the
right exposure I want or you just gonna
shake it a little bit over the best
right that bother me but the other thing
I usually say is I've never liked him up
until very recently I've never liked a
good Android camera like I've never
thought there was a good one fair enough
until this new crop of phones and that's
the one the s4 you know not and drove
with the Lumia 1020 we're gonna talk
about flagship devices sure I mean if
we're going to move past the spec war
and then all that argument front fine
but the things people care about then is
design they nailed it right battery life
they nailed it and camera which the
tried right one and the Lumia 1020 is
actually really interesting example of
this whole thing because you can you can
say all you want that you know 41
megapixels is useless and nobody needs
it but what 41 megapixels does is enable
a whole different kind of using your
photos and your camera where you know
you can zoom and you can rotate and you
can make these different photos out of
the photos that you take and that's cool
and that's that is purely a spec thing
and that's specs for a purpose which I'm
a big fan of but and Motorola is sort of
explicitly not playing that game it's
it's a 10 megapixel camera which is
plenty for most cases but that's you
know specs can be meaningful and good
and important if they're used properly I
think right so we got another question
this is a question we've kind of talked
a little bit over and let's just kind of
revisit it sir i'm going to call out Joe
to live over to labor sorry sorry dude
thanks for watching we love you but
sorry anyway Joe hey that a question Joe
wanted to note would you pick the x over
the HTC One or s4 and this is just comes
back to sure is this actually a flagship
phone worth buying we're spending money
on so again we we have not spent nearly
enough time with this phone to be able
to say for sure so all of this is with
the monstrous grain of salt that is the
fact that I've had this in my hand for
not very long um but I think for right
now it's it's just gonna depend on who
you are if this is every bit as good as
motorola says it is let's just grant
that sure then yes probably on my end
because i think what i want is a phone
that feels good and is like I haven't
put this down since we've been sitting
here it and it just feels nice I like
holding this phone and I felt the same
way about the one which is why all I
liked it a lot more than the s4 but the
exception and this is playing devil's
advocate this is not my own opinion
because playing devil's advocate the
screen I know when we are shooting this
features and networking everything ready
uh you know one of our directors John
lagomarsino he's actually in the control
room John and Neil I by the way yelling
people yelling at me my ear I know angry
screams go Adam go out over the screen I
wanna do it John you're welcome the
screen is not pentile but it's not great
either right so it's it's amylin demo
which uh and this is this is challenging
because I get why they detect amyloid in
the s4 know the one and the s4 both have
much better screens in the rice like
much better screens there's no question
about that I like their their logic for
it makes senses which is that you get
the notifications that I still for the
life of me can't figure
how to actually make come up the phone
like if you have it down on a desk or a
table upside down okay and then you pick
it up it comes right on and that's cool
but there's like no way to actually
activate it when you want it to seem as
though turn your phone on but so with
that that's enabled by AMOLED which lets
you light each pixel individually so
they can do that without drawing power
from having to light the whole screen
but it means you know scrolling is kind
of janky and ugly and the colors are
over saturated and I've complained about
this on samsung phones many many times
and you know it to hear Motorola say it
people don't care but I cannot care and
I know John cares right and so it's it's
it's a challenge it's trade-off and
here's like this phone I'd like using
this more than either of the others but
those are ultimately probably better
phones and that's really the question is
thing which is which without screen
better cameras better specs essentially
like that's the s4 that's the one but
for here you're getting better battery
life and with our design yeah hopefully
no I will say if battery life is what
Motorola promises this is going to be an
unbelievably compelling phone right
because it even if it's not the best out
there all I have to do is walk into a
store with you know not to keep bringing
my mom into this book with my mom and
say mom this is a smartphone it does
everything you needed to do it has a
pretty good camera and it will last you
all day and all night right and that's
you know sold beyond that like I don't
need to walk in and be like well it has
an extra notes 8 processor and a 5-inch
1080p square like my mom's asleep by the
time I finished that but if I say it's
powerful and has a pretty good camera
and lasts all day and is pretty that's
the ballgame for her oh and and the
challenge I think is going to be
competing with the one on that front
because the one is so similar in that
respect or the one mini right well and
then Samsung has all of the branding on
its side where everybody knows what it
is the s4 active the export passes the
x4 whatever I mean you put any adjective
or superlative after that right there is
a samsung phone of some inch size sure
next to it well in same time makes great
phones like they don't give Samsung a
lot not without sign but they make great
phones it's just
it's weird I don't know quite where
motorola fits into that but killer
battery life would go a long long way
right a couple of questions in the
course if you have courses will be in
comments and forms answering this
there's a huge review coming out and I'm
sorry we didn't get to your question but
I'm hoping to god they're all answer at
some point a couple more we'll get to
them we've got one do you think that the
kind of customization is important for
people also Decius has a plastic iPhone
competitor I mean this is like talk like
this looks I'm guessing team on a
competitor to the plastic iPhone or a
plastic iPhone let's talk about both
okay um but i will say i'm sending
people who are looking at this from the
video from this live show it probably
looks cheaper than it is this deals i
already yeah it does this feels
surprisingly yes dirty it's there is
plastic it's very much made of plastic
but it doesn't feel like a cheap plastic
phone by any stretch right on yeah i
don't know i think it's too good to be a
competitor to the plastic iPhone
assuming it's what we think it is and
definitely not a plastic iPhone
competitor no no which we don't know
what that's good ready but I mean but it
is speak to like that generations coming
up sure and this has to lasted two years
you're buying crude contract course or
upgrading you've got this locked in
unless your tmobile or he's doing the
really bad ATT plan really where you
guys a bunch of money to pay a bunch of
money for phones which brings us to of
course this next question trying to do
really good transitions yes learning
skill uh we've got what is motorola
betting on the carrier version of the
Moto X or the google play edition what's
the difference what's better obvious the
difference is somewhat more stock
Android which is pretty clean as is no
you know the difference is people are
gonna buy the carrier version yes uh the
the google play editions are wonderful
and they're gonna make a very core set
of nerdy people very happy and a lot of
that core set of dirty people who are
very happy hour in this office right now
um but I mean it's you only make a play
across all four carriers if you're
really buying in and we've heard rumors
about how much money google is putting
into marketing this phone and if they
wanted to just throw it in the play
store and see what happens they would
have done that this is a very different
play this is this is
them trying to be that fourth I mean I
think for all intents and purposes there
are three phones right now there's and
really only two there's the iphone the
gs4 and then slightly below the one and
this is trying to be that fourth phone
in every sense in the realm with that
and it's competing on sort of different
terms which i think is smart I don't
know if it's going to work but I think
it's smart but it's it's yeah it's the
carriers the carriers will ultimately be
what makes or breaks this device which
brings me to the other end just one last
point the facet verizon loves motorola
could be a huge win for this phone well
could be honest went for the droid are
there gonna be selling this to right and
the question then becomes you know
people are gonna walk in and they're
gonna say hey you should check out our
droids and they're like it's kind of big
and bulky and expensive and there if if
they can get them to be like hey come
check out this other phone before you
look at the iphone that's a huge win for
motorola that's going to happen but
that's a huge win that is true and that
that does bring the questions like it's
into the carrier's hands first question
that why not do both why not just give
it unlocked no star carries gonna be
pissed that you're offered a power much
fun to be clear they've not announced
how much the play dish is gonna be but
if i'm gonna guess 600 bucks so this may
be five yeah i mean if they can come out
and make it to 99 then you know okay i'm
gonna be so yes that I Spit 199 on
contract for this uh no but I think I
don't know that's a really good question
I don't know the answer to that I wonder
I wonder why they're doing it that way
because the you know there I guess on
one hand sort of philosophically getting
away from the people who buy those
phones but on the other hand like if the
people who buy those phones buy that
phone that seems like a win for
everybody I don't know it's very it's
I'm sort of confused by that strategy to
but I'm hoping when they say soon they
actually mean soon and it's things like
October as opposed to you know sometimes
when they say soon they mean
twenty thirty six right although to your
point earlier I have ATT I'm still
grandfathered into that unlimited data
as dumb as it sounds I'm never let it go
so ever leave your eyes yeah so i'm
going to i'm paying for that contract
for you a ring no matter what so i'm
gonna buy on contract and probably gonna
buy this i've been waiting for a while
to buy a phone yes and why why this as
opposed to any other option waiting so
damn long no um truth of the matter is
and to come too far a little it comes
down to almost a fashion thank like this
to me all the android phones are good
enough for what i want what i need to do
with it gmail twitter foursquare
sometimes things like that instagram
like it does everything i need I just
want a camera and I want a bright lights
got last I want notifications that
aren't bad no offense to the iphone but
like no these new gmail app is great
despite this is best notification
experience I've ever had and I might be
the only one the office who hates the
one design I do hate the HTC one's lime
it looks go ahead to me Ross you're dead
it's it's the same thing that Sony argue
with like bells and whistles when you
get any never use it again if you want
borgeous yeah I think it looks gorgeous
until i play with it for more than a day
in the back scratched up or anything oh
my prized by how many people added here
that have gotten danger yeah or i have
it on my desk like this in that hole
wavy back it buzzes its metal on metal
in books like I don't want that i really
i texted this phone like five times rauf
like an hour day going does this bother
me does this piss me off no national
buzz happy that it's an experiencing
like we're talking qualitative or
quantitative which unfortunately for us
is like basically going to what Motorola
wants sure but the right and this is
kind of what I want yeah no I mean I I I
kind of agree again I need to you know
see if everything that they claim is
true is actually true right but if it is
i think you know i'd rather have a phone
that works all day and does everything
else well instead of a phone that lasts
six hours and does everything else
really well right like that's the chime
happy to make that trade-off and I think
I mean if Motorola's data is right a lot
of other people are too but one final
question and then we're going to switch
gears get to the verge cast maybe take a
small break we've gray here hours like
just preparing for this where does
motorola go from here and the reason i
ask cuz like this is the thing
bother me so much motorola keeps saying
we're past the specs we're done playing
the specs game and i'm not entirely sure
we're at the point where the specs have
plateaued enough to say that I agree but
like it's just almost there too like
they're making compelling case but where
do they go from your mobile is a company
who's making a carrot thing it's not
really what Google does Google's mantras
screw the carriers will do our own right
motors like let's just do everything
because my OLB bless price what's next
so I think and I'm curious to know what
you think about this too but i think the
pc industry is really instructive here
where we had sort of the same spec race
where everything up better everything
got faster everything got uglier
everything got cheaper everything got
sort of dumber and overwrought and
unnecessary and then we sort of pulled
back which is not to say they stopped
getting faster they stopped getting
better but we started paying attention
to design and battery life and how
things feel and how they work but i
think what what's going to happen here
again is that we're going to have sort
of a Haswell moment where i hope this is
my hope for like the next two years is
that somebody's going to come out with a
new chip that it's not it's better as as
well as better but it enables different
things like Haswell has graphics built
into the chip so you get better game
support from even an ultrabook or like a
macbook air right it has unbelievable
battery life so you from the same
machine you always had just proved
better battery life and I think in that
sense I think specs are going to start
to go away from being objectively faster
like by the time you're doing you know
billions and billions of calculations
every second there's real diminishing
returns so the focus is on other things
and and I don't think you know I'd love
to do 3d CAD modeling on my phone but I
don't nobody needs to do that that's not
that's not where we all got even a good
hypothetical you'd never do kadmo know
what anything and that's where you know
we can build towards that in a spec race
but we can also you know find a way to
make our hardware do better things and I
think if Motorola can be in a place
where it can get some whatever the phone
version of some
like as well is where it's it's better
without being you know the absolute
bleeding edge but it enables things like
graphics and things like battery life
and all this other stuff I think that
could get really exciting because motor
role is in a lot of ways ahead of the
game when it comes to design and
manufacturing and they're doing a number
of things really well they have the size
down they've figured out some of the
software and services and now it's just
a matter of they've sort of builds a
shell that they can fill with better
specs this time goes on and that's a
pretty good place to be right i mean i
don't know i mean we try and figure this
out and like this strategy felt very
similar to how HTC was positioning
itself early on with like the HTC one
the one device that matters just the
flagship phone and then as time went on
an agency was doing worse almost like
they're getting better reviews but the
quarterly is laying out and they just
started releasing other phones acquit
did heads are best before there was the
windows 8 X Windows Phone a dexterous
did okay from Windows Phone sure it's
the one man yeah weird number of them in
the wild really way more than I see
you're you and I thought wanting is
there anything like that windows stores
mostly not only yes still mostly samsung
android devices no but uh no III agree
but um but and whatnots practice not
know making a good device and selling a
ton of them are not necessarily
correlated and if Samsung's really good
at one thing its marketing everybody
else out of the market so yeah it's
gonna be insane but what do you think
like what what a year from now what do
you what should this look like and I
can't really disagree the light set but
I will say that the specs have to get
better because it has to last longer I
think 24 hour battery life that's enough
like yeah I'm happy like when we talk
about ebooks like you and I very long we
first met one of the first things he did
was like eating nook event it was like a
look easy glow like yeah glowlight sorry
sorry barnes noble your septa another
easy glow light is the next one thank
you yeah but we into the event and like
oh we've got 48 36 hours of battery life
I'm like or no it's two months right and
like even for an e-book I'm like that's
that's enough I don't care right right
very much coming be like a year yeah
well I guess that's better and for
laptops if you can have a laptop last a
day or two right that's enough and we're
pretty much there with the house well
uh this is 24 hours the you know droid
maxx's 48 hours we're proving that we're
getting to that point you were hitting
this kind of plateau where keep better
life is work on efficiency but you can
also increase the performance right now
camera right which I yeah I need
something better than this yeah i agree
and that's great the other thing I think
is fashion they've got the design done
you're happy with this I think motorola
though needs to sell it and i don't know
if they're gonna do it i like this phone
i don't know if people don't walk in the
store and go well I don't like the droid
is it only the droid could probably get
the iphone right i think i agree that's
the brandon my great hope is that people
know about this phone and i think that's
true this is we're talking about its
earlier i think this is the third most
hyped phone I've ever seen in my life
behind the iphone 5 and a galaxy s4 this
is i have people who don't know anything
about phones being a quince that that
new the new x phone coming out i kind of
want to get that and i hope i hope to
god that motorola can ride that into
something for their own sake but yeah i
agree i don't i don't know and cameras
I've sort of lost hope the cameras are
we gonna get like really good but maybe
they will those hips well this is my
goodbye to the Moto X's at this point I
have to give it back to Motorola you're
