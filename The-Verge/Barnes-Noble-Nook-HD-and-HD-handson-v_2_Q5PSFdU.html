checking out two new tablets and Barnes
&amp;amp; Noble it's the nook HD and the Nook
HD+ they're two totally new tablets
unlike anything Barnes enola side before
and they're making a big deal out of the
technology inside both and the new
interface and there's some new stuff in
the shop and they're pretty great
tablets what we've seen so far the first
thing you'll notice when you turn the
new nubs on is that there are a bunch of
different user profiles you can boot
into barns and we'll talked a lot about
how families tend to share tablets and
so you can actually set up completely
separate user accounts there's one that
kind of manages everything but you can
set up one for your kid or your spouse
or whoever and manage what apps are
books or websites they're allowed to
visit it's a pretty cool feature we've
seen something like it on other tablets
but this is a very kind of complete core
feature in the android operating system
here they've also redesign the interface
a lot on these new tablets it's based on
Android 4.3 alee nothing like a lot of
the Android tablets we've seen it has a
carousel at the top kind of like what
Amazon did with all your most recent
stuff but it doesn't take up the whole
page and you still get icons for apps or
bookmarks or what have you and it's a
pretty nice compromise I think between
all of that stuff because this Ice Cream
Sandwich there's also a bunch of
different home screens so you can
customize it to your heart's content
there's four icons down at the bottom
which launched you into your browser or
your apps or your library which has all
your magazines and books and whatnot in
it but really the biggest changes here
brought on by the displays the nook HD
has a 7-inch 1440 x 900 display which
horizontals making a big deal out of it
being better than the kindle fire or the
Nexus 7 or any of the other tablets out
there at the same size and it really
does look good blacks or really black
and whites are really white it's great
for reading everything's really crisp
and we got to watch movies on it too and
with the wide display it looks really
nice and on the HD Plus you get on full
1920 x 1080 display and it'll actually
output 1080p content onto your TV via
hdmi if you want it but even on the
device itself the screen looks really
really good Barnes &amp;amp; Nobles talked a lot
about the technology behind the display
how they have laminated the display to
the glass and how there's no air gap so
it should be less reflective and the
resolutions a big deal and all these
things are really important on a reading
tablet and from what we've seen so far
it's pretty successful the screen is
definitely one of the best we've seen on
a tablet
and having such a great display makes
things like magazines and catalogs would
look really good and there are a bunch
of nifty features they've implemented
especially for the bigger screen that
works pretty well you can swipe down
with two fingers on any given page and
clip a page to basically a scrapbook
like magazine clippings and you can also
tap on a hotspot they're calling it for
products that will jump you straight to
a website where you can buy the product
from Pottery Barn or whatever catalog
you're reading it's a pretty clever
feature and it's a whole new section of
the barnes &amp;amp; noble store they've also
beefed up the magazines and there are
more apps and books and again all these
things are designed to be used on the
bigger screen and the higher res screen
and especially magazines like National
Geographic look really great with big
images and great colors the other thing
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble talked a lot about was
just the overall performance of devices
there are brand new TI OMAP processors
built into both devices and we were
using pre production software so there
were some lags and some crashes and some
issues but Barnes &amp;amp; Noble promises
that'll all be worked out by the time
these products are ready and everything
else that we saw when it worked it
worked really well really smoothly even
with big images and magazines things
seem to work really fluid
both new nook tablets are going to be
available at the end of October but they
are available for pre-order now the
7-inch device is going to be a hundred
ninety nine dollars for eight days of
storage or four thirty dollars more you
can get 16 gigs of storage and with such
a small gap expect a lot of people to
get more storage the HD plus the 9 inch
model is going to be available also at
the end of October for 269 dollars for
16 gigs of storage we can get 30 24
again only thirty dollars more it's a
small gap and people should just get
more storage they look really great
especially with the kindle fire out it's
going to be a really interesting holiday
season and there's certainly a lot of
good tablet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
