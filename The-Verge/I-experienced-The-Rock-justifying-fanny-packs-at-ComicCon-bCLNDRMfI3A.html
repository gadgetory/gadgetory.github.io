up Hall 8 the biggest venue at Comic Con
I showed up at 4:30 in the morning and
at that point everybody just looks like
a homeless person people in sleeping
bags keep gathering around garbage fires
watching television but finally they let
us in and we get to see upcoming
blockbusters and just what I'm feeling
like the day has peaked all the lights
go on and suddenly you hear a man's
voice shout I am Hercules and everyone
starts screaming because the rock is
like running down the halls and I have
lost all journalistic credibility at
this point I've heard my laptop on to
the person next to me I'm waving at him
like he's gonna see me and just walk
over but the greatest thing if somebody
shouts out pit rock was your fanny pack
and in case you haven't followed this he
posted this throwback Thursday photo of
himself looking ridiculous and so he
starts cracking up and then he has to
explain why he was wearing a fanny pack
and the rock talking about his fashion
choices from the 90s on state is
basically all my dreams coming true at
the same time and so I blacked out</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
