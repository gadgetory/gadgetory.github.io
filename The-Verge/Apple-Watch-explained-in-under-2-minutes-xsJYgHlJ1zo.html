wearable race the company unveiled its
long-awaited fitness tracker today and
it's called the Apple watch the device
is a square faced SmartWatch that comes
in two different sizes three different
models and dozens of different bands all
models feature what Apple calls the
digital crown a small knob on the side
of the device think of it as the home
button on the iPhones the digital crown
can be rotated to scroll zoom and
navigate the user interface without
obstructing the display the glass on the
watch is made of sapphire crystal the
scratch proof material that was
speculated to be used in the new iPhone
6 models displays sapphire is a
relatively common material and high-end
watch making and it makes perfect sense
for it to be used here on the back side
of the watch is a set of four rings that
houses sensors the watch is using to
track where is activity the sensors
include infrared visible light LEDs and
photo sensors which all work together to
detect your heart rate using that
information Apple says that it can put
together a comprehensive look at a
person's daily activity the Apple watch
also has a built-in gyroscope in a
taptic engine for input sensing which
allows it to recognize the difference
between a tap and a press charging the
watch is super easy thanks to a MagSafe
charger that simply snaps on the back of
the device there was no word however on
a watch's battery life on a software
side the voice-activated Siri assistant
will come integrated along with
dedicated maps and photo applications
brand new fitness and workout apps will
serve to collect your daily biometric
data and encourage a more active
lifestyle
there's also watch kit designed to help
developers create apps tailored to the
Apple watch the previously announced
