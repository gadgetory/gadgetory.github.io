we're looking at Windows Phone 8.1 an
update to Microsoft's mobile operating
system the first thing you'll notice is
when you scroll through the tiles on the
Start screen here there's a transparent
effect and you can basically skin these
tiles with a background image and that's
coming across to all old devices that
update and it's just a new feature and
it's kind of cool-looking and now some
of the bigger features in Windows Phone
8.1 is a new Action Center you swipe
down from the top so kind of similar to
iOS and Android
you've got your sort of settings here
you can turn off and Bluetooth turn off
Wi-Fi all that kind of stuff and you can
also check out the battery so you
actually see the percentage these days
and notifications from apps will show
here you could tweak them and get them
to mute not to vibrate and all the
sounds etc and another big feature is
obviously Cortana and you hold down the
search button to activate the voice side
of it you can ask the questions you
could also interact with texts so it
will quickly show you that now now on
the text side you can actually use a
swipe keyboard now much the same this is
the fastest in the world and they're
boasting about that it's kind of fast
and it's all integrated in so you don't
have to like go and swap to it it's just
all there now what kind of the theme of
Windows Phone 8.1 is tweaking and lots
of small additions so one of them
battery saver can go in the recent list
basically all your battery usage across
all of the apps so you can see which
apps are really taking your battery
clinical and there's also a Wi-Fi sense
feature that will automatically connect
to free Wi-Fi networks when you when
you're on the road so Internet Explorer
has also been updated supports YouTube
in the way that the YouTube video will
now play inline rather than full screen
and you can also sync all your tabs back
to your windows 8.1 device and that's
kind of a common theme across Windows
Phone 8.1 so even your like your theme
color choice and your layout here will
sync up to onedrive and that'll be
prevalent across any Windows Phone 8.1
device that you use so marshals also
separating out the video and the music
features and podcasts and there's also
new features in the Canada so the view
view looks a lot better so that was kind
of the the big features Action Center
Cortana and his cool new start screen
and that was Windows Phone 8.1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
