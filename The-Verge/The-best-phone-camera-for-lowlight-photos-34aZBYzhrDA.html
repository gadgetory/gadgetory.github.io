released this year and tried to figure
out which ones are the best at shooting
in the dark you might think that Apple's
imaging prowess and good light would
mean it's the best in low-light too
that's not always the case while the
iPhone 10 generates consistently
pleasing images in nighttime scenes bar
scenes
indoor scenes and other low-light
situations the phone tends to smudge the
images a bit too much to hide the noise
that shows up in low-light photos
getting rid of noise is something all of
these phones try to do but the iPhone
sometimes takes it a little too far and
the photos can lose detail in the
process take a look at these branches
where these power lines or this building
now compared those to these photos from
the pixel 2xl and the HTC u11 these two
smartphones believe it or not
consistently handled low-light
situations better than the rest
the HTC u 11 captures great detail in
most low-light situations often much
more than the iPhone 10 does and it
doesn't skew the colors of these scenes
as much as the note 8 or the LG v 30 it
also does a really good job of providing
good dynamic range considering the lack
of available light where the HTC u 11
falters is that it's not always
consistent in capturing photos to the
best of its ability the pixel to excel
on the other hand is fantastic at this
google's method of taking multiple
photos at once and then blending the
results together helps it reduce image
noise capture more light and the results
are just occasionally unbelievable
colors are accurate the photos are crisp
that handles highlights in these dark
photos really well this process of
blending images is known as HDR
photography which stands for high
dynamic range and the other smartphones
are able to do similar tricks the
difference is that Google just does it
so much better the pixel isn't perfect
there are times where it missed focus or
other times where I put too much HDR
processing into a scene leaving the HTC
with the best image of the bunch and
let's be clear all of these phones have
image stabilization which is a huge help
in low-light they also all have super
wide apertures which let in a ton of
light for a camera this size and they
all have flashes that are useful in a
pitch the iPhones is especially good now
because it slows down the shutter speed
so that it's not always obvious that you
used a flash compared to years past
these phones below their predecessors
out of the low-light waters but the next
time you're in a dark restaurant are
trying to take a picture of a nighttime
Sene you'll have the best chance of
capturing that photo if you have a pixel
- in your hands hey thanks for watching
if you want to see a full in-depth photo
comparison with all those smartphones we
did a huge 30 minute video with our
creative director James b√¶rum you can
watch that right here and also go
