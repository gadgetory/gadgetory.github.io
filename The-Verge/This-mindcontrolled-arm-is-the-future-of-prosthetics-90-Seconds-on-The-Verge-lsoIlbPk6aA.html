prosthetic arms with an immobile hand or
a metal hook but that's all about to
change movie i'm sam Scheffer and this
is 90 seconds on the verge the US Food
and Drug Association has approved the
DECA arm system a mind-control
prosthetic that can do multiple
simultaneous movements a number of
scientists and engineers from around the
world are working on similar limbs but
this is the first one with FDA approval
the DECA arm system is similar in size
and weight to an actual human arm it's
capable of detailed tasks like using
zippers brushing teeth and even handling
fragile foods like grapes and eggs the
company has nicknamed it Luke after the
character from Star Wars notice the
similarities the project is funded by
DARPA but developed by deca a company
founded by Segway inventor Dean Kaman
here's how it works
the deca arm system is controlled by EMG
electrodes placed on the remaining
portion of the human arm a computer
processor translates muscle contractions
into one of 10 specific movements the
system also uses a combination of
switches and both movement and force
sensors for control some of which we'll
showcase in a 60 minutes report from
2009 this is Fred Downes who was the
Veterans Affairs official in charge of
prosthetics first time in 40 years
my my left hand did this with FDA
approval deca can now bring the arm to
market with that said there's currently
no price and won't be until the company
finds a commercial partner to
mass-produce for more on the deca arm
system check out the verge coming up
DARPA announces a collaboration with
Dharma to create a prosthetic hand that
pushes a button every 108 minutes</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
