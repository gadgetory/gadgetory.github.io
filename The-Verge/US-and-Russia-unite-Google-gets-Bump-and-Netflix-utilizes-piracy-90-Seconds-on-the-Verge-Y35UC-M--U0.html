robertson and after 450 minutes and 27
thousand seconds were finally at episode
300 but really we measured in love this
is 90 seconds on the verge after three
days of talks the US and Russia have
agreed to a plan that calls for the
destruction of Syria's chemical weapons
Syria is expected to submit a list that
includes the names and quantity of its
weapons in the next week the complete
elimination of Syria's chemical weapon
capabilities is set for the first half
of 2014 it is important to note that the
US military has not moved its destroyers
in the Mediterranean Sea with Obama
saying quote if diplomacy fails the
United States remains prepared to act
google has bumped into a new business
partner bumped the mobile transfer app
that allows users to trade data by
simply tapping their phones has been
acquired by Google Google will likely
look to incorporate elements of bumps
wireless data transfer into its own
mobile phones and operating system
perhaps Google is looking to incorporate
head bumps into glass and finally piracy
is helping Netflix stuff while piracy
Netflix is team led by Reed Hastings
says they check what shows are being
pirated the most to determine what to
buy the company hopes that by giving
customers all the shows and movies they
want for only a few dollars a month
they'll stop pirating them this led to
Netflix purchasing shows like prison
break which is commonly torrented in the
Netherlands if this is based at all on
what I torrent expect to find rubik the
amazing cube coming soon to Netflix and
that's it for today's top stories coming
up tomorrow feminism is it killing grand
