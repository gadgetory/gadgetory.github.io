playstation 4 so this is the start of
the next gen I'm crazy excited for this
year what what do you think defines next
gen what if you didn't know which
console was running on or the hardware
behind it you saw that games next gen
that games not what would you say that
is it to me it's it's about doing more
of what we've seen on this generation so
it's it's not just there's not some
overall technology that's necessarily
better but overall the PlayStation 4 is
more powerful so for example if you
wanted to attach a deeper physics model
to every single enemy that was on the
screen and you want a higher volume of
those you can do that while you're also
putting an advanced lighting model on
the whole scene all of its bigger and
better that's what people are going to
notice you guys have gotten this really
great perception of being the one for
for gamers yeah what is it about the
games that that made people walk away
from these keynotes and think Sony's
games are about gamers and Microsoft
doesn't quite get it I think man there's
a million ways to answer that question
and I think a lot of it is just some of
the culture that's come through from
from a lot of the leaders in our in our
group it starts for me with with shoe
who is my boss and is genuinely a gamer
I love to play games Adam who was on
stage loves to play games so when we
talked to devs it we don't go in with a
spreadsheet and a calculator and say
okay this is the profit margin on this
game we're talking about game features
and how it relates to movies we've just
seen and how it relates to other games
and did you see this did you see this
mechanic in this game and did you try
this not necessarily like game a B and C
on PlayStation beat game a B and C on
actually not it's just a pencil overall
I think it's a general it's it's what
PlayStation stands for I mean again I
love to talk about this subject because
you can say look at a game like heavy
rain when it first came out not a lot of
places would approve development on that
game because it doesn't quite make sense
on the spreadsheet but it
ances our medium of games to a place
that it hasn't been before sit
goosebumps right so it's true right it's
crazy it's me I won't be boys club its
toll it's really I mean that right and
and when shoe says that he means it when
you know Adam Boyes goes out you know he
announces transistor on stage right
today there last night I don't get turns
out at all I don't have any idea what
that is but it but but but you did get
that it was that it looked beautiful and
different right so the point is the
first time he sees that he comes back
give sends me a text give me a call hey
you're not going to believe how cool
this looks right and that just kind of
goes on we have to get this in the
family and then dev see that passion in
it it just becomes a two-way thing what
would what happened emotion gaming for
you guys it's not really here to show
you talked about at the launch you
talked about your technology for the eye
but I've always seen one game here fact
most of the PlayStation 4's aren't
plugged in to an eye and I I think what
is really the big issue for me is that
the the PlayStation 4 is not shipping
with the odd as a default well to answer
the last question it's it's not
something that we wanted to require our
customers to purchase it's also not
something certainly back to the previous
point about about creative vision and
kind of freedom on teams it's it's not
something we wanted to mandate for every
team as well so what kind of taking it
one step at a time if there are great
ideas that come from great developers
either inside or from third parties or
from our from from indys from you name
it we actually embrace that completely
but it's not something that we're going
to cram down people's throats how did
you guys feel when you got the say that
word out loud or I don't know that it's
because 394 the word the phrase that's
309 let's say it's a phrase so
absolutely great I mean it was an
amazing feeling so you know this client
went nuts absolutely and we went nuts I
mean we were kind
Hooten just like everyone else because
this plan has been in place for years
you know developing a brand new console
takes a long time so with a goal that 0
was kind of put in motion about three or
four years ago you saw this at the
februari event where we talked about how
we talked to all the different
developers you know what are you liking
about the ps3 what would you like to see
changed that's all real all that
happened and our goal was to build the
most powerful console at a price that
was affordable and we set that target at
399 and all the great engineers in Japan
mark cerny was leading all those teams
everything all came together the game
developers all came and said what they
wanted we made sure there was you know
eight gigs of the fastest Ram out there
I mean all these things that developers
wanted still manage to do all of that in
a machine that was super slick looking
and still did it for 3 99 that's why
it's something it's a moment that we're
very proud of and we were all that was
accentuated when our competitors
announced morning that it wasn't for 99
how did that so I mean were there high
fives rounding are you kidding me up so
so so so like a low fuzz okay well we
were out we were all in rehearsals all
day so at the at the sports arena where
the the e3 event was the press
conference so you know that some people
are at the press conference everyone's
got looking at Twitter everything's and
as soon as it one ounce yeah there's
running up and down the aisle woohoo you
know makes our announcement that much
better so I just wanted to clarify that
the drm stuff there's been a little bit
of confusion because you guys again to
great applause I really feel like you
paid attention to Microsoft's
announcement too great applause you know
announced on disk you're going to allow
people that you know they're going to
play used games and they don't have to
connect to the internet all the time
that
you know be very clear policy Jack laid
it out pretty clearly then you guys also
said some stuff though about developers
being able to set their own dr around i
just want to you know clarify what what
that means and also what the drm
policies are for digital it's not that
developers are setting their own damn
i'm erm we we set a very clear policy
about about physical used games and
there's a reason that you know kind of
that one-two punch just basically saying
look the your games you bought them you
can play them on your machine at home
and you want to play the metra friend's
house you take it to your friends house
and you play the policy is very simple
and we're setting the precedent on
definitely how we want all first party
games to act and for me personally i
believe that you know why would it make
sense right for anyone to come up with a
used game drm policy that's that's that
that that isn't fair to consumers well
so so there are other ways that your
guys's policies right now contrast with
with the current gen or are you guys the
same it's the same thing because we are
seeing right in the current jam the
current gen like this game comes with an
unlock codes you get a special sword for
the person first person who buys it or
you know the online activation so that
so that less than was it going to limit
at all attempt to look is it two
different questions so first question
could a publisher come out with a
special piece of content that is an
unlock code that makes it more valuable
to the first purchaser sure that could
happen it still doesn't prevent
secondhand sale of that game but I
wondering if there's any new ways you're
gonna try to discourage that or no it's
not it's not a goal to discourage it I
think we came right out and said that
the online pass you know will go away
because that's because it requires a PS
Plus subscription to play multiplayer
online does it make sense for an online
pass to ask you to pay again it just
doesn't make any sense right so that's
that's why we came out very clearly and
said that you know no more online pass
okay yeah why does some playstation plus
cost to play multiplayer
people have been used to having maybe a
subpar multiplayer experience on
PlayStation and also having that for
free so where's the where's the balance
there now that you have to pay for my
you're going to put it that way I think
that that does cost a lot of money to
run a set of online services that's what
I'm at yeah and I think of the reason
that you're moving that way yeah
absolutely can be better at multiplayer
absolutely okay you know if you're gonna
put it that way tell me that you'll be
better at multi before and I think that
that is that is absolutely our goal you
know we want to provide a service that's
very robust and that offers you all
kinds of great value and it there's
other services there too and we're not
going to do silly things like not going
to put the movie services behind a pay
gate because that doesn't make sense you
already pay for it right so we're
treating this as fairly as we can you
know for all the customers out there and
making sure that they get a ton of value
and that they do get a better service at
the end of the day is there any reason
to believe that so that the PlayStation
4 will be any different than the
PlayStation 3 as far as your guys's own
entertainment services sony has this
vast library of movies and music that no
other publisher has and so let's take
advantage of it let's find new ways to
take advantage of it let's let's make
that PlayStation customer happier than
any other customer out there and what
Michael did say on sage is that it's to
his it's to his benefit that playstation
4 succeeds is that going to be connected
to PlayStation Plus in ways that the
people will be able to we're not
announcing how all those things tie
together I mean there's there's all
sorts of different permutations what are
there what does game or friendly content
mean like what do gamers want I think
what michael was referring to is that
there's obviously when you think of kind
of the stereotypical hardcore gamer you
kind of think of a certain genre of
movies I think that's what he was
referring to this would be all the fast
and furious if there's no zombies it
doesn't make it on no it's it no but but
in in that girl's name you know like
okay yeah and I think who knows what
that means I think that that
gamers like a pretty wide variety of
movies so Gaikai i think i know i assume
gaikai was coming the game streaming was
coming too at launch so what why is that
being delayed or is that being delayed
it's just it's a service that's going to
continue to grow over time and I think
that it's um you know still a relatively
new technology and understanding how
that's going to work with PlayStation
content on not just playstation machines
but on all sorts of other devices
there's still a lot that that has to be
worked out and that was Andy's point he
was he was verifying that it be on on
all devices you know your smartphone
your tablet all that stuff but that it
would continue to grow over time I mean
a part of the family now and it's
launching early 2014 yes that's what he
knows and you guys talked about select
classic ps3 games being playable over
Gaikai we haven't announced exactly
which I think Andy's just making a point
that we're going to start there and
again that that library is going to grow
there's so much in the PlayStation
library from 17 years I just didn't
backwards compatibility has been
something that has been over promise
under delivered by everybody in the
industry all the time yeah is there any
reason to believe that it's going to be
better this time what people will still
be playing ps3 games because i don't
know if i have room for a ps3 and a ps4
and xbox 360 xbox one in my welcome by
the last two then so again that is part
of the goal is that gaikai will not only
reach out to a whole different set of
folks out there but that it might
satisfy some of that need to play some
of your older games this is total
tangent but I'm a huge twitch TV fan
yeah when you get the notes you stream
yeah I was really excited about that
because I think that's I love enjoying
games vicariously and watching you all
the way it's cool but then Microsoft
announced which and I'm at which guy
yeah that's where I go every night which
you know games me to sleep
where you guys surprised that microsoft
announced twitch streaming and do you
think that's just obvious no that's
obvious but I don't know that we were
surprised either i mean this is this is
an industry this is the week when
everyone announces all their deals and
associations with all these other
technologies and companies so things
happen I mean was Microsoft surprised
when we announced redbox and flixster I
don't know your service is a little
different yeah and that it will you can
someone can jump in and play your game
right eventually through gotcha is that
the yeah that is that is that is kind of
a long term goal there it's pretty
interesting it's pretty interesting idea
I think someone is going to come and
help you out with something you're
having trouble with that's pretty neat
and so that will all happen through the
console interface you're watching
somebody over their shoulder then you
press a button yeah that is over yeah
again and then that is the long-term
goal this long-term goal and then will
that happen when gaikai launches or
maybe even longer than that not a
hundred percent sure okay you said you
get these sort of vertical slices of
these games in their early stages and
obviously these are all still pretty
early are they there any that you get to
have a good time ps4 crazy next-gen
games that you can go into your office
right now sit down and have a good time
with I mean you can do that with
everything that they saw at the show
like those were live gameplay demos that
you saw when you walked in last night so
yeah all those games I can I can play
those same sections it's just I can't
wait until all that stuff is revealed
because I'm really excited about how
that looks in that game so absolutely
all right all right your diva thank you
so much thanks take it easy
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
