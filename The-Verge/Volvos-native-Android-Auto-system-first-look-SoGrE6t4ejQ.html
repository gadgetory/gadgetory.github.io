- Hey, this is Natt with The Verge,
and I am here at Google I/O 2018
where we are about to go check out
the first car that has Android
Auto natively built in.
Let's go see.
(upbeat music)
We are now in the Volvo XC40.
It's the first Volvo car
that's going to have Android
Auto pre-installed in the car.
So, whether or not you use
an Android or an iOS phone,
you can still get access to Google Maps
and all of the other Android Auto skin
without actually connecting your phone.
So, the system runs on Android P,
which is the latest system,
and it has all this stuff pre-installed.
You have Maps, which you
can tie to your account.
It kind of lets you personalize
the driver to the account.
So you can adjust your seat.
You can set your Maps
shortcuts to your home,
your work address, or other
favorite destinations,
and you also have access to
a bunch of entertainment apps
so that you can adjust which one you like.
The newest part of this is now
a Google Play functionality
that lets you install different apps.
Now, these are going to be curated
so that all the apps that are available
are going to be car specific.
So you won't get every single
Google Play app onto the car,
just the stuff that makes sense,
such as music or navigation or texting.
The car will also have RCS pre-installed.
So, that uses the new Google Chat protocol
so that you can get messages
without waiting to receive it on Hangouts
'cause R.I.P. Hangouts.
There's also an integrated
Google Assistant button
that you can click and
ask for the assistant
to change other hardwares in the car,
such as car temperature or seat warmers.
Now, this is Volvo's skin on Android Auto,
which means that this looks
like a Volvo infotainment system,
but it basically runs on Android.
Other car makers may adopt the same thing,
but it may look a little different.
The goal is for the system
to look like the car
that you're familiar with
and you use and drive all the time,
but the experience of using an Android app
such as Google Maps or
Assistant will be consistent
with what you use at
home or on your phone.
If you use a Google
Assistant app on your iOS,
that comes in this car as well.
The way Volvo has it right now
is that Google Maps is available
both on the main infotainment screen
and also up in the navigation up here.
This is all a work in progress.
It's just a demo,
which means that Volvo
actually won't be able
to roll this out until at least 2020,
but it's a good glimpse
of what it looks like
to have Android Auto in
the car without your phone.
The new Google Assistant
update will be able
to make appointments for you.
So, in the future, Volvo believes
that the car will then be able to tell
when your car is ready for maintenance
and then suggests that
you can make appointments
through Google Assistant within the car.
Again, you don't need your
phone for any of this,
but if you have it tied
to your Google account,
that'll help.
So, I mentioned this is
running on Android P.
If you wanna learn more about Android P,
we actually have a different video
that goes down all the lists
of all the features coming
to Android P; check it out.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
