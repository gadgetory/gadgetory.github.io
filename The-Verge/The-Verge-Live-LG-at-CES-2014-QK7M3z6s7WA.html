I'm Josh Topolsky of course i'm here
with dieter bohn LOL oh hello on and
we've just finished LG's exciting
sexually exciting a press event actually
not that exciting it depends on how much
you want to know about washers yeah a
lot of lot of smart honestly a lot of
smart stuff but we did but we did I
think I think most importantly what just
happened is webos the ill-fated palm
operating system ill-fated is is a very
nice way to put that yeah ill yeah see
mommy it's sick ill design yeah but
that's a live again it's still here to
talk about the rebirth of webos alright
so dieter should we talk about the
announcements you just wanna talk about
webos for a second we just get into it
so so LG announced a bunch of webos TVs
yeah at varying sizes they say that that
fifty six percent of their t means next
year will be running level s 56 yeah
it's a very exact number 70 no they
expect that seventy percent of their
total sales will consist of webos okay
and fifty-six percent is like of the
number of tvs a record so more than half
the televisions that LG ships in this
calendar year will be weatherley yeah
that means that they sell at least 50
different models probably a hundred
probably more because to get 256 and
that Annie Brown number never I don't
know the numbers but you know they're
running as a native operating system
webos yep which is has gone through a
lot of permutations and you have you
have kind of the inside story on on the
design of this new version of webos yeah
so no two yet just run through run
through the story that you that you put
up just like an hour ago yeah so
yesterday we went and we spoke to at
I've on Shaq and Collins owl I'm going
to murdering Collins last name who are
the design guys behind webos on the TV
they came over from HP after LG bought
the company and we walked through what
the thinking was behind why webos looks
the way it does why it doesn't look
exactly like webos on a tablet because
trying to manage cards the old school
cards on a tablet would be a nightmare
right so they they redid everything and
they're using this metaphor of a line
right and so what are the benefits here
like why not just using off-the-shelf
why don't just build their own you know
grab the Linux you know do their own
distro or whatever like everybody else
or just use Android right at the base I
don't know if I fully understand or they
wouldn't have been easier to just use
Android as opposed to webos so the
designs of faculty the main reason is
that web apps don't perform very well on
Android at all and they perform pretty
good on level s if you're optimizing it
and it's a lot of smart TV apps are just
built an HTML because one they're
already building for the web they're
building it because it's cross-platform
so they can get it to run on all these
other smart TV platforms and all these
insane set-top boxes and blu-ray players
and everything else is out there so if
everybody's already making web HTML web
apps for their content stuff right why
not build a platform that's really good
at displaying that stuff and running
that stuff I mean I guess that makes
sense we were actually last night we
were talking about the TV issue the
situation that with the fact that like
everything is different every app is
different and I mean my impression is
that this might actually lead to some
more consistency at least on LG
television the it's supposed to they've
got they're gonna have an SDK and
they're they're going to release it and
they're they've got like UI guidelines
for how it's supposed to work and the UI
guidelines basically are don't ever
leave TV like they want it to be TD is
like the thing you're watching and that
when you go do something like hit the
home button or go to the menu on an app
or whatever that's pops up as an overlay
over what you're looking at so you don't
lose your place Netflix app that show is
not an overlay it's just like a full
screen it's a full screen thing well
yeah forget all that so that whole
design guideline things it's not so much
thrown out yeah I mean I think part of
the problem is i mean our individual
companies still developing these apps
are they being developed in-house it at
a younger than probably any more
confident i almost said HP by the yeah
well should we talk a little bit about
the webos story I mean I think everybody
knows everybody's not
that necessary but you know I yesterday
i said i was reading my palm pre review
yeah on that I did on n gauge which was
a 10,000 word review and well how long
was your did you do there I was close to
10,000 although I wasn't like so back
then whenever there was a phone in bar
go there was the real embargo and then
there was the embargo whenever everybody
actually went because in publication
would go O'Reilly because they were a
newspaper and they thought that was okay
let's just seems the walls of the Walt
Mossberg Wall Street Journal there I was
like in the in the in the older days
look man of large but blogs got know
when blogs got really no respect
whatsoever you would be given a review
embargo that wasn't real and then you'd
be scrambling and finishing it for like
the next morning and Walt review would
go up and people who think what's
happening why is this happening to death
we all realize they had very different
reviews by the way like I you don't
needed you needed to be experiential to
talk to a bunch of people and I needed
to be comprehensive to satisfy the
insatiable need for every last freaking
detail possible you don't think my
10,000 words covered every last detail I
had I have you spent more time I had a
viable a list of like every so every
single gesture worked and like the
thinking behind it I know I go through
all that are we competing now and I can
say it was better no it was better they
were different you know you know it's
funny so I've been qualitatively better
yes I mean but of course also very
different so in in in this this this
story behind the webos TV post you know
that there's a narrative arc because
webos launched here at CES and it was
five years ago and in my first draft saw
most of the day yeah well I first one I
had 40 results he was January wait it
was to the day it was a to the day was a
jinkies january six well my crazy some
eerie stuff people if you're a huge nerd
this is really super huge nerd right
generate 80 is the eighth yeah not that
he ever mind yep not so cool anyhow so
huge deal to yeah I remember they
launched they couldn't get on verizon
they had to go sprint they've launched
late which by the way LG just did a
sprint exclusive launch well result of
their going are going to be in t-mobile
and AT&amp;amp;T two of the g flex yeah but it's
pretty well established in my opinion
that if you launch with sprint goodbye
the product is dead yeah
you're screwed it's not happening I mean
it's the smallest is it smaller than
t-mobile no driver base close we get a
fact check of subscriber base the Ross
let me know Eddie how I'm going to get
in trouble don know a lot of webos on
the brain yeah palm launch webos in the
penis was like there this was the if
they don't do this they're there gob air
screw and they were already kind of late
and like rye you're waiting and waiting
and waiting and nobody expected what
they did nobody except i was amy was
incredible in my opinions it's still
first off one of the greatest first off
one of the greatest CES demos of all
time in my opinion yeah but in terms of
I mean really skillfully put together
and really thoughtfully done a real
moment for me love it for me like having
been a palm fanboy yeah and really
wanting to see them succeed seeing them
pull off what they pulled off at CS of
course it was all smoke and mirrors
because the product was not relevant at
all yeah there were six months away from
shipping yeah and what what they showed
to this day i think is still incredibly
advanced yeah the best part about that
was talking about this last night the
sinking was a huge deal they showed by
the way remember when syncing was a
thing and it really how am I gonna sink
this with itunes they showed how you can
sink the preacher you could take the pre
with how work is proposed to be talking
about web loss of televisions we're just
a dimas doubting about web and phones
but how you could sync with itunes was a
huge deal in that Apple killed it
basically but anyhow it was five years
ago almost of the day yeah they did that
at CES and since then web less has just
been on it's been nosedive it well I
mean yeah they had a little moment and
then it was they couldn't they couldn't
get support from carriers in the US they
needed it they kept on launching stuff
late the performance wasn't very good
they ran out of money basically and a
bunch of companies were like we're going
to buy and we're gonna buy them for IP
we're buying for this HP bought them and
then HP CEO got it caught the sex
scandal and they got a new CEO who
didn't believe them that's right and he
set the thing on fire the leo apotheker
better known as the apotheker ellipse
apothic ellipse but is that what its own
it's known as the epochal really like
people within both the webos division
palme division and within HP at large
had no idea was like I spread everybody
was that he was a businessman yeah he
didn't he didn't have the passion yeah
he was a passionless bastard and from
hell yeah is that cool to say that's
probably live I'm not gonna be sooo not
his people it sounds he have people he
got a golden parachute and got got out
yeah and now now the rest of the come
now Meg Whitman is trying to pick up the
pieces hey Whitman I love she's great
manifold lady so anyhow so he also gave
us it and then LG buys the rest of it
and this was februari last year LG
bought like a bunch of what level s this
like HP kept some it was weird but they
bought them and we are like well guys
why do you need webos to make smart TVs
and they had no answer for us then and
we have the answer now and the answer is
HTML apps run really well on it and to
and I think this is a more important
thing they managed to pick up some
really good designers yeah like the I I
think the design of this is probably my
favorite smart t interfit interface that
I've seen and that's not really saying
much but it's it's pretty good with with
one major exception what being be bird
what bean bird you love being birds I
kind of like bean burger we can you
explain being burned so bean bird is a
major mean burns red to shape like a bee
beam and it helps you get through there
in a process there he is like why why
why he's protesting that you didn't set
up your Wi-Fi right there he's like you
should really do not being birds pretty
cute yeah I know Ramon so I mean it's an
easy target though is the thing is
people are going to be making fun of it
but he's just there to help you set up
why didn't he call him like the webos
bird or something or like birdie because
he looks like a bean yeah but do they
act sure they actual refer to ms bean
burger yeah like there's like a Korean
word I just like being a list for lots
of things that you don't you don't want
to hug is the beam non hugging items are
social a little beans yeah all I'm
saying they're probably trying to solve
is nobody ever sets up their smart TVs
and then you're start trying to be sucks
we don't set it out right this is chris
so
not just Sobibor doesn't have wings or
arms yeah he's magical I feel like it's
a sad situation for him oh you think
that he's well I feel like it would be
better to have wings or are ya if your
first off of your bird right hard to fly
without wings yeah no arms hard to lock
in the earth well you got hard to log on
to your web OS TV right okay you uses a
new house of cards season two that's
right by the way the trailer for two
condition is available on the birds
right now you can check it out I mean
Hastings was on the state Reed Hastings
so this is where CEOs got on stage at
the LG event and was basically LG's
awesome everybody this is this is the
problem by the way you have to buy an LG
television yeah and like LG's not really
known for having the greatest television
yeah make fine televisions there remakes
ok television but when you think about
the best television you're like oh
that's panasonic or sony or pie in the
oven so the fundamental problem is like
when you go to buy a television are you
going to get the best television that
you think in terms of picture quality
for the money that you're going to spend
or do you want to get the webos
interface I'm thinking you want to get
the best picture quality for the money
because you know what I'll just go buy a
Roku all generated by an xbox go by away
like their interface is really awesome
but i just bought a Roku I don't replace
my tvs that often yeah the Roku does
what they're doing in the sense that
it's like a cohesive sort of a coat
actually I will say this I if they could
get the UI completely in sync like
completely going following guidelines
yeah I think that would be a really big
deal right do they have a do they have
an IR blaster solution so the the LG
motion remote can work as a universal
remote they're not trying to be super
comprehensive and cover everything but
they say that they're going to they'll
support the big stuff that you care
about so it'll support your DVD player
blu ray player your xbox you're right
you know cable box but so how did the
cable support is just after yeah i don't
i don't know i don't think it integrates
with a guy right but i don't know like
the full details is it you know we were
talking mainly about the design so it's
possible but with what what's
interesting is you know everything that
you want to watch is just like these
little cards these little like
uncle slashes of things right yeah and
so when you plug a new box into it like
if you plug an xbox one into it it'll
switch to it and then it'll add a card
and it'll label it xbox one because it
can detect at its next box one that's
right out and then instead of so instead
of like toggling through your input
button over and over and over again you
like just go down to your card for that
input I mean I will say that sounds kind
of great i mean but but one of the
things that i liked about speaking of
the xbox one and they don't have it
quite right because there's things that
you can't do but but it almost ingests
the cable input into the interface of
the xbox one well almost but I'm saying
they even if they offer that amount of
functionality with this yeah it would be
an improvement because it would take it
would again take a cohesive interface
right and make it make your cable box
part of that interface and it's still
like you're bouncing between those
things I mean it's less of a problem now
I think for most people yeah cable
interfaces have gotten slightly better
and i'll say this time warner just
refresh their interface is it okay i I
mean comparatively to the previous time
warner interface it's like a half it's
like we both did they a punch in the
face of 11 guys it's like the most
advanced you i ever compared to like the
last version of it but i do think you
know it's not for most consumers that's
not that big of a concern but i think
for most consumers they're not aware of
the options and how to access them on
their televisions you know right and I
don't know if having making a better
smart TV with a better interface
necessarily helps them get there well so
here's the thing with like what was
possible for them is when you're dealing
with TV and doing stuff there's a it's
not even it's not a glass ceiling it's
like a steel-reinforced concrete ceiling
of what's possible and microsoft hit it
and couldn't break through right you
know LG is not going to be 0 LG can't
get it where no ways I could do that you
cannot get cable to like give up their
stuff and then play others and there's
and there's a phantom belief that apple
will get there but but thus far they
haven't been a been sitting there upside
down strapped with a jackhammer for the
past five years we're still waiting to
strike well I mean I think that's why we
haven't seen any way I mean everybody
claims this year is gonna be the year of
the Apple to you know it I think that I
think that actually explains a lot about
why we haven't seen more
action there and more motion yeah so
let's try out some of the other some of
the other LG announcements which are why
don't you go through them so they had
the the life man touch which is LG's
fitness tracker yeah it's a water water
resistant whatever that's got an OLED
display it does smart phone
notifications exercise goals proprietary
LG tracking yeah i think so and then it
hooks up with like a little mp3 player
that the earphones will monitor your
heart rate like through the earphones
and it also like check your pulse and
checks blood flow apparently right so
that's kind of cool and weird but I mean
honestly it's it's like they built it
because they could it's another like
that's cool but I think my biggest
problem with these with these devices
particularly for an LG is its
proprietary it's there so you gotta buy
into their software their whole
ecosystem and who is buying into LG's
you know proprietary health ecosystem I
mean I did that doesn't sound like I
mean what we really need no I mean I
don't think most people are thinking
about I mean you and I care a lot about
proprietary health ecosystem and
eventually people will get to caring
about that but like you walk in the best
play like I want to fit this tracker
you're just going to get one until
watching the best prices i want to
fitness tracker really i don't think so
really first off i think i think i think
best buy in America you sure in America
nobody walks into best minds if I want
to fitness tracker they like him like
once a week s I want the biggest
television you have where as cheap as
possible and then the big bell upon the
way they leave with that and they were
they've been up sold a hundred and fifty
dollar hdmi monster atmi kale that's the
best buy experience I think for the vast
majority of Americans at least I'd only
people go in and they're like I need a
fitness tracker which one should I get
what I do think they do is they go and
they say I've heard about some people
going into I heard about this Fitbit
thing right or then FuelBand yeah you
know again to proprietary closed systems
where you can't get your data out right
you know it would just be nice if LG had
gone hey we want to partner with Fitbit
or with Nike or someone the Nike wants a
partner with LG but yeah it done
something where it's like this is going
to work with the rest of the stuff that
you do right no I just I feel like
there's made it cuz they could
like it does it does smart phone
notification so that's cool but like
it's like I don't know it's like it's a
samsung move like we can do we can build
this thing it's not that right it's not
going to kill us we might as well just
do it will sell a few and that right
that's called the that is the life band
life and chach tracker gotta put touch
or something in and I you have any lower
case I or touching it well I think it's
camel case so oh good no no it's not
it's life ban and capital t touch so
what else it's safe what else you know
from LG the flexor is coming to the u.s.
bigger tou the flats and we talked about
this already the plexus is coming
starting with sprint so great we
reviewed the Flex yes we needed we did
not a big fan of the flight I've used
the flesh first up it's gigantic it is
massive there are enormous phone and
then there are enormous phones that
remind you what like that they're
enormous all the time and this is her
letter the curve I don't get I mean the
curve to me seems like the most
superfluous gimmicky thing yeah it is
that it is not even I was it not even
remember when there were a couple phones
that had a 3d screen yeah or 3d camera
the curve is akin to that and LG's like
all over again mix they have the button
on the back oh they were as curved
screen at which has been to compete with
samsung's curved screen and what i used
it i could not see the I mean I heard
you know there was this argument like Oh
it'll reduce glare know so they does are
defending it or talking about it in the
keynote today and it improves sound
quality because the speakers off the
table it allows you to hear better whole
better and view better it improves grip
because you can like I don't know you
don't have to hold it back for whatever
that's what they're saying and yeah
sorry i was just watching that person
step on the phone oh right i mean we're
sure it's made to do that yeah i mean do
we know for a fact that the phone is
made to do that we've got the wolverine
plastic on the back so yeah I don't know
it's got a flexible battery is he
mistake but yeah let's coming to sprint
18t I don't know why you need a phone
it's like hey you know what if you had
not if you had made the phone flat you
wouldn't have to flex when somebody's
yeah
what are they saying it'll break it
won't break is that why it's curved
they're saying they're selling point was
from what I understood they're selling
point was it feels really great to hold
it deserves your face up to me a
sentence like it curves away because I
guess I'll phone but a phone yet hold on
to the curved part that was the reason
for the curve or this your face I mean
well your face might be perfectly flat
my face is perfectly flat it's like it's
like a two dimensional optica like a
sprung out of Maxim can you even see my
face right now no right on it right
doesn't see it now oh there you are
right nobody's just nothing weird yeah
okay just like flatly right oh you know
we should mention uh no actually two
things yeah one of them is like going
way back to the beginning late on me
whatever put a dumb throw down Vizio
said we're not making 3d can you bikinis
any more threes that we said last year
3ds day and now he is admitted it 3d is
dead yeah I mean consumers don't care
about 3d they don't want to watch 3d in
their homes if you showed them a TV that
had immaculate perfect three something
just happened behind us did they don't
get hit by it may have been will we hit
by something let me know what that was
when may have thrown a brick or maybe
someone through G flex at us it's
possible LG is retaliating thats related
avi about the g flex seriously what was
that we should find out we'll figure it
out if this could I last that I was like
I really want a backhoe to just come
driving through the 10 now you're going
to now the backhoe is actually going
it's going to be great in it so this
could be our last broadcast and you
wanted a great time with a great time
with you guys ok anyhow are we just
talking about oh just think that
companies are beginning to give up on 3d
oh yeah well sweetie I mean don't worry
is it always going to say if you gave if
you were like here's the TV it looks
beautiful perfect exactly normal but you
can switch it into 3d mode without
glasses and it'll show you 3d and it
will be perfect there's a you're tearing
or blurring or you know interlacing or
whatever maybe maybe maybe somebody
would use it
but like you have to give them that
experience yeah i mean what's the deal
with with some ticket sales for 3d
movies how they doing well they do
better but it's because there's like no
other option but i don't think they're
doing as well as they they were they
they're not a couple of years ago and
they also cost for so like figuring out
the numbers is really nice we do is
always a gimmick in my opinion I mean
you James Cameron will tell you that
it's a life-changing experience I've not
seen gravity in 3d and everybody says
gravity is the movie that 3d was made
for so I could be wrong I didn't get a
chance right see it you're very unhappy
I'm saying it's been ruined for the two
people hey I know spoiler alert Braun
dies now come on Rob Harry Potter
robbery from Harry Potter died because
he has no gravity he's like hey guys she
gets shot by an alien yeah that's what
would happen right Ron okay oh I think
we're nearly done allergies or anything
else talking about with LG no I think
that's fine it's really nothing else I
mean there we have no idea if they're
going to make a phone and if you make a
phone or tablet LG please go back and
use that Moshe you I that we wrote about

middle ground between flat and

beautiful very elegant I mean here's
