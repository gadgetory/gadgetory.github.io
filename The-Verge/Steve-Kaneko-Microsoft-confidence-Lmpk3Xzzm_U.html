years ago there were many places where
Microsoft was unchallenged or didn't
have the kind of challenges that we see
now but in today's market with illness
and every one of these bases I mean you
could look at entertainment you know
home entertained and you can look at
mobile devices laptop tablet David OS
any whether the productivity I mean
you've got real competition coming from
big challengers how I mean does that
worry you does it I mean does it how
does that inform what you guys are doing
or you just make you more reactive or
this is this is the part when I said
that the community feels more confident
this is the part I love and that I I
really believe we're start worse we're
not looking over our shoulders as much
as we used to and the the type of
planning that we are doing which
involves user experience and product
planning formal pilot project planning
and development etc is much more
long-term you've seen some of the
envisioning lab work and the office labs
and we have more teams that are actually
thinking one to two steps ahead and
we're doing a better job at creating
frameworks to actually connect the dots
with a a smarter idea who we are and who
we aren't this is back to I think Metro
in some ways we want to be as good as we
can be at Microsoft we no longer
comparing finding our sauce comparing
ourselves to other design organizations
around their companies and I like that
feel right certainly we're aware of
what's happening but everything that's
happened today in recently that you're
seeing and I think we're sensing coming
from this alignment is is done by RS
ourselves we did it because we did it
gets the right thing it turned out to be
something very authentic and unique to
Microsoft and there's more coming that
is more just about what we think we
should be doing and I think that
confidence is attracting better
designers better developers that are
better program managers because they
sense that we are no longer looking over
our shoulders go to chase tail lights
whatever it may be that that perception
of the company is is definitely not
holding true
eternally we're actually focused on what
we're doing and we have a roadmap and we
have confidence in that roadmap is smart
and we want to and are empowering
designers researchers to do their best
work with new environments the right
tools the right types of challenges the
right type of training so there is a
collective confidence that really makes
it feel like we no longer have to look
outside we're no longer nervous yeah and
I like that aspect yeah there's there's
a and it's not an arrogance I think it's
a confidence that we've been at this
long enough and it's time we just step
into that and really do what we're paid
to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
