is your lucky day we saw not one but two
new chromecast devices and I'm sitting
here with Mario kiddos he is a VP of
product management at Google and he is
the chromecast guru you've got in your
hand here at the new chromecast second
generation for streaming video that's
correct
it's also chromecast Audio tell us very
quickly with these what these do and why
people should want them one of the big
differences between the when we first
launched chromecast and today when we're
launching these these new products is
what's most important to consumers and
to users which is the entertainment that
they can access within you know a little
bit more than than two years we've had
thousands of new apps be published with
cast support and there's lots of new
apps coming everyday video sports music
games kids apps and so that's probably
the you know the thing that really
matters now what we're doing is we're
we're trying to make sure that your
experience for bringing that
entertainment to your TV across all
these different categories is really
really easy and simple and something
that you're familiar with you know
Google has had its ups and downs when it
comes to offering streaming video
through a Google interface on TV there
was Google TV now there's Android TV you
guys also make a nexus device for
streaming media you know through Google
the Google OS and there's chromecast so
I think maybe what a lot of people are
wondering is why both Android TV and
chromecast's and are we ever gonna see a
merger of the two I mean that's a that's
a really good question the good news is
that there is there are so many users
out there with so many different needs
that we we don't think that the the
solutions the platforms or the the
products are competing with each other
they're really complementary there are a
lot of people who are who enjoy watching
videos and listening to music and so
forth on their phones or tablets or
their laptops and they really just want
an easy way for you basically to extend
that experience to a big screen to any
big screen and this is perfect for for
chromecast a very inexpensive device
plug it into the back
and all of the content that you have on
your personal device you can either
easily bring it on to the TV Android TV
is about let's say that there's a TV
manufacturer or a operator that's
building a set-top box they want an
operating system that they want to make
sure that apps can run they have remote
controls and Android TV is a great
solution for that we think that there's
it's still early enough in terms of how
people are consuming over-the-top
content and there's really room for for
both products to be in the market and
help educate people of all the options
that are available so five years down
the road someone is in the market for
some type of Google powered media
consumption experience TV some type of
display what is it that they're getting
at that point is it an Android TV
set-top box is it is it that our
personal devices are actually powering
the whole experience and so it's
chromecast what do you see there so it's
so hard to predict fight five years from
now but I do think that one of the the
key ways that people are going to
continue to to consume you know to to
enjoy content is starting from their
smartphones for different reasons first
of all your it's the apps that you
already know the apps that you're logged
into they know your preferences so it's
really easy for you to go up to a TV and
say great I'm gonna put Pandora on the
TV you don't have to log into to the TV
or your YouTube goes to TV so I do think
that with the smartphone being more and
more at the center of how people live
their lives and manage their lives I
think it'll be very natural just to
extend that that experience to to the TV
and but I you know it's it's it's hard
to say what's what's going to happen to
the TV screen itself and you know we'll
listen to consumers and what
manufacturers are doing in terms of the
operating system that we're will
continue to build into to news let's
talk about chromecast Montillo so I have
to be honest when I first heard about
chromecast Audio I thought oh
interesting a $35 solution for turning
my non Wi-Fi connected speaker at home
into something that's Wi-Fi connected
but currently doesn't support multi-room
audio and then you have to plug
chromecast Audio into each and every
speaker that you want to do this to so
then I thought well
I know I guess I'm trying to understand
the value of this solution tell me a
little bit about it how does it work
it's a great question first of all we're
really trying to bring the best audio
experience that we can the best quality
because you want to listen to your music
and you want it sent to sound really
good and that happens you know it
happens to be much better to stream from
the cloud through Wi-Fi to the device
directly that's a bit better quality
than for example through Bluetooth
because most people when they're sending
music from their phone to a speaker
today I believe it's over Bluetooth at
we think that a Wi-Fi based solution is
is better in in lots of different ways
it's you know the parrying is very
simple somebody can just walk up and
cast something to to the speaker
compared compared with today's today's
solution and and so that's one aspect
now let's say if you believe that okay
great
Wi-Fi speakers are great for all those
reasons then you go out to buy a Wi-Fi
speaker if you're buying a new a new
speaker you might as well get one that
has Wi-Fi right if you're not in the
market for a new speaker then instead of
going out and paying three hundred four
hundred five hundred dollars for one for
$35 again as we said earlier today less
than the price of a lot of head you know
headsets you plug this into your speaker
and you have a Wi-Fi connected speaker
we are bringing multi zone
synchronization out in within the next
couple of months okay that allows for
you to go in and sing great I'm gonna
pay I'm gonna put these speakers into
one zone and then use some music to
those speakers you walk from one room to
the to the other and you can change the
music education which is something that
you can do but like Sonos for example
now which I guess makes me think do you
see this as a type of Sonos competitor
or something that is offering people
that type of solution you know I think
we're I think we're actually trying to
solve a similar problem but since you
know as we said fewer than 5% of people
it cut households in the u.s. have have
speakers that can connect to Wi-Fi so
it's such a young market that I actually
think it's good to have different
solutions coming to the market because
we we want to educate people that it's
really easy to do this and so I don't
really see it as competition this
early on I see it really as you know
we're coming in we're helping to educate
consumers that they can do this a lot of
the consumers already know how to cast
and so for us it's really simple to say
hey the apps are already available
they're already cast enabled you just
cast your speaker now in addition to
casting to to your TV so I think that
competition is good when you're trying
to bring in a solution to market like
that so some people might look at these
two different devices and say they seem
a little redundant why didn't you just
put a jack into the chromecast for video
and make that chromecast audio as well
yeah well it's a it's an interesting
question and we actually had that that
conversation the same device is not
being used for both purposes right so
when you're plugging into your TV you're
you're not going to be using the same
device to power a speaker that's in a in
a different room we really wanted to
optimize each product for the purpose
that they're made for and so far from
you know all the people that have been
testing the product they they they like
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
