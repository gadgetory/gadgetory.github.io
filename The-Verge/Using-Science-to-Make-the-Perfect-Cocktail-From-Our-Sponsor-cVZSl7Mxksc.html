come up with new not just drink
combinations but new techniques that's
what gets me interested my mom even
though she was a doctor and works like
an incredible amount like always found
the time to kind of throw the occasional
fancy dinner party and you know I would
dress up like a page and run around and
she would cook you know traditional
stuff the fact that even though she was
really busy a she took the time to kind
of do this kind of instilled in me this
kind of desire to be in the kitchen when
I was growing up there wasn't the this
kind of saturation of kind of higher-end
interesting foods my mom always took the
time to expose me to this stuff so you
know I was the kid who loved escargot I
was the kid who loved smoked eel
everyone kind of would praise my food
knowledge when I was a kid when I was a
senior in in college I was a philosophy
major and I took an art class and I
loved it I tried to do you know work as
a working artist but a lot of my project
started getting extremely complicated
and I would work for years on them and
do a lot of research and not finish them
I found that being part of the art world
was less and less kind of what I really
maybe wanted to do and was trying to go
into the food world I was looking for a
way to do that a bunch of things happen
simultaneously I met Wylie Dufresne it
started you know hanging out with him he
was the kind of want to show me that my
interest in technology and my interest
in food could interact in a way to
create new kinds of foods do new things
he kind of introduced me to that world
there was a lot of people working on
using new techniques in the food world
and not as many people who are focusing
specifically on the problems of
and cocktails even though it's all
flavors they have a very different set
of problems from cooking and the
knowledge doesn't apply a hundred
percent straight away and so I felt if
there's a wide open field go there
so I have a bar called buffer index the
mission is to use new techniques that
new technologies and to focus very very
critically on how we make drinks we use
the centrifuge we'll use new infusion
techniques we'll you know milk wash
liquid nitrogen model we'll do all these
things but in the end the drink is very
simple my hope is that the stuff that I
work on helps other cooks and other
bartenders teach them how to use
something that they haven't used before
and that as a result they feel more
fulfilled people tend to say you know
you haven't really followed kind of a
linear path started out life you know
working in science cooking with science
you know family background go to
philosophy go to drinks they're all
threaded together you know they all
involve connecting your hand to your
brain I always say that our goal is to
change the way we make drinks not to
change the way you drink I'm Dave Arnold
and this is my story
