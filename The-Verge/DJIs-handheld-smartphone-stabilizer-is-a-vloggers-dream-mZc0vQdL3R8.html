hanging out in China with the new DJI
Osmo mobile so this is the newest
version of DG eyes handheld stabilizer
and as you can see what makes it
interesting is it's not using DG eyes
proprietary drone camera it's using
whatever smartphone you have so you know
did GI it made the Osmo it cost about
five or six hundred bucks and the only
camera used was the one that you get on
the DJI phantom 4 drone now obviously a
lot of vloggers picked up the Osmo and
found it to be a really useful tool but
what they're hoping to do is livestream
to Facebook and snapchat on YouTube so
now they can use their own phone they
can use their own apps but still have
the Osmo stabilization technology with
the Osmo mobile you connect using
bluetooth which means your Wi-Fi is free
that's really important if you're a live
streamer looking to get something up on
Facebook or YouTube so another important
change with the Osmo mobile is that the
jack that used to be for an external
microphone is now accessible for
powering up the Osmo that's really great
if you're out shooting in the field is
much easier to plug into a mobile power
source and shoot all day so this one
will cost a lot less since it comes with
no camera about 200 bucks but it does
have another really interesting and
powerful feature it has the computer
vision and autonomous tracking that's
built into the DJI phantom 4 drone so I
can draw a box around a subject say a
race car or around my own face and then
the camera will do the job of tracking
for me I can walk around I can look at
something else and we'll make sure to
always keep me in frame okay so this is
me vlogging Shenzhen using the new DJI
Osmo mobile what's really incredible
about this is that I can turn on face
tracking and it's now got me identified
and so I can stop looking at the camera
I can just wander around and talk about
Shenzhen and look in the air even though
I'm not paying any attention to the
camera I can move it from my right hand
to my left it's always going to keep me
in frame because it knows exactly what
my face looks like and it's locked on to
that as a subject so the DJI Osmo mobile
is meant to work with any standard
smartphone I have my iPhone 6 in here
but this little back part here can open
and unscrew and you can go all the way
up to the largest Samsung phones and
obviously this being a tool that they
want you to use with your own phone and
apps like snapchat it does have portrait
mode so this has been been Popper with
the Burj here in Shenzhen China checking
out the DJI Osmo mobile it's a new
handheld stabilizer that works with any
phone should be around $200 and come out
in the next month and on top of making
it possible to use your phone with the
Osmo it now adds some advanced computer
vision and automatic tracking which is
pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
