we have a look at a Windows Phone tango
on the Lumia at 610 okay so the main
improvements in Windows Phone tango can
be found in the messaging application so
previously on mango you better send an
mms with pictures but no video so now
when we will create a new message and we
try to attach we get a picture or video
option or even a voice note now so you
can go into voice note and you can
record sewing and obviously send that
line and it looks like it's limited to a
minute at the moment so
it will just add that into the message
then you can go in and add say a picture
if you keep adding multiple images in
here so you can also add in video now
one thing you'll notice is if you've got
a large video it will tell you that the
file is too big to send us a message it
doesn't really offer you any any option
to actually trim that down our enemy
just quite unusual so hopefully they'll
change that by the time of ships
if we try and add in a smaller one I
don't think it's working on this build
but what you would get yeah what you
normally get is you get a little video
icon similar to the note
okay and obviously tango is primarily
for 256 memory support another change in
tango is if you're going to being
searched you'll notice there's only
three icons along the bottom there
compared to the man got that with the
usual local Scout option there
Microsoft's actually moved that from
tango along with background agents so
that functionality won't be there one
final change here is we've got on the
manga phone on the right here we've got
automatically uploads to SkyDrive and
that sayings actually been removed for
tango but you still can upload the
images manually okay that was a quick
look at Windows Phone tango on the Lumia
610</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
