has become largely preferential to voice
the Verge's staff is scattered around
the globe and as such we spend a
majority of our days social and
otherwise in chat rooms and mail clients
but text only says so much it never
really conveys the right emotion with a
me at all you can always use a smiley
face but well that isn't always clear
either so for majority of communication
we use gifts lots of gifts
no wonder I went yeah I want to add that
but then I was I was riffing I didn't
know where to go for that all right I
think I know how to do it okay think of
it as an artisanal emoticon lighter than
a video heavier than a still perhaps
deeper than both an unchanged container
capturing human history or you know cat
history making a gift doesn't have to be
that difficult all in fact for the most
basic things we just use a still image
in a web app let Oscar favorite ones
include blingy which has a lot of extra
gaudiness and flare the other one we
like is deal with it which will so we're
gonna make a blingy all right so let's
go ahead and find the right picture all
right now we've got Thomas Easton let's
go ahead and start adding a couple
dancing Santas over here there's
Christmas let's add some snow yeah now
that is the winner I like what he needs
a hat Oh cats cats always work alright
and now we're set
stills are nice but video is really
clutch for us it all starts with the
video thankfully there's a lot of
quality apps that are the most
everything you want to do for OS 10
we've been having fun with gif brewery
it's simple its intuitive and about five
dollars in the App Store it's relatively
cheap for this example we're gonna use
the Verge's own David Pierce the next
step is arguably the most important find
your moment we look for moments that are
useful in everyday chat we typically
like to find anything that can convey
happiness frustration disappointment or
you know morale is low just a good laugh
framerate is the other key factor here
and if your app lets you change it we'd
recommend starting at 12 frames per
second and going from there the trick to
the perfect loop is isolation as a
little bit of a moment in time as
possible to really ensure constant or
these fake continuity now we have much
fewer frames and we've got a full fluid
David dance because the limitations the
medium captain's really do play a huge
part in maximizing the message obviously
there's no audio with a gift so let's
focus on a subtitle now for some apps
you can definitely do a frame-by-frame
text but unfortunately for gif brewery
it's really all or nothing so let's go
ahead and just make a party down David
alright and with that okay hopefully
your work of art is ready to be birthed
it's time to export and compress in file
size is very important here as a hard
and fast rule we generally shoot for
gifts that are under one Meg typically
half that but tumblers file size limit
is one Meg we think it's a good metric
let's go ahead and really quickly let's
throw that on some kind of sharing site
so that's the basics it really should
cover most of what you're gonna want to
do both The Verge video team and dev
team swear by using professional
software like Adobe Photoshop Premiere
After Effects Apple's motion and it
really makes sense we can think about
because these are professional software
tools they were used to make high
quality video and high quality stills
and the gift just falls somewhere in
between those two hey buddy hey I'm just
making this advanced animated gif here
so I'm gonna start this project in After
Effects although I guess you could do
this in Premiere or Final Cut Pro or any
other video software but I'm gonna go
with After Effects today because we're
gonna use a couple of the unique
features of that program so I've already
imported my video clip it's David here
looking confused angry sad this range of
emotions in this clip I think I'm gonna
drag this onto a new competent than
After Effects and trim it down a little
bit so I think it would be great to
punctuate that moment a zooming in on
him and the reason I'm doing this in
After Effects is because I'd like to
apply some dramatic
motion blur so that's looking pretty
good but I want to punctuate this a
little bit more so of course the font to
use is impact David grows David displays
hamburger and cuts off their so now I'm
gonna export this but the trick here is
to pick a frame rate that's pretty low
this thing started at 24 frames a second
but I'm gonna lower it down to 12 or 15
frames a second because as I see in the
next step keeping a gift small and file
size is key to making a successful gift
so now that we're in Photoshop I'm using
cs6 so it'll handle video pretty well we
can scrub through it and check that
everything looks okay the real trick
here is using safer web this is huge so
I'll have to resize this down to maybe
500 pixels wide another very important
part of gift making is making sure that
it loops forever
not once now just to double check my
work when I throw that file into Chrome
well it's looking pretty good to me now
for the final step
see what David thinks so looks to me
like that was a successful gift all
right I know it sounds ridiculous but in
this modern age we really do think of
gifts as a necessary tool for
communication for really conveying the
right emotion and getting your message
across you know at the right time a gift
can be more of a personal statement and
less of a random joke you know just be a
random drug</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
