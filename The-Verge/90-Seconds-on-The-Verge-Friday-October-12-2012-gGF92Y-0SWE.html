David Pierce and according to sources
familiar with the matter speaking on
condition of anonymity due to their
relation to the production this is 90
seconds on the verge All Things D
reports that apple will hold an event on
october 23rd to announce the
much-rumored ipad mini recent whispers
seemed to be an agreement that the new
tablet will have a 7.8 5-inch screen
apple's new lightning connector and an
ultra-thin design all things these
sources decline to say where the event
will be held but applets historically
chosen either the yerba buena center in
san francisco or its own headquarters in
Cupertino speaking of rumors the yet to
be announced LG Nexus already has its
first review according to Belarusian
blog onliner the 4.7 inch prototype is
fairly reminiscent of the Samsung Galaxy
Nexus some things to note though there's
just eight gigabytes of internal storage
with no options to expand and a
non-removable battery the phone has a
new version of Android jelly bean but
it's rather buggy Oh surprise of course
since technically this device doesn't
exist yet bear in mind it's still not
confirmed whether this is even the next
Nexus device at any rate rumors suggest
an October 29th announcement followed by
a mid-november release and now for the
rumour trifecta the HTC windows phone 8x
will be available on t-mobile starting
November 14th that's according to leaked
roadmap obtained by TmoNews Nokia's own
flagship the Lumia 920 has been rumored
to launch November second we expect firm
release dates for these phones and more
at Microsoft's Windows Phone 8 event on
October 29 yeah that's the same day as
the rumour google event not a
coincidence and that's it for today's
top stories tune in tomorrow for less
whispers more facts and all David all
the time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
