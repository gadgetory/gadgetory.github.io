security bug amazing what some people
can do in 140 characters I'm adrianne
jeffries and this is 90 seconds on the
verge today a newly discovered
vulnerability in some versions of
tweetdeck allowed attackers to remotely
execute JavaScript code it seems to have
started innocuously enough with users
seeing random pop-up windows reading yo
or please close tweetdeck but some
coders soon realize how to trigger the
retweet command causing more tweet tech
users to spread the code further many
popular accounts were hit including the
New York Times Central Park and the BBC
soon after the news broke tweetdeck took
the service down as it assess the
security issue surface returned an hour
later after tweetdeck said it had
verified the security fix ok so what
exactly is going on here in short the
issue has to do with cross-site
scripting or XSS let's say someone
writes a bit of JavaScript code into a
tweet a Twitter client is supposed to
convert that into harmless plain text
but something went amiss and tweetdeck
was instead executing the code as
written all it had to do was show up in
your tweet decks timeline one of the
earliest examples we found was from a 19
year old Austrian teen named Florian
from around eight this morning he soon
reported it publicly to tweet deck which
potentially alerted anyone who monitor
the accounts mentions the small silver
lining here is that the javascript is
limited to what tweet tech itself is
allowed to do so while Twitter might be
a mess your local files and gmail
account should be ok for more on Twitter
and the web at large check out the verge
coming up tomorrow we must seek answers
for what comes after the 90th second
wait what
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
