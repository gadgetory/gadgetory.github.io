verge and we're looking at lenovo
thinkpad yoga now this is a 12.5 inch
display on this particular model and
obviously Lenovo's had yoga's in the
past but this is the first one with the
pink background and it's got kind of
unique twist to it so like all the other
yoga's you can obviously flip it over
but if you watch very closely at the
keyboard here just notice that it rises
up the frame around it so basically the
effect is that you get a flat back and
at the keys you can't actually type on
them so although they had software to
protect from that in the passage move
out g and putting some hard hard right
now so you really can't get the keys and
that's probably the coolest thing about
this and apart from that I'm it's a
Haswell processor it also has a stylus
seems simply going Internet Explorer
right your webpages up
and I'll see apps like fresh paint and
OneNote will support the stylist as well
so shipping around October so most
likely October 18 for Windows 8.1 and
that was a quick look at the Lenovo
ThinkPad yoga okay so now we're looking
at the yoga pro 2 and this is the
13-inch model and very similar to last
year's but the big difference you might
not notice it straight away is that this
screen is 3,200 by 1,800 so it's crazy
high res and they see it doesn't look
like Lenovo's done much to the DPI
settings for windows 8 one on a desktop
here but it's not wearing the final
version so it's quite hard to tell but
I'm sort of the easy quick benefits you
get you can snap to alongside there and
you can snap preferred in the middle
there so a lot of the current crop of
Windows 8 laptops even if you upgrade
into 81 you're not going to get that
sort of functionality and obviously it's
running on the Haswell chip so you can
get some battery improvements there and
Lenovo is saying probably ran about 8 to
9 hours and obviously it's a yoga so
it's going to go all the way around into
the tablet mode and she feels a little
bit more slender than last year's model
and obviously you can still feel the
keys at the back so unlike the the
thinkpad version of the yoga they don't
have the special key effects okay and
that was a quick look at the yoga pro 2
from lenovo
