2014 and I'm joined by eric migicovsky
CEO of pebble and you're here with your
brand new pebble steel your second
SmartWatch yeah we were here last year
with our first watch and now we're here
with pebble steel pebble steals an
upgrade to the pebble it adds a lot of
premium materials to the construction
we're using stainless steel we're using
corning gorilla glass but other its core
it's still a pebble it talks to your
iPhone or your Android phone and it
brings you know the same notifications
and apps and other features that you've
come to expect from your from your
pebble it's now just in a little bit
more of an elegant or more stylish
stylish watch case yeah and what drove
the decision to move to co is the main
construction component we actually
borrowed a lot of the techniques and a
lot of components from the classic watch
making industry we even went overseas to
find a factory that had experienced
building sort of higher-end classic
watches so we used stainless steel 316
which is a pretty a pretty high-class
high quality material we also CNC mill
every single pebble that comes off the
line we make sure that all the seals are
tight and all the dimensions are perfect
partly because we've maintained the
exact same waterproofing rating for the
first pebble couple steals waterproof 25
atmospheres and one of the idea of
keeping it waterproof kind of goes with
our philosophy of making sure that
pebble will mesh perfectly into your
everyday life we've maintained all the
other features like a five to seven day
long battery life we've even made it a
bit smaller and more compact reducing
the border area around the display
really because we wanted to make a watch
that can get on to more people's wrists
around the world and then once it's on
the wrist then we can provide that smart
functionality like the notifications and
the apps and stuff like that so one of
the reactions was from our editor in
chief judge Topolsky who only saw
pictures of the new pebble and he said
that it was first mile watch they were
considered buying and owning and
actually feeling proud of so was that
part of you drive behind the design to
get those people who wouldn't consider
Bionic SmartWatch to go for the pebble
steel definitely I mean that was some of
the feedback that we got right at the
beginning of pebble people love the idea
of
when they started putting on their
wrists when they did accessible when
they did activities like swimming or
biking or hiking we got people who said
you know I love it but I'm just not
going to be able to put it on when I go
it for dinner or when I go to the office
so with pebble steel we're hoping to be
able to provide the same smart
functionality but in it for people to
people who just want to wear a more
stylish watch or a different different
design on their wrist you have OS 2.0
which are going to be releasing at the
end of this month january 2014 that's
around the time when you properly launch
your app store and it's around the time
that the public still will be arriving
yeah it's kind of our forward push for
2014 I think that in 2014 pebble will
represent more than just the hardware i
think the the actual functionality will
be driven by the apps that people create
around the platform and up until this
point it's been it's been a bit of a
creative process to find apps for pebble
we didn't have a centralized app
repository so there's been a lot of
community sponsored projects like my
pebble faces and the pebble forums that
have popped up to kind of fill the void
there's people that are sharing apps on
on facebook on reddit all over the
internet with the pebble appstore
developers now have a consolidated
single point of contact where they can
upload their apps and get their app
distributed to over 300,000 people
around the world but since you started
shipping the original pebble they having
plenty of other smartwatches showing up
on the market Samsung suddenly they've
come up with new iterations why do you
think that is where does this popularity
come from well I think other
smartwatches in the market it's not it's
not necessarily a new thing even before
we launched pebble their work there was
I think what are the two versions of the
Sony SmartWatch there was this moto
active so there's always been a lot of
sort of movement in this market I think
what's interesting to me is just the
just the fact that most of the other
people who are making products are
taking a very different stance towards
what the product is meant to do in your
everyday life then pedal for us we're
all about meshing with your everyday
life so it's about making a product that
doesn't force you to conform to the
product it conforms to your own life and
offers more of a companion to
smart phone rather than a replacement
and I think that's kind of our guiding
principle right now both when we design
pebble and pebble steel as well as the
software that we make that will be
something that we continue forward with
were bought into that idea we believe
that the best product on your wrist is
one that works best for the
circumstances that it's built for and
the expanded functionality can be left
on your phone so that's kind of our
guiding principle and I think over time
you'll see more and more more and more
smart watches and wearables that that
kind of I guess try to try to try to
cram a lot of gear onto your wrist but
at the end of the day that's just not
exactly what we're trying to do that's
beautiful that's it that's exactly the
weather I feel and it's the thing that
attracted me to the original bubble yeah
it's and we're seeing that for our users
as well and on top of that that informs
our app and software decisions figuring
out which components of the app we want
to include on the watch it's kind of
governed by that same principle like you
don't want to have to write an email or
answer an email or anything on your
wrist you might want to do a quick quick
response or it can reply but you know
there's quite a division of labor
between what's sitting in your pocket or
in your bag and what's on your body so
outside of the iphone and android
devices what about Windows Phone and
other mobile platforms we've been
looking at them I mean we have some avid
users within the Office of these other
platforms as well for us it's kind of
its kind of priorities thing we have two
major platforms to tackle already and
providing excellent functionality to
both iOS and Android users is still our
prime our prime goal we're exploring it
there's actually a lot of people who
have started developing third-party
pebble apps or both windows phone as
well as blackberry 10 we've tried them
all and they're pretty awesome we're
supporting people where we can helping
publish more parts of our API I think
that as a company will probably continue
focusing on iOS and Android but I think
we're going to try to do our part to the
community and make more and more pieces
of the pebble API open source so that
people can interact with couple when
they need to and just to speak about the
future there are key queries that we
have our Korean intern was interested
about other languages you support for
other languages whether you might be
considering that yeah it's it's
that we get on a daily basis it's also a
problem that we've been thinking about a
lot how do you how do you build expanded
language functionality into such a small
and portable device like pebble it's a
problem that we're actively working on
we don't have an ETA or anything like
that that we can announce but it's
actively one of our top top requested
features right now offering expanded
language support an affinia goes hand in
hand with that is expanded markets when
we'll get some of this in Europe has the
thing that I'm really wondering about
well we've been shipping pebble
worldwide from our website and it's kind
of interesting we've actually gotten a
massive amount of orders on our website
from outside of the US I think we're
close to around 50 50 right now orders
that are coming from inside the u.s. to
around the world I think it it it's cool
like were we're pushing pushing forward
on international compatibility but I
think that even today it's quite an
accessible product that people can pick
up in fact with pebble steel we're
offering free worldwide career so anyone
who in the world can buy a pebble for
249 dollars with free shipping from
January 28 well they can promote it now
exactly and then get it on january 28
all right thank you very much we timer
ex-wife appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
