Nokia Lumia 800 coming only a few weeks
of the releases Nokia n9 this is
actually the finished company's new
smartphone flagship the difference
between it and the n9 in spite of the
really obvious physical similarities is
that the Lumia 800 runs Windows Phone
Microsoft's new operating system it runs
version 7.5 codenamed mango and its
internal specifications are pretty much
par for the Windows Phone course that
means 1.4 Kieffer's Qualcomm processor a
3.7 inch display with 800 by 480
resolution and 16 gigabytes of on-board
storage without the ability to expand
fire microSD card the main way in which
naka differentiates itself from the rest
of Marx's hardware partners is actually
in the physical design of this phone yes
it is very much like the N nines but in
terms of anything else in the Windows
Phone ecosystem this is a unique design
the unibody or as Nokia calls it model
body polycarbonate design is something
that we really loved about the n9 and is
still very much true here with the Lumia
800 it is brilliantly well put together
fit and finish are fantastic and all the
lines just flow into one another it is
seamless and it is beautiful in terms of
the extra software however this is very
standard stuff there is almost nothing
to tell you that this is a Nokia device
rather than any one of those already
produced from the likes of HTC and
Samsung for Windows Phone there are no
key customizations they're just not of
the relevant kind what you get in terms
of exclusive content of things like
ringtones notifications alerts a few
extra wallpapers but the actual Windows
Phone interface remains entirely
unskilled and unmodified there is no
expansion in terms of capabilities in
fact Nokia doesn't give you the full
windows for an experience at least in
terms of mango because internet sharing
is disabled on the lumia 800 and you
also that I have a front-facing camera
so in terms of that knock it actually
falls behind where it tries to catch up
is with a pair of exclusive applications
first up is Nokia Drive which gives you
offline navigation and voice
turn-by-turn instructions and second is
Nokia music which includes
mix radio which offers free streaming
preset playlists
you also need to be online in order to
use it some of the people upgrading from
Nokia Symbian family phones might
appreciate is the Bluetooth contacts
transfer application this does pretty
much what it suggests it is allows you
to transfer your contacts from your
phone to the 804 I blue tooth the Blum
800 also comes with an 8 megapixel
camera on the back it has carl zeiss
lens with an f 2.2 aperture and can
record 720p video performance in both
Stills and video was very quick and
snappy pretty much standard for Windows
Phone to be honest however there were a
few issues with the actual result some
photos took on an artificial green hue
after they've taken it seems to be a
post-processing issue and motion blur
seems to be a problem when shooting non
static images that being said when it
gets its colors right the blue
Manhunters camera can produce some
really excellent results it collects an
awful lot of detail and if you switch to
macro mode it takes some really great
close-up shots as well comparing to
Lumia 800 to the rest of the smartphone
field at the moment is really going to
be dependent of what you think of
Windows Phone if like Stephen Elop you
like the platform and you believe it's
ecosystem has a great future ahead of it
the Lumia 800 is pretty much an obvious
choice simply on account of its great
physical design and awesome AMOLED
display the Lumia 800 takes the lead
amongst Windows Phones
way it ranks once you factor in iOS and
Android devices it's going to be down to
the way that you use a smart phone the
alternatives are relatively obvious
there's the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s for
all the functionality of iOS 5 and on
the Android side you can pick up the
incredible West from HTC which is a
4-inch screen and the same 800 by 480
resolution as Lumia 800</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
