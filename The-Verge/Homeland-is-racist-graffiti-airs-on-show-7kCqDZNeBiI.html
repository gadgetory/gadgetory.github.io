paying close attention to the most
recent episode of homeland you may have
caught a subversive protest written on a
wall in a scene where Carrie Mathison
played by Claire Danes walks through
refugee camp in Lebanon the words
homeland is racist can be seen written
in graffiti on a wall there were other
messages too there is no homeland and
homeland is not a show the graffiti was
planted by a group of three artists who
were hired over the summer to design
sets for the popular Showtime series
Showtime was looking for artists to tag
the sets in Arabic script in order to
lend a sense of authenticity they
suggested some generic examples and
urged the artist to keep in a political
but they apparently didn't follow up the
artists hub Amin kerim cap and stone
seized the opportunity to protest
against homeland which they say
perpetuates misleading stereotypes about
the Arab world over the course of its
run the show has come under criticism
from many who say it presents an
inaccurate and biased view of the
cultures and places it addresses even
some governments like Lebanon and
Pakistan have publicly taken issue with
it the artist went public with their
stunts on Wednesday a few days after the
episode aired in the u.s. in a statement
they called homeland the most bigoted
show on television
it's not yet clear whether Showtime will
try to digitally erase the graffiti for
future rebroadcasts in a statement
issued this week showrunner Alex Gansa
expressed regret for not catching the
stunt before I went to air though he
also complimented the artists for their
ingenuity as homeland always strives to
be subversive in its own right and a
stimulus for conversation he said we
can't help but admire this act of
artistic sabotage</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
