iPhone might not have a headphone jack I
said in case you haven't heard the next
iPhone might not have a headphone jack
sorry I was listening to sweet tunes on
my son hyzers over here did you just say
that the next iPhone might not have a
3.5 millimeter headphone jack yes what
kind of rock have you been living under
oh my god
well anyway if that happens there are
likely going to be two ways that you can
listen to music on your iPhone there
might be some sort of new standard that
Apple comes up with or maybe you'll
listen through your lightning port or
you can use Bluetooth headphones which I
already use bluetooth headphones oh no
hurting my ears
sorry here are the main differences
between Bluetooth headphones and wired
regular headphones the main thing to
know about Bluetooth headphones is that
they pair wirelessly magically if you
will with all of your gadgets so main
thing to know about Bluetooth headphones
is that they generally suck that's not
true well from a quality perspective
it's taken bluetooth headphones a while
to reach adequate levels of sound
quality and even now you're still going
to get better sound from a pair of Wired
headphones like these I mean you don't
see professional audio engineers using
bluetooth headphones like that do you
yeah but wires I don't have to deal with
wires though still have a wire the wire
just goes from the earbud to the earbud
instead of from the headphones to the
phone look let me tell you all the
things that are annoying about those
bluetooth headphones for one you have to
charge them I mean who wants to wear a
pair of headphones that you have to
charge all the time but battery life has
gotten pretty good with Bluetooth
headphones
I mean some pairs even get up to 12
hours who do you know that listens to
music for 12 hours straight but then you
still have to pair them so when you get
that unexpected phone call or you're
running late to a conference call and
you need to hop on quickly meaning
have to actually take the time to pair
your phone with your headphones you
can't just go like this just once one
second I'm just carrying these okay yeah
but once I'm paired I mean I'm
completely untethered I can throw my
phone in my purse or my pocket and just
walk around you know hands-free
untethered okay I could see the value
and being untethered but I still don't
think the trade-offs are worth it you
know what else Bluetooth headphones are
awesome for working out you can still
use these to work out or these you just
have to keep your music on your phone
attached yeah that looks cool anyway
seriously Bluetooth headphones are great
for exercising you can just tuck your
phone in your pocket or your gym bag and
then you can remotely control your music
if your Bluetooth headphones have a
little remote like this these have a
remote too so do these but these
headphones don't get tangled I mean
honestly
how many hours of your life have you
spent untangling headphones before you
don't have to worry about that with
Bluetooth headphones
these aren't these they don't tangle all
that much and they like just well these
these don't because they're bigger and
better right
listen wireless headphones are the
future in fact some companies aren't
just making wireless headphones they're
making completely Wire free ear buds you
stick into your ears and control from in
there so this is the way the industry is
moving you might not like Bluetooth
headphones but you have to admit they
have their benefits and someday soon the
3.5 millimeter Jack may be a thing of
the past you can stick with your
Bluetooth headphones I love my wired
headphones the sound quality is better I
don't need to charge them and if I need
to use them quickly I can just stick
them in somewhere I don't need to take
the time to pair them it's that simple
do I need a new audio standard or an
adapter in order to have this experience
and not really sometimes I think that
new technology is a solution in search
of a problem sorry what was that
they said sometimes I think new
technologies are solution in search of a
problem
