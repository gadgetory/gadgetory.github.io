at the lincoln booth at the detroit auto
show with the new lincoln continental
that was just revealed its Lincoln's new
flagship car that appears to be aimed
directly at China they focused a lot on
the interior especially the back seats
having a chauffeur is very popular in
that part of the world and so the
ability to sit in the back be very
comfortable and have a presence as the
car moves around is really important it
was interesting during the press
conference they didn't focus very much
on the exterior of the car almost
everything was about the interior and
they also left out the powertrain
throwing in one line about how it has a
twin turbo engine but this is all about
the experience they had a live jazz band
on stage to reinforce that the car is
full of technology it has soft closing
doors massaging seats electric door
handles which are pretty neat but for
everything they told us during the press
conference they haven't really told me
why I should buy it over the Mercedes
e-class or Cadillac or an audi or BMW
there's a lot of competition in this
segment and Ford is going to have a
tough time making a name for themselves
but Lincoln's a historic brand the
Continental is a storied name we'll see
if they can do it for more on the
Lincoln Continental visit the verge calm
