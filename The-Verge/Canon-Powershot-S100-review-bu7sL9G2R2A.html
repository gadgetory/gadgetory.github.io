I'm here with the canon powershot s100
that's the upgrade to the s 90 and the s
95 two pocket cameras that have been out
for a couple of years now but are still
some of the best point-and-shoot cameras
you can buy it's about the same as the S
90 and the S 95 has a little bit better
finish and remove some buttons and moved
others around but pretty much it's the
same it did add a nice little grip bar
on the front which makes it easier to
hold the camera it's also got a wider
lens that goes out to 24 millimeters
instead of 28 which makes it easier to
get a lot in the photo and it's got a
longer zoom it goes from the s 95 s 3.8
X to a 5x zoom so you can get wider and
closer I'd also has a GPS which is cool
you can geotag your photos and then in
an app like iPhoto or Picasa actually
see a map of where you were when you
shot all of your photos and there's a
dedicated video button so any mode
you're in or any menu wherever you are
you just hit one button and you can
start recording video you can shoot at
1080p but you can only shoot it at 24
frames per second the s100 can now do
720p at 30 frames per second the cameras
also just much faster it has a new
processor so everything it does is just
a little bit faster whether you're
flipping through photos or taking a
bunch of the time they just handles
everything quicker generally though it's
pretty much the same camera it's got
that same great ring around the front
that you can use to change aperture or
zoom in and out it's got the same flash
which looks kind of cheap and small but
it's actually really bright and works
pretty well it has a lot of manual
controls there's dials and modes and
buttons everywhere which is great for a
pocket camera and is really rare I'd
also like the S 95 in the S 90 it just
takes really good pictures whether
you're in low light or a great light it
doesn't matter it has a pretty big
sensor in it as an F 2.0 lens which
works really really well to take good
pictures especially when you're not in
great lighting Canon also swapped out
the s 95 sensor for one with 12.1
megapixels instead of 10
but unfortunately the trade-off there is
it doesn't do quite as well in low light
it still does well but not quite as well
as yes 95 which is the best point in
shoot camera we've used in bad lighting
it also tends to over saturate colors
and photos so sky blue looks a little
bluer than it actually should overall
the s100 is a really great camera but
unfortunately the s 95 still takes
slightly better pictures the s 100 has a
longer zoom it has GPS it has better
video since it shoots 1080p but for pure
still images the s 95 is still the best
point-and-shoot we've ever seen and you
can find it for a little bit cheaper
it's 399 right now on sale but that's
likely to go down now that the
for 29s 100s on the work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
