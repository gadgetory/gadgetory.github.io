just going to have a look at the xbox
live integration on windows 8 and some
of the audio and video features so start
off with xbox live you see it here on
the home screen if we go in the first
thing you notice is be able to get
access to your avatar here on the Left
we scroll across I have should actually
be able to customize the avatar I'm not
sure if that's that's working totally
right now I think it's a few connection
issues and it you will be able to
customize your avatar there and you can
also get access to your friends list so
you can see who's online and if we go
into one particular friend you can sort
of compare games and can ever look at
their profile it seems very similar to
the actual iOS so do ipad application so
some of the games that are coming from
as I and you will actually get
achievements with them so your bid to
access those achievements here final
part of it is the yeah chica access to
the windows getting marketplace now
there's not a lot of games in here
should show you i think we've only got
pinball FX at two and solitaire and if
you're going solitaire
we can either buy it or look at the game
details I think we've already got it on
the system's it's pre-installed just
look at the full tile version and they
get play option there just go in and
play solitaire so obviously this is a
another sort of Metro style and game
here
so you could play solitaire just as you
normally would and it's also got
achievements once it's an xbox live game
and it will seem to choose your as your
avatar up there in the top right okay so
we're just going to look at the video
app in windows 8 here this is the main
way that you'd actually play or access
video content on windows 8 and as you
can see you get the sort of spotlight
stuff and the whole interface looks very
much like the Xbox Live app and we can
scroll across and you get your
collection so you've got one video in
there at the moment and you also get the
movies marketplace and a TV marketplace
and if we go back to our collection and
reply this video what you see you get
lots large sort of Metro style controls
there and you can right-click to bring
up the sort of controllers down the
bottom there and now there's an option
here that says play on xbox basically we
haven't got an Xbox see it right now but
this uses the Xbox Live companion
application to stream this content to an
xbox and the other thing we can do is we
can you drag down from the top and then
snap to the left and what will happen is
this will basically go into a mini
player so you got the mini player there
and it's like an overview of what's
coming up next it's like if we go back
to the actual main start screen and we
launch
you say whether what you see is it still
snapped alongside so you can basically
launch another metro app or even a
desktop app and you still had this snap
to the side though so we drag this has
to strike this back out and we go back
to the main interface and that what
you'll notice here is danna bottom the
video was still playing even when you're
in the video app application you not see
control it there and now if we have a
look through the store or you'll notice
is no mention of zune at all so we've
got TV marketplace their movie
marketplace and we'll see the spotlight
stuff okay so next up we're going to
look at the music application and again
very similar to the video application
this is the main interaction point for
any audio content on Windows 8 again you
can right-click you get access to the
controls down the bottom here one thing
that's missing is the pay on xbox and so
it doesn't look like you can stream
audio content to the xbox 360 using the
companion application and we've also got
the spotlight so very similar and to the
video one and we've got our collection
here so you can see some of the songs
we've got there and the music
marketplace on the right there again no
mention of zoom now let's play some
music
so it's identical to the video
application and you also get some cover
art in the background which is also
pretty much the same as the xbox
experience at the moment so we can also
snap this to the side and that will
create a mini player and we can go into
another metro style application and use
that just bring that back up okay as you
can see when you go back to the music
app it's still playing on the bottom and
you get state as there as well similar
to the e video app so when you're in a
traditional desktop and you double-click
a file so this is a music file it will
actually open it in the Metro style a
music player and that is the same for
videos as well so if we go back
it will bring up the metro-style video
player as well okay and that wraps up
yeah a quick look at the music and the
video and export side of Windows a</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
