at the Detroit Auto Show where how D is
introducing something really exciting a
lunar rover that's going to go to the
moon as part of Google's XPrize
challenge we sat down with one of the
scientists to learn more so laughter
tell us a little bit about why you built
a lunar rover at one point in time
Google announced the so called Google X
flash challenge it's basically a bet by
the two founders of Google who say if
you get back to the moon privately and
drive 500 meters we give you 30 million
dollars and I was hearing about you know
this prize and was thinking like why are
they doing this
you know why is somebody offering money
to get back to the moon it was such a
crazy situation and you know thinking
about this I kind of you know got a lot
of friends together with scientists and
engineers and we were thinking about is
it possible could you do something about
it and that's where it all started and
seven years later where we are today
we've now developed multiple generations
of lunar rover prototypes landing module
prototypes we are just about to purchase
a very large rocket to put it all in and
launch to the moon in the first quarter
of 2017 so a lot has happened in seven
years got it and you've chosen a very
historically and scientifically
significant landing point for for your
craft yeah we're going back to the
towers literal valley which is the site
that man said last foot on the moon so
and it has been a lot of research has
been done because it was the only Apollo
missions was the site of the Apollo 17
mission was one of the only missions
where scientists actually went to the
moon so as if one of the set matter of
fact it was the actually only mission
which generated to me a huge amount of
scientific valuable data and this is
perfect for us to build upon we have
this opportunity to we do this value
with much finer equipment and figure out
what does anomaly have been caused and
also of course expands the range of
excavation that has been done there
the main mission objective from our
mission is not just to get back to the
moon itself but actually visit something
that's been left on the moon that's the
LRV the lunar roving vehicle that's the
moon body that the Apollo astronauts
used to drive around the moon
and it's parked outside of the Apollo 17
landing site about 235 meters we want to
go there and study the remains of it
it's been on the moon over 43 years
exposed to the vast amount of space and
to the radiation and to all of the space
weather and so this kind of material
science helps you to understand what
Mateusz you can use to build a lunar
base and what's the partnership without
he bring to you and the partnership
without he actually adds two big values
for us of course access to the
technology and the engineers at Audi and
of course the funding that we need to
develop everything we do so for the
first thing something was really coolest
that already helps us to do all of the
optimizations so what it helped us from
the very last generation to this
generation of the rover to get to weigh
down by over ten kilograms using 3d
printing technology for example in house
so then for example the latest order to
just see here it has been sweetie based
on sweetie printed aluminium and
titanium with special mixes done by Audi
for Samba which have a very high
strength but very lightweight so Anna
just departs are just one millimeter
thick then of course we have this
electrical drive subsystem where we have
highly efficient brushless twice
integrated into the wheel which gives us
360 degrees of freedom from the topside
perspective and of course from the side
perspective so it means that it can
traverse the terrain quite a lot that's
very guys from Crouch will help us a lot
and then you have of course the the each
one sector where they guys help us a lot
and you can have everything qualified
because and it's a very complex system
so it's not like you know it's not
something where you can pick up it's not
a 3d puzzle where you have all the
pieces mapped out but you really need to
understand all the states where you have
there could be in almost everything
self-developed from you know starting
from the film where level to the PCB
layouts and to the half of the
programming that you need to do to get
things running and that's something that
you need to do to get to a level where
you have the kind of reliability that
you need but also can balance the cost
of the rover could make it to the moon
within two years but space is hard so
good luck to them we'll have much more
from the Detroit Auto Show here later
