CES 2013 this is a virtual signage
prototype that they have here from face
cake it's called the face cake swivel we
saw us last year but was using as a
connect and they've designed this too
they've scanned these clothes and the
idea is that when you're walking down
the street you might see you might see
this signage and you'll decide that
you'd like to step into it and see what
it's like so if I step in I could check
out this purse like a necklace and I
could even switch hands face cake is
hoping that retailers and other
advertisers will be using these signs
and moles and even in their front
windows to get people not only to view a
photograph of the clothing or the
accessories but they'll be able to
actually try it on and it's not in any
stores yet at the moment but they plan
on improving it and I'm sure they're
shopping around the signs based on the
same technology that we saw a line scoop
from face cake which is the face cake
swivel a virtual dressing room and lets
you choose dresses and suits and ties
that you'd like to try on they've also
announced here to see as a face cake
swivel up close which is designed for
you to try on makeup in a very similar
fashion this technology itself is based
off of a kinect sensor they are reading
body size and there they've already
created models in house they create
models of clothing and accessories and
they're mapping it onto your body the
sign itself is designed for retailers or
advertisers that would like to not only
show static imagery on digital signs but
they'd like to try to get people to
actually try on these clothes without
even stepping into the store of course
we haven't seen this yet in action like
in reality but
face cake says that they'll keep on
working on and they'll keep on improving
it of course swivel ran a trial the
technology but this past fall at twenty
Bloomingdale's and if you'd like to try
it out yourself we were told that
they're going to start going to get
later this year</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
