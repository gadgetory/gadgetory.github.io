Mobile World Congress 2015 and we're at
Sony's booth and the big announcement
this year is the experienced Zed for
tablet does that for is super thin it's
6.1 millimeters thick which is about the
same as the iPad air 2 and or they say
they no longer makes laptops it's old
the bio division off its positioning
this is a bit more of a Productivity
device this keyboard comes in and you
can start it in here and you have what
is a reasonable facsimile of a laptop
when it's closed it's a pretty big smart
thing the the keyboard is not amazing
the keys do you feel a bit Hollow and a
lot of them are smaller than I'd like
and it does have a bit of a cheap feel
but at the same time it does basically
work and it's certainly a better typing
experience than you get on a tablet or
you know computing box out there already
and so yeah this is definitely being
sort of pitched as a Productivity
focused Android device the screen is
really good it's a 2k display which is
26 2560 x 1600 super bright and sharp
sony says the battery life should be
pretty impressive with a six thousand
milliamp hour battery one thing about
the Zed for tablet is it's actually some
way off release it's not coming out
until June and we don't have pricing
information just yet but some what we
can see here if you're in the market for
an Android tablet this does look like a
pretty good option I mean the question
there is whether you are in the market
for an Android tablet because Android
tablets and iPads alike have been sort
of not setting the world on fire or a
plate but if this is the kind of thing
you're after I think that may make you
happy
so aside from the zero tablet Sony's
phone announcement of this show is the
Xperia m4 aqua which is it's kind of a
mid-range device but it's designed to
take a lot of the design features from
the flagship experience at 3:00 and put
it into a more affordable price point
this is going to retail for around 300
euros and I think for that it's it's a
pretty impressive offering the build is
very solid it looks very much like one
of Sony's more premium phones even
though it is made of plastic the screen
is 5 inches and 720p so it's not the
highest resolution out there but in
terms of color reproduction and viewing
angles and stuff it's it's pretty good
the phone is also waterproof as with the
tablet and a lot of other Sony products
these days sony is also touting the
cameras on this device there it's a 13
megapixel shooter on the rear and a 5
megapixel wide-angle selfie camera on
the front as ever the crazy lighting of
a show floor is probably not the best
place to be
during to many conclusions about the
cameras performance but they're
definitely making it a feature of the
firm so yeah well at all as a device for
this grace guys I think this looks like
a pretty solid effort obviously there
are companies like Motorola that will
undercut them on here Christ but it's
only the same with this devices to kind
of give some of that premium DNA in a
lower price point and this seems like a
pretty good a pretty successful effort
to fulfill that mandate so yeah the Sony
Xperia m4 aqua at Mobile World Congress</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
