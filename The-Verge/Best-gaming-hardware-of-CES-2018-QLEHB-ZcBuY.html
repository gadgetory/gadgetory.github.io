flying cars AI washing machines and of
course a lot about the future of playing
video games
now gaming isn't typically part of the
main event here at CES we have GDC III
and a whole lot of other conferences for
that but we're developers startups and
game companies do you cs4 is hardware a
lot of really weird experimental and
awesome hardware Nvidia this week showed
off new g-sync 65-inch 4k HDR gaming
monitors that look absolutely incredible
the company is working with Acer Asus
and HP to develop the hardware and gsync
monitors of this caliber at this size or
reshaping how we think about PC gaming
visuals and then there's Razer every
year the company comes to CES with at
least one wacky prototype to show off
this year it was a laptop dock for the
recently announced a Razer phone it's
called Project Linda and it's a laptop
dock for the phone itself even better
the laptops trackpad is where the phone
actually plugs in that the touchscreen
acting is your mouse input we've also
seen a few really neat gaming
accessories including one standout
invention from Asus that uses light
refraction to remove monitor bezels
called the bezel free kit the mountable
lenses bend the image of your screen
from one monitor to the next obscuring
the black bezels in between we also saw
some pretty out-there stuff take for
instance the mirror of is projector
screen which can handle two video inputs
at the same time that will let gamers
play co-op or compete without splitting
the screen another is the Xena ma II
skin smart shirt which basically turns
your entire body into a video game
motion controller ah now you can't talk
about weird gaming hardware at CES
without talking about virtual and
augmented reality now it's been a couple
of years since VR basically dominated
the show floor you can trace that back
to the commercial launches of the oculus
rift and the HTC vive it used to be that
CES was the best place to try these
companies prototypes and it was an
exciting time for a brand new product
category of course oculus has its own
annual conference now called oculus
connect and sony has in the past
typically reserved PlayStation VR
announcements for more game focus shows
like GC but we did get one VR Hardware
announcement here at CES
HTC's new vive pro it gives the
company's headset a resolution bump
built-in headphones and a wireless
adapter for cordless play that's a big
deal because it means HTC is really
focusing hard on the premium PC powered
VR market
it will be interesting to see how oculus
responds especially because oculus has
been putting a lot of resources toward
cordless self-contained headsets like in
Santa Cruz prototype but here's the
reality VR is in the show stealer it
once was this year at CES it's mostly
faded into the background and that's
alright VR will only get better from
here and that means so will the apps the
games of the film's that we experience
in VR here at CES in place of all the
oculus and vive excitement of the last
few years we now have a are taking the
spotlight it feels like every company
Under the Sun is trying to take
advantage of a renewed interest in
augmented reality it also helps that
since the launch of Pokemon go about two
years ago
AR has been the coolest and most
exciting mobile development in a long
time out here in Vegas though we're not
talking about mobile AR through an
iPhone camera we're talking about
full-fledged AR goggles and glasses that
can float virtual images in your vision
and help software interact with the
physical world all hands-free and all
without a phone since Microsoft debuted
its hololens roughly three years ago
we've all known that this style of AR
tech is possible and then I could have a
big impact on gaming and mobile
computing AR has just been too early or
too limited or too expensive to really
take off yet even the hololens which is
really really impressive stuff is a ways
away from being a consumer product at
CES this year we've seen a number of
companies so some genuine AR
advancements
music's a rochester new york based
company that's been trying this stuff
for years finally managed to shrink its
tech down into a device that looks
almost like a standard pair of
sunglasses the blade headset is a
heads-up display that's basically a
next-gen version of Google glass and it
even has Amazon Alexa we also saw a
number of other AR style displays for
specific applications like motorcycle
helmets
now sure there's a ton of junk out there
most of which will never become a
successful consumer product
everyone thinks AR is gonna take over
the world and it might just 10 or 15
years from now that's not to say that
eventually won't happen but these types
of transitions and technology take time
was a hololens 2.0 on the way and then
even Apple is working on a rumored AR
device and also this magic leap who's
apparently groundbreaking goggles are
coming out later this year
so if there's anything to take away from
CES about VR AR in gaming except there
will be hype and there will be missed
expectations but when all of that dies
down we'll be left with products that
are smaller better and more powerful
because CES is a look around the corner
and technology keeps getting better all
the time now sure there's a ton of oh
yeah get rekt
yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
