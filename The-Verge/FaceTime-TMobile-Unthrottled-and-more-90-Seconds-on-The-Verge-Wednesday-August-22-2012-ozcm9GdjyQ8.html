seifert the new guy and this is 90
seconds on the verge 18 t is now
responding directly to criticisms over
its new face time restrictions the
carrier announced last week that it
would allow facetime over cellular but
only for customers on its new mobile
share plans in a blog post today ATT
executive Bob quim wrote that the move
does not violate SEC rules because it's
a pre-loaded app Quinn argues that a
FaceTime was a downloadable app then of
course the carrier wouldn't block it
both and as the pointe shoe market
continues to fall at the hands of
smartphones nikon's latest has a secret
weapon Android the 16 megapixel coolpix
s800c runs stock android 2.3 with full
access to Google's Play Store it also
has a 10 times zoom lens and shoots
1080p HD video the camera will be
available next month for just under
three hundred and fifty dollars
Instagram will never be the same
t-mobile has announced that it will
offer truly unlimited data with no
restrictions the unlimited nation 4g
data plan will have no caps and will not

unlike t-mobile current plans an
all-you-can-eat voice text and HSPA+
data plan costs around ninety dollars
which beats the competition by about
twenty dollars a month there is a catch
though you won't be able to use your
phone as a hotspot the new plants will
be available September fifth but no word
from t-mobile on if it's going to
include LTE with them that's it for
today's top stories turn it in tomorrow
to see why some astronomers believe that
the Big Dipper may actually be a baster</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
