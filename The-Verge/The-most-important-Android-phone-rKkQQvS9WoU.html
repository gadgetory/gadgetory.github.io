and I've been talking a lot about how
its dominant now there's over two
billion users and it has over 80%
worldwide market share now in a previous
video we looked at why Android got
started but this week I have a different
question
how did Android get so big if you take
yourself all the way back to 2009 it was
very much not a sure thing that Android
would become the king of mobile in fact
what you were looking at back then was
like a six or seven horse race far out
in the lead was Symbian which was
dominant in Europe but almost nothing
here in the US the iPhone was gaining a
little bit of traction blackberry was
doing okay and Android was like a blip
like a 4% blip now in hindsight it's
really easy to say why Symbian and
Windows Mobile and Blackberry and Linux
and yes Linux phone existed and webOS
why they all crashed and burned they all
happened for kind of different reasons
but today I want to focus on one of the
biggest reasons they all went down in
flames instead of staying competitive
and that reason is more so than the g1
this right here is the real Android og
and there's a lot of really notable
things to talk about this device first
off it was a big deal for Motorola which
hadn't had a hit since the Razer flip
phone and it was before the company fell
on hard times and then got bought by
Google and then got sold by Google and
now just kind of makes bog-standard
Android phones now that it's owned by
Lenovo nope this phone right here with
its little flip out thing here this was
the big comeback in oh my gosh what a
comeback it's hard to remember now but
this thing was the pinnacle of tech I
mean just look at the crazy angles on
these things and it had turned by turn
directions in Google Maps which was very
rare back then and it launched with
Android 2.0 it had a very big screen it
had multiple buttons little five-way
removal battery whole bunch of stuff and
if you didn't know Google had a hand in
developing this phone I've even heard
some Googlers referred to the Droid as
the unofficial first Nexus device even
before the Nexus One in 2010 this phone
was metal it was metal as hell and that
brings me to the real reason that the
Droid was the moment when Android
started to get big and that's because of
Verizon you see back in 2009 carriers
had a lot more control over what phones
got on their networks and they still did
most of the marketing work on them and
to be clear I'm mostly talking about the
u.s. right now but the US was also kind
of ground zero for the smartphone wars
sure the iPhone was getting big but it
was exclusive just to AT&amp;amp;T after Verizon
had turned it down so Verizon was
desperately looking for something to
compete with the iPhone now Verizon
started this thing called the blackberry
storm which was a absolute dumpster fire
of a device with a biggish screen that
you're supposed to click and down on to
type it was it was really bad so Verizon
was looking around for the next big
thing and you know what I know a lot of
you been waiting for this because the
company that horizon took a look at next
Palm Horizon had rejected the first Palm
Pre and that went to sprint which you
know anytime iPhone was exclusive to
sprint you know it's gonna bomb just ask
essential but by 2009 palm had made this
the Palm Pre Plus and it was looking to
launch it on Verizon and Verizon was
actually game the Palm Pre Plus was
maybe going to be Verizon's iPhone
killer we reported that Verizon had
placed an order for a quote
extraordinary number of Palm smart
phones but somewhere in there Verizon
changed its mind it might have just been
playing Palm all along instead it
launched the Droid in October 2009 as
its flagship and it did so with a huge
marketing campaign I mean massive the
campaign was called Droid does and it
took direct aim at the iPhone it said
that I could do all sorts of things that
the iPhone can't like multitasking and
navigation and taking five megapixel
photos and just on and on and on it was
a spec war basically an age reported
that Verizon pumped 100 million dollars
into its marketing campaign which is a
lot of money now and
was a huge amount of money back then
Verizon also license the word droid from
George Lucas who had the trademark on it
thanks to you know Star Wars I have to
point out that these ads they were awful
and really misogynistic they painted the
iPhone as girly and the droid is a manly
stealth bomber looking thing I mean just
look at some of this imagery it's kind
of flat-out offensive is it a precious
porcelain figurine of a phone in truth
no it's not a princess it's a robot
phone the traits hairdo but can do
verizon what were you doing a lot of
people bought into your manly droid add
claptrap and it kind of hurt the Android
community for a while thankfully those
days are mostly behind us but the Droid
was good enough to serve as the thing
that people could get on Verizon since
they could get an iPhone and that ad
campaign made Android the de facto other
smartphone to the iPhone now it does not
help that everybody else was tripping
over their own shoelaces trying to make
a phone to compete with the iPhone
Blackberry was antiquated Symbian was on
the downslope and Microsoft was told
years away from really knowing what the
hell it was doing his phones they all
shot themselves in their own feet over
and over and over again and palm it
wasn't much better but it was a little
better now Verizon did eventually launch
the Palm Pre Plus but they made some
pretty terrible commercials for it which
were also a little bit sexist but that
whole Verizon thing it kneecapped the
company and in the face of that huge
massive marketing blitz there wasn't any
oxygen for anything other than droid the
rest was history within six months of
launching the Droid Android past iOS as
the most used smartphone and it never
looked back on its path taking over most
of the world so I'm not saying Verizon
single-handedly made Android happen but
without that ad campaign and this phone
right here who knows
who knows what might have happened the
next time you see a phone ad and you
just feel it's just a little bit to feel
good and sentimental just remember nice
is better than everybody thanks so much
for watching and let me know in the
comments what made you buy your first
Android phone wasn't an ad campaign was
it a friend was it something else really
curious let me know also if you missed
the first part of this series about
Android history it's about why Google
bought Android and made it in the first
place so you should check that out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
