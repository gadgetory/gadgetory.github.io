here with Facebook's redesigned news
feed so a lot of what Facebook has done
here is try to put a lot more white
space and make everything bigger in its
new design what it's done in part is
take the news ticker from here and
remove it and then move your messaging
over here and then use that space that's
freed up to make the photos and posts a
lot bigger you'll see that you've got a
sidebar that's very sort of mobile
inspired that includes your messages and
events and then you've got larger photos
and some full descriptions of things
like shared articles if you scroll down
and you find photos you'll see that
they're not actually breaking out the
text of the photos anymore instead
they're actually overlaying it onto the
photograph itself they've made the whole
thing a little bit easier to see and a
little bit more consistent with what
you'll find on a lot of other sites
they've also done is separate out your
news feeds here you've got a standard
news feed of your friends and you've
also got some of the same lists you had
before like close friends but you've
also got dedicated feeds for photos
games and any lists that you create for
instance you can see anything that your
friends have liked or played that's
related to music by going to your music
feed and if you've liked a page it'll
also start suggesting news related to
say music news pages that you've liked
you've also got a dedicated feed of
everyone that you're following so you'll
be able to just have what's essentially
a news ticker of the articles that are
being shared and the posts that are
being made on the public pages that you
follow this whole thing is going to roll
out across mobile and web it's actually
starting right now on the web and then
it's going to come to mobile in the next
few weeks
Facebook says this is going to be a
pretty slow rollout you can sign up for
a waiting list but it may not actually
start showing up for a while
