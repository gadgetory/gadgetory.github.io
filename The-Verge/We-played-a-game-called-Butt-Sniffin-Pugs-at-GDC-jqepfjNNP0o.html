Smith and pubs a game where you are a
pug and you sniff hug but you control it
with this giant tennis ball it's kind of
like a mouse person it moves your plug
around you have two options right now I
have white in park and if i want to
change those goodies I go over to my pal
tap that but and I get new powers right
now I can pedal and I can poopie it's
good some eating from you oh no oh and
now now I have a case of diarrhea he is
not feeling it oh my gosh his eyes he's
surrendered you know what to the giant
bowel problems uh it feels really nice
but the thing about all these games to
control all GD c is that they're not
really practical for traditional video
gaming setup so what is the future penis
is it something that can maybe be in
arcade I talked to my pal gave over here
and he said that maybe the cement could
be coming to the PlayStation that
there'd be other ways 24 48 maybe the
touchpad or something but really the
intention of the game is naturally super
serious and just let you have a little
bit of fun you know like dogs do you
mean sem each other's poopers</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
