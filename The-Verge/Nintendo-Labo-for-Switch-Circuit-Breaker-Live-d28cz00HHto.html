the Verge's premier and flagship Gadget
Show Live on YouTube I'm Ashley Carmen
I'm Paul Miller Tommy Lee is here our
girl just brought so many things with
her but first before we get to the
things Donnie has brought let me just
tell you what we have going on for this
show so DOM is here and then we're going
to have a massive career that's going to
come out and try out the spinning wheel
of gadget wonderment which is what I'm
calling it fishing channel I don't
expect anyone to know what that means
but you'll see eventually so this is
gonna be a really great show I'm excited
also this is our last episode probably
ever yeah I did because we have the
greatest gadget of all time but next
week we're not going to be standing
right here the verge exists exists
Ashley is making some amazing videos if
you go to the verge YouTube channel it
all exists it just won't be live every
week after this after right now okay
we'd always are both sad stuff and maybe
later but dummy Nintendo lab oh yeah
what oh lab Oh which was just released
4:20 nice it's sort of like DIY
cardboard accessories for the switch and
a lot of people were kind of confused
about it cuz Nintendo was selling to
kits right now there's the $60 a variety
kit oh no sorry $70 which comes with
five different games like this toy piano
you can build right here or like a
fishing rod and then there's also an $80
robot kit which Paul is modeling right
now and people were like why is this
cardboard so expensive like what the
heck and the thing is you're not just
paying for cardboard girls are paying
for like the experience and it comes
with like this game cartridge which has
all of the corresponding games for it
but let's start
one of my favorites which is this toy
piano here and I'm going to explain how
this all works yes but just to clarify
because I was confused about this for a
while
you don't buy labo and then buy a bunch
of these different things there's a kit
that is a bunch of stuff and then
there's a kit that's a robot switch
cartridges and it's all separate from
your switch which is a whole nother
thing you buy yeah so right now we have
the variety kit cartridge in the switch
right now and I'm gonna use that to
demonstrate how this toy piano works it
looks really impressive yeah so
basically the build guide says it takes
what like three hours to build this but
that's probably like assuming like your
bullying with like a small child because
this really marketed towards kids
mmm-hmm this took a Meg our production
manager an adult it took her like an
hour and a half to build out and it's
mostly like it's just so much folding
and like you really got to follow all
the steps and yeah all of this is
individually folded yeah
like everything is cardboard you don't
need scissors or glue or anything like
they've engineered this so you can just
building it like right on the box really
cool-looking um so yeah I'm going to go
into the software here and go into the
toy piano mode we're going to okay so
first you have to control or connect the
controller is wirelessly just wait for
that to detect and this is important
because the red controller has IR camera
right there and this picks up on little
IR stickers that are on the back of the
keyboard here if you look right there I
can see them
yeah and those are stickers do you have
to put on your cell yeah
so the kits all come with like a roll of
like IR stickers and you just have to
place them in the right positions oh my
god yeah it's a lot of work and let me
just stick this into the back of the
piano here so wouldn't you like press a
key it'll reveal itself to the camera
telling the switch to make a sound and
then we try well in here hmm I love I
use a lot this morning yeah so whoa
right
now it's on a mode for to make the
keyboard sound like cats I'm not like
super musical you can't really make
music with this that works I just really
feel bad for parents like a terrible
child oh my god but there's different
filters you can put into the keyboard
here so that was just a cat torture
basically all of these little knobs here
it's instantaneous - yes it's got a
different title in code yeah you can see
you just place it on there differently
let's try this one this one is an
angelic voice tell your kids that we
lost the cat sound and you can press
this little lever here to bend the hear
that in like a Brooklyn warehouses oh
yeah on the top on the left or right at
the plate so I think this one is for
recording
just press the button oh well I did not
program this this is just playing a song
for us this is happy birthday mm-hmm
so I guess this just came with it we're
still discovering yeah number three
oh wait no this one's also really good
at some old man would you rather have
your kid play with more the cat worse or
the old man I really don't know oh they
have different songs
I guess sound like a band beat up okay
that's over so that's the piano yes
so let's see what other filters there
are no if the lab is flimsy or weak and
also is it easy to replace ik if you
lost pieces maybe yeah so Andrew Webster
reviewed the lab oh and he has like two
kids like super young and he said it's
like surprisingly durable mm-hmm but
also Nintendo's cells like replacement
kits try something or he also said it
was like easy to fix
I think they even have tutorials of like
how to repair something if you raise it
okay cool but Nintendo also suggested
like you should hold on to these like
cardboard kits that it came from so if
you finish making one you can always use
it as a stencil to like create more kids
reproducing cardboard kits here yeah
there's so many like different modes on
here so that was just a toy piano if you
go into studio you have way more options
this is like a baton that also came with
the cardboard I don't know where it went
but the studio lets you like really
record and like play around with making
music and also it gives you more octaves
it's like five octaves that you can
adjust it the lever here so much scarier
looking yeah oh no man everything
started they were counting you in okay
oh so let's check out something else
yeah so let's take this off and maybe
move on to the fishing rod we have here
and the fishing rod is fun because you
can play the corresponding game that
comes with it how do ya when I saw that
there's a fishing rods like I wasn't
really having a hard time one it's made
out of cardboard - how is that like a
video game so the video game is
basically it's very calming it you just
reel in the fish that you catch but the
way they set this up is you put the
screen on like this and you have to is
it going to teach me how to fish just to
be clear for people this is still part
of the variety kit the variety this is
the $70 kit okay so piano fishing oh
like there's a house that you can build
with like a hibachi character and it's
all the games are on one
all the games on one cartridge so we're
gonna put this controller I think it was
right here yeah
and the red one goes on there oh sorry
no we got this backwards so the
instructions are all on the screen here
we don't like following yeah the red one
should have gone we'd prefer to
experiment let's do this play our own
rules there you go there you go who's
this using the camera - yes so the
camera is on the red controller and it
can sense where your fishing rod is
right now Ashley fish we're gonna wait
for fish to come along and buy the hook
I'm gonna means this guy mmm so I can
also pull it yeah and it knows yeah just
so people can see that on the screen I
don't know it's more effective to go
like this or to go maybe it's like a
combination of both yeah that does seem
to be more for gonna be patient yeah I
have no patience but this is good it's
good I need to practice this one like
teach kids Paige okay okay fishing you
got a mackerel yeah I did amazing thank
you
this is awesome I could absolutely see
myself playing with just all the time
and sitting in the office doing it baby
I'm like good for a union of break yeah
how long does this one take the mate so
creighton our producer made this I think
I took him like what no three minutes no
hour and a half yeah yeah we went to the
Nintendo like hands-on event and they
basically they how does make this RC car
which super easy to make it takes like
five minutes yeah but they had to start
the fishing rod and like didn't give us
time to finish it because they knew what
take longer that sounds fine I mean we
still had to play with it after it was
done but yeah I want to show you
the RC car next still variety kit yeah
still variety can too much to pay for
cardboard well let me tell you yeah and
also you got to RC cars okay one
cardboard sheet here so basically this
one's already done this one that has ink
on it
this one's some green so like all the RC
cars are green fishing on it's blue like
so you'll never like mix up okay toys
but they also give you a blank one so
you can like decorate it however you
want but googly eyes on it if you want
it feels like the proper way to do it
I'm gonna I'm gonna try this I'm not
here old school Lego expert yeah you
know you give me some Legos an
instruction book I'm there really
haven't done a lot of cardboard work in
my life yeah but I'm willing to flex
into this new role yeah so I guess
before we let you start building we can
show people like what the finished one
looks like and let's go into the RC car
mode here stick the controllers and like
this and you gotta get the antenna on
the thing makes it official yeah so this
is our finished RC car and if you press
this button here they make a little
roller vibrate to make it go in that
direction
if you press some blue on it goes left
press both environment goes straight and
this part is really cool there's a
camera as I mentioned the IR camera on
the red controller here you can actually
see yourself on the screen there is
there there's paul night vision mode
whoa the paul cam on there people see
this yeah Paul's camera there's Ashley
if you top it one more time it turns
into like a depth sensing camera so the
closer you are show up in red and then
also has this auto mode so you put that
down and turn on auto mode and then
it'll start to follow whatever is in
front of it
it follows those stickers stickers pick
up super well on the camera
I'm over there no should we so I guess
we have to have you build yeah we give
this shot so this is supposed to be the
easiest one to but this super easy takes
like less than five minutes and it's the
first one they have you build in the
variety cuz kit because it teaches you
the basics of like folding so how do we
so we have to go back to make mode okay
and the instructions are like super easy
to follow there's these back and
forwards arrows that will let you adjust
the speed of like how fast you want to
learn first that takes you through like
the entire process and then if you pull
the tab like all the way over here it
goes super fast
you just hold it down it's like kind of
slow okay so you just follow these
instructions to see what's most amazing
to me is the fact that like I own a
Nintendo switch and I really never
thought about how yeah the camera or how
this could eventually be used in the
future to actually make something like
this yeah there's really not that many
games on the switch that make use of
this camera so far like even want to use
it for like one two switch there's a
game on there that's like I think it's
like the eating contest game oh yeah put
the controller in front of your mouth
and you're like this yeah like we can
take some questions about yeah if anyone
out there who's watching the show has
questions let us know I'm gonna go
through here and see if there's any that
are coming through but seems like most
people are just really excited about
this and that they think that the
fishing game could be addictive which
honestly after just a little bit of
playing and I'm like I honestly could
see myself playing yeah and just sitting
there waiting for it let's see you know
many questions yet but yeah Paul how's
it going
the key to good toy car construction is
to crease firmly along the fold lines
that's where I'm at yeah so folding is
like ninety percent from building yeah
it's really making you work for your
entertainment looks because I missed the
bus was to punch this circuit
we're gonna fall we only just go back to
playing with this because it's my
favorite thing ever it's super fun I
guess I can also show off this guitar
that is not part of the variety kit but
this is about manager Meg all-star
superstar she signed this guitar as all
good guitarist should have and she
reinforces the back with like popsicle
sticks here and we use this for like the
labo video would you also watch because
it's very incredible yeah it took me
like two days of like blood sweat and
tears over my guitar on to labo which is
something you can do to work on garage
which is a programming platform within
the lab oh let's you like remix like all
the different variety kit games or like
the robot kit which Paul is going to
show off later yeah yeah for the guitar
we basically like attached this blue
controller here and like use that as
like the fret and then we have the
screen here and we're like that's so
cool so people can buy this now braid
they're asking yeah that one it's
available
yes it's available now and everyone
seems to be very interested in the
quality of the cardboard yeah which it
does feel hefty yeah doesn't feel super
like yeah it's like somewhere in between
the thickness of like a card a cereal
box and like an Amazon shipping package
somewhere in the middle yeah and then
it's one cartridge per kit right so it's
not like I need a separate cartridge for
the piano or for they common so the
variety kit has the piano
RC car fishing rod there's like a
tamagotchi like house and was the other
one motorcycle yeah did you guys get the
motorcycle we and so it's in the office
somewhere like we played it at the event
and it's pretty fun yeah and also is
Nintendo trying to make this an
educational thing like is that at all
part of their focus or is it more just
like this is a fun cool thing for people
to do I'm sure it's like like they
definitely want to focus on education
like especially with work on garage it
teaches kids like
basics of programming so it works with
like if this then that it works with
like a series of nodes where you like
determine what is the input node so like
if you touch this part of the screen the
output would be like making a sound or
making a part of the screen light up
yeah I figured this out okay I've got
this Paul is working on the RC car it
looks like it's almost done
yeah I'm a real instructional follower
but I realized now what is actually
happening and I think it's gorgeous so
it also tells you you have to put the
antenna on the screen which is purely
decoration right so this part this next
part is pretty fun we're gonna face off
and rage right these cars hey I love a
racetrack let me let me look at the
racetrack okay yeah so these
instructions are great because it tells
you like now put the controller in yes
let's you know you know like after you
put it in like does it feel a little
loose and if so like that's okay cuz
it's meant to be loose it vibrates there
we go okay and now we're gonna make oh
you guys are really using your
imaginations so this is the outer edge
of the racetrack this is the middle and
we've have our starting line right here
so that's the start also like these like
cones also come with the cardboard kit
so like they're really encouraging you
to like know get competitive wow I can't
believe this tutorial okay so I guess
yeah let's exit out and go back to the
play portion and this is the part
let's you race your friends you can
control both of these on one switch I
think one of these is backwards which
the IR camera is forward
I have no idea yeah I think it was going
towards with okay let's test this out
okay so I'll take I'll take this one
okay very good
who's gonna win okay Tommy you're Paul
now place your bets oh yeah
actually I can't book side it's you know
I gotta remain neutral here I'm just a
neutral referee do you have an advantage
because you're cool we'll be outside
okay what if you try to push him out
that's all there's about marathoners you
help everyone without limit of their
life wait here
Yami's really trying to push them out
wait music coming from tell me you are
now third square 52 seconds
that's just loud that was exactly what
you can do with a variety K now let's
move on to the robot can I ask a
question for my shot people want to know
if you think it's worth some money I
definitely think it's worth money like
if you're gonna spend $60 on like Super
Mario any game these days games are like
like this is an experience it makes a
lot more sense if you have kids yeah but
there is something that is very
satisfying if you if you're looking for
like a hobby yeah you want to learn
programming or or just like make
something with your hands it's it's
pretty good okay so I'm gonna switch out
the cartridge here oh that's right it's
a different yeah it's a different game
$80 yes I do think the robot
I think the variety kid is a better
value yeah but I were to recommend
something like a robot and this took one
of our team members Jeff about three
hours three hours our longest one to
build I think we have like a time-lapse
of Jeff there he is
and yeah there's just so many pieces
showing show off like the inside of it
yeah yeah yeah so the instructions
you create like weights to be put inside
this cardboard backpack and the way all
those weights are made up of this
cardboard that you fold over each other
and it works like the piano you have
these like IR stickers that move up and
down depending on if you're pulling on
the strings and you can't see it on the
camera but Paul also has the weights
attached to his feet so so the
controller with a camera with going yeah
so we have to put the controller into
the back of the robot kit how does it
feel to pull on the strings I was when I
saw this it looked like the most fragile
thing in the world and I didn't think I
would be able to actually wear it at all
yeah weirdly strong yeah it's cool that
like both kids and adults can wear this
robot kit because the string is long
enough mm-hmm I definitely feel like I'm
sending Paul off to school oh and also
comes with this visor here we have to
put the blue controller here okay this
is we launched the yeah so let's put the
robot kit into the dock all right so
this is my new look for the summer
you're placing your wearable computer
glasses that's right let's say and we're
gonna just go ahead and put this into
the dock and play the robot game all
right we're gonna put this on the big
screen so you guys it's C and Paul's
gonna demonstrate this these are the
these are the legs yeah there's a little
fiddly to get it oh okay right now you
have the visor on which puts you into
the perspective of the robot
first-person perspective
that's normal and the objective of this
game is to basically just walk around
and destroy everything so you can take a
bunch of stuff to go forward punch the
building destroy it if you could also
visualize where the yeah the weights are
yeah you're sewing destruction if you
crouch down you can get into a car good
for the kids
yeah not so much funny because the
switch can also tell how many calories
you burn while doing this I feel like I
should be making yeah well my favorite
part is it almost feels like an AR
experience beautifly send your arms out
to fly it gives you a couple tips
they're really loves giving you this
helpful tips yeah I am like 3 or 4 times
and it always gives me this whole the
immune eyes are you enough destruction
yeah you're just being peaceful I really
don't like the story things I'm a bill
Oh but so you actually program yes so I
was I thought this is cool is pretty
excited about it and then I saw a Dom
knees project of building this guitar
and playing Rainbow Connection so I
immediately took the this robot kit I
was like well I can make like a robot
yeah I know but I think I think that's
the idea and I think that's why this is
an exciting thing is cuz I think I'm
probably the only person who thought
robot piano and they saw Tommy's video
cuz it's just obvious what what am i
doing I'm doing stuff ok here we go
built a one-man instrument machine that
you control with your body
it's really sad sound
oh my god freakin to watch yes I feel so
sad but you know Paul you're following
your heart and that's what's important
here
[Laughter]
so basically you this has inputs so the
input is if the the left arm right arm
right leg left leg I also set it up with
touch inputs like that means this guitar
thing so those and then those are wired
up to the way the legs work it detects
that you're pulling it down and it it's
it's the opposite of automatically
contracted and then they're like the
legs by default are what's the opposite
of contracted extract new extended okay
so but so I put in these not gates so
that's in the middle there's these logic
things so so I put it in little not
gates because there are not and AM gates
by the way this is turn complete you
could make your own NAND gates and make
a whole computer out of this program it
would take forever yeah you can
customize what sound you want piano or
you can make it play like an organ to
play like a heavy metal guitar sound a
way to sharing what you've created like
this they build a community because you
can go in here and like save your file I
have no idea I guess they've got
something they thought of you can also
say what range it senses this with them
mm-hmm
so if you if I don't want it I didn't
want a guitar sound until I hit like a
pretty high oh yeah so it's not doing
that's really cool
busking falls one-man band
amazing alright well that is the lab Oh
amazing
Tommy this is beautiful so Paul yes you
made a video it was basically trying to
start some beef with hi and Barton Bird
cuz we were disagreeing about some
technology topics also I feel like a lot
of what the show is about is showing
them to behind the scenes and what is
more than behind-the-scenes then a
writer for circuit-breakers desk so this
is x desc
hey it's your friend paul miller a lot
of people have said that Paul why is
your desk so messy and well I always say
to them is I don't have a good answer
but one one way I deflect is I say have
you seen Himes desk
- hi I'm Garten Berg hi in addition to
always agreeing about where our
keyboards should be placed and headphone
form factors
we both have pretty messy desks would
you agree yes would you say your desk is
maybe more messy than mine I would maybe
disagree on that I generally point
people at your desk oh wow so we're both
deflecting yeah see I have a lot more
loose cables you've got a lot of boxes
yeah I mean they just accumulate because
you have like little things like you
know headphones and hubs and then they
come in boxes and then I don't need the
box while I'm testing it but I need the
box so I can give it back afterwards and
it's just like they just kind of pile up
and I test a lot of things so I think
what we should do
there's no shame here all right okay
well let's just let's just run through
what you got this is the most important
space which is the small reclaimed area
that I get to keep my computer so I can
actually get work done let it be known
that you do get a lot of work done
that's that's good or you just say these
are my headphones they usually go in my
bag I just didn't put them back in my
bag after my commute this morning would
you say they're comfortable headphones
yeah these are great these are really
comfortable that's good to know
Nintendo switch which I'm actually
currently testing with some USB C
chargers right now this is a notebook
full of notes for meetings oh this is my
to-do list notebook actually I have
actually still not done some of these I
should get on that
wait where's that cable from oh okay so
this cables actually from these
headphones I'm matching matching the
logos sometimes I said things the back
sometimes they just stay on my desk but
you what's the process here so the
process here is I'm gonna hand it to
Michael and Michael's gonna hopefully
put in our views room real time behind
the scenes Michael I had nice return
there will be more it's like an echo da
Apple TV combo pack am i right you're
not a MIDI introduce some garbage this
is some garbage this is some car
that plastic I really I recognize that
plastic sheet as just a common thing
that goes in boxes sometimes this is the
remarkable it's an Ian tablet this was
on the show this is a personal favorite
it is a razor light up mug holder and if
you plug this into computer it lights up
and you can have it light up with like
razer stuff headphones your ultimate is
available in overwatch when your
Ultimates available it's it's really the
pinnacle of mug technology are you
reviewing the ps4 I am borrowing a ps4
from the verge because I don't actually
own a ps4 but I am playing the new God
of War so I can write about that for our
game section you gotta force by the way
pretty good these are notebooks five and
six notebook County notebook number
seven which says small on it I'm not
sure why it's a common insult that I
received in middle school this is the
holder for these headphones so I'm gonna
put this bad yeah we're reuniting
elements let's reenact these guys I
think I spotted goggles are there
goggles on your desk Kyle yeah of course
these are my protection goggles we're
actually like reaching the base layer of
desk at least in the center over here
now we like in archaeology are we going
backwards in time yeah we're actually we
want to say number eight I met 20 I'm
seeing a book do you also review books I
don't it seems like the base sedimentary
layer is USB cables yeah this is a
PlayStation 4 controller that looks a
lot like an Xbox controller and a Google
pixel book look things that are you
currently in progress
we're finally approaching the final
layer this is just a giant pile of USBC
hubs would you call yourself the world's
foremost expert on USB C hubs can I call
you the world's for math you can do
whatever you want Paul this is crazy
so yeah I just need to organize the
cables a little bit let's do the
official count two three four five six
percent
13 that seems that seems about right
I really just want to take everything on
your chair please I need to I need to
address this that's how it's done use
psychological warfare on your co-workers
to make them clean their desks that was
beautiful Paul that was just stunning I
feel bad you feel bad maybe I'm a mean
person I mean your desk is equally as
messy it's true so we just need to hire
them to get revenge on you true but now
you can't you know I'll figure it out
okay so for this segment
the spinning wheel of gadget wonderment
yes we're going to spin the wheel these
are all the gadgets that we're supposed
to be on the show but we just never got
to it yeah so then what's gonna happen
is we're gonna land on a gadget and
someone is gonna come out and explain
the gadget it's me like lightning boom

our whole lives it's true it's true this
this wheel requires a lot of muscle
should I spend first the Hori onyx
that's time uh-oh hi I'm this is his
chance to really tell us how he feels
Hori onyx which is a really weird
PlayStation 4 controller that is a the
first an actually only third-party
Wireless PlayStation 4 controller so if
you want a wireless controller that
isn't made by Sony okay this is the only
one and it also looks suspiciously
almost copyright inducing like an Xbox
controller
but it still is the touchpad it still
the touchpad is still it doesn't
actually it has uses this little light
over here instead of light bar on top
okay but if you like the Xbox controller
this is the closer you can get with the
PlayStation is it I know this is a real
company they only sell it in Europe you
cannot buy this in America you actually
have to import it from America but if
you wants the Xbox experience on a
Playstation this is pretty much your
only option I don't want to start any
beefs but do you prefer the Xbox
controller to the ps4 can still I prefer
the Xbox controller layout

promise that the buns on this just
aren't that good but someone hopefully
will make one Chris the buttons need to
be crisper I agree and I think it turned
it on all right
