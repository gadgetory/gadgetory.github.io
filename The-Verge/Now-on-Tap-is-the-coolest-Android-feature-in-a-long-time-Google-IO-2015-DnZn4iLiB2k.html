we're here at Google i/o 2015 and we're
taking a look at now on tap which is the
new feature from Google for the Android
M primary and it's really wild it
basically lets Google search inside any
app and give you Google now cards so
here's an example that Google has
running out a demo a chat where
someone's asking about pitch-perfect -
so I can hold my finger down on the home
button it reads the screen searches for
it and then gives me cards so here's a
card on Anna Kendrick I can go right
into the IMDB app to get more
information about her if I just want to
go see pitch perfect - because obviously
that's what I want to do right now I can
go right into Flixter to go and get
information about the movie and where I
can play it and so on
so that's pretty cool there's a bunch of
other examples so you can even use an
Instagram photo and you can see it says
grub gardens so if we were to pull their
finger down there it gives me a location
I can call them I can navigate to them
here's a tweet and it mentions an author
Walter Isaacson the whole done now on
tap it reads through the thing what's
interesting here oh there's a dude named
Walter Isaacson what books did he write
well there is Walter I can see jobs you
know I wrote that book and so on so
that's pretty cool so basically any app
inside Android M you can hold down the
home button and search for what the
contents of the app is it gives Google
an advantage because it gets to know
what's inside apps but really for you
it's awesome you can do all kinds of
stuff way faster and not have to cut and
paste between apps and that's actually
really exciting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
