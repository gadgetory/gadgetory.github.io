got to be you got to be zoned in you
have to be focused for three hours three
four hours whatever the game may be
if you go to air and it's not it's not
right or there's a mistake millions of
viewers see it you don't get a chance to
edit it you get one shot everybody wants
to put on a clean product you know
something without a mistake a lot of
times if you were at home doesn't know
what the mistakes are they don't see
them they don't hear them very rarely
some you wonder if they even care they
just want to watch a game we know what
it takes to get on the air I laugh
because my father used to think it's a
big Vudu box watching TV because all
this stuff just comes out it just spills
out on the air and you can watch it home
until he saw what it takes to put one of
his own this is a actually a very well
oiled machine eight fibers interconnect
the two trucks and move over 3500
signals on those eight fibers I think we
probably have somewhere between 150 and
200 people credentialed for this weekend
that includes stage managers
statisticians runners camera guys
technical director audio utilities
cameramen may ultimately when it comes
down to it everything that we're trying
to do is all about telling the story and
giving the producers and directors the
tools that they need to tell that story
we want to give the viewer the best
experience graphically visually orally
audio ever
thing is all for the viewer
if we see things happening other places
we cover it show it discuss it its
instincts its reactions and it happens
really quickly I'm the director of the
show so basically in charger that the
visuals that you see for the most part
and basically I'm I'm in charge of all
the cameras during the course of the
game you know for a given game I'll have
15 cameras on a given Sunday you know
when we will have whatever it is 13
technicians the Fox TV trucks there are
three 53-foot trucks and they contain
the entire show and then we have another
53-foot truck that's just cable cam
we've done all 32 stadiums now in the 11
years we've been doing this so it's
gotten easier over the years you can
walk in and you know right where to go
and write what to do and we're pretty
quick at it the computer is controlled
through the joysticks just basic inputs
I have up and down and then left and
right and forward it back that signal
goes to the computer the computer takes
it to our winch station where our motors
are we have three motors XY and Z and if
you remember your basic algebra from
high school we have what's called a
Cartesian grid and it flies in an XY
pattern this way and a Z up and down
pattern that way and so I can control in
any stadium I know which way I'm going
left and right this basic joystick
camera there's a lot of remote control
operated cameras they're really all
basically the same you got your hand
your tilt your zoom focus the only thing
that makes this one different and it's a
big difference is that this camera has a
roll on it where I can control the
horizon we can finish each other's
sentences it's like hey do that thing
where you okay shorthand language I mean
you know when we get down toward the end
zone if they're gonna run into the end
zone he'll tell me to come up give me
some Z you know I'll come up a little
bit to show him the play develop
I'm foxes a lead technical director for
NASCAR in the NFL during the show I
punch the buttons mix the video switch
the video and the director makes the
decisions but I physically make that
happen it's more of a monologue from
rich to us but rich is doing a lot of
talking and we're all listening as he's
talking about ready one take one ready
to take two you know that's letting the
camera guy know that he's ready to take
that camera settle down and you're about
to go on the air so that the camera guy
doesn't swish pan or something like that
but also lets me know be ready to take
that camera and a lot of times you know
that wants to happen right at a precise
moment that he's trying to go from one
thing to another and so sometimes the
guts can be very very precise Larry 771
I'm in charge of the live cameras so
when Richie calls the replays that were
shooting the things that we need to be
shooting whether it's a quarterback
reaction whether it's a wide receiver
isolation you know with defensive player
whether it's a coach you know whether
it's a sideline reaction one of the
things we try to really push is all the
subtleties and I think we do a good job
but we're constantly pushing just the
reaction shots both sides of the ball
some of our greatest shots honestly are
sitting on the bench where you've got a
guy that's just cost his team the Super
Bowl and he's got this emotion on his
face and now you're you're sitting there
locked on him and we have we haven't
moved but there's no other camera in
here they can get that because of it
a specific angle or there's coach in
front of him or whatever so some of the
greatest stuff we've done is right there
I'm actually now I'm actually an office
guy I'm director of engineering and
technology for Fox Sports remote
operations so I oversee technical
planning for large bands Super Bowl
World Cup US Open golf but also
specifically oversee technology
initiatives such as 4k the thing that
always comes up is clarity of replay we
want to be able to see what's happening
we see what's going on and give the
viewer at home the best possible image
4k is essentially 10 times the amount of
pixels of video information as regular
720p is so we can zoom into an area and
get a lot more detail which is why we're
using 4k another big initiative of Fox
Sports high frame rate cameras four more
frames per second more images per second
which enable clearer replay we can do
things like like zoom in look at a guy's
foot and with a bunch of frames per
second you can see okay you know what he
was he was right there whereas before
that image might have been blurred
looking across a couple frames
technology is so good the pictures are
so good the ability to playback replays
is so fast we have 11 EVs machines most
handle 4 inputs to outputs as soon as
the plays over barely before the guy
stands up to go back to the huddle
he'll know which replay machine to go to
we sell directly to the producer
producer masse who has it or a lot of
times he knows who should have it wants
to see it from those angles so selling
is just getting to the producer letting
them know I got the best look at this
this is the one you should go to air
with we're fortunate our producer trusts
us for the most part if he hears our
voice in years he hears how intent we
are exits great on X Y has the look
whatever Killa he'll go to it right away
without even question I prefer the
subtle real things as opposed to the guy
grandstanding for the camera so the guys
that have been with me for years know
don't sell me a reaction we're guys
self-serving ly acting like an asshole
you know show me the shots when they
come to the bench they don't realize
cameras are on them and there's a little
wink a little smile a little tap on the
helmet from a coach those are the shots
I like to see so you know it's not just
the quarterbacks celebrating effort
touchdown is the defensive back with his
head down like holy Christ what just
happened
well my name is Fred Aldous and I am the
audio consultant for Fox Sports and
their senior mixer I mix NFL for them
and I make some design ballade the
NASCAR coverage for them during NFL I
want the viewer home to be a part of the
the audience in the stands and in a 5-1
show on the surrounds I want them to
feel like they're sitting in the crowd
so I put crowd 360 degrees around my
announcers in the center speaker and
then fill in the front left and rights
with my effects mix because that field
of play never changes so that's that's
kind of being an observer of a game on
this console I have 96 physical faders
and they are dual-layer faders so I have
192 inputs into this console that I can
manage at any point in time while I'm
sitting in here during a game I listen
to a director a producer an associate
director and I do my mix and there's
something else going on I have to deal
in troubleshoot that so I'm listening to
anywhere from five to eight things at
one time trying to juggle any balls it's
hard to really listen to my mix to where
I'd like to but I've learned over the
years what to listen for and how to
listen for a lot I do do a lot of that
by feel I heard here the director call a
camera cut and I just automatically go
to it so at this point my career has
pretty much become reactive as far as
some of the camera cuts and what I'm
listening to and how I react to those
sometimes I open different mics to make
more sense with the picture versus the
cameras that are close up
if you're on the sidelines of the game
you hear things that people at home
watching on TV never get to hear or
experience so we are walking a fine line
between that audio and yet not giving
away state secrets because believer
coaches watch TV tapes now to pick
anything they can up off what they hear
from the line of scrimmage what our
industry has done over the years is
provided up-close video and personal
video they want to hear the audio the
same and sometimes we can provide that
sometimes we can't I think from from
learning from people who did this job
well as you let people do their jobs I
think on Sundays it all comes together
with a balance of everything you know
sounds but let's not overdo it you know
tight pictures but let's not overdo it
X's nose but it's not overdo it my job
is to find the balance to bring
everything together
and make sure it all fits
it's really neat because it's like
working on a great team you're seeing
all those everybody come together and
they all know their job they know what
they're doing they're the best of what
they do you know broadcasting is similar
to being on a you know a team Troy
Aikman would say the same thing you know
he might be the star of the team but it
takes a whole team to actually put the
broadcast together so we just spend the
weekend all together we have dinner
together we spend a lot of time together
and that's the best thing spending time
together as a broadcast team I mean
we've known each other for years even
before we got on this crew a lot of how
to put things together those if there's
a hierarchy there I was going to move up
I'm not yet a half-hour guy cut that
 out
yeah that'd be the boss there are times
I spend more time with these guys and I
do with my family because not only this
I go right into NASCAR and that's
20-some weeks and you're spending four
days a week with them and only two at
home I think I think most of us in this
business enjoy doing what we do because
we like it we have fun doing it and we'd
hate to have a real job sitting behind a
desk all day so when you hear that
three-count going into the open of the
show I'll tell you what the rush is
absolutely incredible knowing there is
no going back there are no retakes you
have to do it right right the first time
and and it's a pretty big rush and I
still get that rush live TV is the only
kind of TV you want to be in now there
are people a lot more creative than I am
who can sit in an edit room and create a
show from scratch and those people are
really smart and really talented but
there's nothing like the adrenaline of
being part of a live broadcast you just
don't know how it's going to go you can
talk to
broadcasters former athletes you know
there's nothing like playing but the
closest thing you can get the planer
coaching is being in TV and covered an
NFL game
bring the pictures crazy science our
producer non-directory tourism tentacle
maker mutual audience our prettiest
