Microsoft in New York City and behind us
is the world's largest windows phone is
this running mango or actually a lot of
people are like hey we just want to know
what the maximum size was right okay
well it's about 60 feet tall little over
20 feet wide okay something like a 40
thousand pixel x 600 pixels it's got a
lot of density for a screaming I guess
what I'm saying I'm pretty low if I get
it up close to that like if I'm reading
a book you know the good news is you can
read your book about six blocks away
that's true a lot of the windows phone
is really focused on people's and so one
of the things we thought would be a fun
fun is actually pretty live active
people so we actually have right now
fetch a Rudolph up give us a wig so if I
thought if I touch him from here like
let's see you're making them animation
this is the control room back here
actually you can see a lot of people
actually doing some of the screens that
drive the live miles about a hundred and
ten people that have been here for
battle for day just like I know inside
of a real windows phones but what I want
to know is where where is the sim slot
this is actually where we're going to
control all the individual tiles and
actually start to kind of coordinate
some of the live action scenes that
you'll see throughout the actual day
there's two different stages in the
actual phone that will actually open up
and really have live people doing a
variety of pretty interesting stuff I'm
sure it's gonna be one very animated to
be very excited when we head upstairs
actually this is actually the top stage
this is an eight-by-eight panel
essentially and it's got all of these
sleeves and you can see that you can
actually see some of the lights oh yeah
I see them platforms right and so
essentially these are actually driving
the live tile that people will see and
then we actually move them out of the
way like a large garage door
where you can actually see the live
action how much did you drop on the
power how much we prob it's about the
price of a windows phone it's luckily
subsidized by your mobile operators no
but it was actually been it's a pretty
significant investment i think more area
shows kind of the idea that we want to
create some stunts and some get people
excited about the phone along chicas
worgen yeah you know we see I was here
last night around ten o'clock and number
of people that were stopping trying to
figure out what it was rather than what
was going on yeah I think people are
starting to take notice and it's a good
opportunity to just really say like hey
Microsoft makes really big we make you
it's fun so thank you so much for the
tour I'm gonna slowly back away from and
get the live tiles yeah from the edge
basically and you know maybe I'm gonna
spend some time with some smaller phones
wave all build up to five inches and you
know eventually I think this is too big
for me for I can imagine a lot of people
feel that okay but thank you so much
happy
I'm Paul Miller and I have a live tile
and I belong here i was born in this
city I was born to make phone calls and
express myself not really I was actually
born in Springfield Missouri near where
Jason Bourne is from</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
