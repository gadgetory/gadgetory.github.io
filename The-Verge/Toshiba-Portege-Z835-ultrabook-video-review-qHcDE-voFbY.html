this is the toshiba portege z8 35 which
is one of the new ultrabooks to hit the
market it's actually the fourth
ultrabook I've reviewed in the last
couple months but there are some things
that make it very different from the
others the first is the lightweight it
only weighs two point four seven pounds
which is lighter than the macbook air
and the new lenovo ideapad u310 so she
was been able to fit on a number of
full-size ports including an SD card
slot a VGA port an HDMI slot and also a
full-size Ethernet port however one of
my biggest complaints about the system
is actually its design it feels a little
bit flimsy but it also looks a little
bit outdated with the gray coloring
under the lid toshiba's actually done a
pretty nice job with the keyboard it's
backlit unlike any of the other
ultrabooks out there though the keys are
a little bit narrow the touchpad may not
be as fancy as some of the competition
but the traditional layout actually
makes it pretty easy to navigate which I
can't say the same for the ax seuss
under the hood toshiba's gone with a
slower processor than the competition to
get to that 899 price point but the core
i3 processor 4 gigabytes of RAM and 128
gigabyte hard drive provide pretty
decent performance the system boots in
37 seconds and resumes from sleep in a
fast 6 seconds battery life is actually
pretty impressive for the system I got
five hours and 51 minutes on the verge
battery test and in typical use I got
about six and a half hours at 899 the
toe she was actually a pretty great
value and one of the best ultrabooks on
the market but for three hundred dollars
more you can always get the macbook air
which has a higher resolution display
more battery life and a much nicer
design
