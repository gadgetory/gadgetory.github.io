this time it's the echo look this one
not only works with Alexa Amazon voice
assistant but it has a camera that's
going to take a picture of you and then
later on judge your outfit this is a
real thing
Amazon first announced this echo look
back in April but there's a catch you
actually can't buy it just yet it's
available by invitation only from Amazon
on amazon.com so for the purpose of this
review we ordered it on eBay for a
little bit more than its retail price
which is $200
so for $200 what you actually get this
is an Alexa enabled device so it works
with Amazon's virtual assistant Alexa
you can shout to it from across the room
and using this for microphone array at
the top of it it will hear you and it
will respond with certain things
depending what you ask it but the main
event is really the camera because this
is what makes it the echo look there are
four LED lights right here in the front
so it's light up when you ask it to take
a photo or a video of you this right
here is an RGB camera now it appears
that that is the only camera but we
actually saw a tear down of this and
behind this panel here there's at least
one other camera including a depth
camera and that comes into play with how
the photos eventually come out but I'll
get into that in a bit there's an on/off
button on the side here it's of course
Wi-Fi connected it has Bluetooth but
that's really only for the pairing and
setup process and it has this base here
that you can unscrew and through and it
tilts forward as you need it to as well
also there's a wall now in case you
wanted to mount it on your wall
so that's your hardware how does this
actually work well you're supposed to
put it somewhere in your room or your
house where at that shoulder level you
point it a little bit downward towards
you you stand in front of it and you say
oh XS take a photo or Alexa take a video
and it takes a quick photo of you or six
second video the point is that it's
supposed to capture the outfit you're
wearing at that
and then it stores it in a separate app
as your daily look overtime of course
you just kind of build up this catalogue
of look and you ask you'll notice
there's this blur around the edges of
the still image which makes you and your
outfit really pop into frame and then
just blurs out the background behind you
this is where the depth camera comes
into play and the images come out like
this by default I kind of liked it to be
honest but some of my photographer
colleagues of the verge saw it and said
you and some of you might not like it so
you can always disable that by tapping
the pop button here in the app but the
real benefit of it is supposed to be
well Amazon wants you to shop more right
I mean the end of the day and that's
what Amazon is all about you can explore
similar items that will point you
towards other items on amazon.com and
you could possibly buy based on what
you're already wearing the more
interesting feature is something called
style check and this is where Amazon
gets judgey basically it's judging your
outfit you can compare two different
outfits side by side after about a
minute you get a response back from the
app that will tell you which outfit
looks better this is done through a
combination of machine learning and
Amazon's own in-house fashion expert
Amazon says that it's basing the style
check decisions off of color fits trends
and style that's great right but a lot
of times this stuff is subjective you
might really like an outfit and whatever
reason style check doesn't I did sort of
notice a couple of patterns for example
if I was wearing a blouse in one photo
and then I put a jacket on over the
blouse in another photo it would often
reject this jacket now that may be based
on whether because the app is also
pulling in contextual information like
whether but it may also just be that
bulky less form-fitting stuff was seen
as less favorable for example if I wore
a big sweatshirt as part of a workout
outfit and then I put on sort of a tight
fitting jacket it would generally go for
the tight fitting jacket over the big
bulky sweatshirt I did want to see if
there was any type of bias at all
towards more
sealing outfits so I dug up an old tube
top that I haven't legitimately worn and
probably a dozen years and tried that on
and compares it to a photo of me and
just wearing a white t-shirt and
surprisingly Cyril check went for the
white t-shirt so I guess it's time to
officially retire the tube top I also
tried on other random stuff like pyjamas
slogan t-shirts I tried on a wetsuit to
see if Amazon would make a
recommendation for other wetsuits I had
all kinds of mixed results it was
honestly really interesting and really
fun but at the end of the day the
important thing to remember is that
Amazon wants you to shop more it wants
you to buy stuff on amazon.com Amazon
already knows what kind of toilet paper
you buy what paper towels you get with
dishwasher soap you order it has this
profile of you already Amazon is trying
to build up its fashion business and
this is another attempt to build a
better profile of you as a shopper to
know exactly what kind of clothes you're
already wearing and what kind of
pleasure more inclined to buy now some
of you may be looking at this and say
hell no I do not want an Amazon powered
camera in my home and that's an
understandable sentiment any
internet-connected device in your home
has a potential to be vulnerable be
hacked or just be sending data back to
someone's cloud you really want them to
have that kind of information now amazon
says that if you've turned the look off
that the microphone and the camera are
electronically disabled so it's not
capturing any information to send back
to amazon's cloud also it says that if
it is on and you are sending in
information that images voice data
anything else is being sent to the cloud
is encrypted so if you don't have
privacy concerns and you don't mind
Amazon having that much more data about
what you're interested in buying and at
the end of the day you like the idea of
an AI telling you what you should wear
then you'll probably really like the
Amazon echo look because it is kind of a
nifty gadget but I also think that what
you wear is such a subjective and
personal thing and a lot of people
already kind of know or have a sense of
what looks good on them that makes them
feel good what makes them happy to wear
you don't necessarily need nai to tell
you what to wear you just sort of just
sort of know so in a lot of ways this
first version is benefiting Amazon
probably more than it's benefiting you
