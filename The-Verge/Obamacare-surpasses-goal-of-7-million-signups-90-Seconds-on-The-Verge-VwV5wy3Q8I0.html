line I'm adi robertson and this is 90
seconds on the verge the deadline for
Obamacare is passed and thanks to a
last-minute surgeon signups the White
House met its target of enrolling more
than 7 million people to help reach its
goal the Obama administration launched
an eleventh-hour marketing push that
included of all things an appearance on
the zach galifianakis show between two
ferns okay let's get this out of the way
would you come here to plug nearly five
million visits were made to healthcare
gov on Monday causing the site to have a
brief last minute break down you know
for old times sake the launch of
healthcare.gov last October was marred
by technical failure only six people
reportedly managed to enroll on the
first day and less than 27,000 total in
the first month the White House promised
to fix the website by the end of
november and while it did become more
robust errors have persisted but don't
worry if you ran into any issues and
weren't able to finish enrollment
there's still quite a bit of wiggle room
anyone who at least started an
application which can be as little as
filling out your name can still complete
it and receive coverage in 2014 actually
even if you haven't started an
application but experienced website
errors we're given misinformation by an
affordable care act worker or fit into
one of eight other categories you'll
still be okay there isn't even a penalty
for lying you must however apply by
April fifteenth in order to get coverage
starting in May for more on the
Affordable Care Act to check out the
verge coming up I submit my claim for
being late to enroll I have to lie down
because I have a headache for not being
able to enroll in healthcare gov yep
that's it psych wasn't working</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
