inevitably think of the Toyota Prius
it's the mack daddy of hybrids and this
is the new 2016 addition it has a
redesigned interior exterior chassis and
powertrain just about everything on the
car has been improved it's been a while
since I've driven a Prius and to be
honest I've never been a huge fan sure
the fuel economy was great but it felt
like everything else was set aside at
the expense of that great fuel economy
that's not the case with this new model
because of all the tweaks and redesigns
as a ten percent better fuel economy and
it's a genuinely nice place to be the
interior has an open spacious look the
seats are comfortable the windows are
huge you have this great big dash in the
middle and the infotainment system
though it isn't my favorite it gets the
job done but as always with the Prius
the real test is how it doesn't stop
until traffic we've drove our is all
around the OC through little towns
filled with red lights the Prius
delivered in the mid 50 miles per gallon
you buy this car because it's super
economical you won't have to spend too
much time or money at the pump and you
won't have to feel bad about wrecking
environmental but with this version of
the freest you don't need to choose
between comfort and driving performance
and staying green the Prius is a
stepping stone between what came before
the pure gasoline-powered car and what's
coming in the future whether that's all
electric or hydrogen fuel cell or
something entirely new if you want to go
on a long road trip you really can't do
that smoothly with an electric car Tesla
supercharger network notwithstanding
with the Prius you can stop the gas pump
refill and go on your way
road trips aside the average American
has a 26-minute commute one way most of
it is spent on a highway and stopped
into a traffic in a traditional car it's
impossible to drive your commute
economically but thanks to the hybrid
engine this car gets it done so whether
you're buying for financial or
environmental reason these it delivers
the exterior has always been a bit
polarizing I've been kind of indifferent
to it but I think this one looks pretty
good especially in this new hypersonic
read and whether you like the design or
not we know you're not really buying the
phrase for its looks you're buying it to
get to work the grocery store or take
your kids to soccer practice all without
spending too much time at the pump
there's a reason that Prius is one of
the most popular cars in California land
of the traffic jam and this one will be
no different</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
