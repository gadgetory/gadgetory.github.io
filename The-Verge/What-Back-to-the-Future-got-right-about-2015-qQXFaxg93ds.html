seen Back to the Future that date might
look familiar except it doesn't look
exactly like the 2015 we live in sure
some of the predictions were pretty
close others well let's take a look okay
first time travel travel sorry doc nor
have we figured out how to harness
nuclear fusion to power our cars or home
appliances I heard Tesla's working on it
we technically have flying cars only
don't expect to drive one unless you
have the money to buy one
hologram displays like this one with
jaws 19 are out but brands are
definitely in we are getting close to
hyper accurate weather forecasting and
we have drones that can take really
stellar photography it'll just be a long
while before they can replace reporters
or walk our dogs we also haven't figured
out anti-gravity and if we did we
probably wouldn't use it for curing back
injuries homes are getting smarter
people have flat-screen TVs and some
even have video calling and tech like
apple's homekit even lets you control
the lights in your home with just your
voice but the average house doesn't have
a black &amp;amp; decker hydration machine or
voice controlled fruit and veggie
dispenser never mind the fax machines
fax is dead
so here's a cool thing a bunch of the
tech back to the future shows off by
knocked other cards covered billboards
being able to buy things with just your
thumb just don't exist on their own but
you get similar functionality thanks to
smartphones a technology the movie
simply never anticipated another is the
internet Cooney's video waiters or fax
need cases when you have seamless and
snapchat then there's fashion we don't
have self drying clothes with those
sweet self-lacing sneakers but we do
have waterproof clothes and those Nike
Air Mags may be closer than we think
last thing hoverboards are cool but ours
are cooler technically okay fine they
kind of suck you need a metal skate park
or supercooled magnets to use them maybe
in another 30 years</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
