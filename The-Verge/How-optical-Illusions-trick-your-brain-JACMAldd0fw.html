rings of concentric circles and these
lines look like they're leaning away
from each other but they're actually
parallel these lines look curved but
really they're straight and the line
that looks like it breaks as it goes
underneath this rectangle that's one
continuous line all of these are optical
illusions images that somehow trick our
minds into perceiving something
different from what exists in reality
these particular ones are something
called geometrical illusions a gmsk
illusion arises when you put a
geometrical figure which could be a
straight line or square or circle onto a
background of other often parallel lines
and we call the background lines induces
and the front figure we call the test
and typically you'll find that the
inducers make the test tilt away from
the induces people have been squinting
and staring at optical illusions for
centuries but scientists still don't
really understand why specific
combinations of shapes and lines mess
with their minds
what they do know is that these
distortions probably come from how our
brains interpret the images rather than
how our I see them each I see is a
slightly different view of the world
that the brain then has to combine into
a 3d perception in the middle of the
20th century neuroscientists la us
invented a kind of optical illusion
called the random-dot stereogram those
are similar to the magic eye illusions
you might remember from the 1990s these
illusions are made up of two images of
random dots if you focus your eyes just
right or use a stereoscope they come
together to form a picture when you less
convert a geometrical illusion slide the
Poland or pollution into random-dot
stereograms people could still see the
distortions that means that the
illusions occur in our brain once the
images have been combined and not in our
eyes one explanation has to do with a
phenomenon called lateral inhibition in
the visual cortex there are neurons that
specifically respond to lines oriented
in different direction the individual
nerve cells that respond to the vertical
and a different set of nerve cells
respond to the tilted ones and these
tend to inhibit or turn on each other
off which means that the perceived
direction of the two lines will diverge
so acute angle move bid to get bigger
that can also explain the herring
illusion where the long red lines seem
to bend but are actually parallel the
thing is lateral inhibition can't
explain every geometrical illusion like
in The pieman dark illusion where a line
passes behind a big vertical rectangle
and it looks like the ends don't connect
but really they do if this illusion
occurs because lateral inhibition makes
the acute angles look larger then
stripping the illusion down to just the
obtuse angles should make it disappear
but you can still see it and when you
strip it down to just these cute angles
the illusion is gone so another theory
is that our brains are trying to process
these 2d images like 3d objects adding
the illusion of depth and perspective
where there is none that especially
seems to be the case with the Ponzo
illusion where even though the top line
looks longer it's actually the same
length as the bottom one that could be
because of a process called size
constancy so to get a better sense for
how this works take your hand and put it
out at arm's length and then bring it to
your nose even though your hand is
taking up more and more of your visual
field as it gets closer to your face
your brand doesn't think that your hand
is getting bigger it thinks that your
hand is getting closer the same thing
could be going on in the image even
though the two lines take up the same
amount of space in our visual fields
because the top line looks farther away
our brains interpreted as larger another
explanation could be that our minds into
written objects eyes based on what's
around it so because the top line
intersects with the lines next to it it
looks longer than the bottom line which
is surrounded by white space what we do
know for sure is that as the 3d world
projects 2d information onto our retinas
which our brains then have to turn back
into a 3d perception sometimes our minds
cut corners so you might have noticed
that the Verge's logo is an optical
illusion too and it's what's called an
impossible triangle was first drawn in
the 1930s by a Swedish artist as a
series of cubes but then in the 1950s a
British physicist was so inspired by the
king of optical illusions MC Escher that
he drew this version that we're familiar
with today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
