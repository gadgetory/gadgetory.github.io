the verge today I'm going to use the
internet to learn how to play guitar I'm
going to be using a service called
instinct it's a piece of software that
works in the browser you don't have to
download or install anything just
register for the site and what makes it
really interesting is that there's no
notation listens to what you're playing
through a microphone tells you if you're
doing it right tries to teach you how to
play guitar so the first thing you're
going to want to do is make sure your
guitar is in tune an instinct has a
program that teaches you how to do that
you play the note an instinct shows you
if you're too high 42 low alright so
I've tuned my guitar it was pretty
painless I felt like it helped me to
hear kind of the notes a little bit and
to get a sense of which one of these
thing my bobbers over here goes with
each one of the strings so the next
thing I'm going to do is try out a
series of courses called year of rock
the guys that instinct were inspired by
code Academy which did a year of coding
and each week they would send you a
weekly lesson you get little points and
badges they've kind of game ified it the
riff i'm going to try and learn to play
today is a seven nation army by the
white stripes
that's not working at all there we go
okay I hit the first note okay now wants
me to take my what is that my pinky this
is hard
nope that's going to make sure I start
in the right spot one thing I didn't
realize which I see now is that they
show you these little spots on the
guitar and if you line your fingers up
with that it's a little easier to tell
what fret you're supposed to be playing
but it's not explaining to you you know
why you might start in some place or
where a good place to put your fingers
would be oops it's not it's not easy man
this guitar stand easy i'm telling you i
enjoyed the lesson I felt like at the
end I could kind of hear the riff I was
supposed to play and you know I
definitely would have I would keep
practicing because it's simple you could
just sit down at home with a guitar open
up your browser and do it did it teach
me to play the riff and in five minutes
no do I feel like I learned a little bit
about how to play the guitar ya think so
yeah i started here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
