am playing in videos of big format
gaming display we have destiny to
running right here and it is pretty
great so what is the big format gaming
display or BFG d as in video calls it
well it's a new hardware platform and
aims to bring the TV style big screen
experience to TC gaming a few hardware
makers are baking them there's gonna be
one from HP asa asus and they're all
using the same panel they're all
basically the same thing they're all 65
inch 4k displays that support HDR and
they all have Android TV built in via
Nvidia shield platform but the BFGS are
not TVs they are PC monitors and that
allows you to do some things that you
can't really do with the TV even if you
hook up your PC to it today so the first
thing is it runs at 120 Hertz which is
you know a faster frame rate than what
you would get out of most TVs or
monitors but more importantly it works
with g-sync
which is invidious technology that
allows more smooth and natural and
lifelike frame rates it's a little
difficult to explain if you haven't seen
it in person but basically what it does
is it syncs the frame rate of the
display with the output of your GPU so
even in complicated scenes and high
pitched fast-paced action you're you're
getting smooth gameplay note on frames
no stuttering it's just a really natural
lifelike experience that you can't get
from playing a game on a TV today but
even though the BFG DS arnott tvs
they'll still work pretty great for
watching Netflix and so on they have a
built-in Nvidia shield which is one of
the best TV streaming boxes out there
it has Android TV all the apps that go
with that you can burn Nvidia's GeForce
now gaming platform you can run Android
TV games that you know and it'll think
the framerate in the same way that it
with PC games and yeah everything runs
in 4k HDR as you would expect we saw an
episode of the Grand Tour in on Amazon's
platform and there are different frame
rates in each episode and it syncs up
plays everything negatively everything
that's great so although you're not
going to be watching you know broadcast
TV on this thing unless you buy an
external area it's still gonna be a
pretty good option for watching movies
and so on if you decide to put it in
your living room so yeah keep it like
from the first this week we have a big
team on the ground here at CES in Las
Vegas we're gonna have a bunch more
gaming news coming up on tech news in
general so subscribe to our YouTube
channel check us out on the verge comm
and any social media network known to
mankind yeah it's gonna be fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
