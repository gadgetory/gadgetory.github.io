I'm taking a look at the new Samsung
Galaxy Note 5 it's the latest in
Samsung's note series of smartphones
they should look familiar because it
looks a lot like a note 4 and galaxy s6
combined together it's a familiar 5.7
inch qHD display but everything is
smaller on the note 5 it's narrower it's
shorter it's thinner than the note 4 was
which makes it quite a bit easier to
hold and use in one hand but it's still
a big phone it's definitely a phablet
style device here you can see it's the
gold color that's coming to the US I
also be available in black the back of
it has this kind of curved finish makes
it a little easier to hold in one hand
but the details are very similar to the
galaxy s6 you've got your HOME key here
your back key and multitasking this of
course is a fingerprint sensor which
will work with Simpson K when that's
available up front you got a 5 megapixel
camera for the front-facing camera there
and around back you got this 16
megapixel image stabilized camera it's
very similar to the s6 as well as well
as the flash there and the heart rate
sensor on the back inside there's a the
same Samsung Exynos processor as the
galaxy s6 this time it's paired with
four gigabytes of RAM this is a
considered a higher-end device and you
can get it with 32 or 64 gigabytes of
storage notably there is no micro SD
card slot on this which isn't a huge
surprise but it is something that's
changed from last year's phone and the
battery inside is 3000 milliamp hours
which is a little bit smaller than no 4s
battery but this time around it's got
built-in wireless charging for both qi &amp;amp;
PMA as well as Samsung's quick charging
mode that's a they say will charge the
battery as quickly as the galaxy s6 even
though it's got a larger battery inside
of it for software it's running android
5.1 lollipop it's got Samsung's pretty
familiar by now software interface on
top of that it's very similar to the
galaxy s6 of course what makes us a note
though is the s-pen which you can see
right here S Pen has been slightly
redesigned it's a higher quality to pen
now it's metal a little bit nicer to
feel it's got a little spring-loaded
action on it one of the new software
features is the ability to draw on the
screen when it's off so you can take
notes immediately from when you take
pen out of its holster otherwise you can
activate the air command types of
features these have been slightly
redesigned little more options now you
can set favorite apps that you want to
use often with it and you can access
these pretty much anywhere you're using
the phone in any app that you're in via
these widgets one of the new features of
the S Pen is called scroll capture it
lets you capture things that are longer
than just a single screenshot so if it's
a webpage or a map or something like
that you can progressively capture more
and more of the display that you can
save offline you can notate it etc so if
you are trying to save your data usage
or just capture a long page you can see
a preview of it here and then you can go
back and review it down see no files
gonna be available in the US on August
21st it's gonna be available on all four
carriers you'll be able to get it in
black or gold like I've got here and you
can expect to be priced around the same
as the note 4 and prior note models</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
