we are looking at the new microsoft
surface pro 2 tablet that was just
announced today from the outside the pro
2 looks virtually the same as the pro
from last year it's the same size
roughly the same weight about the same
thickness it's still the magnesium
material that was maybe four but under
the hood microsoft has made a ton of
improvements they've increased the are
upgraded the processor to a new Haswell
processor which offers better for
performance but most importantly up to
75 percent better battery life according
to their claims so this really is a much
more powerful longer-lasting device than
before the screen it says to have
forty-five percent better color accuracy
than last year's model but it is still a
1920 x 1080 p panel the other major
thing that's different here is with the
kickstand in the back like before it's
got a first-stage kickstand that allows
you to prop it up on a table but the new
surface pro 2 allows you to adjust that
kickstand to its second stage so it's
more comfortable when you're using on
your lap or microsoft says that people
who are taller are still going are going
to be able to use it easier but overall
it feels very similar in your hands it's
very well-built very solid very
professional feeling of a device
microsoft will be selling this starting
on october twenty second with prices
starting around 899 but you can place
pre-orders for it starting tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
