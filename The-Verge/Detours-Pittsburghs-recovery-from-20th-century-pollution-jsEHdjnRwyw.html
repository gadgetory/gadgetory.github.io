a different kind of culture so I'm going
down River Road down here and I see what
the kids would like look a cloud maker
and a cloud maker is just this this car
joven I guess you want to call it
we knew that we really shouldn't be
eating the cat suit out of the river
because the rivers were you know
comparatively speaking pretty polluted
people that have been here since the 50s
and 60s that used to see the sky dark at
noontime think that you know it can't
get any better than this
coke works are one of the dirtiest
processes and we happen to have the
largest coke works in the country
when you think about the Mon Valley you
think about Pittsburgh you think about
steel to principal ingredients of making
steel iron ore and coal you need coke
and the way you make coke is by taking
coal processing it baking okay
that's coke so the coal releases all the
chemicals that are in cold so you'll get
ammonia zits solvers and a whole bunch
of the products there are dozens and
dozens of chemical byproducts that are
stripped out of the coke oven gas and
then sold separately so this isn't just
a coke making facility it's actually a
chemical plant as well I find it
necessary hi handkerchief they're the
children's mop in some futile attempt to
block out some of these pollutants even
though I know the sulfur dioxide can't
be filtered and when I send them out
into this air I feel like just like a
murderess I close the door behind me and
I think it's Anchorage's today what will
it be tomorrow well growing up I
understand that that was back in the 60s
and 70s that predated the creation of
the modern environmental and the modern
conservation movement there was no
Department of Environmental Protection
there was no Earth Day okay there was no
Silent Spring written with that advent
of the modern environmental movement you
saw a recognition that what we spew into
our air and dump into our waterways does
eventually affect our health I think
last year we had 12
football players with asthma and I think
we only had 30 players on the team so
almost half at some form of asthma
swimming pools a pointless I stopped
using my swimming pool two months ago I
was vacuuming it every other day with
black soot all over the bottomless
Winkle it's horrible in the 60s and 70s
there was nothing green here nothing
nothing
okay now you can go deer hunting up here
I was talking to some of the students
and the parents a couple days ago and we
were talking about Pollution Control and
the parents are really afraid of it
because they say as long as there's
smoke coming other smokestacks then
there's food on the table and money and
clothes for the kids and the fathers who
are working well I had a father and he
died five years ago and he worked in a
steel mill all his life and he died of a
heart attack and I'm just wondering if
that's not Lyme because of the pollution
we had this tremendous you know economic
dislocation that was not caused at all
by the advent of the Environmental
Protection Agency and the laws and
regulations this happened because in the
1960s and early 70s there was a
conscious decision by steel makers in
this country that they were going to
invest in the new technology of
steelmaking either down south or
offshore after 15 months of hearings the
variance in Appeals Board made this
landmark decision it denounced the US
Steel Corporation for its waging a kind
of blackmail using the threat of
unemployment to intimidate workers and
public officials it ruled that US Steel
be taken to court and made to clean up
its pollution the people of Lincoln
borough Pittsburgh and towns up and down
the Monongahela River now know they
don't have to hold their breath
well we're currently standing on the
rooftop of the air quality programs
offices in our in Lawrenceville
Pennsylvania the rooftop here serves as
our main urban monitoring site and you
can see the instruments that we have
deployed we currently have 25 monitoring
sites scattered across Allegheny County
monitoring 60 different pollutants at
all of those sites besides the fact that
the process is dirty the plant sits in a
river valley which is prone to what are
called temperature inversions and these
temperature inversions tend to trap the
pollution is there so if this plant were
anywhere else except sitting in that
valley
it wouldn't be anywhere near the problem
that it is
in a few minutes we'll formally
commissioned our plants newest coke
battery the C battery and the first of
three new low emission quench towers the
battery and the wench tire as well as
the environmentally focused
rehabilitation work we've done on
batteries one through three represent an
investments of more than 500 million
dollars by our company this is the
single largest facility investment
project and this plants nearly one
hundred twelve year history and one of
the largest investment programs in our
company's 112 year history you know we
want to keep good family paying jobs and
we want to clean up our environment too
okay because that's good for us
it's good for us in the short term it's
good for us in the long term it's not an
either/or choice you got to deal with
both there always be a a constant
trade-off in terms of how much pollution
reduction is necessary versus the
controls on how much facilities can
afford to put on those controls however
what we've seen as time is going on that
we can have both we can have acceptable
error we can have perfectly clean air
but we can't have acceptable
