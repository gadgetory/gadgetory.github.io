film on oh I was president CEO of sony
electronics mera and we are standing in
front of a very impressive television
Krytos be my absolute pleasure with just
today announced this sony xbr 84 inch 4k
TV it's our first 4k TV as you can see
first of all it's a large TV 84 inch
across on the diameter but the key here
is that this picture you're seeing is
four times the resolution of Full HD so
four times the resolution of filler HD
which gives us the ability to give this
a completely immersive picture so lets
you launched a number of other products
here yes you've got the new tablet and a
cup executive cameras i just wanna talk
about the camera the tablets are very
briefly yes it done so you had a line of
previous tablets one of which had a very
odd form factor the clamshell I've
noticed you you've iterated on one of
those the standard sort of they've got
the new tablet ass yeah I'm sort of
iterated from the previous design and
the other design it seems to kind of set
aside is your reason for that so we
always work and listen with the consumer
that's at the heart of our innovation
and our feedback so the clamshell type
although it's very innovative it seems
that the consumers weren't embracing it
to the level we expect it so we put our
focus on our energy into creating a
beautiful new second-generation tablet
yeah we call it the tablet xperia it's
thinner it's light so it's a beautiful
design we got a full range of
accessories yeah and it's differentiated
let me give you one example we have a
unique app on there that was developed
by Sony which allows you to see visually
what's on your TV satellite box so
rather than scrolling through a thousand
channels and trying to find something
this gives you a visual picture of
what's on and through our IR remote
control you can then choose what you
want to watch from the tablet and throw
it to the TV and it will change the
channel I our control staff yes are you
can integrate that more
deeply with the television than just ir
because it seems like you want when you
do the swype you're still descending a
channel change command over I are one
point we perhaps didn't explain fully we
have a macro capability and a macro
capability with the IR remote control
allows you to control multiple devices I
get that but it's still a ir which is
you have a tablet which it has an IR
blaster that's correct but you also make
tvs you make receivers are you going to
do a more direct control is beyond iron
so that's how i know it's so we don't
planned out at the moment because what
we found on the consumer feedback that
we've got they they really appreciate
the ir remote control yeah they can put
five or six remotes away yeah just use
our tablet to control their home
entertainment and with this smarter
where you can choose your content and
throw it it works beautifully yeah so
we'll get more coffee consumer feedback
and if we see the need and there's
demand there of course will in innovator
game well that app ever what you throw a
video from the tablet this video its way
on the tablet to sony TV yes it will
personal video you can throw from the
tablets of the TV not just sony to the
other T it's all its atomic the channel
changing out or is it two different it's
a separate function because if you're in
an ingest personal video it sits in the
video app itself but you could throw it
anyway and it understands those
questions I i think the tablet is
probably the future loving room control
I agree with it needs it just seems like
all the stuff is getting integrated
that's correct right now it's in silos
kind of on it and I think I think not so
much silo so as an example with a video
we have one icon on our tablet that if
you press that iconic will move whatever
your viewing whether it's YouTube or
content on the internet all your
personal content it will move it to the
TV throw it to the TV by the way did I
mention our tablet is splash proof did I
said for that so it's unique in your
hands up in frustration your dream falls
oh no no no no I don't think we have any
customers doing that but if you if
you're in the kitchen with it
cooking and you're looking at a menu
were looking at content you spill on it
you're not going to have a problem yeah
you could even read books in the bath I
don't recommend it place it drops in
yeah but you know it is splash proof and
we're saying five gallons per minute for
five minutes and it will survive so it's
pretty cool I'm have to try it out
please do</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
